https://openalex.org/W1966537851,"Learning, whether motor, sensory or cognitive, requires networks of neurons to generate new activity patterns. As some behaviours are easier to learn than others, we asked if some neural activity patterns are easier to generate than others. Here we investigate whether an existing network constrains the patterns that a subset of its neurons is capable of exhibiting, and if so, what principles define this constraint. We employed a closed-loop intracortical brain-computer interface learning paradigm in which Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) controlled a computer cursor by modulating neural activity patterns in the primary motor cortex. Using the brain-computer interface paradigm, we could specify and alter how neural activity mapped to cursor velocity. At the start of each session, we observed the characteristic activity patterns of the recorded neural population. The activity of a neural population can be represented in a high-dimensional space (termed the neural space), wherein each dimension corresponds to the activity of one neuron. These characteristic activity patterns comprise a low-dimensional subspace (termed the intrinsic manifold) within the neural space. The intrinsic manifold presumably reflects constraints imposed by the underlying neural circuitry. Here we show that the animals could readily learn to proficiently control the cursor using neural activity patterns that were within the intrinsic manifold. However, animals were less able to learn to proficiently control the cursor using activity patterns that were outside of the intrinsic manifold. These results suggest that the existing structure of a network can shape learning. On a timescale of hours, it seems to be difficult to learn to generate neural activity patterns that are not consistent with the existing network structure. These findings offer a network-level explanation for the observation that we are more readily able to learn new skills when they are related to the skills that we already possess."
https://openalex.org/W4235475088,"Information is central to quantum mechanics. In particular, quantum interference occurs only if there exists no information to distinguish between the superposed states. The mere possibility of obtaining information that could distinguish between overlapping states inhibits quantum interference. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a quantum imaging concept based on induced coherence without induced emission. Our experiment uses two separate down-conversion nonlinear crystals (numbered NL1 and NL2), each illuminated by the same pump laser, creating one pair of photons (denoted idler and signal). If the photon pair is created in NL1, one photon (the idler) passes through the object to be imaged and is overlapped with the idler amplitude created in NL2, its source thus being undefined. Interference of the signal amplitudes coming from the two crystals then reveals the image of the object. The photons that pass through the imaged object (idler photons from NL1) are never detected, while we obtain images exclusively with the signal photons (from NL1 and NL2), which do not interact with the object. Our experiment is fundamentally different from previous quantum imaging techniques, such as interaction-free imaging or ghost imaging, because now the photons used to illuminate the object do not have to be detected at all and no coincidence detection is necessary. This enables the probe wavelength to be chosen in a range for which suitable detectors are not available. To illustrate this, we show images of objects that are either opaque or invisible to the detected photons. Our experiment is a prototype in quantum information--knowledge can be extracted by, and about, a photon that is never detected."

A warming climate is expected to decrease snowfall dramatically, but will it necessarily reduce the frequency of extremely heavy snow events — those that tend to have the greatest impact on, for example, urban infrastructure and power supplies? Paul O'Gorman shows that by the late twenty-first century, even in a scenario of high emissions of greenhouse gasses, there should be little change in the frequency of heavy snowfall events. O'Gorman links the stability of heavy snow to the presence of a stable threshold between rain and snow, one that is unlikely to be changed by climate warming. The findings suggest that — unlike the case for extreme liquid precipitation — extreme snowfall is unlikely to be a good diagnostic of climate change. Snowfall is an important element of the climate system, and one that is expected to change in a warming climate1,2,3,4. Both mean snowfall and the intensity distribution of snowfall are important, with heavy snowfall events having particularly large economic and human impacts5,6,7. Simulations with climate models indicate that annual mean snowfall declines with warming in most regions but increases in regions with very low surface temperatures3,4. The response of heavy snowfall events to a changing climate, however, is unclear. Here I show that in simulations with climate models under a scenario of high emissions of greenhouse gases, by the late twenty-first century there are smaller fractional changes in the intensities of daily snowfall extremes than in mean snowfall over many Northern Hemisphere land regions. For example, for monthly climatological temperatures just below freezing and surface elevations below 1,000 metres, the 99.99th percentile of daily snowfall decreases by 8% in the multimodel median, compared to a 65% reduction in mean snowfall. Both mean and extreme snowfall must decrease for a sufficiently large warming, but the climatological temperature above which snowfall extremes decrease with warming in the simulations is as high as −9 °C, compared to −14 °C for mean snowfall. These results are supported by a physically based theory that is consistent with the observed rain–snow transition. According to the theory, snowfall extremes occur near an optimal temperature that is insensitive to climate warming, and this results in smaller fractional changes for higher percentiles of daily snowfall. The simulated changes in snowfall that I find would influence surface snow and its hazards; these changes also suggest that it may be difficult to detect a regional climate-change signal in snowfall extremes."
https://openalex.org/W2072829950,"A type Ia supernova is thought to be a thermonuclear explosion of either a single carbon-oxygen white dwarf or of a pair of merging white dwarfs. The explosion fuses a large amount of radioactive 56Ni. After the explosion, the decay chain from 56Ni to 56Co to 56Fe generates gamma-ray photons, which are reprocessed in the expanding ejecta and give rise to powerful optical emission. Here we report the detection of 56Co lines at energies of 847 and 1238 keV and a gamma-ray continuum in the 200-400 keV band from the type Ia supernova 2014J in the nearby galaxy M82. The line fluxes suggest that about 0.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of radioactive 56Ni were synthesized during the explosion. The line broadening gives a characteristic mass-weighted ejecta expansion velocity of 10000 +/- 3000 km/s. The observed gamma-ray properties are in broad agreement with the canonical model of an explosion of a white dwarf just massive enough to be unstable to gravitational collapse, but do not immediately exclude more complicated merger scenarios, which fuse comparable amount of 56Ni."
https://openalex.org/W1980773214,"Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney diseases. This study was designed to investigate whether H2S has protective effects against diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic rats were induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and administrated with H2S donor NaHS for 12 weeks. Rat glomerular mesangial cells were pretreated with NaHS or MAPK inhibitors (U0126, SP600125, and SB203580) prior to high glucose exposure, and cell proliferation was determined. Our findings suggest that H2S can improve renal function and attenuate glomerular basement membrane thickening, mesangial matrix deposition, and renal interstitial fibrosis in diabetic rats. H2S was found to reduce high glucose-induced oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and to exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. In addition, H2S reduced high glucose-induced mesangial cell proliferation by blockade of MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, H2S was also found to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system in diabetic kidney. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that H2S alleviates the development of diabetic nephropathy by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation, reducing mesangial cell proliferation, and inhibiting renin-angiotensin system activity."

https://openalex.org/W2088084647,"Discovering the structure and dynamics of transcriptional regulatory events in the genome with cellular and temporal resolution is crucial to understanding the regulatory underpinnings of development and disease. We determined the genomic distribution of binding sites for 92 transcription factors and regulatory proteins across multiple stages of Caenorhabditis elegans development by performing 241 ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) experiments. Integration of regulatory binding and cellular-resolution expression data produced a spatiotemporally resolved metazoan transcription factor binding map. Using this map, we explore developmental regulatory circuits that encode combinatorial logic at the levels of co-binding and co-expression of transcription factors, characterizing the genomic coverage and clustering of regulatory binding, the binding preferences of, and biological processes regulated by, transcription factors, the global transcription factor co-associations and genomic subdomains that suggest shared patterns of regulation, and identifying key transcription factors and transcription factor co-associations for fate specification of individual lineages and cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2007659337,"Maillard α-dicarbonyl compounds are known as central intermediates in advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation. Glucose is the primary source of energy for the human body, whereas l-threo-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is an essential nutrient, involved in a variety of enzymatic reactions. Thus, the Maillard degradation of glucose and ascorbic acid is of major importance in vivo. To understand the complex mechanistic pathways of AGE formation, it is crucial to extend the knowledge on plasma concentrations of reactive key α-dicarbonyl compounds (e.g. 1-deoxyglucosone). With the present work, we introduce a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS multimethod for human blood plasma based on derivatization with o-phenylenediamine under acidic conditions. The impact of workup and reaction conditions, particularly of pH, was thoroughly evaluated. A comprehensive validation provided the limit of detection, limit of quantitation, coefficients of variation, and recovery rates. The method includes the α-dicarbonyls 1-deoxyglucosone, 3-deoxyglucosone, glucosone, Lederer's glucosone, dehydroascorbic acid, 2,3-diketogulonic acid, 1-deoxypentosone, 3-deoxypentosone, 3,4-dideoxypentosone, pentosone, 1-deoxythreosone, 3-deoxythreosone, threosone, methylglyoxal, glyoxal; the α-keto-carboxylic acids pyruvic acid and glyoxylic acid; and the dicarboxylic acid oxalic acid. The method was then applied to the analyses of 15 healthy subjects and 24 uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis. The comparison of the results revealed a clear shift in the product spectrum. In most cases, the plasma levels of target analytes were significantly higher. Thus, this is the first time that a complete spectrum of α-dicarbonyl compounds relevant in vivo has been established. The results provide further insights into the chemistry of AGE formation and will be helpful to find specific markers to differentiate between the various precursors of glycation."

Hyperactivation of mTOR has been observed in various cancers. Regulation of mTOR activity is thus of importance in physiological processes and tumor development. Here, we present pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) as a novel regulator of mTORC1 signaling. mTORC1 activity was augmented with PDK4 overexpression and reduced by PDK4 suppression in various cell lines. Furthermore, PDK4 bound to cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and prevented its degradation. The enhanced CREB consequently transactivated the expression of Ras homolog enriched in brain (RHEB), a direct key activator of mTORC1, independent of AMP-activated protein kinase or tuberous sclerosis complex protein 2. PDK4 potentiated the mTORC1 effectors hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and pyruvate kinase isozymes M2 and promoted aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). Knockdown of PDK4 suppressed the tumor development of cancer cells with activated mTORC1. The abundance of PDK4 dictated the responsiveness of cells to the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Combinatory suppression of mTOR and PDK4 exerted synergistic inhibition on cancer cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2068804121,"Chicken macrophages express several receptors for recognition of pathogens, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) derived from bacterial or viral pathogens leading to the activation of macrophages. Macrophages play a critical role in immunity against viruses, including influenza viruses. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that treatment of chicken macrophages with TLR ligands reduces avian influenza replication. Furthermore, we sought to study the expression of some of the key mediators involved in the TLR-mediated antiviral responses of macrophages. Chicken macrophages were treated with the TLR2, 3, 4, 7 and 21 ligands, Pam3CSK4, poly(I:C), LPS, R848 and CpG ODN, respectively, at different doses and time points pre- and post-H4N6 avian influenza virus (AIV) infection. The results revealed that pre-treatment of macrophages with Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN reduced the replication of AIV in chicken macrophages. In addition, the relative expression of genes involved in inflammatory and antiviral responses were quantified at 3, 8 and 18 hours post-treatment with the TLR2, 4 and 21 ligands. Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN increased the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ, IFN-β and interferon regulatory factor (IFR) 7. The expression of these genes correlated with the reduction of viral replication in macrophages. These results shed light on the process of immunity to AIV in chickens."

The most abundant β-glucosidase in the mesophilic fungus Hypocrea jecorina is HjCel3A, which hydrolyzes the β-linkage between two adjacent molecules in dimers and short oligomers of glucose. It has been shown that enhanced levels of HjCel3A in H. jecorina cellulase mixtures benefit the conversion of cellulose to glucose. Biochemical characterization of HjCel3A shows that the enzyme efficiently hydrolyzes (1,4)- as well as (1,2)-, (1,3)-, and (1,6)-β-d-linked disaccharides. For crystallization studies, HjCel3A was produced in both H. jecorina (HjCel3A) and Pichia pastoris (Pp-HjCel3A).

https://openalex.org/W1996096546,"A gram-negative aliphatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium SJTD-1 isolated from oil-contaminated soil was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa by comparative analyses of the 16S rRNA sequence, phenotype, and physiological features. SJTD-1 could efficiently mineralize medium- and long-chain n-alkanes (C12-C30) as its sole carbon source within seven days, showing the most optimal growth on n-hexadecane, followed by n-octadecane, and n-eicosane. In 36 h, 500 mg/L of tetradecane, hexadecane, and octadecane were transformed completely; and 2 g/L n-hexadecane was degraded to undetectable levels within 72 h. Two putative alkane-degrading genes (gene 3623 and gene 4712) were characterized and our results indicated that their gene products were rate-limiting enzymes involved in the synergetic catabolism of C12–C16 alkanes. On the basis of bioinformatics and transcriptional analysis, two P450 monooxygenases, along with a putative AlmA-like oxygenase, were examined. Genetically defective mutants lacking the characteristic alkane hydroxylase failed to degrade n-octadecane, thereby suggesting a different catalytic mechanism for the microbial transformation of alkanes with chain lengths over C18."
https://openalex.org/W2019003319,"Multi-electrode arrays are a state-of-the-art tool in electrophysiology, also in retina research. The output cells of the retina, the retinal ganglion cells, form a monolayer in many species and are well accessible due to their proximity to the inner retinal surface. This structure has allowed the use of multi-electrode arrays for high-throughput, parallel recordings of retinal responses to presented visual stimuli, and has led to significant new insights into retinal organization and function. However, using conventional arrays where electrodes are embedded into a glass or ceramic plate can be associated with three main problems: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio due to poor contact between electrodes and tissue, especially in the case of strongly curved retinas from small animals, e.g. rodents; (2) insufficient oxygen and nutrient supply to cells located on the bottom of the recording chamber; and (3) displacement of the tissue during recordings. Perforated multi-electrode arrays (pMEAs) have been found to alleviate all three issues in brain slice recordings. Over the last years, we have been using such perforated arrays to study light evoked activity in the retinas of various species including mouse, pig, and human. In this article, we provide detailed step-by-step instructions for the use of perforated MEAs to record visual responses from the retina, including spike recordings from retinal ganglion cells and in vitro electroretinograms (ERG). In addition, we provide in-depth technical and methodological troubleshooting information, and show example recordings of good quality as well as examples for the various problems which might be encountered. While our description is based on the specific equipment we use in our own lab, it may also prove useful when establishing retinal MEA recordings with other equipment."
https://openalex.org/W2033251175,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor of the head and neck region, which frequently occurs in Southeast Asia, especially in the south of China. It is known that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a central role in regulating cellular functions, including proliferation, growth, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis. Aberrant expression of the mTOR signaling pathway molecules has been found in many types of cancer. However, whether the alterations of p-Akt, p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 protein expression are associated with clinicopathological features and prognostic implications in NPC have not been reported. The purposes of the present study are to investigate the association between the expression of p-Akt, p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins and clinicopathological features in NPC by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the positive percentage of p-Akt, p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins expression in NPC (47.2%, 73.0% and 61.7%, respectively) was significantly higher than that in the non-cancerous nasopharyngeal control tissue (33.3%, 59.1% and 47.0%, respectively). There was a significantly higher positive expression of p-Akt in undifferentiated non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma than that in differentiated non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (P = 0.014). Additionally, positive expression of p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins, and positive expression of either of p-Akt, p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 were significantly correlated inversely with overall survival rates of NPC patients (P = 0.023, P = 0.033, P = 0.008, respectively). Spearman’s rank correlation test showed that expression of p-Akt in NPC was significantly associated with expression of p-p70S6K (r = 0.263, P<0.001) and p-4EBP1(r = 0.284, P<0.001). Also there was an obviously positive association between expression of p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins in NPC (r = 0.286, P<0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis further identified positive expression of p-4EBP1 and p-p70S6K proteins were the independent poor prognostic factors for NPC (P = 0.043, P = 0.027, respectively). Taken together, high expression of p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 proteins may act as valuable independent biomarkers to predict a poor prognosis of NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2319131584,"Acyl CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-2 is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes triacylglycerol (TG) synthesis using diacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA as substrates. DGAT2 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but when cells are incubated with fatty acids, DGAT2 interacts with lipid droplets presumably to catalyze localized TG synthesis for lipid droplet expansion. Previous studies have shown that DGAT2 interacts with proteins that synthesize its fatty acyl CoA substrates. In this study, we provide additional evidence that DGAT2 is present in a protein complex. Using a chemical cross-linker, disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), we demonstrated that DGAT2 formed a dimer and was also part of a protein complex of ∼ 650 kDa, both in membranes and on lipid droplets. Using co-immunoprecipitation experiments and an in situ proximity ligation assay, we found that DGAT2 interacted with monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT)-2, an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of diacylglycerol. Deletion mutagenesis showed that the interaction with MGAT2 was dependent on the two transmembrane domains of DGAT2. No significant interaction of DGAT2 with lipin1, another enzyme that synthesizes diacylglycerol, could be detected. When co-expressed in cells, DGAT2 and MGAT2 co-localized in the ER and on lipid droplets. Co-expression also resulted in increased TG storage compared with expression of DGAT2 or MGAT2 alone. Incubating McArdle rat hepatoma RH7777 cells with 2-monoacylglycerol caused DGAT2 to translocate to lipid droplets. This also led to the formation of large cytosolic lipid droplets, characteristic of DGAT2, but not DGAT1, and indicated that DGAT2 can utilize monoacylglycerol-derived diacylglycerol. These findings suggest that the interaction of DGAT2 and MGAT2 serves to channel lipid substrates efficiently for TG biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2002077151,"Despite our increasing knowledge of the specific pathogenicity factors in bacteria, the contribution of metabolic processes to virulence is largely unknown. Here, we elucidate a tight connection between pathogenicity and core metabolism in the enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis by integrated transcriptome and [(13)C]fluxome analysis of the wild type and virulence-regulator mutants. During aerobic growth on glucose, Y. pseudotuberculosis reveals an unusual flux distribution with a high level of secreted pyruvate. The absence of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators RovA, CsrA, and Crp strongly perturbs the fluxes of carbon core metabolism at the level of pyruvate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and these perturbations are accompanied by transcriptional changes in the corresponding enzymes. Knock-outs of regulators of this metabolic branch point and of its central enzyme, pyruvate kinase (ΔpykF), result in mutants with significantly reduced virulence in an oral mouse infection model. In summary, our work identifies the pyruvate-TCA cycle node as a focal point for controlling the host colonization and virulence of Yersinia."
https://openalex.org/W2086472408,"We analyze data sharing practices of astronomers over the past fifteen years. An analysis of URL links embedded in papers published by the American Astronomical Society reveals that the total number of links included in the literature rose dramatically from 1997 until 2005, when it leveled off at around 1500 per year. The analysis also shows that the availability of linked material decays with time: in 2011, 44% of links published a decade earlier, in 2001, were broken. A rough analysis of link types reveals that links to data hosted on astronomers' personal websites become unreachable much faster than links to datasets on curated institutional sites. To gauge astronomers' current data sharing practices and preferences further, we performed in-depth interviews with 12 scientists and online surveys with 173 scientists, all at a large astrophysical research institute in the United States: the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in Cambridge, MA. Both the in-depth interviews and the online survey indicate that, in principle, there is no philosophical objection to data-sharing among astronomers at this institution. Key reasons that more data are not presently shared more efficiently in astronomy include: the difficulty of sharing large data sets; over reliance on non-robust, non-reproducible mechanisms for sharing data (e.g. emailing it); unfamiliarity with options that make data-sharing easier (faster) and/or more robust; and, lastly, a sense that other researchers would not want the data to be shared. We conclude with a short discussion of a new effort to implement an easy-to-use, robust, system for data sharing in astronomy, at theastrodata.org, and we analyze the uptake of that system to-date."

In the present study, we investigated the gene expression levels of villous tissues in early gestation. We compared the expression levels of the genes related to angiogenesis and apoptosis in the villous tissues obtained from smoking and non-smoking pregnant women.We collected villous tissue samples from 57 women requesting surgical termination due to non-medical reasons at 6-8 weeks of gestation. The maternal cigarette smoking status was evaluated by the level of serum cotinine and patients were divided into active smokers and non-smokers by the serum cotinine level. The placental levels of VEGFA, PGF, FLT1, HIF1A, TP53, BAX and BCL2 mRNA were quantified by real time PCR.The gene expression level of PGF and HIF1A in the active smoker group was significantly higher than that in the non-smoker group. We did not observe any significant differences in the VEGFA or FLT1 expression between the groups. In active smoker group, the gene expression levels of TP53 and BAX were significantly higher than those in the non-smoker group. The ratio of BAX/BCL2 mRNA in the active smoker group was significantly higher than that in the non-smoker group.Our findings revealed that smoking might affect the placenta during early pregnancy. Maternal cigarette smoking in early pregnancy may be associated with villus hypoxia, which may influence angiogenesis and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2057620464,"Background Anesthetic exposure early in life affects neural development and long-term cognitive function, but our understanding of the types of memory that are altered is incomplete. Specific cognitive tests in rodents that isolate different memory processes provide a useful approach for gaining insight into this issue. Methods Postnatal day 7 (P7) rats were exposed to either desflurane or isoflurane at 1 Minimum Alveolar Concentration for 4 h. Acute neuronal death was assessed 12 h later in the thalamus, CA1-3 regions of hippocampus, and dentate gyrus. In separate behavioral experiments, beginning at P48, subjects were evaluated in a series of object recognition tests relying on associative learning, as well as social recognition. Results Exposure to either anesthetic led to a significant increase in neuroapoptosis in each brain region. The extent of neuronal death did not differ between groups. Subjects were unaffected in simple tasks of novel object and object-location recognition. However, anesthetized animals from both groups were impaired in allocentric object-location memory and a more complex task requiring subjects to associate an object with its location and contextual setting. Isoflurane exposure led to additional impairment in object-context association and social memory. Conclusion Isoflurane and desflurane exposure during development result in deficits in tasks relying on associative learning and recognition memory. Isoflurane may potentially cause worse impairment than desflurane."
https://openalex.org/W2115483275,"SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are mitochondrial deacylases that impact multiple facets of energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. SIRT3 activates several mitochondrial enzymes, SIRT4 represses its targets, and SIRT5 has been shown to both activate and repress mitochondrial enzymes. To gain insight into the relative effects of the mitochondrial sirtuins in governing mitochondrial energy metabolism, SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 overexpressing HEK293 cells were directly compared. When grown under standard cell culture conditions (25 mM glucose) all three sirtuins induced increases in mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis, and glucose oxidation, but with no change in growth rate or in steady-state ATP concentration. Increased proton leak, as evidenced by oxygen consumption in the presence of oligomycin, appeared to explain much of the increase in basal oxygen utilization. Growth in 5 mM glucose normalized the elevations in basal oxygen consumption, proton leak, and glycolysis in all sirtuin over-expressing cells. While the above effects were common to all three mitochondrial sirtuins, some differences between the SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 expressing cells were noted. Only SIRT3 overexpression affected fatty acid metabolism, and only SIRT4 overexpression altered superoxide levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. We conclude that all three mitochondrial sirtuins can promote increased mitochondrial respiration and cellular metabolism. SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 appear to respond to excess glucose by inducing a coordinated increase of glycolysis and respiration, with the excess energy dissipated via proton leak."

This study was to characterize the expression of miRNAs that might be involved in the development or reflect the consequences of VSD.MiRNA microarray analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were employed to determine the miRNA expression profile from 3 patients with VSD and 3 VSD-free controls. 3 target gene databases were employed to predict the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs. miRNAs that were generally consensus across the three databases were selected and then independently validated using real time PCR in plasma samples from 20 VSD patients and 15 VSD-free controls. Target genes of validated 8 miRNAs were predicted using bioinformatic methods.36 differentially expressed miRNAs were found in the patients with VSD and the VSD-free controls. Compared with VSD-free controls, expression of 15 miRNAs were up-regulated and 21 miRNAs were downregulated in the VSD group. 15 miRNAs were selected based on database analysis results and expression levels of 8 miRNAs were validated. The results of the real time PCR were consistent with those of the microarray analysis. Gene ontology analysis indicated that the top target genes were mainly related to cardiac right ventricle morphogenesis. NOTCH1, HAND1, ZFPM2, and GATA3 were predicted as targets of hsa-let-7e-5p, hsa-miR-222-3p and hsa-miR-433.We report for the first time the circulating miRNA profile for patients with VSD and showed that 7 miRNAs were downregulated and 1 upregulated when matched to VSD-free controls. Analysis revealed target genes involved in cardiac development were probably regulated by these miRNAs."

Numerous components involved in inflammasome activation have been identified, but the mechanisms of inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion have not yet been fully explored. Here, we demonstrate that end-binding protein 1 (EB1), which is required for activation of AIM2 inflammasome complex, links the AIM2 inflammasome to autophagy-dependent secretion. Imaging studies revealed that AIM2 inflammasomes colocalize with microtubule organizing centers and autophagosomes. Biochemical analyses showed that poly(dA-dT)-activated AIM2 inflammasomes induce autophagy and IL-1β secretion in an LC3-dependent fashion. Furthermore, depletion of EB1 decreases autophagic shedding and intracellular trafficking. Finally, we found that the 5′-AMP activated protein kinase may regulate this EB1-mediated autophagy-based inflammasome-induced secretion of IL-1β. These findings reveal a novel EB1-mediated pathway for the secretion of IL-1β.

These findings reveal a novel EB1-mediated pathway for the secretion of IL-1β. Inflammasomes are intracellular protein complexes that sense various pathogenic infections and cause inflammation by inducing the secretion of interleukin 1 β (IL-1β) or interleukin 18 (IL-18) (1.Davis B.K.

Numerous studies have revealed that inflammasomes participate in various diseases (e.g. cancers, diabetes, and Alzheimer disease) by regulating IL-1β secretion (2.Chen L.C. Wang L.J. Tsang N.M.

Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that comprise receptors (e.g. NLPR3, AIM2, and NLRC4), an adaptive protein ASC, and procaspase 1. The receptors activate procaspase 1 via ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD)-dependent or -independent mechanisms, and the activated caspase 1 subsequently triggers IL-1β secretion (1.Davis B.K. Wen H. Ting J.P. The inflammasome NLRs in immunity, inflammation, and associated diseases.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29: 707-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The typical mechanism of IL-1β secretion requires two signals: (i) transcriptional regulation of pro-IL-1β and (ii) inflammasome activation-mediated secretion of IL-1β. An activated inflammasome is seen as a single perinuclear complex in cells; this is called a “speck-like particle” (5.Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S.

Interestingly, inflammasomes not only sense pathogenic infections, they also detect cellular damage signals (e.g. reactive oxygen species production and ATP release) (6.Zhou R. Tardivel A. Thorens B.

Autophagy is cellular vacuoles that governs cellular homeostasis and responds to cellular stress (12.Boya P. Reggiori F. Codogno P. Emerging regulation and functions of autophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, autophagy begins with the nucleation of proautophagic vacuoles at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) (13.Mackeh R. Perdiz D. Lorin S. Codogno P. Poüs C. Autophagy and microtubules: new story, old players.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The autophagic vacuoles then mature; this may be tracked by the processing of LC3-I to LC3-II via upstream regulators (12.Boya P. Reggiori F. Codogno P. Emerging regulation and functions of autophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The mature autophagic vesicles then fuse with lysosomes, enabling the enzymatic digestion of cellular components. This supports cellular homeostasis and the clearance of pathogens (12.Boya P. Reggiori F. Codogno P. Emerging regulation and functions of autophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The intracellular trafficking of autophagic vacuoles has been shown to require microtubules (14.Korolchuk V.I. Rubinsztein D.C. Regulation of autophagy by lysosomal positioning.Autophagy. 2011; 7: 927-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that microtubule polymerization is important for autophagic movement. Interestingly, autophagy not only prevents cellular damage by clearing proteins and pathogens, it also participates in the unconventional secretion of certain factors (15.Dupont N. Jiang S. Pilli M. Ornatowski W. Bhattacharya D. Deretic V. Autophagy-based unconventional secretory pathway for extracellular delivery of IL-1β.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4701-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 16.Jiang S. Dupont N. Castillo E.F. Deretic V. Secretory versus degradative autophagy: unconventional secretion of inflammatory mediators.J. Innate Immun. 2013; 5: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Given that autophagy can be triggered by ubiquitinated inflammasomes (17.Shi C.S. Shenderov K. Huang N.N. Kabat J. Abu-Asab M. Fitzgerald K.A. Sher A. Kehrl J.H. Activation of autophagy by inflammatory signals limits IL-1β production by targeting ubiquitinated inflammasomes for destruction.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) and the secretion of IL-1β is known to require vesicle shedding (18.Carta S. Tassi S. Semino C. Fossati G. Mascagni P.

Rapid secretion of interleukin-1β by microvesicle shedding.Immunity. 2001; 15: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that autophagy may be involved in the secretion of IL-1β. Here, we demonstrate that EB1-activated AIM2 inflammasome specks colocalize with MTOCs and are engulfed in autophagic vacuoles. We show that AIM2 inflammasome-induced IL-1β secretion depends on autophagy and can be inhibited by silencing of the autophagic marker, LC3. In addition, we report that depletion of EB1 decreases autophagy and IL-1β shedding after AIM2 inflammasome activation. Finally, we show that 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may regulate EB1-mediated AIM2 inflammasome activation and autophagy-based IL-1β secretion. Conclusively, we performed the third signal of inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion via autophagy, which was elicited by EB1-depended MTOCs location of AIM2 inflammasome speck and autophagic shedding. The following antibodies were utilized: anti-caspase 1, anti-EB1 (for immunoprecipitation), anti-LAMP1 and anti-α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-FLAG, anti-γ-tubulin, anti-LC3, anti-mouse IgG (10 nm of colloidal gold) and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich); anti-ASC (MBL, Woburn, MA); anti-GFP (GeneTex, Irvine, CA); anti-EB1 (for Western blot analysis; BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-AMPKα (Epitomic, Burlingame, CA); and anti-Thr(P)-172-AMPKα (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The poly(dA-dT), PMA, AICAR, rapamycin, chloroquine, and compound C were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow was purchased from GE Healthcare. Finally, the Amicon Ultra 2-ml centrifugal filters 3K were purchased from Merck Millipore. The wild-type EB1 construct was PCR amplified from HK1 cDNA and cloned into HindIII/BamHI-treated pFLAG-CMV2 vectors (Clontech). Wild-type ASC was PCR amplified from HK1 cDNA and cloned into HindIII/BamHI-treated pEGFP-N1 vectors (Clontech). HeLa, NPC TW02, and HK1 cells were cultured as described previously (9.Wang L.J.

Lentiviruses were established following the protocol of the RNAi Core of Taiwan and used to generate HK1 cells expressing mature human IL-1β. The cells were maintained with 500 µg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). For transfection assays, cells were transfected with poly(dA-dT) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The sequence encoding the full-length human AIM2 cDNA was cloned into NdeI/BamHI-treated pET-15b vectors (Novagen). His-AIM2 was expressed in vector-transformed Rosetta competent cells treated with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 1.5 h, and the expressed proteins were purified using a nickel Sepharose High Performance system (GE Healthcare). Two American Rabbit Breeders Association (New Zealand) rabbits were immunized twice (interval, 1 month) with 1 mg of purified His-AIM2 in Freund's complete adjuvant. At 10–14 days after the second (boost) injection, anti-AIM2 sera were obtained from the immunized rabbits and purified. Cells were treated with poly(dA-dT) for 6 h. Cell extracts (1 mg) were collected using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ethylenediamine tetraacetate, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm phenylmethylenesulfonyl fluoride) and immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies (1 µg) or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for 24 h. The antibody-bound samples were precipitated with Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow for 1 h at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitated products were collected for Western blot analysis. Stealth RNAi reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. These included three 25-bp RNA duplexes for each of three targets, as follows: AIM2 (5′-UAUGGUGCUAUGAACUCCAGAUGUC-3′; 5′-GACAUCUGGAGUUCAUAGCACCAUA-3′; 5′-AAACCAUUCACAAUUGUUCCAAGGG-3′), EB1 (5′-CCGAAGAAACCUCUCACUUCUAGCA-3′; 5′-GGAUCAAUGAGUCUCUGCAGUUGAA-3′; 5′-UCAACGUAUUGAAACUUACUGUUGA-3′), LC3 (5′-CGGACCAUGUCAACAUGAGCGAGUU-3′; 5′-UCGCGGACAUCUACGAGCAGGAGAA-3′; 5′-GGCUUCCUCUAUAUGGUCUACGCCU-3′), and AMPKα (5′-CCCAUCCUGAAAGAGUACCAUUCUU-3′; 5′-CCCUCAAUAUUUAAAUCCUUCUGUG-3′; 5′-ACCAUGAUUGAUGAUGAAGCCUUAA-3′). The negative control siRNA was synthesized by Research Biolabs (Singapore). Cells were transfected with 75 pmol of dsRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 6 h, the dsRNA complexes were removed, and the cells were replated in 5 ml of fresh medium. Cell culture supernatants were assayed for human IL-1β using the human IL-1β ELISA Ready-SET-Go kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole-cell extracts were homogenized and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ethylenediamine tetraacetate (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylenesulfonyl fluoride, and 2 µl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad), and equal protein amounts (30–50 µg/lane) were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. For the concentrated samples, the culture media were collected and concentrated with Amicon Ultra 2-ml centrifugal filters. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk in TBS, incubated overnight with the respective primary antibodies at 4 °C, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated rabbit/goat/mouse anti-IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce ECL, Thermo Scientific) on Fuji SuperRx films. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized, and blocked overnight at 4 °C with PBS containing 1% BSA. The coverslips were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 2 h and then with the appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich). All coverslips were mounted with the Vectashield reagent (Vector Laboratories) and visualized by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510 META laser-scanning microscope; Carl Zeiss, Germany) with a 63 × 1.32 or 100 × 1.32 NA oil immersion objective. Cells were fixed in a mixture of 1% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer for 2 h and then embedded in 12% gelatin. The blocks were trimmed to size, immersed overnight at 4 °C in PVP/sucrose (15%/1.7 M), mounted on aluminum pins in the proper orientation, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were prepared with an ultracryomicrotome (Reichert Ultracut S/Reichert FCS; Leica, Vienna, Austria). To obtain ultrathin sections, 0.5-µm sections were first cut at −70 °C, stained with 0.1% Toluidine Blue in 1% boric acid, and examined under light microscopy. When the cells were reached within each block, the cutting temperature was lowered to −100 °C, and the section thickness was decreased to 55 nm. Ultrathin sections were picked up with a drop of an equal volume mixture of methylcellulose (2%)/sucrose (2.3 m). Each section was stained with anti-GFP antibodies in 0.1% BSA buffer for 30 min, followed by anti-IgG gold antibodies for 25 min at room temperature. The samples were finally mounted with methylcellulose/uranyl acetate buffer and viewed under a JOEL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope. We previously reported that EB1 is a component of the NLRP3, AIM2, and RIG-I inflammasomes in NPC cells and that it is required for the formation of activated inflammasome specks (9.Wang L.J. Hsu C.W. Chen C.C. Liang Y. Chen L.C. Ojcius D.M. Tsang N.M. Hsueh C. Wu C.C. Chang Y.S. Interactome-wide analysis identifies end-binding protein 1 as a crucial component for the speck-like particle formation of activated absence in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2012; 11: 1230-1244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate the biological function of EB1 in speck formation, we monitored specks (i.e. activated inflammasomes (5.Fernandes-Alnemri T. Wu J. Yu J.W. Datta P. Miller B. Jankowski W. Rosenberg S. Zhang J. Alnemri E.S. The pyroptosome: a supramolecular assembly of ASC dimers mediating inflammatory cell death via caspase-1 activation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1590-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar)) using fluorescence-tagged ASC. Following poly(dA-dT)-induced AIM2 inflammasome activation, GFP-ASC-labeled specks showed perinuclear localization (Fig. 1A). Together with our previous work (9.Wang L.J. Hsu C.W. Chen C.C. Liang Y. Chen L.C. Ojcius D.M. Tsang N.M. Hsueh C. Wu C.C. Chang Y.S. Interactome-wide analysis identifies end-binding protein 1 as a crucial component for the speck-like particle formation of activated absence in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2012; 11: 1230-1244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), this finding indicates that AIM2 inflammasome specks show EB1-dependent perinuclear localization. Notably, we observed only one visible inflammasome speck per poly(dA-dT)-treated cell. Because EB1 regulates microtubule polymerization at the plus end of the microtubule (10.Jiang K. Akhmanova A. Microtubule tip-interacting proteins: a view from both ends.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we speculated that EB1 may recruit the AIM2 inflammasome to the origin of the microtubule or to the MTOC. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the perinuclear location of the GFP-ASC specks in poly(dA-dT)-treated cells was specific to the central cytoskeletal network, as indicated by staining with anti-α-tubulin antibodies (Fig. 1A). Because γ-tubulin is an essential component of the MTOC, we used anti-γ-tubulin antibodies to identify the position of the MTOC in our system. Our results revealed that the GFP-ASC specks in poly(dA-dT)-treated cells colocalized with the MTOCs (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, this phenomenon has also been observed for NLRP7 inflammasomes (20.Messaed C. Akoury E. Djuric U. Zeng J. Saleh M. Gilbert L. Seoud M. Qureshi S. Slim R. NLRP7, a nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor protein, is required for normal cytokine secretion and co-localizes with Golgi and the microtubule-organizing center.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 43313-43323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that inflammasome specks may commonly localize to the MTOC upon activation. The colocalization of activated inflammasome specks with the MTOC suggests that the microtubule network may be involved in inflammasome activation and/or IL-1β secretion. For the past few decades, researchers have examined cellular cargo trafficking (21.Stow J.L. Nobel Prize discovery paves the way for immunological traffic.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), including the secretion of cytokines or growth factors. IL-1β secretion has been shown to depend on vesicular transport (18.Carta S. Tassi S. Semino C. Fossati G. Mascagni P. Dinarello C.A. Rubartelli A. Histone deacetylase inhibitors prevent exocytosis of interleukin-1β-containing secretory lysosomes: role of microtubules.Blood. 2006; 108: 1618-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19.MacKenzie A.

Rapid secretion of interleukin-1β by microvesicle shedding.Immunity. 2001; 15: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and prior reports have shown that (i) autophagy acts on ubiquitinated inflammasomes (17.Shi C.S. Shenderov K. Huang N.N. Kabat J. Abu-Asab M. Fitzgerald K.A. Sher A. Kehrl J.H. Activation of autophagy by inflammatory signals limits IL-1β production by targeting ubiquitinated inflammasomes for destruction.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar); (ii) the intracellular trafficking of autophagosomes depends on the microtubule network; and (iii) the shedding of these vacuoles begins at the MTOC (14.Korolchuk V.I. Rubinsztein D.C. Regulation of autophagy by lysosomal positioning.Autophagy. 2011; 7: 927-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Based on our present findings, we therefore hypothesize that in addition to being required for speck formation, EB1 also participates in inflammasome activation/IL-1β secretion by recruiting inflammasomes to the MTOC and regulating autophagy-dependent secretion. To examine whether EB1 is involved in the secretion of IL-1β, we used NPC cells that stably expressed mature IL-1β (HK1/mIL1b) and constitutively secreted IL-1β regardless of inflammasome stimulation (Fig. 2A) (2.Chen L.C. Wang L.J. Tsang N.M. Ojcius D.M. Chen C.C. Ouyang C.N. Hsueh C. Liang Y. Chang K.P. Chen C.C. Chang Y.S. Tumour inflammasome-derived IL-1β recruits neutrophils and improves local recurrence-free survival in EBV-induced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.EMBO Mol. Med. 2012; 4: 1276-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To examine whether EB1-mediated inflammasome activation was required for IL-1β secretion, we used the EB1-silenced cells generated in our previous work (9.Wang L.J. Hsu C.W. Chen C.C. Liang Y. Chen L.C. Ojcius D.M. Tsang N.M. Hsueh C. Wu C.C. Chang Y.S. Interactome-wide analysis identifies end-binding protein 1 as a crucial component for the speck-like particle formation of activated absence in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2012; 11: 1230-1244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results revealed that EB1 depletion reduced the secretion of mature IL-1β from poly(dA-dT)-treated HK1/mIL1b cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that EB1 is involved in both inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion. To test whether autophagy was also involved in these processes, we treated two NPC cell lines (HK1 and NPC TW02 cells) with rapamycin (which induces autophagy by targeting mTOR) or chloroquine (which inhibits autophagy by blocking the fusion of the vesicle with the cell membrane) and then subjected the cells to AIM2 inflammasome activation. We found that chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased IL-1β secretion following poly(dA-dT) treatment in both NPC cell lines, but rapamycin did not have a significant opposite effect (Fig. 1B). Because the processing of LC3-I to LC3-II reflects the maturation of autophagy (12.Boya P. Reggiori F. Codogno P. Emerging regulation and functions of autophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), we used Western blot analysis to monitor autophagic maturation. We found that poly(dA-dT) treatment increased the levels of LC3-II by 2.2-fold (Fig. 1C; 12 h), suggesting that the activation of autophagy was subsequent to that of AIM2 inflammasomes in our system. Notably, HK1 cells expressed a basal level of LC3-II in the absence of poly(dA-dT) treatment (Fig. 1C, 0 h). This may explain the low level secretion of IL-1β previously observed from these cells in the absence of inflammasome stimulation (9.Wang L.J. Hsu C.W. Chen C.C. Liang Y. Chen L.C. Ojcius D.M. Tsang N.M. Hsueh C. Wu C.C. Chang Y.S. Interactome-wide analysis identifies end-binding protein 1 as a crucial component for the speck-like particle formation of activated absence in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2012; 11: 1230-1244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the less significant induction of IL-1β secretion following rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1B). Knockdown of autophagy by silencing of LC3 significantly decreased IL-1β secretion in poly(dA-dT)-treated HK1 and HK1/mIL1b cells (Figs. 1D and 2B), as well as in a monocyte cell line (THP1) (Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-EB1 in NPC TW02 cells revealed that the levels of LC3-II and ASC increased after poly(dA-dT) treatment (Fig. 1E), indicating that mature autophagosomes were associated with the activated AIM2 inflammasomes. A previous study showed that the extracellular delivery of IL-1β requires the autophagy-based secretory pathway (15.Dupont N. Jiang S. Pilli M. Ornatowski W. Bhattacharya D. Deretic V. Autophagy-based unconventional secretory pathway for extracellular delivery of IL-1β.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4701-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Here, we show for the first time that both EB1 and autophagy are involved in AIM2 inflammasome-induced IL-1β secretion. This is likely to be an innate and common biological process that occurs in the various cell types that undergo inflammasome-associated IL-1β secretion.FIGURE 3.In THP1 cells, EB1 regulates poly(dA-dT)-induced autophagy and AIM2 inflammasome shedding, and AMPK is involved in poly(dA-dT)-induced IL-1β secretion.

https://openalex.org/W2087293292,"Histone H2A variant H2AX is phosphorylated at Ser(139) in response to DNA double-strand break (DSB) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) formation. UV light dominantly induces pyrimidine photodimers, which are removed from the mammalian genome by nucleotide excision repair (NER). We previously reported that in quiescent G0 phase cells, UV induces ATR-mediated H2AX phosphorylation plausibly caused by persistent ssDNA gap intermediates during NER. In this study, we have found that DSB is also generated following UV irradiation in an NER-dependent manner and contributes to an earlier fraction of UV-induced H2AX phosphorylation. The NER-dependent DSB formation activates ATM kinase and triggers the accumulation of its downstream factors, MRE11, NBS1, and MDC1, at UV-damaged sites. Importantly, ATM-deficient cells exhibited enhanced UV sensitivity under quiescent conditions compared with asynchronously growing conditions. Finally, we show that the NER-dependent H2AX phosphorylation is also observed in murine peripheral T lymphocytes, typical nonproliferating quiescent cells in vivo. These results suggest that in vivo quiescent cells may suffer from NER-mediated secondary DNA damage including ssDNA and DSB."

Serine racemase (SR) is the enzyme that converts l-serine to d-serine. In this study, we demonstrate that SR interacts with the synaptic proteins, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and stargazin, forming a ternary complex. SR binds to the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95 through the PDZ domain ligand at its C terminus. SR also binds to the C terminus of stargazin, which facilitates the cell membrane localization of SR and inhibits its activity. AMPA receptor activation internalizes SR and disrupts its interaction with stargazin, therefore derepressing SR activity, leading to more d-serine production and potentially facilitating NMDA receptor activation. These interactions regulate the enzymatic activity as well as the intracellular localization of SR, potentially coupling the activities of NMDA and AMPA receptors. This shuttling of a neurotransmitter synthesizing enzyme between two receptors appears to be a novel mode of synaptic regulation. d-Serine, an endogenous co-agonist for the glycine site of the synaptic NMDA glutamate receptor, regulates synaptic plasticity and is implicated in schizophrenia.

By contrast, SR is inhibited by binding to the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (11.Mustafa A.K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Maag D. Ehmsen J.T. Gazi S.K. Chakraborty A.

Stargazin is one of the best characterized AMPA receptor accessory proteins (13.Vandenberghe W. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin is an AMPA receptor auxiliary subunit.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Stargazin facilitates AMPA receptor cell surface expression, synaptic clustering, and recycling and modulates its desensitization and deactivation (14.Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W.

Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is one of the most abundant proteins of postsynaptic densities, binding to multiple proteins both in AMPA and NMDAR complexes (18.Xu W. PSD-95-like membrane associated guanylate kinases (PSD-MAGUKs) and synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By binding directly to NMDARs and to neuronal nitric oxide synthase, PSD-95 serves as a signaling scaffold, mediating the activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase by calcium-calmodulin concommitant with the entry of calcium via NMDAR channels (19.Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H.

Also by anchoring AMPA receptors at postsynaptic densities, PSD-95 interfaces between AMPA and NMDA receptors (18.Xu W.

In the present study, we report that SR binds to stargazin. We also identify binding of SR to PSD-95 and provide evidence for a ternary complex of SR with stargazin and PSD-95. We elucidate how these binding interactions influence SR function and, presumably, glutamate neurotransmission. These findings imply a role for SR in cross-talk between AMPA and NMDA neurotransmission. Mice containing targeted mutations of SR have been described previously (6.Basu A.C. Tsai G.E. Ma C.L.

We utilized a human proteome microarray constructed from a library of 16,368 unique full-length human ORFs, as described previously (20.Jeong J.S. Jiang L. Albino E. Marrero J. Rho H.S. Hu J. Hu S.

They were expressed as N-terminal GST-RGS(His)6 fusion proteins and purified from yeast. Each ORF is printed in duplicate on the microarrays. Two preparations of SR (independently purified in the laboratory of S. H. S. and H. W.) and d-serine deaminase (DsdA) protein were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 C2-maleimide (Invitrogen) and used as bait proteins. The microarrays were blocked with SuperBlock Blocking Buffers (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 3% (w/v) BSA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and then independently hybridized to the bait proteins for 1 h at room temperature. The microarrays were subsequently washed three times in the TBST buffer and imaged using GenePix 4000B scanner at 635 nm. The amount of each protein immobilized to the microarray was determined by staining with an Alexa Fluor 555-labeled GST antibody and imaged at 532 nm. The intensity of each spot on the microarray was quantified and ranked. Positive candidates were defined as those ranked in the top 300 in both preparations of SR but not within the top 800 in the DsdA control microarray. HEK-293 cells were grown in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). Primary cortical neuronal cultures were grown in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, l-glutamine (0.5 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). Primary cortical neurons were prepared from E18 mice as described (21.Kang B.N. Ahmad A.S. Saleem S. Patterson R.L. Hester L. Doré S. Snyder S.H. Death-associated protein kinase-mediated cell death modulated by interaction with DANGER.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and utilized for biochemical studies on days in vitro 17. HEK-293 cells were transfected with Polyfect (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitation from cells was carried out 48 h after transfection with the constructs specified. The cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitor tablet). Alternatively, mouse brains were quickly removed, and frontal cortex was isolated on ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently homogenized using an overhead stirrer in the aforementioned lysis buffer. Lysates were allowed to rock at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was harvested. Some immunoprecipitations were replicated by centrifuging at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min with essentially the same results (data not shown). After the protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay, supernatant containing 50 µg (overexpression) or 80 µg (endogenous) of protein was saved as inputs (10%). Primary antibodies (∼2 µg) were added to the supernatant containing 500 µg (overexpression) or 800 µg (endogenous) of protein and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The next day, EZView red protein G or protein A affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the mixture for 2 h at 4 °C and washed with washing buffer (lysis buffer with 250–400 mm NaCl) three times. Bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. The optical density (O.D.) of protein bands on each digitized image was normalized to the O.D. of the loading control (β-tubulin, 1:10,000). Densitometry was done using ImageJ software. Normalized values were used for analyses. SH-SY5Y cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.8% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitor tablet) 48 h post-transfection. Lysates were cleared and 30 µl of a prewashed 1:1 slurry of anti-HA affinity gel (Sigma) was incubated with 600 µg of whole-cell lysate overnight at 4 °C. Next day, the anti-HA affinity gel complexes were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor tablet). The last wash was done without the protease inhibitors. The affinity gel was eluted by HA peptide solution (final concentration of 200 µg/ml) three times at 4 °C 30 min each, and the eluents were pooled (∼90 µl of total volume). The anti-stargazin antibody (1.2 µg, gift from Dr. Richard Huganir) or anti-GFP antibody (1 µg) and EZView Protein A affinity gel were incubated with the eluent overnight. The Protein A affinity gel complexes were washed three times with washing buffer and eluted in 2× SDS loading buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. HEK-293 cells or primary cortical neuronal cultures were resuspended in 350 µl/10 cm dish of fractionation buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. The lysates were passed through a 26G needle eight times and then left on ice for 20 min. The lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g to pellet the nuclear fractions. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was kept as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was dissolved in the fractionation buffer and centrifuged again at 120,000 × g for 40 min. The pellet was suspended in the fractionation buffer supplemented by 0.1% (v/v) SDS and stored at −80 °C as the membrane fraction. Cells grown in 60 mm dishes were rinsed twice with ice cold PBS. Then 2.5 ml of freshly made sulfo-NHS-biotin solution was added to each dish and incubated on ice for 15 min in the dark. The cells were then gently washed with ice cold PBS, followed by a wash with PBS supplemented with 50 mm glycine to quench any unreacted biotin, and two washes with PBS. The cells were then lysed in the lysis buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Cleared lysates containing 500 µg of protein were incubated with neutravidin beads overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the beads were washed 5 times with the lysis buffer. Subsequently, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with elution buffer (1% (v/v) 2-Mercaptoethanol in PBS) at 37 °C for 25 min rocking at 900 rpm. The eluents were then subjected to Western blotting. The SR activity assay was performed as previously described (22.Ma T.M. Abazyan S. Abazyan B. Nomura J. Yang C. Seshadri S. Sawa A. Snyder S.H.

In short, 24 h after transfection, the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 8 mm l-serine. After 24 h, the medium was harvested and spun down at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. The level of d-serine was measured by HPLC as described previously (24.Hashimoto A. Nishikawa T. Hayashi T. Fujii N. Harada K. Oka T. Takahashi K. The presence of free D-serine in rat brain.FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The amount of contaminating d-serine in the commercial l-serine was determined and subtracted. To determine the specific activity of SR, d-serine levels in the media were normalized by the amount of SR expressed (determined by the O.D. from Western blotting analysis). For immunofluorescence, rat primary cortical neurons were cultured in 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek). The cells were not treated, or treated with NMDA at 40 µm for 4 min or at 100 µm for 40 min or 100 µm AMPA for 10 or 40 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS twice and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After washing in PBS for four times, the cells were blocked with 7% (v/v) goat serum with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-SR serum, 1:1000; rabbit anti-PSD-95 1:250; rabbit anti-stargazin, 1:100) overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-labeled species-specific goat secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted at 1:600 for 1.5 h at room temperature. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope at The Johns Hopkins University Neuroscience Multiphoton/Electrophysiology Core Facility. Co-localization of two fluorescent channels was quantified by the Pearson correlation coefficient using the Velocity software (PerkinElmer Life Science). HEK-293 cells were plated in 12-well plates for viability assays. The cells were transfected with 1.4 µg of SR and/or 1.0 or 1.4 µg of stargazin. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cell viability was determined via MTT assay as described previously (25.Koldobskiy M.A. Chakraborty A. Werner Jr., J.K. Snowman A.M. Juluri K.R. Vandiver M.S. Kim S. Heletz S. Snyder S.H. p53-mediated apoptosis requires inositol hexakisphosphate kinase-2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 20947-20951Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by the Student's two-tailed paired t test. Data for each lane in the quantification were derived from at least three independent experiments. p values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Appreciation of d-serine, a product of SR, as an endogenous co-agonist of the NMDAR, places SR at a pivotal position in glutamate transmission. However, as it is a relatively recently identified enzyme, there have been few studies of its interactions with synaptic proteins. We wondered whether SR links with synaptic proteins other than the already identified PICK1 (9.Fujii K. Maeda K. Hikida T. Mustafa A.K. Balkissoon R. Xia J. Yamada T. Ozeki Y. Kawahara R. Okawa M.

Barrow R.K. Huganir R.L. Ghosh A. Snyder S.H. Serine racemase: activation by glutamate neurotransmission via glutamate receptor interacting protein and mediation of neuronal migration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we screened a library of 16,368 GST-tagged human proteins purified from yeast (20.Jeong J.S. Jiang L. Albino E. Marrero J. Rho H.S. Hu J. Hu S. Vera C. Bayron-Poueymiroy D. Rivera-Pacheco Z.A. Ramos L. Torres-Castro C. Qian J. Bonaventura J. Boeke J.D. Yap W.Y. Pino I. Eichinger D.J. Zhu H. Blackshaw S. Rapid identification of monospecific monoclonal antibodies using a human proteome microarray.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; (O111.016253)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar). After screening for proteins that robustly bind to two SR preparations from two independent laboratories, but not to the DsdA control, we identified only two candidates, SAP102 and Golgi reassembly-stacking protein 2 (GORASP2) (Fig. 1A). Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed the binding to both mouse and human forms of SAP102, but the interaction with GORASP2 appears to be detectable only for its mouse orthologs (Fig. 1B). Considering the role of d-serine as a neurotransmitter, we decided to focus on SAP102. SAP102 belongs to the family of MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) proteins, of which the best characterized is PSD-95, a protein that binds both NMDA and AMPA receptor complexes (18.Xu W. PSD-95-like membrane associated guanylate kinases (PSD-MAGUKs) and synaptic plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We observed robust co-immunoprecipitation between SR and PSD-95 as well as SAP102, which is suggestive of binding, whereas no binding is evident for SAP-97 (Fig. 1C). We also detect binding of endogenous SR with SAP102 and PSD-95 by immunoprecipitation experiments with mouse brain extracts and primary cortical neurons (Fig. 1, D and E). We mapped binding sites for PSD-95 and SR. PSD-95 possesses 3 PDZ domains that mediate binding to diverse proteins (26.Kim E. Sheng M. PDZ domain proteins of synapses.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Our mapping experiments reveal that PSD-95 interacts with SR via its PDZ3 domain (Fig. 1, F and G). Accordingly, overexpression of the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95 disrupts the interaction between SR and PSD-95 (Fig. 1H). Consensus sequences enabling proteins to bind PDZ domains of other proteins involve the last several amino acids at the C terminus (27.Tonikian R. Zhang Y. Sazinsky S.L. Currell B. Yeh J.H. Reva B. Held H.A. Appleton B.A. Evangelista M. Wu Y. Xin X. Chan A.C. Seshagiri S. Lasky L.A. Sander C. Boone C. Bader G.D. Sidhu S.S. A specificity map for the PDZ domain family.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e239Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C-terminal Thr-Val-Ser-Val (TVSV) of SR abolishes its binding to PSD-95, indicating that this typical “PDZ ligand” domain of SR is responsible for interactions with PSD-95 (Fig. 1I). We also demonstrate co-localization of PSD-95 and SR in the soma and dendrites of primary cortical neurons in culture preparations (Fig. 1J). We used Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to quantify co-localization because it is independent of signal intensity levels and signal offset (background) and therefore is relatively unbiased (28.Dunn K.W. Kamocka M.M. McDonald J.H. A practical guide to evaluating colocalization in biological microscopy.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C723-C742Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). SR/PSD-95 has a PCC of 0.68 ± 0.01. SR has been previously shown to bind PICK1 and glutamate receptor-interacting protein, well characterized members of the AMPA receptor-associated protein complex (8.Kim P.M. Aizawa H. Kim P.S.

Snyder S.H. Sawa A. Serine racemase binds to PICK1: potential relevance to schizophrenia.Mol. Psychiatry. 2006; 11: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Stargazin is a more recently identified and prominent accessory protein for AMPA receptors (14.Tomita S. Adesnik H. Sekiguchi M. Zhang W. Wada K. Howe J.R. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Stargazin modulates AMPA receptor gating and trafficking by distinct domains.Nature. 2005; 435: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined its possible interactions with SR. Utilizing overexpressed proteins in HEK-293 cells, we observe robust co-precipitation of stargazin with SR (Fig. 2A). Endogenous stargazin also co-immunoprecipitates with SR in mouse brain extracts (Fig. 2B). Presumably SR participates in AMPA receptor complexes that include stargazin. We wondered whether, additionally, SR might bind directly to AMPA recep"

The client attends to alternating bilateral visual, auditory or sensory stimulation while confronted with emotionally disturbing material. It is thought that the bilateral stimulation as a specific element of EMDR facilitates accessing and processing of negative material while presumably creating new associative links. We hypothesized that the putatively facilitated access should be reflected in increased activation of the amygdala upon bilateral EMDR stimulation even in healthy subjects. Methods We investigated 22 healthy female university students (mean 23.5 years) with fMRI. Subjects were scanned while confronted with blocks of disgusting and neutral picture stimuli. One third of the blocks was presented without any additional stimulation, one third with bilateral simultaneous auditory stimulation, and one third with bilateral alternating auditory stimulation as used in EMDR. Results Contrasting disgusting vs. neutral picture stimuli confirmed the expected robust effect of amygdala activation for all auditory stimulation conditions. The interaction analysis with the type of auditory stimulation revealed a specific increase in activation of the right amygdala for the bilateral alternating auditory stimulation. Activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed the opposite effect with decreased activation. Conclusions We demonstrate first time evidence for a putative neurobiological basis of the bilateral alternating stimulation as used in the EMDR method. The increase in limbic processing along with decreased frontal activation is in line with theoretical models of how bilateral alternating stimulation could help with therapeutic reintegration of information, and present findings may pave the way for future research on EMDR in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder."

Stable cell lines were created that express cDNAs for the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of human FPGS under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter in the AUXB1 cell line.

https://openalex.org/W2126595426,"To ensure long-term reproductive success organisms have to cope with harsh environmental extremes. A reproductive strategy that simply maximizes offspring production is likely to be disadvantageous because it could lead to a catastrophic loss of fecundity under unfavorable conditions. To understand how an appropriate balance is achieved, we investigated reproductive performance of C. elegans under conditions of chronic heat stress. We found that following even prolonged exposure to temperatures at which none of the offspring survive, worms could recover and resume reproduction. The likelihood of producing viable offspring falls precipitously after exposure to temperatures greater than 28°C primarily due to sperm damage. Surprisingly, we found that worms that experienced higher temperatures can recover considerably better, provided they did not initiate ovulation. Therefore mechanisms controlling this process must play a crucial role in determining the probability of recovery. We show, however, that suppressing ovulation is only beneficial under relatively long stresses, whereas it is a disadvantageous strategy under shorter stresses of the same intensity. This is because the benefit of shutting down egg laying, and thus protecting the reproductive system, is negated by the cost associated with implementing this strategy--it takes considerable time to recover and produce offspring. We interpret these balanced trade-offs as a dynamic response of the C. elegans reproductive system to stress and an adaptation to life in variable and unpredictable conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2066816986,"Background Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. Several genes involved in phosphorus deficiency stress have been identified in various plant species. However, a whole genome understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in plant adaptations to low P remains elusive, and there is particularly little information on the genetic basis of these acclimations in coniferous trees. Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) is grown mainly in the tropical and subtropical regions in China, many of which are severely lacking in inorganic phosphate (Pi). In previous work, we described an elite P. massoniana genotype demonstrating a high tolerance to Pi-deficiency. Methodology/Principal Findings To further investigate the mechanism of tolerance to low P, RNA-seq was performed to give an idea of extent of expression from the two mixed libraries, and microarray whose probes were designed based on the unigenes obtained from RNA-seq was used to elucidate the global gene expression profiles for the long-term phosphorus starvation. A total of 70,896 unigenes with lengths ranging from 201 to 20,490 bp were assembled from 112,108,862 high quality reads derived from RNA-Seq libraries. We identified 1,396 and 943 transcripts that were differentially regulated (P<0.05) under P1 (0.01 mM P) and P2 (0.06 mM P) Pi-deficiency conditions, respectively. Numerous transcripts were consistently differentially regulated under Pi deficiency stress, many of which were also up- or down-regulated in other species under the corresponding conditions, and are therefore ideal candidates for monitoring the P status of plants. The results also demonstrated the impact of different Pi starvation levels on global gene expression in Masson pine. Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge, this work provides the first insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in acclimation to long-term Pi starvation and different Pi availability levels in coniferous trees."

These results indicated that a testosterone-GPRC6A complex is required for activation of Gq protein, IP3 generation, and [Ca(2+)]i mobilization, leading to Duox1 activation. H2O2 generation by testosterone stimulated the apoptosis of keratinocytes through the activation of caspase-3.

https://openalex.org/W1985734366,"Tacrolimus is an anticalcineurinic agent with potent immunosuppressive activity that has recently been shown to have the added benefit of reducing proteinuria in membranous nephropathy (MN) patients. However, its potential mechanisms remain unknown. To reveal the mechanism, rat cohorts were administered tacrolimus or vehicle from days 7 to 28 after the induction of passive Heymann nephritis (PHN). PHN induction resulted in heavy proteinuria and increased expression of desmin, a marker of injured podocytes. We also showed that the glomerular expression of angiopoietin-like-4 (Angptl4) was markedly upregulated in PHN rats and human MN followed by an increase in urine Angptl4 excretion. In addition, increased Angptl4 expression may be related to podocyte injury and proteinuria. Furthermore, upregulated Angptl4 expression primarily colocalized with podocytes rather than endothelial or mesangial cells, indicating that podocytes may be the source of Angptl4, which then gradually migrated to the glomerular basement membrane over time. However, tacrolimus treatment markedly reduced glomerular and urinary Angptl4, accompanied by a reduction in the established proteinuria and the promotion of podocyte repair. Additionally, glomerular immune deposits and circulating IgG levels induced by PHN clearly decreased following tacrolimus treatment. In conclusion, this is the first demonstration that the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus can reduce Angptl4 in podocytes accompanied by a decrease in established proteinuria and promotion of podocyte repair in MN."

The subunits of the MRC and of F-ATP synthase are mostly encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA), but a small subset is specified by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (1.Zeviani M. Di Donato S. Mitochondrial disorders.Brain. 2004; 127: 2153-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The biogenesis of OXPHOS complexes requires the correct assembly of both mtDNA- and nDNA-encoded subunits. mtDNA-encoded subunits form the hydrophobic core of the complexes, and their cotranslational insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane is the first event in MRC and F-ATP synthase biogenesis (2.Chen J.Q.

The molecular mechanisms leading to COX deficiency and neurodegeneration in LSCOX are still poorly understood, also because of the lack of an adequate animal model of the disease. To shed light on this matter, a Surf1-specific knockdown (KD) model in Drosophila melanogaster was previously created by transgenic double-stranded RNA interference (34.Zordan M.A. Cisotto P.

Our results demonstrate that lack of Surf1 in Drosophila largely phenocopies the human disease, and provides a novel model to address pathogenesis of LSCOX. Flies were raised on standard cornmeal medium and were maintained at 23 °C, 70% relative humidity, on a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle. The UAS fly strain used to perform post-transcriptional silencing, carrying single UAS-Surf1-IR autosomal insertion, was obtained as previously described (34.Zordan M.A. Cisotto P. Benna C.

The following Gal4 lines, obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center, were used to drive the expression of the UAS-Surf1-IR construct: [y, w; Act-Gal4/TM6B, Tb], [elav-C155-Gal4], [y, w; Switch-Act-Gal4/TM6B, Tb], [y, w; how24BGal4]. Wild type [w1118] and [y, w; UAS-GFP] strains were used as controls. For each of the transgenic lines about 300 fertilized eggs were collected on standard yeast-glucose-agar medium in a Petri dish (60 × 15 mm). The fertilized eggs were incubated at 23 °C, and for each experimental condition the number of individuals reaching the 3rd instar larva, pupa, or adult, and the relative percentages were calculated (34.Zordan M.A. Cisotto P.

It was obtained from Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (DGRC). S2R+ cells grow at 25 °C without CO2 in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich) as a loose, semi-adherent monolayer, showing a doubling time of about 48 h. dsRNAi synthesis was performed employing the T7 Megascript kit (Invitrogen) (40.Flockhart I.T.

The oligonucleotides primers used to synthesize dsRNA starting from cDNA were Surf1_T7 F (agtattcccaatcaggcggctgtatgcgttttgccaaagttaaa) and R (aggtcaccaggtacgacagaatggtacaccctctcgatgcactg). These primers give two complementary 600 bp RNA products that anneal as temperature decreases, forming a final 600 bp dsRNA. About 2 × 106 cells suspended in 1 ml of serum-free medium were mixed with 2 µg/ml dsRNA, plated in a 24-well plate, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, one volume of complete medium 2× was added, and cells were grown in the presence of dsRNA for 2 days at 25 °C. All oligonucleotides used in this work were designed using the on-line tool Primer-BLAST (42.Ye J. Coulouris G. Zaretskaya I. Cutcutache I. Rozen S. Madden T.L.

Mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation from ∼200 flies or larvae. Samples were homogenized with a Dounce glass potter and a loose-fitting glass pestle. A mannitol-sucrose buffer (pH 7.4) in 2% BSA was then added to a final volume of 25 ml. Samples were centrifuged at 1,500 × g (Beckman Avanti J-25 Centrifuge, Beckman 2550 rotor) at 4 °C for 6 min. The supernatant was filtered through a fine mesh, and centrifuged at 7,000 × g at 4 °C for 6 min. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of mannitol-sucrose buffer without BSA, centrifuged again at 7,000 × g and finally resuspended in 50 µl of buffer. Protein concentration was measured by the Biuret test. Prior to enzymatic MRC complex activity assays, samples were subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen to disrupt the mitochondrial membranes. The activities of OXPHOS complexes were measured as described previously (43.Kirby D.M. Thorburn D.R. Turnbull D.M. Taylor R.W. Biochemical assays of respiratory chain complex activity.Methods Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 93-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Citrate synthase (CS) activity was determined by the reduction of dithio-bis-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) followed at 412 nm (extinction coefficient = 21,000 m−1/cm−1) in a reaction buffer containing 5 µg of mitochondrial proteins, 75 mm Tris-HCl, Triton 0,1%, 0.4 mm acetyl-CoA, 0,1 µm DTNB, and 0.5 mm oxaloacetate (pH 8.0). Complexes I-V activities were normalized to the activity of CS, both measured as nmol min−1 mg−1 and then expressed as a percentage (44.Ghezzi D. Arzuffi P. Zordan M. Da Re C. Lamperti C. Benna C.

Total RNA was extracted from ∼10 larvae or 2 × 106 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) and further purified by precipitation with LiCl 8 m. RNA samples were checked for integrity by capillary electrophoresis (RNA 6000Nano LabChip, Agilent Technologies). For each sample, 1 µg of RNA was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis, employing 10 mm deoxynucleotides, 10 µm oligo-dT and SuperScript II (Invitrogen). qRT-PCRs were performed in triplicate in a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Invitrogen) using SYBER Green chemistry (Promega). The 2−ΔΔCt (RQ, relative quantification) method implemented in the 7500 Real Time PCR System software was used to calculate the relative expression ratio (45.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

The Surf1 oligonucleotides used were Surf1-RT F (caaatggagtaccgcctggt) and R (gcgagaagagtcctccttgg). Rp49 was used as endogenous control, and the oligonucleotides employed were Rp49 F (tcggttacggatcgaacaa) and R (gacaatctccttgcgcttct). Total DNA from larvae was extracted using phenol/chloroform precipitation. The amount of mtDNA was assessed by the ratio of mtDNA to nDNA copy number determined by quantitative real time amplification of the mitochondrial 16 S gene and the nuclear Rpl32 gene. Primers used in this work (16 S F and R; Rpl32 F and R) were those reported previously (46.Oliveira M.T. Kaguni L.S.

Reactions were per- formed in triplicate using SYBR Green chemistry according to the manufacturer's recommendations (GoTaq qPCR Master Mix, Promega) in a 7500 Real Time PCR System instrument (Invitrogen).

Specimens were analyzed with a Leica DMR microscope using 403 DIC optics, and images were taken with a Leica DFC 480 digital camera. Oxygen measurements were made using the XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) at 25 °C.

The aim of this study was to investigate cortical alterations using both high-resolution T2* acquisitions obtained with 7 Tesla MRI and structural T1 images with 3 Tesla MRI in CADASIL patients with no or only mild symptomatology (modified Rankin's scale ≤1 and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≥24).Complete reconstructions of the cortex using 7 Tesla T2* acquisitions with 0.7 mm isotropic resolution were obtained in 11 patients (52.1±13.2 years, 36% male) and 24 controls (54.8±11.0 years, 42% male). Seven Tesla T2* within the cortex and cortical thickness and morphology obtained from 3 Tesla images were compared between CADASIL and control subjects using general linear models.MMSE, brain volume, cortical thickness and global sulcal morphology did not differ between groups. By contrast, T2* measured by 7 Tesla MRI was significantly increased in frontal, parietal, occipital and cingulate cortices in patients after correction for multiple testing. These changes were not related to white matter lesions, lacunes or microhemorrhages in patients having no brain atrophy compared to controls.Seven Tesla MRI, by contrast to state of the art post-processing of 3 Tesla acquisitions, shows diffuse T2* alterations within the cortical mantle in CADASIL whose origin remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1995830807,"Muscle metabolism dominates the energy costs of locomotion. Although in vivo measures of muscle strain, activity and force can indicate mechanical function, similar muscle-level measures of energy use are challenging to obtain. Without this information locomotor systems are essentially a black box in terms of the distribution of metabolic energy. Although in situ measurements of muscle metabolism are not practical in multiple muscles, the rate of blood flow to skeletal muscle tissue can be used as a proxy for aerobic metabolism, allowing the cost of particular muscle functions to be estimated. Axial, undulatory swimming is one of the most common modes of vertebrate locomotion. In fish, segmented myotomal muscles are the primary power source, driving undulations of the body axis that transfer momentum to the water. Multiple fins and the associated fin muscles also contribute to thrust production, and stabilization and control of the swimming trajectory. We have used blood flow tracers in swimming rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to estimate the regional distribution of energy use across the myotomal and fin muscle groups to reveal the functional distribution of metabolic energy use within a swimming animal for the first time. Energy use by the myotomal muscle increased with speed to meet thrust requirements, particularly in posterior myotomes where muscle power outputs are greatest. At low speeds, there was high fin muscle energy use, consistent with active stability control. As speed increased, and fins were adducted, overall fin muscle energy use declined, except in the caudal fin muscles where active fin stiffening is required to maintain power transfer to the wake. The present data were obtained under steady-state conditions which rarely apply in natural, physical environments. This approach also has potential to reveal the mechanical factors that underlie changes in locomotor cost associated with movement through unsteady flow regimes."
https://openalex.org/W2070843826,"Background Visual exploration of the surroundings during locomotion at heights has not yet been investigated in subjects suffering from fear of heights. Methods Eye and head movements were recorded separately in 16 subjects susceptible to fear of heights and in 16 non-susceptible controls while walking on an emergency escape balcony 20 meters above ground level. Participants wore mobile infrared eye-tracking goggles with a head-fixed scene camera and integrated 6-degrees-of-freedom inertial sensors for recording head movements. Video recordings of the subjects were simultaneously made to correlate gaze and gait behavior. Results Susceptibles exhibited a limited visual exploration of the surroundings, particularly the depth. Head movements were significantly reduced in all three planes (yaw, pitch, and roll) with less vertical head oscillations, whereas total eye movements (saccade amplitudes, frequencies, fixation durations) did not differ from those of controls. However, there was an anisotropy, with a preference for the vertical as opposed to the horizontal direction of saccades. Comparison of eye and head movement histograms and the resulting gaze-in-space revealed a smaller total area of visual exploration, which was mainly directed straight ahead and covered vertically an area from the horizon to the ground in front of the feet. This gaze behavior was associated with a slow, cautious gait. Conclusions The visual exploration of the surroundings by susceptibles to fear of heights differs during locomotion at heights from the earlier investigated behavior of standing still and looking from a balcony. During locomotion, anisotropy of gaze-in-space shows a preference for the vertical as opposed to the horizontal direction during stance. Avoiding looking into the abyss may reduce anxiety in both conditions; exploration of the “vertical strip” in the heading direction is beneficial for visual control of balance and avoidance of obstacles during locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2070562141,"Spinosad is important in pest management strategies of multiple insect pests. However, spinosad resistance is emerging in various pest species. Resistance has in some species been associated with alterations of the target-site receptor, but in others P450s seems to be involved. We test the possible importance of nine cytochrome P450 genes in the spinosad-resistant housefly strain 791spin and investigate the influence of spinosad on P450 expression in four other housefly strains.Significant differences in P450 expression of the nine P450 genes in the four strains after spinosad treatment were identified in 40% of cases, most of these as induction. The highly expressed CYP4G2 was induced 6.6-fold in the insecticide susceptible WHO-SRS females, but decreased 2-fold in resistant 791spin males. CYP6G4 was constitutively higher expressed in the resistant strain compared to the susceptible strain. Furthermore, CYP6G4 gene expression was increased in susceptible WHO-SRS flies by spinosad while the expression level did not alter significantly in resistant fly strains. Expression of CYP6A1 and male CYP6D3 was constitutively higher in the resistant strain compared to the susceptible. However, in both cases male expression was higher than female expression.CYP4G2, CYP6A1, CYP6D3 and CYP6G4 have expressions patterns approaching the expectations of a hypothesized sex specific spinosad resistance gene. CYP4G2 fit requirements of a spinosad resistance gene best, making it the most likely candidate. The overall high expression level of CYP4G2 throughout the strains also indicates importance of this gene. However, the data on 791spin are not conclusive concerning spinosad resistance and small contributions from multiple P450s with different enzymatic capabilities could be speculated to do the job in 791spin. Differential expression of P450s between sexes is more a rule than an exception. Noteworthy differences between spinosad influenced expression of P450 genes between a field population and established laboratory strains were shown."

By employing the k-core decomposition method to identify the core of each snapshot, we find that the core sizes of the FL and FW networks approximately contain about 672 and 373 nodes regardless of the exponential growth of the network sizes. Secondly, we analyze evolving topological properties of the core, including the k-core value, assortative coefficient, clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length. Empirical results show that nodes in the core are getting more interconnected in the evolving process. Thirdly, we investigate the life span of nodes belonging to the core. More than 50% nodes stay in the core for more than one year, and 19% nodes always stay in the core from the first snapshot. Finally, we analyze the connections between the core and the whole network, and find that nodes belonging to the core prefer to connect nodes with high k-core values, rather than the high degrees ones. This work could provide new insights into the online social network analysis."

Vps4 ATPase activity modulates ESCRT function and is itself modulated by its cofactor Vta1 and its substrate ESCRT-III. The carboxyl-terminal Vta1/SBP-1/Lip5 (VSL) domain of Vta1 binds to the Vps4 β-domain to promote Vps4 oligomerization-dependent ATP hydrolysis. Additionally, the Vps4 stimulatory element (VSE) of Vta1 contributes to enhancing Vps4 oligomer ATP hydrolysis. The VSE is also required for Vta1-dependent stimulation of Vps4 by ESCRT-III subunits. However, the manner by which the Vta1 VSE contributes to Vps4 activation is unknown. Existing structural data were used to generate a model of the Vta1 VSE in complex with Vps4. This model implicated residues within the small ATPase associated with various activities (AAA) domain, specifically α-helices 7 and 9, as relevant contact sites. Rational generation of Vps4 mutants defective for VSE-mediated stimulation, as well as intergenic compensatory mutations, support the validity of this model. These findings have uncovered the Vps4 surface responsible for coordinating ESCRT-III-stimulated Vta1 input during ESCRT function and identified a novel mechanism of Vps4 stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2163075953,"The Ste20-related kinase SPAK regulates sodium, potassium, and chloride transport in a variety of tissues. Recently, SPAK fragments, which lack the catalytic domain and are inhibitory to Na(+) transporters, have been detected in kidney. It has been hypothesized that the fragments originate from alternative translation start sites, but their precise origin is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that kidney lysate possesses proteolytic cleavage activity toward SPAK. Ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography combined with mass spectrometry identified the protease as aspartyl aminopeptidase. The presence of the protease was verified in the active fractions, and recombinant aspartyl aminopeptidase recapitulated the cleavage pattern observed with kidney lysate. Identification of the sites of cleavage by mass spectrometry allowed us to test the function of the smaller fragments and demonstrate their inhibitory action toward the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter, NKCC2."
https://openalex.org/W2170073000,"Background There is currently limited information as to which conditions are most prevalent in communities in developing countries. This makes effective planning of eye services difficult. Methods 3,899 eligible individuals were recruited and examined in a cross-sectional survey in Asa Local Government Area, Nigeria. Those who self-reported an ocular morbidity were also asked about their health-seeking behaviour. Health records of local facilities were reviewed to collect information on those presenting with ocular morbidities. Results 25.2% (95% CI: 22.0–28.6) had an ocular morbidity in at least one eye. Leading causes were presbyopia and conditions affecting the lens and conjunctiva. The odds of having an ocular morbidity increased with age and lower educational attainment. 10.1% (7.7–13.0) self-reported ocular morbidity; 48.6% (40.4–56.8) of them reported seeking treatment. At the facility level, 344 patients presented with an ocular morbidity over one month, the most common conditions were red (26.3%) or itchy (20.8%) eyes. Conclusion Ocular morbidities, including many non vision impairing conditions, were prevalent with a quarter of the population affected. The delivery of eye care services needs to be tailored in order to address this need and ensure delivery in a cost-effective and sustainable manner."
https://openalex.org/W2061968829,"Perfringolysin O (PFO) is a toxic protein that binds to cholesterol-containing membranes, oligomerizes, and forms a β-barrel transmembrane pore, leading to cell lysis. Previous studies have uncovered the sequence of events in this multistage structural transition to a considerable detail, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. By measuring hydrogen-deuterium exchange patterns of peptide bond amide protons monitored by mass spectrometry (MS), we have mapped structural changes in PFO and its variant bearing a point mutation during incorporation to the lipid environment. We have defined all regions that undergo structural changes caused by the interaction with the lipid environment both in wild-type PFO, thus providing new experimental constraints for molecular modeling of the pore formation process, and in a point mutant, W165T, for which the pore formation process is known to be inefficient. We have demonstrated that point mutation W165T causes destabilization of protein solution structure, strongest for domain D1, which interrupts the pathway of structural transitions in other domains necessary for proper oligomerization in the membrane. In PFO, the strongest changes accompanying binding to the membrane focus in D1; the C-terminal part of D4; and strands β1, β4, and β5 of D3. These changes were much weaker for PFO(W165T) lipo where substantial stabilization was observed only in D4 domain. In this study, the application of hydrogen-deuterium exchange analysis monitored by MS provided new insight into conformational changes of PFO associated with the membrane binding, oligomerization, and lytic pore formation."
https://openalex.org/W2314271237,"Radix Isatidis (Isatis indigotica Fort.) is one of the most important traditional Chinese medicine plants. However, there is no suitable herbicide used for weed control in Radix Isatidis field during postemergence stage. To explore the safety of sulfonylurea herbicide nicosulfuron on Radix Isatidis (Isatis indigotica Fort.) seedlings and the photosynthetic physiological response of the plant to the herbicide, biological mass, leaf area, photosynthetic pigment content, photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics, and P700 parameters of Radix Isatidis seedlings were analyzed 10 d after nicosulfuron treatment at 5th leaf stage in this greenhouse research. The results showed that biological mass, total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a, and carotenoids content, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, PS II maximum quantum yield, PS II effective quantum yield, PS II electron transport rate, photochemical quenching, maximal P700 change, photochemical quantum yield of PS I, and PS I electron transport rate decreased with increasing herbicide concentrations, whereas initial fluorescence, quantum yield of non-regulated energy dissipation in PS II and quantum yield of non-photochemical energy dissipation due to acceptor side limitation in PS I increased. It suggests that nicosulfuron ≥1 mg L-1 causes the damage of chloroplast, PS II and PS I structure. Electron transport limitations in PS I receptor side, and blocked dark reaction process may be the main cause of the significantly inhibited growth and decreased photosynthetic rate of Radix Isatidis seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W1980288578,"Background and Purpose The time of hospital arrival may have an effect on prognosis of various vascular diseases. We examined whether off-hour admission would affect the 3-month functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to tertiary hospitals. Methods We analyzed the ‘off-hour effect’ in consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke using multi-center prospective stroke registry. Work-hour admission was defined as when the patient arrived at the emergency department between 8 AM and 6 PM from Monday to Friday and between 8 AM and 1 PM on Saturday. Off-hour admission was defined as the rest of the work-hours and statutory holidays. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the association between off-hour admission and 3-month unfavorable functional outcome defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 3–6. Multivariable model included age, sex, risk factors, prehospital delay time, intravenous thrombolysis, stroke subtypes and severity as covariates. Results A total of 7075 patients with acute ischemic stroke were included in this analysis: mean age, 67.5 (±13.0) years; male, 58.6%. In multivariable analysis, off-hour admission was not associated with unfavorable functional outcome (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.09) and mortality (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.77–1.54) at 3 months. Moreover, off-hour admission did not affect a statistically significant shift of 3-month mRS distributions (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78–1.05). Conclusions ‘Off-hour’ admission is not associated with an unfavorable 3-month functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to tertiary hospitals in Korea. This finding indicates that the off-hour effects could be overcome with well-organized stroke management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2027141662,"The Hv1 channel and voltage-sensitive phosphatases share with voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels the ability to detect changes in membrane potential through voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). However, they lack the pore domain typical of these other channels. NaV, KV, and CaV proteins can be found in neurons and muscles, where they play important roles in electrical excitability. In contrast, VSD-containing proteins lacking a pore domain are found in non-excitable cells and are not involved in neuronal signaling. Here, we report the identification of HVRP1, a protein related to the Hv1 channel (from which the name Hv1 Related Protein 1 is derived), which we find to be expressed primarily in the central nervous system, and particularly in the cerebellum. Within the cerebellar tissue, HVRP1 is specifically expressed in granule neurons, as determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Analysis of subcellular distribution via electron microscopy and immunogold labeling reveals that the protein localizes on the post-synaptic side of contacts between glutamatergic mossy fibers and the granule cells. We also find that, despite the similarities in amino acid sequence and structural organization between Hv1 and HVRP1, the two proteins have distinct functional properties. The high conservation of HVRP1 in vertebrates and its cellular and subcellular localizations suggest an important function in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2035916400,"Here, we proposed that volatile organic compounds (VOC), specifically methyl salicylate (MeSA), mediate the formation of calcium oxalate crystals (COC) in the defence against ozone (O3) oxidative damage. We performed experiments using Croton floribundus, a pioneer tree species that is tolerant to O3 and widely distributed in the Brazilian forest. This species constitutively produces COC. We exposed plants to a controlled fumigation experiment and assessed biochemical, physiological, and morphological parameters. O3 induced a significant increase in the concentrations of constitutive oxygenated compounds, MeSA and terpenoids as well as in COC number. Our analysis supported the hypothesis that ozone-induced VOC (mainly MeSA) regulate ROS formation in a way that promotes the opening of calcium channels and the subsequent formation of COC in a fast and stable manner to stop the consequences of the reactive oxygen species in the tissue, indeed immobilising the excess calcium (caused by acute exposition to O3) that can be dangerous to the plant. To test this hypothesis, we performed an independent experiment spraying MeSA over C. floribundus plants and observed an increase in the number of COC, indicating that this compound has a potential to directly induce their formation. Thus, the tolerance of C. floribundus to O3 oxidative stress could be a consequence of a higher capacity for the production of VOC and COC rather than the modulation of antioxidant balance. We also present some insights into constitutive morphological features that may be related to the tolerance that this species exhibits to O3."
https://openalex.org/W1994120002,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is expressed in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron where it performs sodium reabsorption from the lumen. We have recently shown that ENaC activity contributes to the development of salt-induced hypertension as a result of deficiency of EGF level. Previous studies revealed that Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα) is involved in the control of salt-sensitive hypertension and renal injury via Rac1, which is one of the small GTPases activating ENaC. Here we investigated the intracellular mechanism mediating the involvement of the RhoGDIα/Rac1 axis in the control of ENaC and the effect of EGF on ENaC in this pathway. We demonstrated that RhoGDIα is highly expressed in the cortical collecting ducts of mice and rats, and its expression is down-regulated in Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high salt diet. Knockdown of RhoGDIα in cultured cortical collecting duct principal cells increased ENaC subunits expression and ENaC-mediated sodium reabsorption. Furthermore, RhoGDIα deficiency causes enhanced response to EGF treatment. Patch clamp analysis reveals that RhoGDIα significantly decreases ENaC current density and prevents its up-regulation by RhoA and Rac1. Inhibition of Rho kinase with Y27632 had no effects on ENaC response to EGF either in control or RhoGDIα knocked down cells. However, EGF treatment increased levels of active Rac1, which was further enhanced in RhoGDIα-deficient cells. We conclude that changes in the RhoGDIα-dependent pathway have a permissive role in the Rac1-mediated enhancement of ENaC activity observed in salt-induced hypertension.

https://openalex.org/W2036469855,"Although most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cases worldwide are transmitted through mucosal surfaces, transmission through the oral mucosal surface is a rare event. More than 700 bacterial species have been detected in the oral cavity. Despite great efforts to discover oral inhibitors of HIV, little information is available concerning the anti-HIV activity of oral bacterial components. Here we show that a molecule from an oral commensal bacterium, Streptococcus cristatus CC5A can induce expression of APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) and inhibit HIV-1 replication in THP-1 cells. We show by qRT-PCR that expression levels of A3G and A3F increase in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of a CC5A extract, as does A3G protein levels by Western blot assay. In addition, when the human monocytic cell line THP-1 was treated with CC5A extract, the replication of HIV-1 IIIB was significantly suppressed compared with IIIB replication in untreated THP-1 cells. Knock down of A3G expression in THP-1 cells compromised the ability of CC5A to inhibit HIV-1 IIIB infectivity. Furthermore, SupT1 cells infected with virus produced from CC5A extract-treated THP-1 cells replicated virus with a higher G to A hypermutation rate (a known consequence of A3G activity) than virus used from untreated THP-1 cells. This suggests that S. cristatus CC5A contains a molecule that induces A3G/F expression and thereby inhibits HIV replication. These findings might lead to the discovery of a novel anti-HIV/AIDS therapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W2012653610,"Rab5 is a key regulator of early endocytosis by promoting early endosomal fusion and motility. In this study, we have unexpectedly found distinct properties of the two Rab5 homologs (MoRab5A and MoRab5B) from Magnaporthe oryzae, a pathogenic fungus in plants whose infection causes rice blast disease. Like mammalian Rab5, MoRab5A and MoRab5B can bind to several Rab5 effectors in a GTP-dependent manner, including EEA1, Rabenosyn-5, and Rabaptin-5. However, MoRab5A shows distinct binding characteristics in the sense that both the wild-type and the GTP hydrolysis-defective constitutively active mutant bind the effectors equally well in GST pull-down assays, suggesting that MoRab5A is defective in GTP hydrolysis and mostly in the GTP-bound conformation in the cell. Indeed, GTP hydrolysis assays indicate that MoRab5A GTPase activity is dramatically lower than MoRab5B and human Rab5 and is insensitive to RabGAP5 stimulation. We have further identified a Pro residue in the switch I region largely responsible for the distinct MoRab5A properties by characterization of MoRab5A and MoRab5B chimeras and mutagenesis. The differences between MoRab5A and MoRab5B extend to their functions in the cell. Although they both target to early endosomes, only MoRab5B closely resembles human Rab5 in promoting early endosome fusion and stimulating fluid phase endocytosis. In contrast, MoRab5A correlates with another related early endosomal Rab, Rab22, in terms of the presence of the switch I Pro residue and the blocked GTPase activity. Our data thus identify MoRab5B as the Rab5 ortholog and suggest that MoRab5A specializes to perform a non-redundant function in endosomal sorting."
https://openalex.org/W2046307474,"Using deformable models to register medical images can result in problems of initialization of deformable models and robustness and accuracy of matching of inter-subject anatomical variability. To tackle these problems, a novel model is proposed in this paper by compounding local invariant features and global deformable geometry. This model has four steps. First, a set of highly-repeatable and highly-robust local invariant features, called Key Features Model (KFM), are extracted by an effective matching strategy. Second, local features can be matched more accurately through the KFM for the purpose of initializing a global deformable model. Third, the positional relationship between the KFM and the global deformable model can be used to precisely pinpoint all landmarks after initialization. And fourth, the final pose of the global deformable model is determined by an iterative process with a lower time cost. Through the practical experiments, the paper finds three important conclusions. First, it proves that the KFM can detect the matching feature points well. Second, the precision of landmark locations adjusted by the modeled relationship between KFM and global deformable model is greatly improved. Third, regarding the fitting accuracy and efficiency, by observation from the practical experiments, it is found that the proposed method can improve % of the fitting accuracy and reduce around 50% of the computational time compared with state-of-the-art methods."
