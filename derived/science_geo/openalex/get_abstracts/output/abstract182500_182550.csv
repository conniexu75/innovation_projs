https://openalex.org/W1977148550,"Quantum continuous variables are being explored as an alternative means to implement quantum key distribution, which is usually based on single photon counting. The former approach is potentially advantageous because it should enable higher key distribution rates. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a quantum key distribution protocol based on the transmission of gaussian-modulated coherent states (consisting of laser pulses containing a few hundred photons) and shot-noise-limited homodyne detection; squeezed or entangled beams are not required. Complete secret key extraction is achieved using a reverse reconciliation technique followed by privacy amplification. The reverse reconciliation technique is in principle secure for any value of the line transmission, against gaussian individual attacks based on entanglement and quantum memories. Our table-top experiment yields a net key transmission rate of about 1.7 megabits per second for a loss-free line, and 75 kilobits per second for a line with losses of 3.1 dB. We anticipate that the scheme should remain effective for lines with higher losses, particularly because the present limitations are essentially technical, so that significant margin for improvement is available on both the hardware and software."

https://openalex.org/W2028678048,"Traditional discussions of speciation are based on geographical patterns of species ranges. In allopatric speciation, long-term geographical isolation generates reproductively isolated and spatially segregated descendant species. In the absence of geographical barriers, diversification is hindered by gene flow. Yet a growing body of phylogenetic and experimental data suggests that closely related species often occur in sympatry or have adjacent ranges in regions over which environmental changes are gradual and do not prevent gene flow. Theory has identified a variety of evolutionary processes that can result in speciation under sympatric conditions, with some recent advances concentrating on the phenomenon of evolutionary branching. Here we establish a link between geographical patterns and ecological processes of speciation by studying evolutionary branching in spatially structured populations. We show that along an environmental gradient, evolutionary branching can occur much more easily than in non-spatial models. This facilitation is most pronounced for gradients of intermediate slope. Moreover, spatial evolutionary branching readily generates patterns of spatial segregation and abutment between the emerging species. Our results highlight the importance of local processes of adaptive divergence for geographical patterns of speciation, and caution against pitfalls of inferring past speciation processes from present biogeographical patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2053837765,"Myofibroblast differentiation and activation by transforming growth factor-ॆ1 (TGF-ॆ1) is a critical event in the pathogenesis of human fibrotic diseases, but regulatory mechanisms for this effect are unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that stable expression of the myofibroblast phenotype requires both TGF-ॆ1and adhesion-dependent signals. TGF-ॆ1-induced myofibroblast differentiation of lung fibroblasts is blocked in non-adherent cells despite the preservation of TGF-ॆ receptor(s)-mediated signaling of Smad2 phosphorylation. TGF-ॆ1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) including that of its autophosphorylation site, Tyr-397, an effect that is dependent on cell adhesion and is delayed relative to early Smad signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of FAK or expression of kinase-deficient FAK, mutated by substituting Tyr-397 with Phe, inhibit TGF-ॆ1-induced α-smooth muscle actin expression, stress fiber formation, and cellular hypertrophy. Basal expression of α-smooth muscle actin is elevated in cells grown on fibronectin-coated dishes but is decreased on laminin and poly-d-lysine, a non-integrin binding polypeptide. TGF-ॆ1 up-regulates expression of integrins and fibronectin, an effect that is associated with autophosphorylation/activation of FAK. Thus, a safer and more effective therapeutic strategy for fibrotic diseases characterized by persistent myofibroblast activation may be to target this integrin/FAK pathway while not interfering with tumor-suppressive functions of TGF-ॆ1/Smad signaling."

Here, we examine expression profiles and the potential role of MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. Expression patterns are studied by Northern blot and real-time PCR in two genetic models of obesity (ob/ob and db/db mice) and in a diet-induced model of obesity (AKR mice). Of the MMPs and TIMPs studied, mRNA levels for MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-12, MMP-14, MMP-19, and TIMP-1 are strongly induced in obese adipose tissues compared with lean tissues. In contrast, MMP-7 and TIMP-3 mRNAs are markedly decreased in obesity. Interestingly, enzymatic activities of MMP-12 and of a new identified adipocyte-derived 30-kDa metalloproteinase are enhanced in obese adipose tissue fractions, demonstrating that MMP/TIMP balance is shifted toward increased matrix degradation in obesity. Finally, we analyze the modulation of MMP-2, MMP-19, and TIMP-1 during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation, and we explore the effect of inhibition of MMP activity on in vitro adipogenesis. We find that the synthetic MMP inhibitor BB-94 (Batimastat) decreases adipose conversion of 3T3-L1 and primary rat preadipocytes. BB-94 represses differentiation without affecting mitotic clonal expansion but prevents the early expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ॆ, a transcription factor that is thought to play a major role in the adipogenic program. Such findings support a role for the MMP/TIMP system in the control of proteolytic events and adipogenesis during obesity-mediated fat mass development.

Nature. 2000; 404: 635-643Google Scholar). Adipose tissue mass is a reflection of the number of adipocytes and their amount of fat stored. The development of obesity is associated with coordinated cellular processes, including adipocyte hypertrophy followed by recruitment of adipocyte precursors, and new fat cell differentiation (2Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Google Scholar, 3Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. Négrel R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 207-233Google Scholar). These processes are also accompanied by neovascularization that is essential for generation and proper function of the tissue (4Crandall D.L. Hausman G.J. Kral J.G. Microcirculation. 1997; 4: 211-232Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that such multiple events include dynamic changes of cell-matrix interactions and extensive extracellular matrix (ECM)1 remodeling, and that modifications in proteolytic activities within the adipose microenvironment might occur during the development of the fat depot. Although numerous studies have examined the regulation and intracellular events that occur during adipogenesis, only limited information is available about molecular mechanisms underlying ECM remodeling, proteolytic events, and cell-matrix interactions during obesity-related fat mass development. In a course of differential gene expression analysis between lean and obese adipose tissues, we recently identified osteonectin/SPARC, a protein involved in dynamic interactions between cell and matrix, up-regulated in obesity (5Tartare-Deckert S. Chavey C. Monthouel M.N. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22231-22237Google Scholar). This suggested that alteration in the expression level of matrix proteins may contribute to the development of obesity-associated adipose tissue growth. A balance between the opposing activities of proteinases and their inhibitors controls pericellular proteolytic events. Among enzymes implicated in the degradation of matrix molecules and in the generation of bioactive factors, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family is considered to be primarily responsible for these processes (6Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Google Scholar). MMPs comprise a large family of structurally related zinc-dependent proteinases that has been classified into subgroups on the basis of their structure, substrate specificity, and cellular localization. These subgroups are collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs), and other MMPs (7Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Google Scholar, 8McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 534-540Google Scholar). MMPs participate in many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, wound repair, reproductive cycling, and metastasis (6Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Google Scholar, 7Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Google Scholar). In addition to their direct influence on the degradation of structural matrix molecules, MMPs have also been implicated in the generation of bioactive molecules. They can mediate the release and/or activation of sequestered growth factors and the cleavage of cell surface adhesion receptors (7Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Google Scholar). The activity of MMPs is regulated at the level of gene transcription, proenzyme activation, and via inhibition of their activity by endogenous inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) (9Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Google Scholar). TIMPs are a family of four secreted proteins (TIMP-1 to TIMP-4) that selectively inhibit MMPs in a 1:1 stoichiometric manner. Interestingly, TIMPs can exert biological activities independent of their MMP-blocking action. The balance between MMPs and TIMPs is a critical determinant of ECM integrity and function, and alterations in MMP/TIMP-mediated proteolysis may contribute to many pathological states. The role of matrix remodeling and proteolytic pathways that occur during adipogenesis and adipose tissue formation has just begun to unfold. Recent studies have indicated that matrix degradation might be essential for adipogenesis. It has been proposed that serine proteases of the plasminogen system positively regulated adipocyte differentiation in vitro, as well as in vivoduring mammary gland involution (10Selvarajan S. Lund L.R. Takeuchi T. Craik C.S. Werb Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 267-275Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that mature fat cells and cultured adipocytes secreted gelatinases A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively), and that their proteolytic activities were induced during adipocyte differentiation (11Brown L.M. Fox H.L. Hazen S.A. LaNoue K.F. Rannels S.R. Lynch C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C937-C949Google Scholar, 12Bouloumie A. Sengenes C. Portolan G. Galitzky J. Lafontan M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2080-2086Google Scholar). Further, elevated expression of MMP-2 was reported in adipose tissue of obese mice (13Lijnen H.R. Maquoi E. Holvoet P. Mertens A. Lupu F. Morange P. Alessi M.C. Juhan-Vague I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 1111-1116Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes with synthetic MMP inhibitors and by neutralizing antibodies decreased differentiation, suggesting that MMP activities were required for adipocyte conversion (12Bouloumie A. Sengenes C. Portolan G. Galitzky J. Lafontan M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2080-2086Google Scholar). In contrast, another study showed that addition of TIMP-1 or MMP inhibitor GM6001 accelerated 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (14Alexander C.M. Selvarajan S. Mudgett J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 693-703Google Scholar). In addition, this study also demonstrated that stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) determined the rate of adipose reconstitution during mammary gland involution in mice (14Alexander C.M. Selvarajan S. Mudgett J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 693-703Google Scholar). Moreover, on a high fat diet, stromelysin-3 (MMP-11)-deficient mice developed adipocyte hypertrophy compared with wild-type mice (15Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Frederix L. Rio M.C. Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 530-535Google Scholar). Together, these reports revealed a novel function for MMPs as modulators of adipogenesis. However, their expression profile and role in the cellular microenvironment during obesity-mediated adipose tissue development remain poorly defined. Here, we examine the cellular regulation of MMPs and their endogenous inhibitors in white adipose tissue from two rodent genetic models of obesity and from a diet-induced model of obesity, and we further explore the effect of pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteinases on adipogenesis. Our data show that obesity is associated with profound changes in the MMP/TIMP balance and support a potential role for these matrix proteins in the control of remodeling events and adipogenesis during obesity-mediated fat mass development. Care of animals was performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. Male C57BL/6,ob/ob, db/db, and AKR mice were obtained at 6 weeks of age from Harlan (Gannat, France). Male Wistar rats (150–200 g) were from Iffa-Credo (L'Arbresle, France). Animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled facility (22 °C) on a 12-h light-dark cycle with regular unrestricted diet. Induction of obesity by high fat diet in AKR mice was carried out as described previously (5Tartare-Deckert S. Chavey C. Monthouel M.N. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22231-22237Google Scholar). Animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and epididymal fat pads were rapidly dissected and processed for RNA or protein analysis. Total RNA from epididymal white adipose tissue or cells was isolated using the TRIzol reagent following the instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Northern blotting was conducted as previously described (5Tartare-Deckert S. Chavey C. Monthouel M.N. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22231-22237Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ॖg of denatured RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on 1.27 agarose gels and transferred to positively charged nylon membrane. Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with specific32P-labeled cDNA probes. Membranes were exposed to phosphor screen for 4–24 h, and the signals were scanned with a STORM 840 and quantified using ImageQuant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics,Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped and rehybridized with an 18 S oligonucleotide probe as an indicator of RNA integrity and loading. In some experiments data were normalized to the signal generated from 18 S probe. After treatment with DNase I, 1 ॖg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random priming and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Quantitative PCR was performed by monitoring in real time the increase in fluorescence of the SYBR Green dye on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Gene-specific primers (Invitrogen) were designed using the Primer Express software from Applied Biosystems (Table I). Relative expression level of the target gene in obese adipose tissue was plotted as -fold change compared with lean control. 18 S rRNA was used for normalization. Each real-time quantitative PCR assay was performed twice using triplicate samples.Table IPrimers used for amplification of MMP-2, TIMP-3, and Wnt-10b PCR productsGene productPrimersSequence (5′–3′)MMP-2ForwardGCCTCATACACAGCGTCAATCTTReverseCGGTTTATTTGGCGGACAGTTIMP-3ForwardTGACAGGGCGCGTGTATGAAGGReverseGTGGTAGCGGTAATTGAGGCCWnt-10bForwardAATGCGGATCCACAACAACAReverseTTCCATGGCATTTGCACTTC18 SForwardTCGGAACTGAGGCCATGATTReverseCCTCCGACTTTCGTTCTTGATT Open table in a new tab Mouse cDNA clones for matrilysin (MMP-7), stromelysin-2 (MMP-10), and MMP-19 were gifts from T. Ny (Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden). cDNA probes for collagenase-2 (MMP-8) and murine collagenase-like A and B (Mcol-A and -B, respectively) were gifts from C. López-Otı́n (University of Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain). Rat cDNA fragments for gelatinase A (MMP-2), gelatinase B (MMP-9), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), stromelysin-3 (MMP-11), MT1-MMP (MMP-14), collagenase-3 (MMP-13), TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 were used to probe for the corresponding mRNAs. cDNA probes for mouse metalloelastase (MMP-12) and TIMP-4 were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR from mouse epididymal white adipose tissue RNA as described for other probes (5Tartare-Deckert S. Chavey C. Monthouel M.N. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22231-22237Google Scholar). cDNA for aP2 was provided by C. Dani (CNRS, UMR 6543, Nice, France). cDNAs were labeled to high specific activity by random priming and used as probes for Northern blot analysis. Epididymal fat pads from male Wistar rats or from male C57BL/6 and ob/ob mice were minced and digested with the Liberase Blendzyme 3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as previously described (5Tartare-Deckert S. Chavey C. Monthouel M.N. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22231-22237Google Scholar). Isolated adipocytes were separated from stromal-vascular cells (S-V) by centrifugation. The floating top layer of adipocytes and the S-V pellet were washed three times in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate Hepes pH 7.4 buffer and processed for RNA or protein preparation. Adequate cellular fractionation was confirmed by analyzing the expression of S-V and adipogenic markers (Wnt-10b and aP2, respectively). For primary rat preadipocyte culture, the S-V fraction was filtered through a 30-ॖm nylon mesh, centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and plated at 507 confluence in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Freshly isolated adipocytes or S-V cells were lysed in a buffer containing 17 Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C under agitation for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by brief spinning, and protein concentration was evaluated by bicinchoninic acid technique (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce). 40 ॖg of nonreduced protein sample was loaded on 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml α-casein (Sigma) or type I collagen prepared from rat tail tendon. Following electrophoresis, proteins were renatured by incubating gels in 2.57 Triton X-100 for 2 h at 37 °C. Gels were then washed three times in distilled water and incubated in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 5 mmCaCl2) at 37 °C for 24 h (collagen zymography) or 48 h (α-casein zymography) with gentle shaking. Gels were stained with 0.17 Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma) and destained in 77 acetic acid. Enzymatic activities appear as cleared bands in a dark background. In separate experiments, gels were incubated at 37 °C in substrate buffer containing the hydroxamate MMP inhibitor BB-94 (British Biotech, Oxford, United Kingdom; 10 ॖm) or EDTA (1 mm) to verify that zymogen activities were attributable to MMPs. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection) and primary rat preadipocytes prepared as described above were propagated in DMEM supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 ॖg/ml streptomycin and allowed to reach confluence. After 2 days (day 0), the differentiation was initiated by addition of a hormonal mixture composed of 2 ॖm insulin, 1 ॖm dexamethasone, and 0.25 mm isobutylmethylxanthine in DMEM plus 107 fetal bovine serum with or without 10 ॖm BB-94. Three days later (day 3), the induction medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum plus insulin only, and cells were then fed every 2 days. Adipogenesis was scored by analysis of the expression of adipocyte-specific genes (aP2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)) and by lipid accumulation using microscopic analysis or oil red O staining. In standard conditions, cytoplasmic lipid droplets were visible by day 4, and cells were fully differentiated by day 6. For BB-94 treatment, control cells were exposed to an identical concentration of vehicle (Me2SO). Where indicated, cell differentiation was initiated in the presence of rosiglitazone (0.01 ॖm). Cell number at various stages of differentiation was determined by trypsinizing cell monolayers from six-well culture plates followed by counting with a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 cells were prepared at the indicated times according to the method of Schreiber et al. (16Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cell monolayers were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, scraped, and collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. Cell pellet was lysed in cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) supplemented with 107 IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma). After 15 min on ice, the homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 30 s. Nuclear pellet was resuspended in ice-cold hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) and vortexed every 5 min during 30 min on ice. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting nuclear extracts (30 ॖg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblot using a polyclonal antibody to C/EBPॆ, or a monoclonal antibody to PPARγ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Immunoreactive proteins were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECLTM (Amersham Biosciences). Western blotting was also performed on adipocytes and S-V cell lysates to evaluate MMP-12 expression. Each cellular fraction was mixed with Laemmli buffer (37 SDS, 70 mm Tris, pH 7, 117 glycerol) and protein concentration was assayed by bicinchoninic acid technique (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce). Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblot using a monoclonal antibody against MMP-12 (R&D Systems, Inc.). To test the hypothesis that obesity-linked adipose tissue growth might be associated with alterations in MMP/TIMP balance, we first evaluated expression of 13 MMPs in epididymal white adipose tissue of genetically obese ob/ob anddb/db mice and their lean controls (see TableII for MMP nomenclature). The extreme obesity of these two strains results from leptin signaling disruption, and they represent well studied models of obesity.ob/ob mice lack functional leptin, whereasdb/db mice have no functional leptin receptor (17Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold M. Friedman J. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Google Scholar, 18Chen H. Charlat O. Tartaglia L.A. Woolf E.A. Weng X. Ellis S.J. Lakey N.D. Culpepper J. Moore K.J. Breitbart R.E. Duyk G.M. Tepper R.I. Morgenstern J.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 491-495Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-12, MMP-14, and MMP-19 mRNA levels were markedly increased in adipose tissue of both ob/ob anddb/db mice compared with their lean littermates (C57BL/6) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, MMP-7 transcript was strongly reduced in obese adipose tissues. MMP-9, MMP-11, and MMP-13 transcripts were detected in fat tissues, but levels were similar between lean and obese mice (data not shown). MMP-8, Mcol-A, Mcol-B, and MMP-10 transcripts were not detected in adipose tissue by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). Because activity of mature MMPs and activation of proenzymes are regulated by their physiological inhibitors, the TIMPs, we compared expression pattern of the four members of the TIMP family (TIMP-1 to TIMP-4) described to date in adipose tissue of lean and obese mice. As previously documented, all TIMPs were found to be expressed in white fat (19Fata J.E. Leco K.J. Moorehead R.A. Martin D.C. Khokha R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 238-254Google Scholar). TIMP-1 mRNA expression level was strongly elevated in adipose tissue of ob/ob anddb/db mice, whereas TIMP-3 mRNA level was decreased (Fig. 1B). No significant changes in TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 transcripts were observed between lean and obese adipose tissues.Table IINomenclature of MMPs studiedMMP designationCommon nameMMP-2Gelatinase AMMP-3Stromelysin-1MMP-7MatrilysinMMP-8Collagenase-2MMP-9Gelatinase BMMP-10Stromelysin-2MMP-11Stromelysin-3MMP-12MetalloelastaseMMP-13Collagenase-3MMP-14MT1-MMPMMP-19RASI-1No designationMcol-ANo designationMcol-B Open table in a new tab To further characterize the regulation of MMPs and TIMPs in obesity, we analyzed their expression in wild-type AKR mice that developed obesity on high fat diet. In the following experiments, we focused mainly on MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-12, MMP-19, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 that were the most differentially expressed in fatty tissues studied. AKR mice were fed a high fat diet or control chow for 12 weeks. Fat pads were dissected and weighed (Fig.2A). As observed previously, fat pads from fat-fed mice weighed ∼4.5-fold more than those of control mice (Fig. 2A) (5Tartare-Deckert S. Chavey C. Monthouel M.N. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22231-22237Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that MMP-12, MMP-19, and TIMP-1 transcripts were elevated in adipose tissue of fat-fed mice as compared with chow-fed, whereas MMP-7 mRNA level strongly decreased in adipose tissue from obese mice (Fig. 2B). In parallel experiments, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 transcripts remained constant, whereas MMP-2 and TIMP-3 transcripts were below the detection level in these tissues (data not shown). Using a more sensitive assay, we examined the amount of MMP-2 and TIMP-3 mRNAs in diet-induced obesity. Adipose tissue from fat-fed mice showed a 2.5-fold increase in MMP-2 mRNA level and a 2-fold decrease in TIMP-3 mRNA level, as assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that expression of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-12, MMP-19, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 was modulated in mice with diet-induced obesity. Our observations are consistent with those obtained inob/ob and db/db mice in whom obesity is inherited trait (Fig. 1). These findings collectively show that obesity is associated with profound changes in expression of a subset of MMPs and TIMPs in adipose tissue. In addition to mature fat cells, white adipose tissue contains adipocyte precursors and a variety of other cell types such as fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and macrophages. We next determined the source of MMPs and TIMPs expression in adipose tissue. Fat pads from lean (C57BL/6) and ob/obmice were divided into adipocytes and non-adipose cells. Total RNA of these two fractions was analyzed by Northern blot and real-time quantitative PCR (Fig. 3). Adequate separation of the two cell fractions was confirmed by quantitative PCR assay for the S-V marker Wnt-10b, and by Northern blotting for the adipocyte marker aP2 (Fig. 3C) (20Bernlohr D.A. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly Jr., T.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5563-5567Google Scholar, 21Bennett C.N. Ross S.E. Longo K.A. Bajnok L. Hemati N. Johnson K.W. Harrison S.D. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30998-31004Google Scholar). All transcripts tested were detected in both adipocytes and their associated S-V cells. However, except for MMP-19, expression of all transcripts was mainly associated with the S-V compartment. Fig. 3A shows that inob/ob-derived cells MMP-7 mRNA was decreased by a 1.9-fold (adipocytes) and by a 4.6-fold (non-adipose cells) compared with lean counterparts, whereas MMP-12 transcript was strongly induced in the two obese fractions (4.4- and 17.8-fold in adipocytes and S-V cells, respectively). TIMP-1 transcript was, respectively, 2.6- and 4.3-fold higher in obese adipocytes and S-V cells than in lean ones. MMP-19 transcript was increased approximately by 1.4-fold in the two fractions isolated from ob/ob mice. Fig.3B shows real-time PCR analyses of MMP-2 and TIMP-3 transcript distribution in different cell fractions. MMP-2 mRNA level was increased by 2.2-fold in obese adipocytes, whereas the amount was decreased by 3-fold in S-V cells isolated from obese fat tissue. Inob/ob-derived cells, TIMP-3 transcript was markedly decreased in adipocytes (3.6-fold) and in S-V cells (8.2-fold) compared with lean controls. Note that modulation of MMP-7, MMP-12, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 expression was to a greater degree in S-V cells than in adipocytes. These results indicate that the S-V fraction of adipose tissue is the main source of MMP and TIMP expression, and that modulation of their expression profile in obesity occurs mainly in these cells. We next examined MMP activities in adipocytes and non-adipose cells from lean (C57BL/6) and ob/obadipose tissue to determine whether modulation of mRNA steady state levels is reflected by changes of corresponding proteins. Cell-associated metalloproteinase activities were assessed by type I collagen and α-casein substrate gel zymography (Fig.4). Collagen zymography allowed the detection of enzymatic activities at ∼82–92 and 62–72 kDa that are consistent with latent proforms and active forms of MMP-9 and MMP-2, respectively (Fig. 4A). Activities were high in both cell fractions, and there was no significant difference between lean and obese cells. Note that a similar pattern of activities was observed in gelatin substrate zymography (data not shown). Using α-casein, a preferential substrate for MMP-12 (22Curci J.A. Liao S. Huffman M.D. Shapiro S.D. Thompson R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1900-1910Google Scholar), we showed that S-V cells contained a caseinolytic activity migrating at 22 kDa. The molecular mass of this activity corresponds to that expected for the active form of MMP-12. This activity was detectable only in the non-adipose fraction and was strongly increased in obese cells compared with lean ones (Fig. 4B). Under conditions of sample preparation used here, we did not observe the activity of the proenzyme form of MMP-12. Immunoblot analysis further confirmed the identity of this caseinolytic band as MMP-12 (Fig. 4C). In addition, a prominent ∼30-kDa caseinase was detected in both adipocytes and S-V cells (Fig.4D). Interestingly, this activity was higher in adipocytes from ob/ob mice compared with that of lean mice, suggesting that increase of this activity is adipocyte-specific. Further, the 30-kDa caseinase was inhibited by BB-94 (Fig.4D, lower panel), which is consistent with a metalloproteinase activity. Together, these data confirm at the protein level the overexpression of MMP-12 in obese tissue and allow the observation of a ∼30-kDa metalloproteinase activity in obese adipose tissue. In an effort to understand the role of MMPs in adipose tissue mass formation in vivo, we investigated the expression pattern of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-12, MMP-19, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 during adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (day 0) were induced to differentiate by addition of adipogenic mixture. Adipose conversion was monitored by the analysis of the adipocyte lipid-binding protein aP2 expression. Northern blot analysis showed that MMP-2 is strongly expressed in committed preadipocytes (Fig. 5A). After a strong decline within 1 day after induction of differentiation, expression of MMP-2 was induced at day 2, reached maximal level at day 3, and then returned to a low level at day 6 after induction. In contrast, MMP-19 mRNA level increased throughout the differentiation process, whereas TIMP-1 transcript is highly expressed in preadipocytes and decreased during adipocyte conversion. Expression of MMP-7, MMP-12, and TIMP-3 mRNAs was below the detection level (data not shown). These observations prompted us to examine the effect of pharmacological inhib"

Dose-response studies on gastroprotection in stress and indomethacin-induced ulcer and inhibition of pylorus ligation-induced acid secretion indicate that omeprazole significantly blocks gastric lesions at lower dose (2.5 mg/kg) without inhibiting acid secretion, suggesting an independent mechanism for its antiulcer effect. Time course studies on gastroprotection and acid reduction also indicate that omeprazole almost completely blocks lesions at 1 h when acid inhibition is partial. The severity of lesions correlates well with the increased level of endogenous hydroxyl radical (⋅OH), which when scavenged by dimethyl sulfoxide causes around 90% reduction of the lesions, indicating that ⋅OH plays a major role in gastric damage. Omeprazole blocks stress-induced increased generation of ⋅OH and associated lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, indicating that its antioxidant role plays a major part in preventing oxidative damage. Omeprazole also prevents stress-induced DNA fragmentation, suggesting its antiapoptotic role to block cell death during ulceration. The oxidative damage of DNA by ⋅OH generated in vitro is also protected by omeprazole or its analogue, lansoprazole. Lansoprazole when incubated in a ⋅OH-generating system scavenges⋅OH to produce four oxidation products of which the major one in mass spectroscopy shows a molecular ion peak atm/z 385, which is 16 mass units higher than that of lansoprazole (m/z 369). The product shows no additional aromatic proton signal for aromatic hydroxylation in 1H NMR. The product absorbing at 278 nm shows no alkaline shift for phenols, thereby excluding the formation of hydroxylansoprazole. The product is assigned to lansoprazole sulfone formed by the addition of one oxygen atom at the sulfur center following attack by the ⋅OH. Thus, omeprazole plays a significant role in gastroprotection by acting as a potent antioxidant and antiapoptotic molecule.

Clin. Ther. 2000; 22: 266-280Google Scholar) such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole are extensively used for therapeutic control of acid-related disorders including gastroesophageal reflux disease and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and for peptic-ulcer disease caused by stress (stress-related erosive syndrome), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and Helicobacter pylori infection (2Langtry H.D. Wilde M.I. Drugs. 1998; 56: 447-486Google Scholar, 3Garnett W.R. Ann. Pharmacother. 1996; 30: 1425-1436Google Scholar, 4Zimmermann A.E. Katona B.G. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 308-326Google Scholar, 5Wolfe M.M. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: S9-S31Google Scholar). These compounds share a common structural motif contributed by a substituted pyridylmethylsulfinyl benzimidazole (Fig.1). Inhibition of gastric acid secretion by these compounds is considered to be an important step to control the disorders (6Sachs G. Shin J.M. Besancon M. Prinz C. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 7 (Suppl. 1): 4-12Google Scholar). Proton pump inhibitors inhibit acid secretion by irreversibly interacting with the H+-K+-ATPase, the terminal proton pump of the parietal cell (7Fellenius I. Berglindh T. Sachs G. Olbe L. Elander B. Sjostrand S.B. Wallmark B. Nature. 1981; 290: 159-161Google Scholar, 8Sachs G. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 22-37Google Scholar). In the acid space of the secreting parietal cell or in the vicinity of the enzyme, these compounds are converted to thiophilic sulfenamide or sulfenic acid, which reacts mainly with the Cys-813 residue in the catalytic subunit of the H+-K+-ATPase, which is critical for enzyme inactivation (5Wolfe M.M. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: S9-S31Google Scholar). Although omeprazole, the primary member of the proton pump inhibitors, has been extensively used to control these disorders (2Langtry H.D. Wilde M.I. Drugs. 1998; 56: 447-486Google Scholar), lansoprazole, the second member of the substituted benzimidazole containing a trifluoroethoxy group, has also been used more recently (4Zimmermann A.E. Katona B.G. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 308-326Google Scholar). The role of acid in gastroduodenal pathogenesis has been extensively studied. Although gastric ulcer patients show normal or reduced level of acid secretion, duodenal ulcer patients usually secrete more acid (9Wolfe M.M. Soll A.H. New Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 1707-1715Google Scholar, 10Feldman M. Richardson C.T. Gastroenterology. 1986; 90: 540-544Google Scholar). In fact, “no acid, no ulcer” is the dictum for duodenal ulcer. Because 30% of patients having duodenal ulcer and very few patients with gastric ulcer are hyperchlorohydric (9Wolfe M.M. Soll A.H. New Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 1707-1715Google Scholar), clearly factors other than acid are involved in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal ulcer. Although the secreted acid itself is not sufficient for ulcer formation, its corrosive property and increased peptic activity is sufficient to aggravate the ulcer. Even the normal rate of acid secretion may cause ulceration in the breached mucosa when some gastroprotective factors are lost. Hence, acid suppression by omeprazole is a common practice to control gastroduodenal lesions (2Langtry H.D. Wilde M.I. Drugs. 1998; 56: 447-486Google Scholar,5Wolfe M.M. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: S9-S31Google Scholar). Suppression of intragastric acid also helps in the healing of ulcer (11Burget D.W. Chiverton S.G. Hunt P.H. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 345-351Google Scholar). In animals, the role of acid in gastric lesions has been studied using some animal models such as stress or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced gastric ulcer. Stress itself inhibits gastric acid secretion through a central nervous reflex mechanism (12Esplugues J.V. Barrachina M.D. Beltran B. Calatayud S. Whittle B.J.R. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14839-14844Google Scholar). Restraint cold stress or restraint water immersion stress induces gastric lesions, which are associated with a decreased or normal level of acid secretion (13Das D. Banerjee R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 115-125Google Scholar, 14Hayase M. Takeuchi K. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1986; 31: 166-171Google Scholar). Because restraint or water immersion stress significantly decreases acid secretion induced by pylorus ligation (14Hayase M. Takeuchi K. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1986; 31: 166-171Google Scholar), acid plays a minor role in stress ulcer. Administration of antacids to neutralize secreted acid does not protect stress ulcer (15Cho C.H. Ogle C.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1979; 55: 23-33Google Scholar), suggesting that factors other than acid are involved in ulcer formation. However, in indomethacin-induced gastric damage, acidity may be increased because of decreased biosynthesis of prostaglandin (16Arai I. Hirose H. Usuki C. Muramatsu M. Aihara H. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1987; 57: 313-327Google Scholar,17Evbuomwan M.I. Bolarinwa Y. Afr. J. Med. Sci. 1993; 22: 29-31Google Scholar). Because acidity as high as 0.6 m HCl can experimentally produce gastric lesions (18Larsson H. Mattson H. Sundell G. Carlsson E. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1985; 20 (Suppl. 108): 23-35Google Scholar), mild irritants like 0.35m HCl prevents gastric damage caused by stronger necrotizing agent through “adaptive cytoprotection” mediated by increased formation of prostaglandin (19Robert A. Nezamis J.E. Lancaster C. Davies J.P. Field S.O. Hanchar A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: G113-G121Google Scholar). It is now generally agreed that gastric lesions develop when the delicate balance between some gastroprotective and aggressive factors is lost. Although the cellular and molecular basis of gastric mucosal defense against gastrodamaging factors are known (20Wallace J.L. Granger D.N. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 731-740Google Scholar), the mechanism of mucosal damage by the aggressive factors is not fully clear today. Stress (13Das D. Banerjee R.K. Mol. Cell.

Pharmacol. 1999; 50: 695-710Google Scholar) cause mucosal damage through a number of mechanisms, of which some reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 such as O2⨪and ⋅OH are now considered to be one of the major causative factors for mucosal lesions through oxidative damage (13Das D.

Banerjee R.K. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 501-513Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation, an important parameter for ⋅OH-induced oxidative damage of membrane, is increased in gastric lesions caused by ethanol (35Pihan G. Regillo C. Szabo S. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1987; 32: 1395-1401Google Scholar), indomethacin (29Yoshikawa T. Naito Y. Kishi A. Tomii T. Kancko T. Iinuma S. Ichikawa H. Yasuda M. Takahashi S. Kondo M. Gut. 1993; 34: 732-737Google Scholar), and water immersion stress (36Yoshikawa T. Miyagawa H. Yoshida N. Sugino S. Kondo M. J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 1986; 1: 271-277Google Scholar). Increased lipid peroxidation, increased protein oxidation, and decreased glutathione level are also evident in restraint cold stress-induced gastric lesions as a result of oxidative damage caused by the significant generation of ⋅OH (13Das D. Banerjee R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 115-125Google Scholar, 22Das D. Bandyopadhyay D. Bhattacharjee M. Banerjee R.K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 8-18Google Scholar, 37Das D. Bandyopadhyay D. Banerjee R.K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 460-469Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidative damage of membrane lipid and protein and depletion of glutathione have also recently been reported in human gastric ulcer (32Bhattacharjee M. Bhattacharjee S. Gupta A. Banerjee R.K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 731-743Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radical is generated from O2⨪ and H2O2 in presence of a trace amount of transition metal (released from protein by acidosis caused by ischemia) by Haber-Weiss reaction (38Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Google Scholar) following alteration of the antioxidant enzymes of the gastric mucosa (13Das D. Banerjee R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 115-125Google Scholar, 22Das D. Bandyopadhyay D. Bhattacharjee M. Banerjee R.K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 8-18Google Scholar, 32Bhattacharjee M. Bhattacharjee S. Gupta A.

Bandyopadhyay D. Banerjee R.K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 460-469Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicate that programmed cell death or apoptosis plays a significant role in gastric ulceration. Gastric mucosal lesions caused by stress, indomethacin, ethanol, and H. pylori are also due to increased cell death by apoptosis (39–51). Apoptosis is promoted because of an imbalance between the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic protein and apoptotic Bax protein in stress ulcer (39Konturek P.C. Brzozowski T. Konturek S.J. Pajdo R.

Int. 1997; 42: 247-254Google Scholar). Induction of tumor necrosis factor-α and release of cytochrome c to activate caspase-3-like protease are involved in apoptotic cell death in indomethacin ulcer (41Slomiany B.L. Piotrowski J. Slomiany A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 32: 638-642Google Scholar, 42Fuji Y. Matsura T. Kai M. Matsui H. Kawasaki H. Yamada K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Yasuda M. Miwa T. Koga Y. Gut. 1999; 44: 456-462Google Scholar). Apoptosis also occurs because of nitric oxide production through induction of nitric-oxide synthase by H. pylori (45Watanabe S. Takagi A. Koga A. Kamiya S. Miwa T. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2000; 15: 168-174Google Scholar). Involvement of ROS and oxidative damage of DNA and DNA fragmentation have also been evident in apoptotic cell death in gastric mucosal injury (39Konturek P.C. Brzozowski T. Konturek S.J. Pajdo R.

Although omeprazole is believed to offer its antiulcer activity through acid suppression (1Horn J. Clin. Ther. 2000; 22: 266-280Google Scholar, 2Langtry H.D. Wilde M.I. Drugs. 1998; 56: 447-486Google Scholar, 5Wolfe M.M. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: S9-S31Google Scholar) by inactivating the H+-K+-ATPase (5Wolfe M.M. Sachs G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: S9-S31Google Scholar, 7Fellenius I. Berglindh T. Sachs G. Olbe L. Elander B. Sjostrand S.B. Wallmark B. Nature. 1981; 290: 159-161Google Scholar, 8Sachs G. Pharmacotherapy. 1997; 17: 22-37Google Scholar, 52Wallmark B. Larsson H. Humble L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13681-13684Google Scholar), very little is known regarding its role in controlling oxidative damage and apoptotic cell death of the gastric mucosa during ulceration. The role of acid suppression effect of omeprazole on gastroprotection against some necrotizing agents (ethanol, acidified aspirin, hypertonic saline, 0.6m HCl) has been studied earlier (18Larsson H. Mattson H. Sundell G. Carlsson E. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1985; 20 (Suppl. 108): 23-35Google Scholar, 53Mattsson H. Andersson K. Larsson H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 91: 111-114Google Scholar), where evidence has been provided to show that acid inhibition plays no significant role on the gastroprotective effect of omeprazole. Moreover, omeprazole neither stimulates prostaglandin biosynthesis nor increases bicarbonate secretion to offer gastroprotection (18Larsson H. Mattson H. Sundell G. Carlsson E. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1985; 20 (Suppl. 108): 23-35Google Scholar, 53Mattsson H. Andersson K. Larsson H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 91: 111-114Google Scholar). Thus, omeprazole exerts its antiulcer activity through some other mechanism that has not been explored yet. Using animal models of stress and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions and pylorus ligation-induced acid secretion, evidence has been presented in this paper to show that the gastroprotective effect of omeprazole is not mediated through its acid inhibitory effect. Further evidence has been presented to show that endogenous ⋅OH plays one of the major roles in gastric lesions and that omeprazole acts as a potent antioxidant to scavenge the endogenous ⋅OH, thereby preventing the oxidative damage by increased lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation. Moreover, it offers an antiapoptotic effect by blocking DNA fragmentation during ulceration. Evidence has also been presented to show that omeprazole or lansoprazole blocks ⋅OH-induced oxidative damage of DNA by scavenging ⋅OH in vitro. Analysis of the major oxidation product of lansoprazole indicates that this antioxidant activity is due to scavenging of ⋅OH to form an oxygenated product that is assigned to lansoprazole sulfone. The studies thus provide new insights on the mechanism of the antiulcer effect of proton pump inhibitors. Omeprazole was a kind gift from Dr. W. Beil (Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany). Lansoprazole, melatonin, α-phenyl N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN), thiobarbituric acid, ethidium bromide, ascorbic acid, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, collagenase type 1A, Pronase E, proteinase K, RNase, catalase, guanidine HCl, Fast Blue BB salt, tetraethoxypropane, benzenesulfinic acid, and 5,5- dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were purchased from Sigma. Desferrioxamine was obtained from Ciba Geigy Ltd. Vitamin E (α-tocopheryl acetate), Me2SO, and TLC plates coated with silica gel 60 F254 were procured from Merck. Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250g) of both control and experimental groups kept separately in controlled condition were fasted for 24 h with water ad libitum. The control group received the vehicle only while the experimental group received omeprazole intraperitoneally 30 min prior to restraint cold stress or indomethacin administration for gastric ulceration or pylorus ligation for acid secretion. Animal experiments (n = 8–30) were carried out following the guidelines of the animal ethics committee of the institute. Human gastric mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained from the Cancer Centre Welfare Home and Research Institute (Kolkata, India) following approval by the human ethics committee of the institute. The rats were immobilized under light ether anesthesia and subjected to cold (4 ± 1 °C) stress for 3.5 h (13Das D. Banerjee R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 115-125Google Scholar). The severity of mucosal lesions was scored as ulcer index as follows: 0 = no pathology; 1 = a small ulcer (1–2 mm); 2 = a medium ulcer (3–4 mm); 4 = a large ulcer (5–6 mm); and 8 = larger ulcer (>6 mm). The sum of the total scores divided by the number of animals was expressed as the mean ulcer index (13Das D. Banerjee R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 115-125Google Scholar). Luminal acid content was determined by titration with 1 mm NaOH using an autoburette pH stat system from Radiometer (Copenhagen, Denmark) (13Das D. Banerjee R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 115-125Google Scholar). The rats were orally fed with indomethacin at 48 mg/kg of body weight. After 4 h, the animals were killed, and gastric lesions in the mucosa (54Morise Z. Komatsu S. Fuseler J.W. Granger D.N. Perry M. Issekutz A.C. Grisham M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G246-G252Google Scholar) were scored and expressed as ulcer index as follows: 0 = no pathology; 1 = one pinhead ulcer. The sum of the total scores divided by the number of animals gives the ulcer index. Hypersecretion was induced in rats by pylorus ligation (55Shay H. Sun D.C. Gruenstein A. Gastroenterology. 1954; 26: 906-913Google Scholar) under light anesthesia with ketamin (12 mg/kg of body weight). The animals were killed 2.5 h after ligation, and the clarified gastric fluid volume was determined and titrated for acid content with 1 mm NaOH (13Das D. Banerjee R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 125: 115-125Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation products of the mitochondrial membrane fraction of fundic stomach homogenate were determined (22Das D. Bandyopadhyay D. Bhattacharjee M.

The fundic stomach from control, stress-ulcerated, and omeprazole (4 mg/kg)-pretreated stressed rats was homogenized in ice-cold 0.9% saline in a Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer for 45 s to get 5% homogenate. One ml of the mitochondrial membrane fraction obtained after differential centrifugation (22Das D. Bandyopadhyay D. Bhattacharjee M. Banerjee R.K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 8-18Google Scholar) was allowed to react with 2 ml of trichloroacetic acid-thiobarbituric acid-HCl reagent containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene, heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min, cooled, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance determination at 535 nm using tetraethoxypropane as standard. Protein oxidation was measured as carbonyl content (57Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C.N. Amici A. Climent I. Laoz A.G. Ahn B.W. Shaltiel S. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 464-478Google Scholar) in the low speed supernatant of the fundic stomach homogenate (32Bhattacharjee M. Bhattacharjee S. Gupta A. Banerjee R.K. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 731-743Google Scholar). The fundic stomach from control, stress-ulcerated, and omeprazole (8 mg/kg) pretreated stressed rats was homogenized in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer for 45 s to get 10% homogenate. After centrifugation at 600 ×g for 10 min, the proteins from 0.8 ml of the supernatant were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to react with 0.5 ml of 10 mm 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine for 1 h. After precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, the protein was washed thrice with a mixture of ethanol-ethyl acetate (1:1), dissolved in 0.6 ml of a solution containing 6 m guanidine HCl in 20 mm potassium phosphate adjusted to pH 2.3 with trifluoroacetic acid, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for measurement of carbonyl content at 362 nm (ε = 22000m−1 cm−1). Hydroxyl radical generated in the gastric mucosa was measured using Me2SO as⋅OH scavenger (58Babbs D.F. Steiner M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 137-147Google Scholar, 59Bandyopadhyay D. Biswas K.

Bhattacharya K. Banerjee R.K. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 2845-2865Google Scholar). Briefly, the control group was kept at room temperature without any stress after administration (intraperitoneally) of 1 ml of Me2SO. The second group received the same amount of Me2SO 30 min before the onset of restraint cold stress. The third group received omeprazole (8 mg/kg intraperitoneally) 30 min prior to Me2SO administration and were then subjected to stress. After 3.5 h of stress, the animals were killed, and fundic stomach was processed for the extraction of methanesulfinic acid formed by reaction of ⋅OH with Me2SO. Methanesulfinic acid was allowed to react with the Fast Blue BB salt to yield an yellow chromophore that was measured at 425 nm using benzenesulfinic acid as standard. To study DNA fragmentation as an index of apoptosis, DNA was isolated from fundic mucosal surface epithelial cells of normal rats and rats subjected to restraint cold stress without or after pretreatment with omeprazole (8 mg/kg). Fundic mucosa (∼1.5 g) from three animals was scraped, minced separately in PBS-E (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.9% saline and 20 mm EDTA, pH 8), washed twice with PBS-E, and finally suspended in 2 ml of PBS-E containing 0.5 mg/ml collagenase. The suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with stirring, followed by the addition of Pronase E (1 mg/ml), and further incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. It was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was dispersed and incubated with 2 ml of a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl−, pH 8, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, and 1% w/v SDS for 15 min. It was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and DNA was isolated from the lysate by a phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (61Moore D.D. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 2.1.1-2.1.2Google Scholar). DNA was dissolved in 10 mmTris-Cl−, pH 8, containing 1 mm EDTA by gentle shaking at 65 °C. Residual contaminating RNA was removed by incubating the DNA solution with 1 μg/ml DNase-free RNase at 37 °C for 1 h followed by 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K for 3 h. Phenol-chloroform extraction was repeated to obtain purified DNA that was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-Cl− buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mm EDTA. To study DNA fragmentation, DNA was loaded on to a 1.5% agarose gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 100 V for 1.5 h in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8) buffer, and DNA was visualized by UV exposure after staining with ethidium bromide. To study the antioxidant effect of omeprazole or lansoprazole, ⋅OH-mediated oxidative damage of DNA isolated from rat mucosal surface epithelial cells or from human gastric mucosal biopsy specimen was studied in absence or presence of omeprazole or lansoprazole. For isolation of human gastric mucosal DNA, the minced mucosa (1 g) was digested with 12 ml of the digestion buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl−, pH 8.0, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 μg/ml proteinase K, and 1 μg/ml RNase) by incubating in a shaker bath at 52 °C for 15 h. DNA was extracted from the lysate after phenol-chloroform extraction as described (61Moore D.D. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 2.1.1-2.1.2Google Scholar). Rat DNA (∼200 ng) or human DNA (∼300 ng) was incubated in a ⋅OH-generating system containing 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.2 mmCuSO4, and 1 mm ascorbate (59Bandyopadhyay D. Biswas K. Bandyopadhyay U. Reiter R.J. Banerjee R.K. J. Pineal Res. 2000; 29: 143-151Google Scholar) in a total volume of 30 μl for a period of 30 min at 37 °C in presence or absence of omeprazole or lansoprazole. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 μg of catalase, and electrophoresis was carried out in a 2% agarose gel. Hydroxyl radical was generated in vitro in the Cu2+-ascorbate system (59Bandyopadhyay D. Biswas K. Bandyopadhyay U. Reiter R.J. Banerjee R.K. J.

https://openalex.org/W2119589189,"TRPM2 is a member of the melastatin-related TRP (transient receptor potential) subfamily. It is expressed in brain and lymphocytes and forms a cation channel that is activated by intracellular ADP-ribose and associated with cell death. In this study we investigated the calcium dependence of human TRPM2 expressed under a tetracycline-dependent promoter in HEK-293 cells. TRPM2 expression was associated with enhanced hydrogen peroxide-evoked intracellular calcium signals. In whole-cell patch clamp recordings, switching from barium- to calcium-containing extracellular solution markedly activated TRPM2 as long as ADP-ribose was in the patch pipette and exogenous intracellular calcium buffering was minimal. We suggest this effect reveals a critical dependence of TRPM2 channel activity on intracellular calcium. In the absence of extracellular calcium we observed concentration-dependent activation of TRPM2 channels by calcium delivered from the patch pipette (EC<sub>50</sub> 340 nm, slope 4.9); the maximum effect was at least as large as that evoked by extracellular calcium. Intracellular dialysis of cells with high concentrations of EGTA or 1,2-bis(o-Aminophenoxy)ethane-<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>′,<i>N</i>′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) strongly reduced the amplitude of the extracellular calcium response, and the residual response was abolished by a mixture of high and low affinity calcium buffers. TRPM2 channel currents in inside-out patches showed a strong requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the intracellular face of the membrane. We suggest that calcium entering via TRPM2 proteins acts at an intracellular calcium sensor closely associated with the channel, providing essential positive feedback for channel activation."

An increasing number of enzymes and metabolic pathways have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance. However, the primary cellular cause of insulin resistance remains uncertain. Proteome analysis can quantitate a large number of proteins and their post-translational modifications simultaneously and is a powerful tool to study polygenic diseases like type 2 diabetes. Using this approach on human skeletal muscle biopsies, we have identified eight potential protein markers for type 2 diabetes in the fasting state. The observed changes in protein expression indicate increased cellular stress, e.g. up-regulation of two heat shock proteins, and perturbations in ATP (re)synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism, e.g. down-regulation of ATP synthase β-subunit and creatine kinase B, in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 diabetes. Phosphorylation appears to play a key, potentially coordinating role for most of the proteins identified in this study. In particular, we demonstrated that the catalytic β-subunit of ATP synthase is phosphorylated in vivo and that the levels of a down-regulated ATP synthase β-subunit phosphoisoform in diabetic muscle correlated inversely with fasting plasma glucose levels. These data suggest a role for phosphorylation of ATP synthase β-subunit in the regulation of ATP synthesis and that alterations in the regulation of ATP synthesis and cellular stress proteins may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

Furthermore, insulin stimulation of glucose oxidation and suppression of lipid oxidation is significantly impaired in patients with T2DM (2Eriksson J. Franssila-Kallunki A. Ekstrand A. Saloranta C.

Diabetologia. 1991; 34: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the basal, fasting state increased glucose oxidation and reduced lipid oxidation is seen in skeletal muscle of insulin resistant subjects, whether caused by T2DM or obesity alone (4Kelley D.E. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). These defects suggest an impaired capacity to switch between carbohydrate and fat as oxidative energy sources in insulin-resistant subjects. Together with reports of reduced oxidative enzyme activity and dysfunction of mitochondria in skeletal muscle of patients with T2DM (4Kelley D.E. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 5He J. Watkins S. Kelley D.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 6Kelley D.E. He J.

Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 277: E1-E10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That rates of fuel oxidation and mitochondrial function can affect glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis has been reported earlier (12Bashan N. Burdett E. Guma A. Sargeant R. Tumiati L. Liu Z.

In addition, both chronic activation of AMPK and induced expression of the transcriptional co-activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, PGC-1, result in improved mitochondrial biogenesis concomitant with increases in GLUT4 protein content in skeletal muscle (14Winder W.W.

The reduction in oxidative enzyme capacity in patients with T2DM could be attributed to an increased proportion of glycolytic, type 2 muscle fibers (17Gaster M. Staehr P. Beck-Nielsen H. Schrøder H.D. Handberg A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1324-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, reduced oxidative enzyme capacity seems to be equally present in all muscle fiber types in patients with T2DM (5He J. Watkins S. Kelley D.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). An increasing number of enzymes and metabolic pathways has been suggested to be involved in the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance in T2DM. Therefore, there is a growing demand for techniques able to evaluate proteins from many signaling and metabolic pathways simultaneously. The recently introduced technique of proteome analysis, high resolution two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis followed by protein identification using mass spectrometry (MS) and data base searching, offers the possibility to study a large number of proteins and their post-translational modifications simultaneously (18Fey S.J. Larsen P.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the past, primarily defects in the insulin-stimulated state have been studied. However, as discussed above, there are several reasons to look at T2DM as a phenotype described by poor adaptations to fasting conditions, as well (4Kelley D.E. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). To identify protein markers of T2DM in the fasting state, we compared the protein expression profile in skeletal muscle from obese patients with T2DM and age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects using the methods of quantitative proteome analysis. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee and was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Muscle samples were obtained from 10 patients with T2DM and 10 healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects. Five patients with T2DM were treated by diet alone, and five patients were treated by low doses of either sulfonylurea or metformin. These drugs were withdrawn 1 week prior to the study. The patients were all GAD65 antibody-negative and without signs of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, or macrovascular complications. All subjects had normal results on screening blood tests of hepatic and renal function. The control subjects had normal glucose tolerance and no family history of diabetes. Participants were instructed to avoid vigorous exercise for 48 h before the study, which was carried out after a 10-h overnight fast. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for glucose (Glucose Analyzer II; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), free fatty acids (FFA) (Wako Chemicals Gmbh, Neuss, Germany), insulin, and C-peptide (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). Percutaneous needle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle under local anesthesia using a biopsy pistol, and the muscle specimens (∼25 mg) were immediately blotted free of blood, fat, and connective tissue and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen muscle samples were homogenized for 25 min in 100 μl of ice-cold DNase/RNase buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 30 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 25 μg/ml RNase A, 25 μg/ml DNase I (Worthington, Freehold, NJ)). After homogenization, the samples were lyophilized overnight and then dissolved in 120 μl of lysis buffer (7 m urea (ICN Biomedicals), 2 m thiourea (Fluka), 2% CHAPS (Sigma), 0.4% dithiothreitol (Sigma), 0.5% Pharmalyte 3–10, and 0.5% Pharmalyte 6–11 (Amersham Biosciences) by shaking overnight. The homogenization was carried out in a buffer without kinase and phosphatase inhibitors (salts) to avoid destruction of the first dimensional gels. As this step was carried out at 0–4 °C, we assumed the activity of potential kinases and phosphatases to be very low and that the phosphorylation state of most proteins was stable. To confirm this, we have, after the present study, performed similar 2-D gels, in which the muscle specimens were solubilized directly in the lysis buffer for running the first dimensional gel. The pattern of the proteins on these 2-D gels and in particular the relative abundance of the different phosphoisoforms identified by MS showed no difference from the 2-D gels presented in this study. The protein concentration in the muscle samples was determined using the Bradford method, which was adopted for use with lysis buffer as described before (19Fey S.J. Nawrocki A. Larsen M.R. Gorg A. Roepstorff P. Skews G.N. Williams R. Larsen P.M. Electrophoresis. 1997; 8: 1361-1372Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). First dimension gel electrophoresis was performed on IPG covering the pH range from 4 to 7 (AmershamBiosciences). Rehydration buffer for IPG 4–7 strips was identical with lysis buffer used for sample preparation, and the sample was applied by in-gel rehydration. 400 μg of protein were loaded on each gel. Focusing was performed on a Multiphor II at 20 °C using a voltage/time profile linearly increasing from 0 to 600 V for 2.25 h, from 600 to 3500 V for 1 h, and 3500 V for 13.5 h. After focusing, strips were equilibrated twice, each for 15 min in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 2% SDS, 30% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1% dithiothreitol). Gels were frozen at −80 °C between the equilibration steps. SDS-PAGE second dimension was performed using the ProteanTM II Multi Cell 2-D electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad) and laboratory-made single percentage gels (12.5% acrylamide; acrylamide:N,N′-ethylene-bis-acrylamide ratio was 200:1). The gels were run overnight at 20 °C at constant current. Running buffer was recirculated to maintain pH, SDS, temperature, and salt concentrations. After the second dimension, skeletal muscle proteins were visualized using a silver-staining method as described (19Fey S.J. Nawrocki A. Larsen M.R. Gorg A. Roepstorff P. Skews G.N. Williams R. Larsen P.M. Electrophoresis. 1997; 8: 1361-1372Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All gel images were analyzed by the same person using a Bio Image computer program (version 6.1; Bob Luton, Ann Arbor, MI). For comparison we have used 2-D gels from six subjects in the control group and nine subjects in the diabetes group (Table I). The remaining gels revealed that some protein degradation had occurred, and therefore these gels were excluded from the analysis. The expression of each protein was measured and expressed as its percentage integrated optical density (%IOD) (a percentage of the sum of all the pixel gray level values on and within the boundary of the spot in question compared with that of all detected spots). Images from each group were then matched, edited, and compared statistically. The average value of spot %IOD and S.D. were calculated for each protein in each group and then compared using the two-sided Student's t test. Protein spots whose expression was found different between the two groups at the significance level of p < 0.05 were selected for further analysis. For correlation analysis Spearman's rho was used.Table IFasting characteristics of study subjectsControl groupDiabetic grouppn69Duration of diabetes1.1 ± 0.4Age (years)46.1 ± 1.544.8 ± 1.5NSBody mass index (kg/m2)25.7 ± 1.233.3 ± 1.90.01Male/female3/35/4NSCholesterol (mmol/l)5.1 ± 0.45.9 ± 0.4NSHbA1c5.3 ± 0.16.6 ± 0.40.02Glucose (mmol/l)5.3 ± 0.18.5 ± 0.70.002FFA (mmol/l)0.28 ± 0.040.44 ± 0.08NSInsulin (pmol/l)37 ± 1193 ± 120.005C-peptide (pmol/l)575 ± 1201195 ± 930.001 Open table in a new tab Proteins of interest were cut out from the gels and, after in-gel digestion, analyzed by mass spectrometry using a Bruker REFLEX matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (19Fey S.J.

The mass spectra obtained were internally calibrated using trypsin autodigestion peptides, and the masses were used to search the NCBI data base using the ProFound, FindPept, and FindMod programs (www.proteometrics.com). Data base searches were performed using the following attributes with minor modification needed for each program: all species, no restrictions for molecular weight and protein pI, trypsin digest, one missed cleavage allowed, cysteines modified by acrylamide, and oxidation of methionines possible, mass tolerance between 0.1 and 0.5 Da. Identification was considered positive when at least five peptides matched the protein with no sequence overlap.

Myoblasts were grown in 12-wells plates, and growing cell medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum 1 day before the labeling experiment. Prior to labeling, cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 2.5 h. Phosphate groups in proteins of human myoblasts were labeled biosynthetically by incubating them in 300 μl of serum-free phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN Biomedicals) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 300 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (AmershamBiosciences) for 2.5 h. Immediately after, labeling medium was removed, and cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer as described above. Determination of [32P]orthophosphate incorporation into myoblast proteins was performed using trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described (19Fey S.J. Nawrocki A. Larsen M.R. Gorg A. Roepstorff P. Skews G.N. Williams R. Larsen P.M. Electrophoresis. 1997; 8: 1361-1372Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 2-D gel electrophoresis was run as described above loading a cell lysate volume corresponding to 4 × 105 cpm on the gel. [32P]labeled proteins of myoblasts were visualized by exposing dried gels to phosphorimaging plates (AGFA). Using computerized image analysis 489 spots in each gel image were matched and quantitated. Fifteen protein spots were expressed at statistically significant different levels in the two groups (Fig.1). These potential protein markers of T2DM were excised from the 2-D gels for identification by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Eleven of these protein spots were positively identified: three metabolic enzymes, two heat shock proteins, and different isoforms of three structural proteins (TableII). Of the metabolic enzymes, ATP synthase β-subunit (ATPsynβ) and creatine kinase, brain isoform (CK-B) were significantly down-regulated, whereas phosphoglucomutase-1 (PGM-1) was significantly up-regulated in skeletal muscle of patients with T2DM. Heat shock protein (HSP) 90β and 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) were both significantly up-regulated in diabetic muscle. Of the structural proteins, four isoforms of α-1 chain of type VI collagen (α1(VI) collagen) and one isoenzyme of myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MRLC2-B) were significantly up-regulated, whereas another isoenzyme of myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MRLC2-A) was significantly down-regulated in diabetic muscle.Table IIProtein markers of type 2 diabetes in skeletal muscle identified by MALDI-TOF MS analysisSpot no.ProteinDatabase accession no.Theoretical pl/mWSequence coverageMatched peptidesControl groupDiabetic groupp%%IOD ± S.E.180ATP synthase β-subunitP065765.0/5256190.56 ± 0.050.41 ± 0.030.01295Myosin regulatory light chain 2 (A)P109164.9/195891.26 ± 0.100.92 ± 0.100.03541Creatine kinase BP122775.3/4342120.32 ± 0.040.20 ± 0.020.0410Collagen α1(VI) chainP121095.3/11010100.06 ± 0.010.09 ± 0.010.0411Collagen α1(VI) chainP121095.3/110550.04 ± 0.000.06 ± 0.010.02407Collagen α1(VI) chainP121095.3/110660.05 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.010.03520Collagen α1(VI) chainP121095.3/110650.06 ± 0.010.09 ± 0.010.0281Heat shock protein 90βP082385.0/8415110.03 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.000.02375Glucose-regulated protein 78P110214.9/7828120.06 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.010.02445Myosin regulatory light chain 2 (B)AAK527974.9/195270.30 ± 0.080.69 ± 0.120.03456Phosphoglucomutase 1P368716.2/6225120.14 ± 0.040.28 ± 0.040.03 Open table in a new tab In the diabetic group the levels of ATPsynβ (spot 180) and CK-B (spot 541) correlated negatively with fasting plasma glucose values (r = −0.75; p < 0.05) and (r = −0.82; p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas the levels of α1(VI) collagen (spot 11) correlated positively with fasting plasma glucose values (r = 0.67;p < 0.05). Furthermore, the levels of ATPsynβ (spot 180) correlated positively with the levels of CK-B (spot 541) (r = 0.71; p < 0.05) (Fig.2 C) and negatively with the levels of α1(VI) collagen (spot 11) (r = −0.72; p < 0.05) in the diabetic group. In contrast, in the control group the levels of ATPsynβ (spot 180) correlated negatively with fasting FFA values (r = −0.81; p < 0.05) rather than fasting plasma glucose values (Fig. 2 D), and the levels of PGM-1 (spot 456) correlated positively with insulin (r = 0.95; p < 0.01). No other correlations among glucose, FFA, insulin, or C-peptide levels and the identified potential protein markers of T2DM were observed in the two groups. In particular, none of these protein markers correlated with body mass index either in the entire study population or within the study groups. CK-B, HSP 90β, GRP78, PGM-1, and MRLC2 have been reported previously (22Hemmer W. Skarli M. Perriard J.C. Wallimann T.

Several of the identified protein spots were located within a row of three-six protein spots with the same molecular weight indicating multiple post-translational modifications (possibly phosphorylation) of the same protein (Fig. 1). These protein spots were excised and subjected to MALDI-MS analysis. Two additional isoforms of HSP 90β, GRP78, PGM-1, α1(VI) collagen, MRLC2-A, and MRLC2-B and three additional isoforms of ATPsynβ were positively identified (Fig.3). Calculation of sums of expression of the different isoforms of each protein marker showed that the sum of expression of HSP 90β, GRP78, α1(VI) collagen, and ATPsynβ were significantly up- or down-regulated in the same direction as the protein markers (Table III). This was also the case with the sum of expression of MRLC2-A and MRLC2-B, although these differences did not reach statistical significance (Table III). The relative abundance of the down-regulated ATPsynβ isoform (spot 180) was significantly reduced in muscle of patients with T2DM, as well (p = 0.03), indicating a role for post-translational modification of this protein. Interestingly, in the diabetic group the sum of expression of ATPsynβ and α1(VI) collagen correlated significantly with fasting plasma glucose values (r = −0.76 and r = 0.70;p < 0.05, respectively), and the sum of expression of ATPsynβ correlated significantly with the sum of expression of α1(VI) collagen (r = −0.87; p < 0.01).Table IIISum of expression of protein markers isoformsProteinControl groupDiabetic group%IOD ± S.E.ATP synthase β-subunit2.28 ± 0.161.86 ± 0.10ap < 0.05 vs. control.Myosin regulatory light chain 2 (A)3.67 ± 0.213.16 ± 0.29Collagen α1(VI) chain0.29 ± 0.040.43 ± 0.03ap < 0.05 vs. control.Heat shock protein 90β0.09 ± 0.010.13 ± 0.01ap < 0.05 vs. control.Glucose-regulated protein 780.13 ± 0.010.17 ± 0.01ap < 0.05 vs. control.Myosin regulatory light chain 2 (B)3.64 ± 0.214.77 ± 0.67a p < 0.05 vs. control. Open table in a new tab The identification of four isoforms of ATPsynβ with identical molecular weights but different pI values, suggested that ATPsynβ is also phosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 3). To further characterize the modification of ATP synthase β-subunit, we carried out 2-D gel electrophoresis of [32P]labeled human skeletal muscle cells (myoblasts) in culture. These 2-D gels revealed that all four identified ATPsynβ isoforms are in fact phosphorylated isoforms (Fig.4 A) and that a putative non-modified variant was below the level of detection by silver staining. MALDI-MS analysis and data base searching for phosphopeptides from the tryptic digest of the three most basic phosphoisoforms of ATPsynβ, including the down-regulated ATPsynβ spot (180), demonstrated the presence of a phosphorylated residue most likely at position Thr-213 in the nucleotide-binding domain of ATPsynβ (Fig. 4,B and C). Tyrosine sulfation may give rise to the same pattern on 2-D gels and the same increase in peptide mass (80 Da) as phosphorylation. However, according to the consensus features of a tyrosine sulfation site, such sites are not present in the sequence of ATPsynβ. The [32P]labeling of all four ATPsynβ isoforms and the MS data therefore indicate that ATPsynβ is regulated by multi-site phosphorylation. Using the methods of proteome analysis we have identified and characterized eight potential protein markers of T2DM in skeletal muscle in the fasting state. Although proteome analysis is somewhat limited by narrow dynamic ranges of silver staining and difficulties in MS identification of low abundant proteins recovered from fixed and or stained gels, it is the only technique that provides the possibility to quantitatively study global changes in expression profile of proteins, as well as certain post-translational protein modifications in a given cell or tissue. Because of the method of sample preparation used in this study the interpretation of the relative abundance of the specific protein marker phosphoisoforms should be done with some caution. However, in the present study MS identification of ∼75% of the protein markers and several additional isoforms demonstrates that combined 2-D gel and MS technology can be powerful tools for the study of molecular processes underlying a complex disease such as T2DM. Our findings indicate that the catalytic β-subunit of F1-ATP synthase is regulated by phosphorylation and that the expression and phosphorylation of ATPsynβ might be altered in skeletal muscle of patients with T2DM. Because there is no report to date on the phosphorylation of human ATPsynβ it is uncertain how such post-translational modification interacts with the proposed binding-change model for ATP synthesis, in which conformational changes in the nucleotide-binding sites of the three β-subunits are coupled to the catalytic activity of F1-ATP synthase (27Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). That phosphorylation of human ATPsynβ may play a role for the catalytic activity of F1-ATP synthase is suggested by the recent observation that phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding 14–3-3 proteins were found to be associated with mitochondrial ATP synthase in plants in a phosphorylation-dependent manner through direct interaction with the β-subunit of F1-ATP synthase and that the activity of ATP synthase was reduced by recombinant 14–3-3 protein (28Bunney T.D. van Walraven H.S. de Boer A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4249-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Consistent with the reduced expression of ATPsynβ in our study, several other studies argue for a lower ATP synthase activity in diabetic muscle. Thus, gene expression of several subunits from the other four complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain were found to be decreased in skeletal muscle of streptozotocin-diabetic mice (29Yechoor V.K. Patti M. Saccone R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10587-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and during fasting conditions reduced activity of cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase activity, as well as reduced overall activity of the respiratory chain, have been demonstrated in skeletal muscle of patients with T2DM (4Kelley D.E.

Moreover, mutations in mtDNA can, via impaired oxidative phosphorylation, cause T2DM, with both muscle insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion (7Gebhart S. Shoffner J.M. Koontz D. Kaufmann A. Wallace D. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 526-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar). Indeed, decreased ATP synthase activity and increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported in hybrids constructed from mitochondria of patients with T2DM (9Anderson C.M. Drug. Dev. Res. 1999; 46: 67-79Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, whether the down-regulation of a specific ATPsynβ phosphoisoform is a mechanism to maintain normal activity despite reduced total levels of ATPsynβ or whether it reflects an altered activity of ATPsynβ per se warrants further studies. Endurance training up-regulates ATPsynβ protein levels in soleus muscle of rats (30González B. Hernando R."

https://openalex.org/W2004275852,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major malignancy in many parts of the world, especially in Asia and Africa. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the long arm of chromosome 13 has been reported in HCC. In search of tumor suppressor genes in this region, here we have identified DLC2 (for deleted inliver cancer 2) at 13q12.3 encoding a novel Rho family GTPase-activating protein (GAP). DLC2mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues but was significantly underexpressed in 18% (8/45) of human HCCs.DLC2 is homologous to DLC1, a previously identified tumor suppressor gene at 8p22-p21.3 frequently deleted in HCC. DLC2 encodes a novel protein with a RhoGAP domain, a SAM (sterile α motif) domain related to p73/p63, and a lipid-binding StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain. Biochemical analysis indicates that DLC2 protein has GAP activity specific for small GTPases RhoA and Cdc42. Expression of the GAP domain of DLC2 sufficiently inhibits the Rho-mediated formation of actin stress fibers. Introduction of human DLC2 into mouse fibroblasts suppresses Ras signaling and Ras-induced cellular transformation in a GAP-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings suggest a role for DLC2 in growth suppression and hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2127212851,"Ghrelin is a 28-residue peptide hormone that is principally released from the stomach during fasting and prior to eating. Two forms are present in human plasma: the unmodified peptide and a less abundant acylated version, in which octanoic acid is attached to the third residue, a serine, via an ester linkage. The acylated form of ghrelin acts as a ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor and can stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. It also initiates behavioral and metabolic adaptations to fasting. Here we show that an immobilized form of ghrelin specifically binds a species of high density lipoprotein associated with the plasma esterase, paraoxonase, and clusterin. Both free ghrelin and paraoxon, a substrate for paraoxonase, can inhibit this interaction. An endogenous species of ghrelin is found to co-purify with high density lipoprotein during density gradient centrifugation and subsequent gel filtration. This interaction links the orexigenic peptide hormone ghrelin to lipid transport and metabolism. Furthermore, the interaction of the esterified hormone ghrelin with a species of HDL containing an esterase suggests a possible mechanism for the conversion of ghrelin to des-acyl ghrelin.

Furthermore, the interaction of the esterified hormone ghrelin with a species of HDL containing an esterase suggests a possible mechanism for the conversion of ghrelin to des-acyl ghrelin. Ghrelin is a peptide hormone that was purified from the stomach that can cause the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland (1Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Google Scholar). It has subsequently been found that ghrelin is predominantly released from the stomach prior to feeding (2Cummings D.E. Purnell J.Q. Frayo R.S. Schmidova K. Wisse B.E. Weigle D.S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1714-1719Google Scholar), although other tissues have been shown to express the gene as well (3Gnanapavan S. Kola B. Bustin S.A. Morris D.G. McGee P. Fairclough P. Bhattacharya S. Carpenter R. Grossman A.B. Korbonits M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2988Google Scholar). Peripheral injections of ghrelin have been shown to increase feeding in both rats (4Tschop M. Smiley D.L. Heiman M.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 908-913Google Scholar) and humans (5Wren A.M. Seal L.J. Cohen M.A. Brynes A.E. Frost G.S. Murphy K.G. Dhillo W.S. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5992Google Scholar), and a course of injections leads to increased obesity in rats (4Tschop M. Smiley D.L. Heiman M.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 908-913Google Scholar). Therefore, ghrelin can be seen as an important link between the stomach, appetite, and metabolism as well as playing a role in growth hormone release. The aim of this study was to establish whether ghrelin interacts with any other component of plasma. It was hypothesized that any interaction might be an important factor in determining the activity or longevity of ghrelin in plasma. Furthermore, an interaction in the plasma might be involved in the creation of the two distinct forms of ghrelin (6Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 909-913Google Scholar): the acylated form, in which octanoic acid is covalently bound to the peptide, and the more prevalent des-acyl form in which the peptide is unmodified. The acylated form of ghrelin stimulates the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland, therefore any mechanism that might convert one form of ghrelin into the other could be an important factor in controlling the activity of ghrelin. A peptide corresponding to mature human ghrelin, with a cysteine residue substituted for the serine residue at the third position (S3C ghrelin), was synthesized by Fmoc 1The abbreviations used are: Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; RIA, radioimmunoassay; PON I, serum paraoxonase; GH, growth hormone chemistry using a Rainin PS3 automatic peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies). The peptide was purified to over 90% homogeneity by reverse-phase chromatography using a Varian 500LC HPLC. The molecular weight of the purified peptide was verified by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI)-mass spectrometry. The purified peptide (10 mg) was covalently bound to 2 ml of Sulfolink matrix (Pierce) via the sulfydryl group of the introduced cysteine. Briefly, the peptide was dissolved in 1 ml of PBS and then gently agitated with the resin for 1 h at room temperature. The slurry was then centrifuged for 1 min at 1,000 × g and the supernatant removed. Any remaining iodoacetyl binding sites on the matrix were then blocked by incubation with 15 mm free cysteine for 20 min. A negative control matrix, with no peptide attached, was only blocked with free cysteine. The two matrices were washed in 100 mmglycine, pH 2.5, and then neutralized in PBS. Blood was taken into EDTA from an individual who had not eaten for over 12 h. The plasma was purified from the blood cells by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min, and the two column matrices were each incubated with 10 ml of plasma for 1 h. Each column was then sequentially washed with 5 ml of PBS, 5 ml of PBS + 1 m sodium chloride, 5 ml of PBS + 2 m sodium chloride, and then the proteins that had remained bound were eluted with 5 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. All samples were concentrated into 100 μl of PBS using Amicon Centricon preparators (cutoff: 10 kDa). Samples were made up in Laemmli buffer, and 10 μl was used for SDS-PAGE, prior to staining with Coomassie Blue, while 20-μl samples were used for protein sequencing. Gels were blotted onto PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences), at 1 mA/cm2 for 1 h, and stained with Ponceau S. Stained protein bands were excised from the PVDF membrane, washed, and de-stained in methanol containing 0.1% (v/v) ammonia, rinsed with methanol, and dried in air in preparation for sequencing. The N-terminal residues of the protein bands were identified by automated Edman degradation using liquid-pulse chemistry on an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 with on-line 140C narrow-bore HPLC system and 610A data analysis software. To investigate whether the interaction between the ghrelin matrix and the species of HDL could be inhibited, 1-ml samples of plasma, from a fasted individual, were incubated with 0.1 ml of ghrelin-Sulfolink matrix and 100 μl of PBS or an equivalent volume containing either free ghrelin or paraoxon. The matrices were then sequentially washed with 1 ml of PBS, 1 ml of PBS + 1m sodium chloride, 1 ml of PBS + 2 m sodium chloride, and then the remaining bound proteins were eluted with 1 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. The glycine-eluted samples were then washed extensively and concentrated into 100 μl of PBS using Amicon Centricon preparators. Samples of 10 μl were made up in Laemmli buffer and run on SDS-PAGE for staining with Coomassie Blue. Human low (LDL) and high (HDL) density lipoproteins were isolated from fresh blood, donated by healthy fasted volunteers, by a modification of the method of Chung et al. (7Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Geer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Google Scholar). Whole plasma was loaded into a discontinuous gradient (1.3 and 1.006 g/ml), which formed into a linear gradient between upper and lower density limits during centrifugation for 150 min in a Beckman Ti-70 rotor at 160,000 ×g. The density ranges of the low and high density lipoprotein classes are 1.019–1.063 and 1.063–1.21 g/ml, respectively. Serum albumin was removed from HDL using blue Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The lipoproteins were de-salted on a G25 column, fractions were monitored for absorbance at 280 nm, and samples were analyzed for immunoreactivity by RIA (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals). Lipoprotein fractions, along with a positive control of acylated ghrelin (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), were spotted onto methanol-whetted PVDF membrane in triplicate. The membrane was blocked in 5% milk powder in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then probed for 16 h with 1% milk powder in PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 1/1,000 antiserum that had been raised against S3C ghrelin coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The membrane was then probed with 1/5,000 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) in 1% milk powder in PBS-T for 1 h and then extensively washed in PBS-T and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). Affinity chromatography, using an engineered form of ghrelin, was used to identify the moieties in plasma that could bind to ghrelin. The samples that were eluted by the acid glycine were separated by SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto PVDF membrane and stained for protein. All the stained bands in the sample on the PVDF membrane were subjected to N-terminal sequencing, and proteins were identified by at least eight cycles of Edman degradation. The most abundant protein that was purified by the ghrelin affinity chromatography (Fig. 1) was identified as apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). It was eluted from the ghrelin column as a band of ∼30 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of 27 kDa for the mature protein. Serum paraoxonase (PON I) was detected at ∼40 kDa. The residues identified at the N terminus correspond to the signal sequence, which, unusually, is not cleaved from the mature protein (8Hassett C. Richter R.J. Humbert R. Chapline C. Crabb J.W. Omiecinski C.J. Furlong C.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10141-10149Google Scholar). Both the α and β chains of clusterin (apolipoprotein J) were detected as a band below 50 kDa, and as a dimer, which is consistent with the predicted molecular weight for the mature protein. Clusterin, PON I, and apoA-I associate on a species of HDL particle (9Kelso G.J. Stuart W.D. Richter R.J. Furlong C.E. Jordan-Starck T.C. Harmony J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 832-839Google Scholar) that comprises ∼1% of the HDL particles in plasma. Therefore, it is consistent that these proteins were identified eluting from the column together. Serum albumin and vitronectin were identified as a single band at ∼65 kDa; however, serum albumin was identified as binding to both the ghrelin column and the control column, suggesting that this was not specific binding. The specificity of the interaction between this form of HDL and ghrelin was investigated by repeating the affinity chromatography in the presence of free ghrelin to assess whether it would inhibit the binding of the HDL species with immobilized ghrelin. Virtually all binding of the HDL to the column of immobilized ghrelin was inhibited by 4 nm ghrelin (Fig.2 a). This suggests that there is a limited number of binding sites on the HDL species for ghrelin. It has been reported that ghrelin levels fluctuate diurnally, but can reach levels as high as 0.5 nm (2Cummings D.E. Purnell J.Q. Frayo R.S. Schmidova K. Wisse B.E. Weigle D.S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1714-1719Google Scholar). The interaction between the immobilized form of ghrelin and the HDL was also inhibited by paraoxon, a substrate for the esterase PON I. The binding of HDL to the column of immobilized ghrelin was inhibited by ∼50% by 1 mm paraoxon (Fig. 2 b), which is close to the K m of PON I for paraoxon. This suggests that either ghrelin binds to the same active site as paraoxon or that the binding of paraoxon causes an alteration to an allosteric site where ghrelin interacts. To establish whether any endogenous ghrelin is bound to HDL or LDL in human plasma, the lipoproteins were purified by density-gradient ultracentrifugation. When the sodium bromide was removed from the HDL fraction by gel filtration, the ghrelin immunoreactive species co-migrated with the lipoprotein (Fig.3 A). This shows that ghrelin migrated as a high molecular weight species during density-gradient ultracentrifugation and gel filtration and co-migrated with HDL under both of these purification processes. In Fig. 3 B, the fractions of lipoprotein were spotted in triplicate onto PVDF membrane and probed by an antibody raised against ghrelin. The antibody recognized ghrelin in human plasma, but not in low density lipoprotein. The antibody bound ghrelin in the HDL fraction, and this was not reduced by the removal of serum albumin from this fraction. Ghrelin affinity chromatography was also performed on serum from a rabbit that had been fed ad libidum. Only PON I and apoA-I were identified after acid-glycine elution from the column (data not shown). It could be that the difference in these results is due to different properties of the proteins from different species or that the calcium in the serum, or the EDTA in the plasma, alters this interaction. It is also possible that satiety alters this interaction, therefore further work is being undertaken to establish what factors are important. PON I, an esterase whose physiological substrate has not been established, is part of the species of HDL that binds the immobilized form of ghrelin. However, there is no inhibition of the enzymatic breakdown of paraoxon by PON I, by either 1 mm ghrelin or des-acyl ghrelin (data not shown). PON I has been shown to possess esterase activity, and there is an ester bond in ghrelin that links the octanoic acid to the third residue, a serine (1Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Google Scholar). However, the present affinity chromatography data were obtained using a matrix that has the peptide bound via a thioether bond at the point at which the octanoic acid would be attached to the peptide via an ester bond. The purified peptide was immobilized via the sulfydryl group to Sulfolink matrix, which has a spacer group containing a 12-carbon chain between the sulfydryl-specific iodoacetyl group and the cross-linked agarose matrix. Therefore, this engineered form of ghrelin has an aliphatic chain attached to the peptide at the correct position, but via a thioether linkage, rather than the ester linkage in natural ghrelin. Engineered forms of ghrelin, in which the vulnerable ester linkage is exchanged for a more robust bond, may alter the biostability and activity of ghrelin. If PON I breaks ghrelin down to the des-acyl form, then PON I may be a suitable target for developing drugs to control the biostability, and therefore activity, of endogenous ghrelin. This interaction may offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention in the control of either appetite or lipoprotein metabolism. No previous data have suggested a link between ghrelin and a subtype of HDL. However, both ghrelin and this species of HDL are present in plasma during fasting, although they are released from different tissues; therefore, it should be possible for these two serum components to interact. The relationship between growth hormone (GH), ghrelin, and HDL is not fully understood. Both GH deficiency and excess are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Acromegaly is associated with both low HDL levels (11Arosio M. Sartore G. Rossi C.M. Casati G. Faglia G. Manzato E. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 151: 551-557Google Scholar) and low ghrelin levels (12Cappiello V. Ronchi C. Morpurgo P.S. Epaminonda P. Arosio M. Beck-Peccoz P. Spada A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 147: 189-194Google Scholar). GH deficiency is associated with low ghrelin levels (13Caminos J.E. Seoane L.M. Tovar S.A. Casanueva F.F. Dieguez C. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 147: 159-163Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether there are changes in HDL levels in these patients (10Ozbey N. Algun E. Turgut A.S. Orhan Y. Sencer E. Molvalilar S. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2000; 24: 619-626Google Scholar, 14de Boer H. Blok G.J. Voerman H.J. Phillips M. Schouten J.A. Metabolism. 1994; 43: 199-203Google Scholar). The present data suggest a significant link between HDL and ghrelin, but it is unclear whether the changes in ghrelin and HDL levels in these pathophysiological states are causally linked and whether low ghrelin levels might influence the course of atherosclerosis in these patients or any other groups. This study raises some questions about the physiology of ghrelin and HDL. Further investigations will be required to distinguish which form of ghrelin can interact with the species of HDL and to measure the proportions of bound and free ghrelin in plasma. The interaction may affect the biological activities of these molecules, so this ratio could be an important factor in health and disease. This ratio may vary between individuals, or fluctuate with ghrelin levels, or in specific disease states. It is also possible that ghrelin interacts with other moieties in the plasma under different conditions, and further work will be required to fully characterize the interactions and physiology of ghrelin in the blood. In conclusion, the interaction between ghrelin and this species of HDL is a link between hunger, growth hormone release, and lipid transport, as part of the response to fasting. Further research may establish the importance of this interaction for health and disease."

C2 domains are unique among membrane targeting domains in that they show a wide range of lipid selectivity for the major components of cell membranes, including phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine. To understand how C2 domains show diverse lipid selectivity and how this functional diversity affects their subcellular targeting behaviors, we measured the binding of the C2 domains of group IVa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and protein kinase C-α (PKC-α) to vesicles that model cell membranes they are targeted to, and we monitored their subcellular targeting in living cells. The surface plasmon resonance analysis indicates that the PKC-α C2 domain strongly prefers the cytoplasmic plasma membrane mimic to the nuclear membrane mimic due to high phosphatidylserine content in the former and that Asn189 plays a key role in this specificity. In contrast, the cPLA2 C2 domain has specificity for the nuclear membrane mimic over the cytoplasmic plasma membrane mimic due to high phosphatidylcholine content in the former and aromatic and hydrophobic residues in the calcium binding loops of the cPLA2 C2 domain are important for its lipid specificity. The subcellular localization of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged C2 domains and mutants transfected into HEK293 cells showed that the subcellular localization of the C2 domains is consistent with their lipid specificity and could be tailored by altering their in vitro lipid specificity. The relative cell membrane translocation rate of selected C2 domains was also consistent with their relative affinity for model membranes.

Recently, the membrane targeting of peripheral proteins (e.g.phospholipases, lipid-dependent protein kinases, lipid kinases, and lipid phosphatases) by Ca2+ and lipid mediators, including phosphoinositides, has received much attention as an important event in cell signaling and membrane trafficking. It has been shown that the subcellular targeting of peripheral proteins is driven by a growing number of membrane targeting domains. These domains include protein kinase C (PKC)1 conserved 1 (C1) domain, PKC conserved 2 (C2) domain, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, Fab1, YOTB, Vac 1 and EEA1 (FYVE) domain, band four-point-one, ezrin, radixin and moesin (FERM) domain, epsin amino-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, and phox (PX) domains (1Hurley J.H.

A majority of C2 domains bind the membrane in a Ca2+-dependent manner and thereby play an important role in Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting of peripheral proteins. Structural analyses of Ca2+-dependent membrane binding C2 domains have demonstrated similar tertiary structures in which three Ca2+ binding loops are located at an end of eight-stranded antiparallel ॆ-sandwich (8Shao X.

Biol. 1998; 280: 485-500Google Scholar). Despite similar structural folds, C2 domains exhibit great functional diversities due to local structural variations, particularly in the Ca2+ binding loops. Most Ca2+-dependent membrane binding C2 domains have higher affinity for anionic membranes than for zwitterionic ones. In particular, the C2 domains of PKC-α (PKC-α-C2) and phospholipase C-δ1 show selectivity for phosphatidylserine (PS) (15Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Google Scholar, 16Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Roffler S.R. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21995-22001Google Scholar, 17Ananthanarayanan B. Das S. Rhee S.G. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3568-13174Google Scholar). In contrast, the C2 domains of group IVa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (18Nalefski E.A. McDonagh T. Somers W. Seehra J. Falke J.J. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1365-1372Google Scholar) and 5-lipoxygenase (19Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Google Scholar) strongly favor zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC). Furthermore, C2 domains show distinct subcellular localization patterns. For instance, the C2 domains of PKC-α (20Corbalan-Garcia S. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 513-521Google Scholar) and phospholipase C-δ1 (17Ananthanarayanan B. Das S. Rhee S.G. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3568-13174Google Scholar) translocate to the plasma membrane, whereas the C2 domains of cPLA2 (cPLA2-C2) (21Perisic O. Paterson H.F. Mosedale G. Lara-Gonzalez S. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14979-14987Google Scholar, 22Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J.

Although recent studies indicate that the Ca2+ binding loops are involved in lipid selectivity of C2 domains (17Ananthanarayanan B. Das S. Rhee S.G. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3568-13174Google Scholar, 19Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Google Scholar, 23Gerber S.H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Google Scholar), the mechanisms of differential lipid selectivity and distinct subcellular localization of C2 domains have not been fully elucidated. To understand these mechanisms, we performed biophysical studies using purified recombinant proteins and vesicles whose lipid compositions resemble those of cell membranes and measured the spatiotemporal dynamics of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged C2 domains and mutants in live cells. These studies not only identify the residues that are responsible for their distinct lipid selectivity but also demonstrate that in vitro membrane binding properties of C2 domains are quantitatively correlated with their subcellular targeting behaviors.DISCUSSIONThe membrane binding of proteins involves different types of interactions that depend upon the physicochemical properties of both membrane and protein. Extensive structural and mutational studies of membrane binding proteins have shown that their membrane binding surfaces are composed of cationic, aliphatic, and aromatic residues that drive the membrane binding by electrostatic and non-electrostatic forces (46Gelb M.H. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 428-432Google Scholar). Our recent study by surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that cationic residues primarily accelerate the association of protein to anionic membrane surfaces, whereas aliphatic residues mainly slow the membrane dissociation by penetrating into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (29Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Google Scholar). Aromatic residues, particularly Trp, play a pivotal role in binding to zwitterionic PC membranes (46Gelb M.H. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 428-432Google Scholar,47Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Google Scholar) by affecting both membrane association and dissociation steps (29Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Google Scholar). The present study systematically and quantitatively addresses the question as to whether or not these physicochemical principles governing the in vitro membrane binding of membrane targeting domains also determine their subcellular targeting behaviors, using two C2 domains as a model.Lipid Selectivity of cPLA2-C2 and PKC-α-C2A large degree of structural variations have been found in the Ca2+ binding loops of C2 domains in terms of both primary and tertiary structures (8Shao X.

Biol. 1998; 280: 485-500Google Scholar) studies of C2 domains have identified the residues in the Ca2+ binding loops that play a key role in membrane binding. The present study shows that cationic residues, Arg249 and Arg252, in Ca2+ binding loops of PKC-α-C2 are involved in its binding to the anionic membrane surface, whereas Asn189plays a critical role in PS selectivity. Arg216 and Thr251 are also involved in PS binding but not specifically to the lipid headgroup. These results appear to be at odds with the report by Conesa-Zamora et al. (24Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Google Scholar) in which Thr251 was shown to play a much more important role than Asn189 in binding to PS-containing membranes as well as in PS-dependent PKC activity. It should be noted, however, that the study by Conesa-Zamora et al. (24Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Google Scholar) was performed only in the presence of PS-containing membranes: no comparison was made between PS and non-PS membranes. As shown in Table I, we also observed that T251A had the largest impact on the affinity for POPC/POPS (7:3) vesicles. Importantly, however, both T251A and R216A mutations reduced the affinity for POPC/POPS (7:3) and POPC/POPG (7:3) vesicles to comparable degrees. Only the N189A mutation selectively reduced the affinity for PS. This is consistent with the structure of a PKC-α-C2·PS complex, which shows that Arg216 and Thr251 primarily interact with sn-1 andsn-2 ester carbonyl moieties, respectively, whereas Asn189 interacts directly with the serine headgroup (12Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gomez- Fernandez J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Google Scholar). Also, a smaller effect of the N189A mutation on PS membrane affinity in the study by Conesa-Zamora et al. (24Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Google Scholar) might be due in part to the fact that not isolated C2 domains but full-length PKC-α proteins were used. Presumably, the rest of the PKC-α molecule, including the C1 domains, can compensate for the reduced PS affinity caused by the N189A mutation. In the case of cPLA2-C2, both aliphatic and aromatic residues in Ca2+ binding loops are essential for its membrane binding and PC selectivity. Aromatic side chains have been shown to be involved in PC interactions (46Gelb M.H. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 428-432Google Scholar, 47Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11881-11888Google Scholar); however, the involvement of aliphatic side chains in PC selectivity has not been reported. Further studies are required to understand the origin of this effect.Subcellular Targeting of cPLA2-C2 and PKC-α-C2It has been known that conventional PKCs and their C2 domains, including PKC-γ and its C2 domain (37Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Google Scholar), PKC-α (41Almholt K. Arkhammar P.O. Thastrup O. Tullin S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 211-218Google Scholar), and PKC-α-C2 (20Corbalan-Garcia S. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 513-521Google Scholar), translocate to plasma membrane in response to [Ca2+]i spikes, whereas cPLA2-C2 and cPLA2 are targeted to the perinuclear region upon Ca2+ import (21Perisic O. Paterson H.F. Mosedale G. Lara-Gonzalez S. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14979-14987Google Scholar, 22Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1219-1232Google Scholar, 43Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Google Scholar). However, the origin of these differential subcellular targeting behaviors of PKC C2 domains, cPLA2-C2, and their host proteins is relatively poorly understood. Intuitively, one can assume the presence of site-specific adaptor proteins for these proteins (51Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Google Scholar, 52Nakatani Y. Tanioka T. Sunaga S. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1161-1168Google Scholar). The present study provides quantitative and structural evidence for an alternative view that holds that differential subcellular targeting behaviors of the C2 domains derive mainly from their different lipid selectivity.It has been reported that mammalian cell membranes have different lipid compositions (44McMurray Ansell G.B. Hawthorne J.N. Dawson R.M.C. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier, Amsterdam1973: 205-251Google Scholar). In particular, the cytoplasmic plasma membrane contains a high PS content (44McMurray Ansell G.B. Hawthorne J.N. Dawson R.M.C. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier, Amsterdam1973: 205-251Google Scholar, 45Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Google Scholar, 53Bretscher M.S. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 236: 11-12Google Scholar, 54Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Google Scholar), whereas the nuclear membrane is relatively rich in PC (44McMurray Ansell G.B. Hawthorne J.N. Dawson R.M.C. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier, Amsterdam1973: 205-251Google Scholar, 55Williams S.D. Hsu F.F. Ford D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1585-1595Google Scholar). In this study, the cytoplasmic leaflets of plasma membrane and nuclear envelope were modeled based on the reported lipid compositions of rat liver cell membranes (44McMurray Ansell G.B. Hawthorne J.N. Dawson R.M.C. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier, Amsterdam1973: 205-251Google Scholar). Although the lipid compositions of these vesicles might not reflect the true lipid compositions of cytoplasmic plasma membrane and nuclear envelope of HEK293 cells, they should serve as good models, because kidney and liver cell membranes have similar lipid compositions (44McMurray Ansell G.B. Hawthorne J.N. Dawson R.M.C. Form and Function of Phospholipids. Elsevier, Amsterdam1973: 205-251Google Scholar). Consistent with their distinct lipid selectivity, PKC-α-C2 and cPLA2-C2 demonstrate pronounced specificity for the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope mimics, respectively (121-fold and 33-fold preference, respectively, for their favorite membranes). Agreement between this strict in vitro specificity and highly specific subcellular localization of the C2 domains suggests that their subcellular targeting is driven primarily by membrane-protein interactions. This notion is further supported by the good correlation between altered lipid specificities of PKC-α-C2 and cPLA2-C2 mutants and their subcellular localization. N189A of PKC-α-C2 with markedly reduced selectivity for the plasma membrane mimic showed dual targeting to the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region. Likewise, cPLA2-C2 mutants with lower selectivity for the nuclear envelope mimic exhibited the dual targeting behaviors. Similarly, it was shown that the subcellular targeting patterns of the C2 domains of phospholipase C-δ (17Ananthanarayanan B. Das S. Rhee S.G. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Google Scholar) can be altered by changing their in vitro lipid selectivity. Lastly, for PKC-α-C2, its R249A/R252A mutant, and cPLA2-C2 that translocate to a single cellular destination, the relative affinity (100:20:22, see Table III) for their favorite membrane mimics agrees reasonably well with their relative membrane translocation rate (100:25:15, see Fig. 7).In sum, these studies indicate that the specific subcellular targeting of PKC-α-C2 and cPLA2-C2 derives from their phospholipid headgroup specificities and that one can control the subcellular localization of a C2 domain by altering its lipid selectivity. The studies also demonstrate the semi-quantitative correlation between thein vitro membrane binding of C2 domains and their cellular membrane targeting. A more detailed study is underway to delineate the quantitative correlation between in vitro membrane binding parameters of C2 domains and their cellular responses. Further studies on other membrane targeting domains will answer the question as to whether or not their subcellular targeting could be also explained by biophysical principles that govern their membrane binding. The agonist-induced subcellular targeting of protein is an important process in cell signaling and regulation. Recently, the membrane targeting of peripheral proteins (e.g.phospholipases, lipid-dependent protein kinases, lipid kinases, and lipid phosphatases) by Ca2+ and lipid mediators, including phosphoinositides, has received much attention as an important event in cell signaling and membrane trafficking. It has been shown that the subcellular targeting of peripheral proteins is driven by a growing number of membrane targeting domains. These domains include protein kinase C (PKC)1 conserved 1 (C1) domain, PKC conserved 2 (C2) domain, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, Fab1, YOTB, Vac 1 and EEA1 (FYVE) domain, band four-point-one, ezrin, radixin and moesin (FERM) domain, epsin amino-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, and phox (PX) domains (1Hurley J.H.

The C2 domain has been identified in many cellular proteins involved in signal transduction or membrane trafficking (5Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Google Scholar, 6Nalefski E.A.

A majority of C2 domains bind the membrane in a Ca2+-dependent manner and thereby play an important role in Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting of peripheral proteins. Structural analyses of Ca2+-dependent membrane binding C2 domains have demonstrated similar tertiary structures in which three Ca2+ binding loops are located at an end of eight-stranded antiparallel ॆ-sandwich (8Shao X.

Biol. 1998; 280: 485-500Google Scholar). Despite similar structural folds, C2 domains exhibit great functional diversities due to local structural variations, particularly in the Ca2+ binding loops. Most Ca2+-dependent membrane binding C2 domains have higher affinity for anionic membranes than for zwitterionic ones. In particular, the C2 domains of PKC-α (PKC-α-C2) and phospholipase C-δ1 show selectivity for phosphatidylserine (PS) (15Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19852-19861Google Scholar, 16Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Roffler S.R. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21995-22001Google Scholar, 17Ananthanarayanan B. Das S. Rhee S.G. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3568-13174Google Scholar). In contrast, the C2 domains of group IVa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (18Nalefski E.A. McDonagh T. Somers W. Seehra J. Falke J.J. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1365-1372Google Scholar) and 5-lipoxygenase (19Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Google Scholar) strongly favor zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC). Furthermore, C2 domains show distinct subcellular localization patterns. For instance, the C2 domains of PKC-α (20Corbalan-Garcia S. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 513-521Google Scholar) and phospholipase C-δ1 (17Ananthanarayanan B. Das S. Rhee S.G. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3568-13174Google Scholar) translocate to the plasma membrane, whereas the C2 domains of cPLA2 (cPLA2-C2) (21Perisic O. Paterson H.F. Mosedale G. Lara-Gonzalez S. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14979-14987Google Scholar, 22Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Kaiser A.L. Leslie C.C. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Google Scholar) translocate to the perinuclear region. Although recent studies indicate that the Ca2+ binding loops are involved in lipid selectivity of C2 domains (17Ananthanarayanan B. Das S. Rhee S.G. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3568-13174Google Scholar, 19Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Google Scholar, 23Gerber S.H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Google Scholar), the mechanisms of differential lipid selectivity and distinct subcellular localization of C2 domains have not been fully elucidated. To understand these mechanisms, we performed biophysical studies using purified recombinant proteins and vesicles whose lipid compositions resemble those of cell membranes and measured the spatiotemporal dynamics of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged C2 domains and mutants in live cells. These studies not only identify the residues that are responsible for their distinct lipid selectivity but also demonstrate that in vitro membrane binding properties of C2 domains are quantitatively correlated with their subcellular targeting behaviors. DISCUSSIONThe membrane binding of proteins involves different types of interactions that depend upon the physicochemical properties of both membrane and protein. Extensive structural and mutational studies of membrane binding proteins have shown that their membrane binding surfaces are composed of cationic, aliphatic, and aromatic residues that drive the membrane binding by electrostatic and non-electrostatic forces (46Gelb M.H. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 428-432Google Scholar). Our recent study by surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that cationic residues primarily accelerate the association of protein to anionic membrane surfaces, whereas aliphatic residues mainly slow the membrane dissociation by penetrating into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (29Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Google Scholar). Aromatic residues, particularly Trp, play a pivotal role in binding to zwitterionic PC membranes (46Gelb M.H. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 428-432Google Scholar,47Han S.K. Kim K.P. Koduri R. Bittova L. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. J. Biol.

The present study systematically and quantitatively addresses the question as to whether or not these physicochemical principles governing the in vitro membrane binding of membrane targeting domains also determine their subcellular targeting behaviors, using two C2 domains as a model.Lipid Selectivity of cPLA2-C2 and PKC-α-C2A large degree of structural variations have been found in the Ca2+ binding loops of C2 domains in"
https://openalex.org/W1495996409,"β- and α2–adrenergic receptors are known to exhibit substantial cross-talk and mutual regulation in tissues where they are expressed together. We have found that the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) and α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2AAR) heterodimerize when coexpressed in cells. Immunoprecipitation studies with differentially tagged β1AR and α2AAR expressed in HEK-293 cells revealed robust co-immunoprecipitation of the two receptors. Moreover, agonist stimulation of α2AAR was found to induce substantial internalization of coexpressed β1AR, providing further evidence for a physical association between the two receptors in a cellular environment. Ligand binding assays examining displacement of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to the β1AR by various ligands revealed that β1AR pharmacological properties were significantly altered when the receptor was coexpressed with α2AAR. Finally, β1AR/α2AAR heterodimerization was found to be markedly enhanced by a β1AR point mutation (N15A) that blocks N-linked glycosylation of the β1AR as well as by point mutations (N10A/N14A) that blockN-linked glycosylation of the α2AAR. These data reveal an interaction between β1AR and α2AAR that is regulated by glycosylation and that may play a key role in cross-talk and mutual regulation between these receptors. β- and α2–adrenergic receptors are known to exhibit substantial cross-talk and mutual regulation in tissues where they are expressed together.

Each class of adrenergic receptor (AR) is comprised of three closely related subtypes as follows: α1A-, α1B-, and α1DAR, which couple primarily to Gq to stimulate phospholipase activity; α2A-, α2B-, and α2CAR, which couple primarily to Gi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity; and β1-, β2-, and β3AR, which couple primarily to Gs to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity (1Bylund D.B. Eikenberg D.C. Hieble J.P. Langer S.Z. Lefkowitz R.J. Minneman K.P. Molinoff P.B. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Trendelenburg U. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 121-136PubMed Google Scholar). The adrenergic receptor subtypes are differentially distributed across various tissues, and tissue responses to epinephrine and norepinephrine are believed to be dependent upon the relative ratios of the various adrenergic receptors they express. Because β- and α2-adrenergic receptors couple to G proteins with opposing actions on adenylyl cyclase activity, the two receptors might be expected to purely antagonize each other's signaling when they are co-stimulated in the same cell. However, it has been shown that α2AR co-stimulation can in some cases paradoxically sensitize β-adrenergic signaling in brain tissue (2Northam W.J. Mobley P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 113: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3Atkinson B.N. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 688-694PubMed Google Scholar, 4Birnbaum A.K. Wotta D.R. Law P.Y. Wilcox G.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 28: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, the pharmacological properties of βARs in brain tissue are known to be regulated by α2ARs (5Woodcock E.A. Johnston C.I. Nature. 1980; 286: 159-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Nomura Y. Kawai M. Segawa T. Brain Res. 1984; 302: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and reciprocally the pharmacological properties of α2ARs in brain tissue are known to regulated by βARs (7Maggi A. U'Prichard D.C. Enna S.J. Science. 1980; 207: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Nakamura T. Tsujimura R. Nomura J. Brain Res. 1991; 542: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These examples of cross-talk and mutual regulation between β- and α2-adrenergic receptors have been well known for more than 20 years, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. GPCRs have traditionally been thought to exist as monomers, but recent studies (9Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) have revealed that they can exist in the plasma membrane as both homodimers and heterodimers. At present, a key question in this field is: how widespread is the phenomenon of receptor heterodimerization? The most clear-cut case of the importance of GPCR heterodimerization comes from the GABAB receptor, a pharmacologically defined entity that is now known to be comprised of two distinct GPCRs, GABABR1 and GABABR2 (10Marshall F.H. Jones K.A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 396-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Because GABABR1 and GABABR2 are not functional when expressed by themselves, they represent a clear example of the physiological importance of receptor heterodimerization. Although other heptahelical receptors may not absolutely require heterodimerization to be functional in the same way that the GABAB receptor does, heterodimerization of other receptors may underlie some phenomena that are major question marks in our present understanding of neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, such as unexplained forms of cross-talk between different receptor subtypes. We wondered if the previously reported cross-talk between βARs and α2ARs in brain tissue might be due in part to a physical association between these two receptor types. Many early studies (11Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that the β1AR also exhibits robust homodimerization in cells. Furthermore, it has been shown recently (15Lavoie C. Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Umapathy D. Breit A. Villeneuve L.R. Zhu W.Z. Xiao R.P. Lakatta E.G. Bouvier M. Hebert T.E. J. Biol.

Ther. 1999; 84: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The most widely expressed α2AR subtype, α2AAR, is known to be localized both pre- and post-synaptically in a number of brain regions (18Saunders C. Limbird L.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), where its pattern of expression overlaps significantly with that of the β1AR (17Machida C.A. Bunzow J.R. Searles R.P. Van Tol H. Tester B. Neve K.A. Teal P. Nipper V. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12960-12965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the previously reported functional interactions between α2ARs and βARs, as well as the overlapping distribution patterns of α2AAR and β1AR, we examined the possibility that β1AR might be able to heterodimerize with α2AAR. Our findings reveal that β1AR and α2AAR robustly associate in cells and that α2AAR can regulate β1AR internalization and ligand binding. FLAG-β1AR was kindly provided by Robert J. Lefkowitz (Duke University). HA-α2AAR was kindly provided by Lee Limbird (Vanderbilt University Medical Center). HA-β1AR was kindly provided by Hitoshi Kurose (University of Tokyo). The N15A mutant β1AR was prepared via PCR amplification from the native human β1AR cDNA using a mutant sequence oligonucleotide (CTG GGC GCC TCC GAG CCC GGTGCC CTG TCG TCG GCC GCA CCG CTC). The N10A/N14A mutant α2AAR was also prepared via PCR amplification from the wild-type construct in a two-step process, first using a mutant sequence oligonucleotide (CC CTG CAG CCG GAA GCG GGC GCCGCG AGC TGG AAT GGG ACA GAG G) to make the N10A mutation, and second using a second oligonucleotide (GCG GGC GCC GCG AGC TGGGCT GGG ACA GAG GCG CCG GGG GGC) to make the N14A mutation using the N10A mutant construct as a template. The point mutations were confirmed by ABI sequencing. All tissue culture media and related reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK-293 cells were maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. For heterologous expression of receptors, 2 μg of DNA was mixed with LipofectAMINE (15 μl) and Plus reagent (20 μl) (from Invitrogen) and added to 5 ml of serum-free medium in 10-cm tissue cultures plates containing cells at ∼50–80% confluency. Following a 4-h incubation, the medium was removed, and 10 ml of fresh complete medium was added. After another 12–16 h, the medium was changed again, and the cells were harvested 24 h later. Samples (5 μg per lane) were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 150 V and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked in “blot buffer” (2% non-fat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mmNaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for at least 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody in blot buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies utilized were either a 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or an M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). The blots were then washed three times with 10 ml of blot buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in blot buffer. Finally, the blots were washed three more times with 10 ml of blot buffer and visualized via enzyme-linked chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from AmershamBiosciences. Cells were harvested and lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and the protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was solubilized via end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 30 min and clarified via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. A small fraction of the supernatant was taken at this point and incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer in order to examine expression of proteins in the whole cell extract. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 30 μl of beads covalently linked to anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. After five washes with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analyses. For enzymatic deglycosylation of receptors, immunoprecipitates were separated from beads by boiling for 10 min in a denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol). After cooling, Nonidet P-40 was added to the supernatants to a final concentration of 1%, and Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5) was added to lysates to a final concentration of 50 mm. N-glycosidase F (1,500 units; New England Biolabs) was added to a 30-μl reaction volume, and the sample was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Intracellular cAMP was measured by using a non-acetylation cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, cultured cells were transfected with either FLAG-β1AR alone or FLAG-β1AR/HA-α2AAR in combination. After 24 h, cells were split into 6-well culture dishes with fresh medium. After another 48 h, cells were treated with varying concentrations of isoproterenol for 10 min and harvested with cell harvest buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 μm Ro 20-1724 (Tocris, Ellisville, NJ), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μm GTP). Cell lysates were sonicated, transferred to a 96-well assay plate coated with anti-rabbit IgG, and incubated with an anti-cAMP antibody at 4 °C for 2 h along with a series of cAMP standards. A cAMP-peroxidase conjugate was then added to the microtiter plate and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The plate was then washed four times with 400 μl of wash buffer, and the wells were incubated with 150 μl of enzyme substrate at room temperature for 1 h. When the samples were within the linear range of the standards, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1.0m sulfuric acid. Absorbance was determined in a plate reader at 450 nm, and cAMP levels were determined using standard curves. Transfected cells were split into 35-mm dishes, grown for 48 h, and then incubated in the absence and presence of agonist for 10 min. The cells were then rinsed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and then rinsed three times in PBS and blocked with blocking buffer (2% non-fat dry milk in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min. The fixed cells were then incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The dishes were subsequently washed three times with 2 ml of block buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (AmershamBiosciences) in blocking buffer. Finally, the dishes were washed three times with 2 ml of blocking buffer and one time with 2 ml of PBS and then incubated with 2 ml of ECL reagent (Pierce) for exactly 15 s. The luminescence, which corresponds to the amount of receptor on the cell surface, was determined by placing the plate inside a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). For preparation of membranes to be used in ligand binding assays, transfected cells grown on 100-mm dishes were rinsed twice with 10 ml of PBS and then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ascorbic acid, pH 7.4). Cells were then washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer, sonicated for 10 s, and resuspended in fresh binding buffer for use in radioligand binding assays. Membranes were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]DHA or [3H]RX821002 in binding buffer for saturation binding studies, or with 1 nm [3H]DHA or [3H]RX821002 in binding buffer in the absence or presence of various unlabeled ligands to generate inhibition curves. The samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was defined as [3H]DHA or [3H]RX821002 binding in the presence of either 1 mm isoproterenol or 1 mm clonidine, respectively, and represented less than 10% of total binding in all experiments. Incubations were terminated via filtration through GF/C filter paper using a Brandel cell harvester. Filters were rapidly washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm Hepes), and radioactive ligand retained by the filters was quantified via liquid scintillation counting. The fitting of curves for one siteversus two sites was performed using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Goodness of fit was quantified usingF tests, comparing sum-of-squares values for the one-siteversus two-site fits. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/FLAG-β1AR and pcDNA3/HA-α2AAR. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm isoproterenol or 10 μm UK 14,304 (Sigma). Following this incubation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. To visualize the subcellular localization of β1AR and α2AAR, cells were blocked and permeabilized with a buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.04% saponin in PBS (“saponin buffer”) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with anti-β1AR polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:500 dilution and anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (1 min) with saponin buffer, the cells were incubated with a rhodamine red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at 1:200 dilution and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at 1:200 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (1 min) with saponin buffer and one wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted, and rhodamine red-labeled β1AR and FITC-labeled α2AAR were visualized with a Zeiss LSM-410 laser confocal microscope. Multiple control experiments, utilizing either transfected cells in the absence of primary antibody or untransfected cells in the presence of primary antibody, revealed a very low level of background staining, indicating that the primary antibody-dependent immunostaining observed in the transfected cells was specific. To assess the potential physical association of α2A- and β-adrenergic receptors, HA-α2AAR was expressed in HEK-293 cells either alone or in combination with FLAG-β1AR or FLAG-β2AR. As shown in Fig.1, Western blotting for HA-α2AAR in cell lysates revealed multiple bands, with major species at ∼65 and 120 kDa. The higher order bands presumably represent receptor complexes resistant to separation by SDS-PAGE, as is commonly observed for many GPCRs (9Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). When the FLAG-tagged βARs were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, the co-transfected HA-α2AAR was robustly co-immunoprecipitated. All of the bands of HA-α2AAR immunoreactivity were evident in FLAG-βAR immunoprecipitates. Somewhat more co-immunoprecipitation was observed with β1AR than with β2AR, and thus further experiments in this area focused on the β1AR/α2AAR interaction. No changes in the extent of co-immunoprecipitation were observed when cells were stimulated before harvesting with various adrenergic receptor agonists (data not shown). In related control experiments, HA-α2AAR and FLAG-β1AR were transfected separately into different plates of cells, which were harvested, prepared as detergent-solubilized lysates, and then mixed together. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-β1AR in these experiments did not yield any detectable co-immunoprecipitation of HA-α2AAR (data not shown), revealing that the two receptors need to be expressed in the same cell in order to physically associate. As a second method of assessing the physical association between α2AAR and β1AR, we expressed the two receptors in cells and studied their co-internalization. Agonist stimulation of many GPCRs induces significant internalization from the cell surface, and this process is known to be important in the desensitization and resensitization of GPCR responses (19Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). HA-α2AAR and FLAG-β1AR were expressed either separately or together in HEK-293 cells and then stimulated with one of three agonist conditions: the βAR agonist isoproterenol alone (“Iso”), the α2AR agonist UK 14,034 alone (“UK”), or Iso + UK together. When endocytosis of α2AAR was examined via a quantitative luminometer-based assay (Fig. 2 A), no significant internalization was observed in response to Iso under any condition, whereas internalization in response to UK was ∼15% whether Iso was co-applied or not. When endocytosis of β1AR was examined (Fig. 2 B), ∼25–30% receptor internalization was observed in response to Iso. The extent of internalization was not significantly different for β1AR expressed alone as compared with β1AR expressed in the presence of α2AAR. In response to UK, no significant internalization was observed for β1AR expressed alone, which is the expected result because UK does not activate β1AR. Strikingly, however, β1AR coexpressed with α2AAR exhibited ∼15% internalization in response to UK stimulation. These data indicate that stimulation of α2AAR can cause co-internalization of β1AR. The internalization of α2AAR and β1AR was also studied via immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In cells co-transfected with HA-α2AAR and FLAG-β1AR, immunostaining for both receptors was concentrated into a smooth rim along the edge of the cells, which presumably corresponds to receptor localization in the plasma membrane of the cells (Fig.3, A–C). Stimulation with Iso resulted in the development of significant intracellular immunostaining for FLAG-β1AR (Fig. 3 D) but had no apparent effect on the pattern of immunostaining for HA-α2AAR (Fig. 3 E). In contrast, stimulation with UK resulted in mobilization of both HA-α2AAR and FLAG-β1AR inside the cell (Fig. 3, G and H), where the two receptors exhibited significant co-localization (Fig. 3 I). These data are consistent with the findings obtained using the luminometer-based assay (Fig. 2) and offer additional evidence that α2AAR and β1AR co-internalize from the cell surface following stimulation with α2-adrenergic agonists. Because coexpressed α2AAR was able to regulate β1AR internalization, we next examined if coexpression with α2AAR was able to regulate β1AR pharmacological properties. The binding of the βAR-selective antagonist [3H]DHA to lysed membranes derived from cells transfected with either β1AR alone or β1AR/α2AAR was examined. Saturation binding studies revealed that [3H]DHA bound with comparable affinity to β1AR expressed in the absence and presence of α2AAR coexpression (K D = 2.8 ± 0.5 nm, B max = 39.3 ± 7.7 pmol/mg for β1AR alone; K D = 2.3 ± 0.4 nm, B max = 33.0 ± 6.5 pmol/mg for β1AR/α2AAR). However, studies examining the displacement of [3H]DHA binding by a variety of βAR-selective ligands revealed that many of these compounds exhibited altered affinity for β1AR coexpressed with α2AAR relative to β1AR expressed alone. Inhibition curves for displacement of [3H]DHA binding to membranes expressing β1AR alone were fit extremely well by assuming one binding site (Fig.4; Table I). In contrast, curves for displacement of [3H]DHA binding to membranes expressing β1AR/α2AAR were in most cases fit significantly better by two-site analyses rather than one-site analyses. The appearance of a significant low affinity component for the displacement of [3H]DHA by metoprolol, labetalol, bisoprolol, dobutamine, and isoproterenol suggests that these ligands bind with substantially lower affinity to β1AR/α2AAR heterodimers than to β1AR alone. On the other hand, norepinephrine, an endogenous agonist for both α- and β-adrenergic receptors, exhibited slightly enhanced affinity for binding to the β1AR in the presence of α2AAR coexpression as compared with β1AR expressed alone, whereas epinephrine, which is also an endogenous agonist for both receptors, exhibited no significant change in its apparent affinity for β1AR alone versusβ1AR/α2AAR. In control experiments, membranes derived from cells expressing β1AR alone and α2AAR alone were mixed together, as in the control co-immunoprecipitation experiments described above. In these mixing experiments, no changes in the ligand binding properties of β1AR were observed for any of the ligands examined (data not shown), suggesting that β1AR and α2AAR must be expressed in the same cell for the modulation of β1AR pharmacological properties to occur. Furthermore, the effects of α2AAR coexpression on β1AR ligand binding properties were not blocked by treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin prior to harvesting (data not shown), suggesting that these effects are not due to activation of Gi/Go-dependent intracellular signaling pathways by the coexpressed α2AAR. In related experiments, the binding of various α2AR-selective ligands to membranes expressing α2AAR aloneversus β1AR/α2AAR was examined. No differences in the binding properties of the α2AR-selective agonist UK 14,034, the α2AR-selective partial agonist clonidine, or the α2AR-selective partial agonist guanfacine were observed (Table II), indicating that although β1AR possesses altered pharmacological properties when expressed in the presence of α2AAR, it does not seem to reciprocally be the case that α2AAR possesses altered pharmacological properties when expressed in the presence of β1AR.Table ILigand binding properties of β1AR expressed in the absence and presence of α2AARβ1AR,K iβ1AR/α2AARK HK LK Lnmnmnm%βAR-selective ligandsBisoprolol24 ± 616 ± 522,190 ± 774810Dobutamine1609 ± 971849 ± 41740,360 ± 962022Isoproterenol514 ± 46267 ± 8112,170 ± 232115Labetalol36 ± 825 ± 1011,250 ± 177312Metoprolol93 ± 588 ± 1913,380 ± 434511Propranolol5.7 ± 1.67.6 ± 1.4Endogenous ligandsEpinephrine5562 ± 5785564 ± 492Norepinephrine5010 ± 7013799 ± 404The binding of [3H]DHA to lysed membranes was studied in the presence of increasing concentrations of various adrenergic receptor ligands. The estimated K i values (in nm) are shown for each ligand.

Hence, two K i values (K H for the high affinity component and K L for the low affinity component) are provided for binding to β1AR/α2AAR for most of the ligands, whereas only a single K ivalue is provided for binding to β1AR expressed alone. Note that for all of the two-site fits, the K H value for binding to β1AR/α2AAR is similar to the singleK i value for binding to α2AAR alone, suggesting that the majority of binding sites in the membranes expressing β1AR/α2AAR possess binding properties similar to the binding sites in membranes expressing β1AR alone. However, membranes expressing β1AR/α2AAR also exhibit, in most cases, a small low affinity component (K L), which was estimated between 10 and 25% of total binding sites in all cases, as shown in the right-hand column.

We report here that the N-terminal (NT) end of Bax α, which contains its first α helix (Ηα1), is a functional mitochondrial-addressing signal both in mammals and in yeast. Similar results were obtained with a newly described variant of Bax called Bax ψ, which lacks the first 20 amino acids of Bax α and is constitutively associated with mitochondria. Deletion of Ηα1 impairs the binding of Bax ψ to mitochondria, whereas a fusion of the N terminus of Bax α, which contains Ηα1 with a cytosolic protein, results in the binding of the chimeric proteins to mitochondria both in a cell-free assay and in vitro. More importantly, the mitochondria-bound chimeric proteins inhibit the interaction of Bax ψ with mitochondria as well as Bax-apoptogenic properties. The mutations of the Ηα1, which inhibit Bax α and Bax ψ translocation to mitochondria, also block the subsequent activation of the execution phase of apoptosis. Conversely, a deletion of the C terminus does not appear to influence Bax α and Bax ψ mitochondrial addressing. Taken together, our results suggest that Bax is targeted to mitochondria by its NT and thus through a pathway that is unique for a member of the BCL-2 family.

Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Google Scholar). The main site of action of these proteins appears to be the mitochondrion, particularly through the control of the release of apoptogenic factors from this organelle (2Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Google Scholar, 3Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 67-71Google Scholar). Members of the BCL-2 family can be anti-apoptotic or proapoptotic and totally or partially mitochondrial-bound or cytosolic (4Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Google Scholar). In most cells, one of the crucial and most regulated steps in the implementation of apoptosis is the control of the translocation of Bax α from the cytosol to the mitochondria (4Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL act as inhibitors of Bax function, whereas proapoptotic BH3 only members can either hinder this inhibition (e. g. Bad) or directly activate Bax α (e. g. Bid), which in both cases would promote the association of Bax α with the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM)1 (5Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Google Scholar, 6Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is anchored into MOM bilayer by a short hydrophobic domain close to the C terminus (CT) with its N terminus (NT) exposed toward the cytosol (7Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Google Scholar, 8Tanaka S. Saito K. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10920-10926Google Scholar, 9Janiak F. Leber B. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9842-9849Google Scholar). Bcl-2 belongs to a class of membrane proteins called tail-anchored (TA) proteins, which are associated with different intracellular membranes, usually MOM and the endoplasmic reticulum (10Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. Traffic. 2001; 2: 66-71Google Scholar). Based on the homology with Bcl-2, it has been proposed that Bax became inserted to mitochondria by its hydrophobic α9 helix located at its C-terminal end (for example, see Ref. 11Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the Bax α CT is not required for its interaction with mitochondria, whereas others have found it mandatory for Bax α function (12Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Google Scholar, 13Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J.

We have observed that a chimeric Bcl-XL construct in which the natural Bcl-XL CT was substituted by that of Bax α was no longer able to associate with mitochondria in the cell-free system, whereas the reverse substitution (i.e. Bcl-XL CT fused to Bax α without CT) led to a massive binding to the organelle (14Tremblais K. Oliver L. Juin P. LeCabellec M.T. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 582-591Google Scholar). Nechustan et al. (11Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Google Scholar) have shown that unless the serine 184 was properly mutated or deleted, the wild type Bax CT was not a membrane-addressing signal. From these experiments, one could conclude that the membrane-targeting information of Bax is not encoded in its the wild type CT. In addition, because Bax α is usually located preferentially in the cytosol and/or in the mitochondria of healthy cells, it does not appear to behave like a classical TA protein (10Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. Traffic. 2001; 2: 66-71Google Scholar). Goping et al. (17Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Google Scholar) have described the presence of a sequence enclosed in the first 20 amino acid residues regulating Bax α insertion into mitochondria called the ART sequence, an acronym for “apoptosis-regulating targeting” sequence. Recently, we have determined by site-directed mutagenesis that a proline (Pro-13) located within the ART sequence was crucial for the maintenance of the cytosolic Bax α conformation and that its substitution for a valine increased its apoptogenicity (16Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Google Scholar). We have also discovered that human gliomas expressed a natural variant of Bax α named Bax ψ, which lacks the ART sequence (18Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Martin S. Moreau C. LeCabellec M.T. Jezequel P. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 675-687Google Scholar). Bax ψ is highly apoptogenic and is a deletion of its CT, quite remarkably enhanced its association with mitochondria (16Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Google Scholar, 18Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Martin S. Moreau C. LeCabellec M.T. Jezequel P. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 675-687Google Scholar). These results suggest that the CT plays a role in the control of the cytosolic conformation of Bax and not in its addressing to the mitochondria (16Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Google Scholar). Because of the importance of the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria during apoptosis, we have re-addressed the question of the localization of mitochondrial-targeting sequences in Bax α and Bax ψ. We report here that such a sequence is located in the NT of Bax and that inactivating mutations within this sequence affect Bax α- and Bax ψ-intracellular localization and/or proapoptotic function. Unless specified, all of the reagents used in this study were from Sigma. Monoclonal Bax antibody (clone 4F11) was from Immunotech (Marseille, France). The mitochondrion-selective probe MitoTracker Green-FM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Interchim, Marseille), and fluorogenic peptide Ac-DEVD-AMC was from Bachem (Voisins, France). NT and CT mutants of Bax were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the PCR-based Gateway method and were subcloned into a pDEST 12.2 plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Red fluorescent proteins (RFP) constructions were subcloned into pDsRed-1N1 and pDsRed-C1 plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, Ozyme, St. Quentin Yvelines, France). Transformer Site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech was used for internal mutations. Primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Table I. To obtain in vitrotranslated proteins, RFP constructs were subcloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Charbonnieres, France) after digestion bySacI/NotI for pDsRed-1N1 and byApaI/NdeI for pDsRed-C1.

Plasmid DNA (5 μg) were introduced into 106 BdGBM cells by electroporation (GenePulser, Bio-Rad) using 200 V/cm and 250 microfarads. The transfected cells were selected in a medium containing neomycin (250 μg/ml) for 48 h.

The expression of RFP in stably transfected cells was determined by cytometry on a FACScan II (BD Biosciences) by measuring the natural fluorescence of the protein in the cells after exclusion of dead cells on the basis of their forward and side scatter characteristics.Table ISequences of the oligonucleotides used for the obtention of Bax α or Bax ψ fusion proteins and/or mutantsN- and C-deletionsBax α SGGGG ACA AGT TTG TAC AAA AAA GCA GGC TTC ATG GAC GGG TCC GGG GAG CAG CCC AGA GGC GGC GGGBax ψ SGGGG ACA AGT TTG TAC AAA AAA GCA GGC TTC ATG AAG ACA GGG GCC CTT TTG CTT CAG TTC ATBax Δ1–37 SGGGG ACA AGT TTG TAC AAA AAA GCA GGC TTC ATG GGG GGG AGG CAC CCC GAG CTG GCC CTG GACBax Δ169–192 SGGGG AC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GTA TGC CAC GTG GGC GTC CCA AAG TAG GAG AGG AGBax ASGGGG AC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GTT TCA GCC CAT CTT CTT CCA GAT GGT GAG CGA GGC GGT GAG CA1–19 SATGGGACGGGTCCGGGGAGC20–37 SATGAAGACAGGGGCCCTTTTG169–192 SATGTGGCAGACCGTGATCTTTGTGG1–19 ASGATCTGCTCAGAGCTGGTG20–37 ASTCGCCCTGCTCGATCCTGG169–192 ASTCAGCCCATCTTCCAGATGGTGAGCGAGGCSubstitutions*S184TCAGCCCATCTTCCAGATGGTGAGCGCGGCGGTGAA24RATGAAGACAGGGCGCCTTTTGCTTCAGGGTTTCATCCL26G/L27VATGAAGACAGGGCTGGGGGTTCAGGGTTTCATCCL26GATGAAGACAGGGGCCCTGGGGCTTCAGGGTTTCATCCPlasmid mutationpDEST12.2 NheICGTCGTGACTGGGAAAACTGTTTGCTTGGG Open table in a new tab Mitochondria were prepared from normal rat liver, and cell-free association of Bax with the mitochondria was performed as described previously (16Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Google Scholar). [35S]Met (Amersham Biosciences) labeled proteins were synthesized from cDNAs using the TNT-coupled transcription/translation system from Promega. Post-translational insertion of labeled proteins into mitochondrial membranes and alkaline treatment of mitochondrial-bound proteins were performed with a standard import buffer as described previously (16Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins bound to the mitochondria were recovered in the pellet after centrifugation of the incubation mixture for 10 min at 4 °C and at 8000 × g. [35S]Met-Bax associated with isolated mitochondria were analyzed on a SDS-PAGE and scanned with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Insertion of Bcl-2 or of a innermembrane protein was routinely performed in parallel to control the quality of mitochondria. The amount of proteins present in the gel slab was subsequently quantified with IPLab gel program (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Transfected BdGBM cells (2 × 106 cells) were cultured in the presence or in the absence of doxorubicin (doxo, 20 ng/ml) for 24 h before quantification of apoptosis by measuring the LDH and DEVDase activities (16Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Google Scholar, 19Oliver L. Priault M. Tremblais K. LeCabellec M. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 161-165Google Scholar). The LDH activity was measured using a Cytotox96®assay from Promega as instructed by the manufacturer. After the induction of apoptosis, the cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline plated in 96-well plates and the caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was added in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated for 30 min with 5 μg/ml MitoTracker Green-FM at 37 °C and then fixed with 1:1 methanol/acetone for 15 min at −20 °C. After saturation with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with anti-Bax (1 μg) for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, a second anti-mouse IgG coupled to rhodamine was added overnight at 4 °C. Images were collected on a Leica TCS NT microscope with a 63 × 1.3 NA Fluotar objective (Leica, Rueil, France). Quantification of the overlay of labeling was done using MetaMorph 4.6 program (Universal Imaging Corp.). The correlation factor (CF) is a measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables, x (labeling specific for the mitochondria) and y (labeling of constructs of interest), and was calculated as instructed by the manufacturer (www.universal-imaging.com). The RFP was used as a standard for a cytosolic localization. In average, calculations were performed after analysis of 50 different cells in three independent experiments. Transfected BdGBM (2 × 106) cells were collected and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in CEB (v/v) (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm cytochalasin B, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described previously (19Oliver L.

The cells were then homogenized with 30 strokes in a 2-ml glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged for an additional 15 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C to obtain the mitochondrial pellets (P13). These supernatants were then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min in a Airfuge system (Beckman), and the resulting cytosolic fraction was further referred to as the S100. The presence of Bax constructs was detected in mitochondrial pellets and S100 using standard immunoblot methods. Human Bax variants were cloned at the pme1 site of the pYES3/CT plasmid (Invitrogen) under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Cells were grown aerobically in a synthetic medium supplemented with lactate as a carbon source (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.2% Drop-Mix, and 2% lactate, pH 5.2). The induction of Bax variants was achieved by adding 0.5% galactose, and cells were harvested after different times (see “Results”). Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (20Law R.H.P. Manon S. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 133-163Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release was measured by spectrophotometry of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions (21Manon S. Chaudhuri B. Guérin M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 29-32Google Scholar). Bax variants and RFP construct association with mitochondrial membrane was determined by alkaline extraction as follows. Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were suspended in 10 mm KOH-Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.6 m mannitol added plus or minus 0.1m sodium carbonate, and 0.1 or 1% Triton X-100. After a 10-min incubation on ice, membranes were recovered by a 15-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were performed as described by Oliveret al. (19Oliver L. Priault M. Tremblais K. LeCabellec M. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 161-165Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the deletion of Bax CT does not affect the association of Bax α with mitochondria but enhances that of a variant, which lacks the first 20 amino acids of the Bax α sequence (16Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Google Scholar). Deletion of the first 20 amino acids of Bax α structurally corresponds to a variant called Bax ψ, which is encoded by a transcript distinct from that of Bax α (18Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Martin S. Moreau C. LeCabellec M.T. Jezequel P. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 675-687Google Scholar). To further explore the association of Bax ψ with mitochondria, we prepared a series of NT deletion constructs (Fig.1 A) and analyzed in a cell-free system the binding to mitochondria of the correspondingin vitro translated proteins (Fig. 1 B). As already shown by several reports (14Tremblais K. Oliver L. Juin P. LeCabellec M.T. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 582-591Google Scholar, 17Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Google Scholar), the association of Bax α with mitochondria in the cell-free system is extremely low but can be enhanced by the deletion of the first 19 amino acids. Conversely, a construct lacking the first 37 amino acids of Bax α (Bax-(Δ1–37)) does not bind to mitochondria (Fig.1 B). We next examined the intracellular localization of these constructs after transient transfection in BdGBM.2 As shown in Fig.2 A, a similar amount of Bax constructs was produced by the expression of the various transgenes. We performed cell fractionation to assess the subcellular localization of the constructs analyzed above. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the results obtained were consistent with the acellular assay as Bax ψ was found essentially in the mitochondrial pellet (mito) and Bax α-(Δ1–37) only in the cytosolic fraction (S100). Bax α and Bax-(Δ169–192) were found in both compartments, however, with a predominant cytosolic localization (Fig. 2 B). Confocal microscopy was used as another technique to confirm the mitochondrial localization of these different constructs. As illustrated in Fig.2 C, the product of the Bax α transgene was essentially cytosolic, whereas that of Bax ψ was predominantly mitochondrial-bound as reported previously (18Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Martin S. Moreau C. LeCabellec M.T. Jezequel P. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 675-687Google Scholar). We quantified the correlation between labeling of mitochondria with that of Bax constructs using a MetaMorph program and compared it with that of the cytosolic protein RFP (see “Materials and Methods”). As observed in the cell-free assay and in the subcellular fractionation, the deletion of the first 18 amino acids of Bax ψ (i.e. Bax α-(Δ1–37)) abrogates the binding of the proapoptotic protein to mitochondria in vitro, which exhibit a correlation factor of a cytosolic protein (i.e. CF = 0.6). On the other hand, Bax ψ was mitochondrial (CF = 1), and Bax α and Bax-(Δ169–192) with a CF of 0.79 and 0.78, respectively, were localized in both compartments (Fig. 2 D). Thus, based on the acellular assay, the confocal analysis, and the cell fractionation results, we conclude that that the first 18 amino acids of Bax ψ contained a sequence involved in Bax targeting to mitochondria. As reported previously (16Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Google Scholar), the mere expression of Bax in the BdGBM cells is not sufficient to trigger cell death (cf cell morphology in Fig. 2 C); thus, we quantified the death-inducing capacity of the different constructs after treatment with 20 ng/ml doxo for 24 h. Cell death was assessed using both the release of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into culture and the direct measure of caspase activity in cell extracts (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig.3, both LDH release and DEVDase activities were enhanced in cells transfected with Bax α and Bax ψ although with different amplitudes as described previously (18Cartron P.F. Oliver L. Martin S. Moreau C. LeCabellec M.T. Jezequel P. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 675-687Google Scholar). On the other hand, in contrast with another report (22Wood D.E. Newcomb E.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 375-382Google Scholar), little or no induction of cell death was observed with the Bax-(Δ1–37) construct (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that a deletion of the putative trans-membrane domain of Bax (CT = amino acids 169–193) had no effects on both the subcellular localization and apoptogenic activity Bax α (Figs. 2 and 3). According to NMR studies (23Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Google Scholar), the first 18 amino acids of Bax ψ (i.e. amino acids 20–37 of Bax α) contains an amphipathic α helix (Hα1). Numerous studies have shown that such α helices are present in membrane-targeting sequence (24von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Google Scholar). We have generated chimeric proteins by fusion of sequences derived from Bax α NT to the N terminus of the cytosolic RFP (see “Materials and Methods”) and analyzed the binding of these constructs in the cell-free system using in vitro translated chimeric proteins. We also constructed chimeric proteins in which the wild type α9 helix and a mutated form of this sequence (i.e.deletion of the serine 184, Bax-(ΔS184)) were fused to the CT of the RFP. These constructs were similar to those described by Nechustanet al. (11Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Google Scholar) with the exception that the RFP was used instead of the green fluorescent protein. We confirmed using the cell-free system their original observation because Bax α CT did not lead to the association of the RFP with the mitochondria, whereas the Bax-(ΔS184) mutant exhibited higher affinity for mitochondria (Fig.4 A). As also shown in Fig.4 A, the first 37 amino acids of Bax α triggered the association of the RFP with the mitochondria in contrast to that observed with the RFP alone, which remained cytosolic. On the other hand, Hα1 alone (Bax-(20–37)) and, to a lesser degree, the sequence encompassing the first 19 amino acids of Bax α were promoting an efficient association of the RFP with mitochondria when compared with the chimera formed from the fusion of Bax CT to the CT of RFP (i.e. Bax-(169–192)). However, it should be noted that the Bax-(1–37)-RFP construct exhibited an interesting behavior as its association with mitochondria was an intermediate between that of Bax-(20–37)-RFP and that of Bax-(1–19)-RFP (Fig. 4 A). These result suggest that the Hα1 (Bax-(20–37)) is more efficient to target Bax to mitochondria than the full-length sequence (Bax-(1–37)) and the ART sequence (Bax-(1–19)), independently of the presence of other Bax domains. Interestingly, none of these constructs were resistant to alkali treatment, which suggests that the NT of Bax is a targeting but not a membrane-anchoring signal. These results were confirmed by cell fractionation (Fig. 4 B) and confocal microscopy/MetaMorph analysis (Fig. 4, C and D). The Bax-(1–19)-RFP showed a more cytosolic pattern (CF = 0.82) than the Bax-(20–37)-RFP, which is mainly associated with mitochondria (CF = 1) (Fig. 4, B–D). Quite interestingly, the Bax-(1–37)-RFP fusion protein exhibited a mixed cytosolic and mitochondrial localization (CF = 0.85) reminiscent of Bax α subcellular localization in these cells (Fig. 4, B–D). The wild type RFP-Bax CT and the Bax-(ΔS184) mutant (see above) behaved as described by Nechustan et al. (11Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Google Scholar) as the wild type CT construct was mostly cytosolic (CF = 0.7) and the mutated construct was mainly mitochondria-bound (CF = 0.95) (Fig. 4,B–D). We next analyzed, using the cell free assay, the binding of Bax ψ to mitochondria in the presence of increasing concentrations of the different Bax NT-RFP constructs. As shown in Fig.5 A, the addition of Bax-(1–19)-RFP did not interfere with the binding of Bax ψ to mitochondria in the cell-free assay. Conversely, both Bax-(1–37)-RFP and Bax-(20–37)-RFP constructs inhibited this association although with an efficiency that appears to be related with the relative affinity of these constructs for the organelle in the cell-free system (Fig. 5 A). The specificity of the interference of the association of Bax with the Bax NT-RFP constructs was assessed by the coincubation of the Bax CT constructs: the wild type RFP-Bax CT and the Bax-(ΔS184) mutant. As illustrated in Fig. 5 B, neither construct competed for Bax ψ binding, although RFP-Bax-(ΔS184) association to mitochondria was roughly similar to that observed for Bax-(1–37)-RFP. Because acellular analysis suggested that the NT-RFP constructs could exhibit a dominant negative function toward Bax, we analyzed stably transfected cells in RFP constructs, the sensitivity to apoptosis upon transient expression of Bax α or Bax ψ. We used cells expressing the same amounts of constructs as quantified by fluorescence of the RFP (Fig. 6 A). These cells transfected with either Bax α or Bax ψ were treated with doxo, and cell death was quantified both by assessing the activity of LDH in the culture medium and the cellular DEVDase activity. Compared with control, the coexpression of Bax-(1–37)-RFP and Bax-(20–37)-RFP constructs inhibited Bax α and Bax ψ sensitization to doxo-induced apoptosis, whereas Bax-(1–19)-RFP constructs had only a slight effect (Fig. 6, B and C). It should be noted that the expression of RFP-Bax CT constructs including that of the mitochondria bound RFP-Bax-(ΔS184) did not affect Bax function in these experiments. Altogether, these results suggest a competition between Bax Hα1-RFP constructs and Bax α or Bax ψ. This competition is likely to occur by the inhibition of the insertion of Bax α or Bax ψ into mitochondria, and this was confirmed by confocal microscopy (data not shown). As part of a mutagenesis screening of Bax NT, we substituted Ala-24 for Arg (A24R) and Leu-26 for Gly (L26G, Bax α numbering) in both Bax α and Bax ψ (Fig. 7 A). The L26G substitution provoked a break in the Hα1, and the A24R reinforced the basic character of the region surrounding the Hα1, two cardinal points of mitochondrial presequences (24von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7 B, in both cases, the acellular association of in vitro translated Bax α and Bax ψ mutants with mitochondria was significantly decreased, although only slightly for the A24R substitution (Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, the effect of the Hα1 disruption (L26G) was more important in Bax ψ than in Bax α, and the additional change in the Hα1 (double substitution L26G/L27V) did not significantly enhance that of the single L26G mutation (Fig.7 B). In both cases, a disruption of the Hα1 had a greater effect on the binding of Bax than a change in the overall positive charge of the molecule. The latter result suggests that the amphipathic nature of the Hα1 is more important for mitochondrial association than its basic character. We next analyzed by cell fractionation and confocal microscopy the subcellular localization of these constructs in BdGBM cells. The mutations that affected Bax α or Bax ψ binding to mitochondria in the cell-free assay also affected its intracellular localization, and this was particularly striking for Bax ψ in which the L26G substitution almost abolished its constitutive binding to mitochondria (Fig. 7, C–E). We have analyzed the influence of the expression of these mutants on the apoptotic response induced by doxo (cf “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 8, the A24R substitution had little or no influence on Bax α or Bax ψ proapoptotic activities. Conversely, in both cases, the L26G mutants nullified the proapoptotic activities"

We found that both hyperglycemia (extracellular glucose concentration [Glu]o = 10 or 20 mm) and hypoglycemia ([Glu]o = 2.5, 1, or 0 mm) impaired HERG function by reducing HERG current (IHERG) density, as compared with normoglycemia ([Glu]o = 5 mm).

As a major source of metabolic fuel, degradation of glucose via glycolysis and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation generates high energy phosphates to power the biological processes in the cell. Yet, through an exquisitely complex network of control mechanisms, the rate of glucose metabolism is only as great as needed by the organisms. Moreover, glucose also has other regulatory effects on many cellular functions. Either inadequate or excessive glucose can be harmful to the living system. Therefore, the blood glucose level is dynamically controlled. However, under pathological conditions like diabetes, glucose cannot be efficiently utilized, and the blood glucose level rises. When the blood level of glucose is maintained higher than 7 mm, it is considered as hyperglycemia. Diabetes therapy, on the other hand, can lead to an overly low level of blood glucose, which is referred to as hypoglycemia when the level falls below 3 mm. Either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia can have deleterious effects on the cells. One common feature of electrophysiological alterations caused by both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the heart is prolongation of Q-T interval and the associated ventricular arrhythmias that are presumably responsible for sudden cardiac death in diabetic patients (1Abo K.

However, the ionic mechanisms by which hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia prolong Q-T interval remained unclear, which is at least a part of the reasons why diabetic patients die of mainly cardiac complications. The human either-à-go-go-related gene (HERG)1 encodes the rapid component of delayed rectifier K+ current in the heart, which is the major repolarizing current in the plateau voltage range of cardiac action potentials. HERG K+ channels are susceptible to genetic defects and environmental cues, with the consequence being depression of HERG function in most situations (9Lindstrom T. Jorfeldt L. Tegler L. Arnqvist H.J. Diabet. Med. 1992; 9: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Indeed, most of the cases of long Q-T syndrome are ascribed to dysfunction of HERG channels, particularly that induced by therapeutic drugs (13Taglialatela M. Castaldo P. Pannaccione A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1741-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that HERG alteration might also be involved in the Q-T prolongation induced by hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. This thought prompted us to carry out a series of experiments to study the effects of glucose on HERG K+channels and the potential mechanisms. HEK293 cells stably expressing HERG (a kind gift from Drs. Zhou and January) (14Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys.

The cells subcultured to ∼85% confluency were harvested by trypsinization and stored in the Tyrode's solution containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C (12Sanguinetti M.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological recordings were conducted within 10 h of storage. Patch clamp techniques have been described in detail elsewhere (15Wang J. Wang H. Han H. Zhang Y. Yang B. Nattel S. Wang Z.

Currents were recorded with whole-cell voltage clamp with an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Borosilicate glass electrodes had tip resistances of 1–3 megohms when filled with the internal solution containing (mm) 130 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 Mg-ATP, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3). The extracellular (Tyrode's) solution contained (mm) 136 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), and glucose at concentrations as specified. Experiments were conducted at 36 ± 1 °C. Junction potentials were zeroed before formation of the membrane-pipette seal. Series resistance and capacitance were compensated, and leak currents were subtracted. d-Glucose (Glu), 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2dG), sodium cyanide (NaCN), pyruvate, ATP, GTP, AMP-PCP (non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP), xanthine (X), xanthine oxidase (XO), and vitamin E (VitE) were all purchased from Sigma. Xanthine was prepared in 2 n NaOH and diluted in the Tyrode's solution 800 times with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl. Xanthine oxidase was added to the xanthine preparation to form the X/XO-reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating system. VitE was dissolved in ethanol and diluted 1000 times to reach the final concentration. Pyruvate in liquid was diluted into the Tyrode's solution, and pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH before use. All other compounds were directly dissolved into the patch clamp recording solutions as specified. Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP) purchased from Calbiochem was dissolved in 1n NaOH and diluted by 5000 times to reach the desired experimental concentrations. All compounds and reagents were prepared fresh before the experiments. 5- (and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes) is a ROS-sensitive probe that can be used to detect oxidative activity in living cells. It passively diffuses into cells, where its acetate groups are cleaved by intracellular esterases, releasing the corresponding dichlorodihydrofluorescein derivative. Its thiol-reactive chloromethyl group reacts with intracellular glutathione and other thiols. Subsequent oxidation yields a fluorescent adduct that is trapped inside the cell. When it is excited at 480 nm, its emissions at 505–530 nm can be captured. CM-H2DCFDA is prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide immediately prior to loading. Glass coverslips were coated with laminin and placed in the wells of a 12-well culture plate before the cells were seeded into the well in a density of 5.0 × 104/well. After overnight incubation, the cells were washed with pre-warmed (37 °C) phosphate-buffered saline once and then incubated in the Tyrode's solution containing glucose of varying concentrations or exogenous superoxide-generating system (xanthine/xanthine oxidase) or the reagents as to be otherwise specified, together with the fluorescence dye CM-H2DCFDA (10 μm). After 30 min of incubation, the coverslips were washed with pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline twice before being mounted to the glass slides with anti-fading mounting medium and were examined immediately under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). The percentage of positively stained cells and the fluorescence intensity of staining were determined by densitometric scanning with LSM software (Zeiss). Group data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons among groups were made by analysis of variance (F-test), and Bonferroni-adjusted t tests were used for multiple group comparisons, and paired or unpaired t test was used, as appropriate, for single comparisons. A two-tailed p < 0.05 was taken to indicate a statistically significant difference. Nonlinear least square curve fitting was performed with CLAMPFIT in pCLAMP 8.0 or GraphPad Prism. To study the effects of varying concentrations of glucose (Glu, ranging from 0 to 20 mm) on IHERG, our experiments were designed for group comparisons. For each experiment, HERG-expressing HEK293 cells were divided into six groups each superfused with the Tyrode's solution containing a given concentration of Glu for 30 min prior to patch clamp recordings. In addition, recordings were performed immediately after formation of whole-cell configuration and adjustments of capacitance and series resistance compensation, and all recordings were made complete within 3 min. In this manner, there was minimal dialysis through the recording pipette and thereby minimal current run-down (time-dependent current decay), and the data best reflect the effects of Glu on IHERG in cells with intact intracellular contents. In addition, such an experimental design also allowed us to study the effect of Glu on IHERG under conditions devoid of influence from exogenous ATP included in the pipette, which is an important issue to be described later. IHERG was elicited by 2.5-s depolarizing steps from −60 to +40 mV to record the activating current, followed by a repolarizing pulse to −50 mV for another 2.5 s to observe the deactivating tail current, before being returned to a holding potential of −80 mV. The results are illustrated in Fig. 1with both representative raw data and analyzed mean data. Glucose produced two characteristic alterations of HERG channel functions as follows: changes of IHERG amplitude and density and shifts of I-V relationships and activation curves. Comparison of IHERG recorded at varying extracellular concentrations of Glu ([Glu]o = 0, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mm) consistently showed that IHERG density was maximal at a physiological [Glu]o (5 mm), and it was depressed at [Glu]o below or above 5 mm (Fig.1, A–C). In other words, under normoglycemia ([Glu]o = 5 mm) the HERG K+ channel operates at its maximum function level, whereas under hypoglycemia ([Glu]o = 0, 1, or 2.5 mm) or hyperglycemia ([Glu]o = 10 or 20 mm), the HERG channel function is impaired, and the degree of functional impairment is proportional to the degrees of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia (Fig. 1 D). For example, with 5 mm [Glu]o, the IHERGcurrent density was 88.5 ± 7.4 pA/pF (n = 25) at a test potential of 0 mV, whereas with 0 and 20 mm, the values were 35.4 ± 3.0 pA/pF (n = 22,p < 0.05 versus 5 mm[Glu]o) and 35.8 ± 4.9 (n = 15,p < 0.05 versus 5 mm[Glu]o), respectively, approximately a 2-fold difference. The HERG tail current density at −10 mV was also significantly depressed by hypoglycemia (0, 1, and 2.5 mm [Glu]o) or hyperglycemia (10 and 20 mm [Glu]o) (data not shown). Also noticeable is the hypolarization shifts of IHERG I-V relationships (Fig. 1 E) and the activation curve by hypoglycemia (Fig. 1 F). For example, the half-activation voltage (V 12) was −25.4 ± 2.7 mV (n = 19) for 5 mm [Glu]o and −34.3 ± 3.8 mV (n = 22) for 0 mm[Glu]o (p < 0.05, unpaired ttest), which accounted for around 10 mV shift of the steady-state voltage-dependent activation of IHERG. This negative shift resulted in a crossover of the I-V curves between normoglycemia and hypoglycemia. Only slight (∼4 mV) hyperpolarization shift of activation was seen with hyperglycemia (20 mm[Glu]o). Several potential mechanisms could explain the observed effects of [Glu]o on IHERG. First, there was a possibility that the effects were a consequence of alterations of extracellular osmolarity with varying [Glu]o. Second, Glu might act directly on HERG proteins to modify the channel function. Finally, Glu metabolism, which generates ATP as well as other metabolic intermediates, also has the potential to modulate IHERG. The following experiments were performed to clarify these issues. To test the first possibility, we performed experiments in which cells were first superfused with a given concentration of Glu (1, 5, or 20 mm) for >30 min, followed by IHERG recording within 3 min bathing in the Tyrode's solution containing 10 mm Glu. Under such conditions, IHERGdemonstrated the same pattern of changes as described above; cells pre-exposed to 1 or 20 mm Glu had markedly smaller IHERG density than those pre-exposed to 5 mmGlu (Fig. 2 A), despite that all recordings were made under isotonic conditions with 10 mm [Glu]o. For instance, at 0 mV, the IHERG density was 56.1 ± 6.9 pA/pF (n= 8) with 5 mm [Glu]o, whereas with 1 and 20 mm [Glu]o, the values were 32.4 ± 3.2 pA/pF (n = 7, p < 0.05 versus 5 mm [Glu]o) and 35.8 ± 2.2 (n = 7, p < 0.05 versus 5 mm [Glu]o), respectively. Consistently, the activation curve of IHERG was also shifted to more negative potentials by hypoglycemia (Fig. 2 B). A similar difference of IHERG between 5 and 20 mm [Glu]owas also consistently seen when 15 mm cellobiose was added to the Tyrode's solution containing 5 mm Glu (Fig.2 D). The above data indicate that changes of osmolarity is unlikely the mechanism by which glucose modulates IHERG. Apart from that, the fact that differences of IHERG among the cells pretreated with three different concentrations of Glu (1, 5, and 20 mm) persisted even though IHERG was recorded 10 min after superfusion with the normal Tyrode's solution containing 10 mm [Glu]o suggests that the effects of glucose on IHERG are mediated by some intracellular events, and direct interactions between glucose and HERG channels do not likely play a major role. Glucose, once being taken up into the cell, is metabolized via glycolysis to generate 2 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of pyruvate (a substrate for oxidative phosphorylation), which is further metabolized via oxidative phosphorylation to produce more ATP molecules. To investigate whether the effects of Glu on IHERG are associated with glucose metabolism, we studied the effects of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2dG). Glucose was replaced by the non-hydrolysable analogue of glucose 2dG to eliminate the glucose metabolism (both glycolysis and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation). Cells were superfused with the Glu-free Tyrode's solution containing 5 mm 2dG for 30 min before patch clamp recordings. IHERG recorded under such a condition was compared with IHERG recorded with the Tyrode's solution containing 5 mm Glu. As shown in Fig. 3, 2dG substitution for Glu reproduced the two characteristic changes of IHERG as observed under hypoglycemia. First, marked depression of IHERG was seen in the presence of 2dG, with IHERG density only ∼38% that in the presence of 5 mm [Glu]o at 0 mV. Second, similar to the results with 0 mm [Glu]o, the I-V relationship and activation curve were shifted by 10 mV toward hyperpolarizing potentials by 2dG (−28.2 ± 3.4 mV for 5 mm[Glu]o and −37.6 ± 4.5 mV for 5 mm 2dG,p < 0.05, n = 8 for both groups) (Fig.3 B). Because 2dG is a competitive inhibitor of glycolysis, its effects on IHERG in the presence of 5 mmGlu were also investigated. Cells were superfused with the Glu-containing Tyrode's solution with or without 5 mm 2dG for 30 min before patch clamp recordings. The IHERG density was ∼45% smaller in cells treated with 2dG than in untreated cells (Fig. 3 C). For example, the IHERG density at 0 mV was 40.2 ± 4.1 pA/pF for cells treated with 2dG at 5 mm [Glu]o (n = 14) and was 75.6 ± 6.6 pA/pF for cells without 2dG treatment (n = 14, p < 0.05). These results indicate the importance of glucose metabolism in maintaining the normal HERG function. Intriguingly, when 2dG was added to the hyperglycemic solution containing 20 mm [Glu]o, IHERG was increased as compared with that measured in the hyperglycemic solution without 2dG (Fig. 3 E). In other words, 2dG partly reversed the depressed IHERG caused by hyperglycemia toward the normal HERG function seen under normoglycemia. To dissect further which of the two, glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation, is truly responsible for HERG modulation, the following experiments were carried out. In the first set of experiments, pyruvate was supplied to the 2dG-containing Glu-free Tyrode's solution. Under such a condition, the glycolysis was inhibited, but the oxidative phosphorylation was maintained. As displayed in Fig. 3 A, addition of pyruvate at a concentration of 5 mm restored the depressed IHERG induced by glycolysis inhibition. However, the negative shifts of I-V relationship and activation curve, as seen with hypoglycemia or 2dG substitution for Glu, were still consistently observed with pyruvate (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, elevation of pyruvate to 20 mm weakened the ability to restore the suppressed IHERG caused by glycolysis inhibition with 2dG substitution for Glu. Thus, the IHERG density with 20 mm pyruvate in the 2dG-containing Glu-free Tyrode's solution was considerably smaller than that with normal [Glu]o (5 mm). However, this high concentration of pyruvate still failed to prevent the negative shifts of IHERG I-V relationship and activation curve produced by glycolysis inhibition (Fig. 3 B). In the second set of experiments, the oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited by inclusion of NaCN (2 mm), an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, in the bathing solution, and the glycolysis was kept intact with 5 or 20 mm [Glu]o. Under normoglycemia (5 mm [Glu]o), inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by NaCN produced a slight non-significant decrease in IHERG (Fig.4 A). Under hyperglycemia (20 mm [Glu]o), however, IHERG was markedly diminished, and NaCN restored the depressed IHERGtoward the IHERG amplitude seen under normoglycemia (5 mm). For instance, the step and tail IHERGdensities in 20 mm glucose were 50.4 ± 5.9 and 56.4 ± 5.3 pA/pF (n = 14) at −10 mV and were restored by NaCN to 73.9 ± 7.9 and 81.6 ± 6.4 pA/pF (n = 13, p < 0.05 versus 20 mm [Glu]o), respectively. Also important is that the oxidative phosphorylation inhibition did not produce any significant voltage shifts of I-V relationships and activation curves, regardless of different [Glu]o values (5 or 20 mm) (Fig. 4 B). It appears from the above data that either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation was sufficient to sustain the normal function of HERG channels, and significant negative shifts of IHERG I-V relationships and activation curves occurred when glycolysis was inhibited, regardless of whether oxidative phosphorylation was maintained or not. The above experiments indicate that glucose metabolism (glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation) is critical for IHERG modulation by Glu. Yet it was unclear whether the IHERG modulation by glucose metabolism is associated with the generation of high energy phosphates (i.e. ATP), and if so whether the ATP generated from the glucose metabolism is glycolysis-derived or oxidative phosphorylation-derived. To clarify this issue, we first assessed the influence of intracellular ATP depletion on HERG function in the presence of 5 mm Glu, by omitting ATP from the pipette (internal) solution. IHERG recorded immediately after membrane rupture and capacitance/resistance compensation was taken as base-line control data, and the same measurement was repeated every 5 min up to 15 min. Under our experimental conditions, 10 min is sufficient to allow complete dialysis, thereby the equilibrium between pipette solution and cytoplasm. As illustrated in Fig.5, the IHERG recorded with the normal ATP-containing pipette showed only slight run-down over a 15-min period, whereas the IHERG recorded with ATP-free pipette was found significantly reduced with time. There was an ∼46% decrease in IHERG at 10 min after dialysis at −10 mV (Fig.5 C), being similar to the reduction of IHERGunder hypoglycemia or with the inhibition of glucose metabolism by 2dG. Also consistent with the hypoglycemia and metabolic inhibition was the negative shifts of the I-V relationship (Fig. 5 D) and voltage-dependent activation (Fig. 5 E) of IHERG with ATP depletion; the V 12 was changed by ∼8 mV from −31.2 ± 3.6 mV before to −38.9 ± 8.1 mV (p < 0.05, n = 7) after [ATP]i depletion. To investigate whether the requirement of intracellular ATP for HERG function relies on hydrolysis of ATP or is simply because of nucleotide interaction with the nucleotide binding domain of HERG channels (17Splawski I. Shen J. Katherine W. Timothy G. Vincent M. Lehmann M.H. Keating M.T. Genomics. 1998; 51: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we carried out the following series of experiments. We first used the pipette containing the non-hydrolysable AMP-PCP to replace ATP. With 5 mm AMP-PCP in the pipette, the IHERGdemonstrated a rapid run-down as observed with the ATP-free internal solution (Fig. 6 C). For instance, at −10 mV the IHERG recorded 10 min after dialysis was 32.2 ± 2.1% smaller than the basal current recorded right after membrane rupture. We then went on to test if substitution of GTP for ATP could prevent IHERG run-down. With 5 mm GTP in the ATP-free pipette solution, the IHERG developed a similar degree of rapid run-down to what was seen with the intracellular ATP depletion alone (Fig.6 F). For example, at −10 mV, there were 34.4 ± 5.1% decreases in the IHERG amplitude 10 min after dialysis. Moreover, the negative shifts of I-V relationships and activation curves were also seen with AMP-PCP or GTP (Fig. 6, B andE). For instance, V 12 was changed from −33.4 ± 0.8 mV for base line to −37.3 ± 1.0 mV for 10 min of dialysis with AMP-PCP, and similarly, V 12 was shifted from −31.4 ± 1.5 mV to −38.9 ± 2.2 mV by GTP (p < 0.05). The same effects of ATP depletion on IHERG were consistently reproduced when glyburide (10 μm) was included in the superfusate to inhibit ATP-sensitive K+current (KATP), if any (data not shown). Collectively from the above experiments, glucose metabolism is necessary for maintaining the HERG channel function, and the ATP produced by either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation seems to be a key factor for the regulation; on the other hand, the fact that NaCN restores the depressed IHERG induced by 20 mm [Glu]o or by 20 mm pyruvate suggests that oxidative phosphorylation also produces negative (suppressive) regulation on HERG function. This would imply that the IHERG suppression by high glucose via oxidative phosphorylation is ATP-independent or is the balance between the enhancement by ATP and the suppression by other factors associated with oxidative phosphorylation. It has been well established that mitochondria produce most of the endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidative phosphorylation (18Ludwig B. Bender E. Arnold S. Huttemann M. Lee I.

It is therefore rational to propose that the endogenously produced ROS via oxidative phosphorylation stimulated by hyperglycemia could impair HERG channel function to suppress IHERG. To test this hypothesis, we performed the following experiments. We first evaluated the effects of an antioxidant vitamin E (VitE) on 20 mm[Glu]o-induced IHERG depression. Cells were divided into three groups as follows: 5 mm[Glu]o, 20 mm [Glu]o, and 20 mm [Glu]o + 0.1 mm VitE. As illustrated in Fig. 7, A andB, pretreatment of cell with VitE effectively prevented the IHERG suppression by hyperglycemia; the IHERGdensity in VitE group was virtually identical to that in the normoglycemia group. There was no significant shift of the activation curve along the voltage axis. These data suggest a participation of ROS in the HERG regulation by hyperglycemia. Next, we studied the effec"

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2003-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the neural adhesion molecules, L1 has been shown to undergo proteolytic cleavage, which has been suggested to be involved in several functions of this molecule.L1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily consisting of immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin type III repeats (for reviews, see Refs. 14Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and 15Hortsch M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, L1 is expressed only by post-mitotic neurons and mainly on non-myelinated axons, whereas in the peripheral nervous system, it is expressed by neurons as well as by non-myelinating Schwann cells. L1 is also expressed by non-neural cells, including normal and transformed cells of hematopoietic and epithelial origin. L1 is involved in neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and myelination (for review, see Ref. 14Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) as well as axon guidance, fasciculation, and regeneration (16Castellani V. Chedotal A. Schachner M. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Rougon G.

The importance of L1 in nervous system development is underscored by the abnormal phenotypes of L1 mutations in humans and mice (for review, see Ref. 20Kamiguchi H. Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 12: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). L1 engages in homophilic and heterophilic cell interactions (for reviews, see Refs. 14Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and 15Hortsch M. Mol. Cell.

Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and references therein). These interactions are likely to depend on the presentation of the L1 molecule either as a membrane-bound form or as a proteolytic fragment, which has been described in various forms (Ref.22Nayeem N.

The 180- and 50-kDa fragments result from membrane-proximal cleavage of the membrane-spanning 200- and 80-kDa L1 forms, respectively, by a metalloprotease, most likely of the ADAM (adisintegrin andmetalloprotease) family (27Beer S.

Substitution of the dibasic RK and KR in the837GSQRKHSKR845 motif results in reduced multimerization of L1 molecules and diminished integrin binding (21Siletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The functional activity of this particular RGD-independent integrin-binding motif appears to be regulated by proteolytic cleavage within this sequence motif: cleavage by plasmin within this motif disrupts multimerization and RGD-independent integrin binding. Plasmin, the end product of the plasminogen/plasminogen activator cascade, cleaves L1 within the 837GSQRKHSKR845 motif at Lys841 and Lys844, leading to the generation and release of a 140-kDa fragment (21Siletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These cleavage sites are both different from the cleavage site obtained by N-terminal sequencing of the 80-kDa form (23Moos M. Tacke R. Scherer H. Teplow D. Früh K. Schachner M. Nature. 1988; 334: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), indicating that proteolytic cleavage takes place mainly at Arg845. The sequence840RKHSKR845 preceding this cleavage site resembles the proprotein convertase recognition motif, (R/K)X 0,2,4,6(K/R) (for review, see Ref. 37Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Here, we have provided evidence that the proprotein convertase PC5A is responsible for the proteolytic processing at Arg845, leading to the generation of the 140-kDa L1 fragment. Mutation of this putative recognition motif abolishes cleavage of L1 by PC5A, clearly demonstrating that this sequence is the recognition motif for PC5A. Furin is relatively inefficient in processing L1 to yield a 140-kDa fragment, and other proprotein proteases do not cleave L1. A similar result was obtained for the processing of integrin pro-α-subunits: PC5A is more active than furin, whereas PC1, PC2, PACE4, PC7, and PC5B are inactive (38Lissitzky J.C. Luis J. Munzer J.S. Benjannet S. Parat F. Chretien M. Marvaldi J. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, although furin and other proprotein convertases do not efficiently process members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, PC5A appears to be responsible for the in vivoprocessing of these proteins (49Ulloa L. Creemers J.W. Roy S. Liu S. Mason J. Tabibzadeh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21387-21396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The low processing efficiency of furin could be due to the fact that furin preferentially cleaves substrates with the recognition motif RX(R/K)R (50Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sequence HXKR, which is present in L1, is a poor substrate (51Chen Y. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Gambee J. Bachinger H.P. Ferguson B. Zonana J. Thomas G. Morris N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7218-7223Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The particular spatial and temporal expression patterns of PC5A in the brain (45Dong W. Marcinkiewicz M. Vieau D. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Day R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1778-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Zheng M. Seidah N.G. Pintar J.E. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 268-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 53Villeneuve P. Seidah N.G. Beaudet A. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) overlap with those of L1 (54Faissner A. Kruse J. Nieke J. Schachner M. Brain Res. 1984; 317: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas furin is ubiquitously expressed in all brain areas and cell types (55Schäfer M.K. Day R. Cullinan W.E. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Watson S.J. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1258-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to furin, PC5A expression is restricted to neurons (53Villeneuve P. Seidah N.G. Beaudet A. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as has been shown for L1 (for review, see Ref. 20Kamiguchi H. Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 12: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of L1 by PC5A in the hippocampus might be involved in synaptic plasticity underlying hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. Indeed, generation of the 140-kDa fragment is observed in the hippocampus, which expresses PC5A, whereas in the cerebellum, which does not show detectable PC5A expression, this fragment is not generated. Interestingly, both PC5A (56Marcinkiewicz M. Savaria D. Marcinkiewicz J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 59: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and L1 are up-regulated after a lesion in the peripheral nervous system; and thus, the processing of L1 by PC5A could be relevant in regeneration, which is highly L1-dependent (see, for instance, Ref. 17Zhang Y. Roslan R. Lang D. Schachner M. Lieberman A.R. Anderson P.N. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, our results do not exclude that other proteases, such as plasmin, cleave L1 in the third FNIII domain, resulting in the generation of different 140-kDa fragments.A second proteolytic site has been shown to exist in L1, leading to the formation of a 180-kDa fragment. This site within an unknown cleavage sequence is localized close to the plasma membrane and is susceptible to cleavage by a metalloprotease. Recently, it has been suggested that the metalloprotease ADAM10 cleaves L1 at this site and generates a 180-kDa fragment (57Mechtersheimer S. Gutwein P. Agmon-Levin N. Stoeck A. Oleszewski M. Riedle S. Fogel M. Lemmon V. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that the metalloprotease inhibitor GM 6001 inhibits formation of this 180-kDa fragment and interferes with neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, calmodulin inhibitors enhance proteolytic cleavage at this site, as has been shown for other functionally important cell-surface receptors regulating cytokine, neurotrophin, and cell recognition (46Diaz-Rodriguez E. Esparis-Ogando A. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Pandiella A. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 47Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K. Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Our observation thus provides further evidence that intracellular signaling via calcium influences release of recognition molecule fragments from the cell surface. These fragments may then diffuse into the extracellular matrix to interact with partner molecules and thereby modulate the cellular environment. The release of the 180-kDa fragment entails the release of the 140-kDa fragment, which remains tightly associated with the membrane by interacting with the full-length L1 molecule. A prerequisite for this concerted release of the complex of the 180- and 140-kDa fragments appears to be the dimerization of full-length L1 at the cell surface, as shown in this study.cis-Dimerization has been reported for other recognition molecules belonging to the families of cadherins (58Tamura K.

J. 1996; 320: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Dimerization thus appears to be important for signal transduction, as has been shown for E- and C-cadherins as well as for the neural N-cadherin (Ref. 58Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar and references therein). Furthermore, dimerization of selectins has been shown to enhance adhesive tethers (60Ramachandran V. Yago T. Epperson T.K. Kobzdej M.M. Nollert M.U. Cummings R.D. Zhu C. McEver R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10166-10171Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dimerization of CEACAM-1 and CEACAM-2 is regulated by calmodulin and calcium ions (68Hunter I. Sawa H. Edlund M. Obrink B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of inside-out signaling mechanisms. ICAM-1 exists predominantly as a dimer at the cell surface and binds in this dimeric state with greatly enhanced affinity to the integrin LFA-1 compared with its monomeric form (43Reilly P.L. Woska J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar).The shedding of the L1 dimers from the cell surface could have several consequences. Because the 180/140-kDa dimer dissociates into its monomers after release from the cell surface, the soluble diffusible 140- and 180-kDa fragments could constitute important ingredients in the extracellular matrix, possibly playing different functional roles. It might thus be conceivable that L1-synthesizing cells build concentration gradients of either soluble or matrix-embedded adhesion molecules that modulate cell migration and axon guidance by “conditioning” the cellular environment for L1 homophilic and heterophilic interactions with the surface of adjacent cells. Another possibility is that the proteolytic processing uncovers binding sites of the residual transmembrane fragments for different ligands. We thus support the idea that proteolytically processed L1 may subserve at least two functions: modification of the extracellular milieu and of transmembrane signaling via the residual L1 receptor stumps. Proteolytic processing of cell-surface proteins is of prime importance for regulating the functional properties of these proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2003-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the neural adhesion molecules, L1 has been shown to undergo proteolytic cleavage, which has been suggested to be involved in several functions of this molecule. L1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily consisting of immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin type III repeats (for reviews, see Refs. 14Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and 15Hortsch M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, L1 is expressed only by post-mitotic neurons and mainly on non-myelinated axons, whereas in the peripheral nervous system, it is expressed by neurons as well as by non-myelinating Schwann cells. L1 is also expressed by non-neural cells, including normal and transformed cells of hematopoietic and epithelial origin. L1 is involved in neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and myelination (for review, see Ref. 14Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) as well as axon guidance, fasciculation, and regeneration (16Castellani V. Chedotal A. Schachner M. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Rougon G.

Neurosci. 2000; 16: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it enhances cell survival (18Chen S. Mantei N. Dong L. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and synaptic plasticity (19Lüthi A. Mohajeri H. Schachner M. Laurent J.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The importance of L1 in nervous system development is underscored by the abnormal phenotypes of L1 mutations in humans and mice (for review, see Ref. 20Kamiguchi H. Hlavin M.L. Lemmon V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 12: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). L1 engages in homophilic and heterophilic cell interactions (for reviews, see Refs. 14Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and 15Hortsch M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) Heterophilic binding partners are the RGD-binding integrins and TAG-1/axonin-1, F3/F11/contactin, NCAM, CD9, CD24, and phosphacan (Ref. 21Siletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and references therein). These interactions are likely to depend on the presentation of the L1 molecule either as a membrane-bound form or as a proteolytic fragment, which has been described in various forms (Ref.22Nayeem N. Silletti S. Yang X. Lemmon V.P. Reisfeld R.A. Stallcup W.B. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4739-4749PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The 140- and 80-kDa fragments resulting from cleavage within the third fibronectin type III (FNIII)1 domain (23Moos M. Tacke R. Scherer H. Teplow D. Früh K. Schachner M. Nature. 1988; 334: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) have been generated in vitro by trypsin (24Sadoul K. Sadoul R. Faissner A. Schachner M. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The third FNIII domain containing two RGD-independent integrin-binding sites (21Siletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) is involved in homophilic binding (25Holm J. Appel F. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), multimerization (21Siletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and L1-dependent neurite outgrowth (26Stallcup W.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cleavage within this domain by plasmin reduces multimerization and RGD-independent integrin binding (21Siletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The 180- and 50-kDa fragments result from membrane-proximal cleavage of the membrane-spanning 200- and 80-kDa L1 forms, respectively, by a metalloprotease, most likely of the ADAM (adisintegrin andmetalloprotease) family (27Beer S.

Because specific proteolytic processing of L1 is important for regulation of neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth, we have searched for the proteases responsible for cleaving L1 at the two sites and investigated some of the structural and functional consequences of this proteolytic cleavage.

We found that the G protein-coupled calcitonin receptor (CTR) undergoes tonic internalization and accumulates within the cell. Using a fluorescence loss in photobleaching assay, we classified these vesicles functionally as recycling vesicles. In a two-hybrid screening, we found that the actin-binding protein filamin interacted with the C-terminal tail of the CTR. The degradation of the receptor was profoundly increased in the absence of filamin or the CTR-filamin interaction. The absence of filamin was also associated with a marked decrease in recycling of the receptor from the endosomes to the cell surface. In contrast, calcitonin-induced inhibition of spontaneous filamin proteolysis was associated with increased recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and decreased degradation of the CTR, suggesting an important role for filamin in the endocytic sorting and recycling of the internalized CTR.

It binds calcitonin (CT), which acts on bone and kidney to maintain calcium homeostasis. It also acts on the central nervous system, where it has anorexic and analgesic effects (1Azria M. The Calcitonins: Physiology and Pharmacology. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1989Google Scholar). GPCRs comprise the largest known superfamily of cell receptors. They mediate responses to the majority of known hormones, neurotransmitters, and neuromodulators and also function as sensors for extracellular ions, light, and pheromones. These facts make GPCRs in general extremely interesting targets for therapeutic drugs. GPCRs mediate signal transduction by serving as ligand-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors for heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, which in turn regulate several downstream effectors. Moreover, several recent reports demonstrate the existence of G protein-independent signaling pathways used by GPCRs (2Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Endocytosis is a common response to ligand stimulation that sequesters the receptors by redistributing them from the cell membrane to intracellular membranes (3Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The internalized receptor can then either recycle back to the cell surface or be targeted to lysosomes and degraded, a process inducing down-regulation of the GPCR. There is a body of evidence showing receptor- and cell-specific differences in the mechanisms of GPCR endocytosis (3Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A common mechanism involves ligand binding and activation of the receptor followed by phosphorylation of the GPCR by GPCR kinases, which leads to binding of β-arrestins to the receptor and thereby to the uncoupling from the heterotrimeric G protein (4Ferguson S.S.

Mechanisms underlying tonic endocytosis include agonist-independent β–arrestin binding or tyrosine-based endocytic motifs (12Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L.B. Ferguson S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 13Parent J. Labrecque P. Rochdi M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Although the reasons for tonic internalization of GPCRs are not understood, it is clear that tonic receptor internalization must be compensated by constant recycling of the receptor back to the cell surface if surface expression of the receptor is to be maintained. However, much less is known about endosomal sorting and recycling processes of GPCRs than about the molecular events leading to GPCR endocytosis. Here we show that the CTR undergoes tonic internalization and recycling to the cell surface. Efficient recycling was found to be dependent on the interaction of the C-terminal tail of the CTR with the actin-binding protein filamin. The absence of filamin or disruption of the association between filamin and the C-terminal tail of the receptor resulted in reduced CTR recycling back to the cell surface and the rapid degradation of the CTR, whereas CT-induced inhibition of filamin proteolysis increased recycling to the cell surface and decreased degradation of the CTR. Salmon calcitonin (sCT) was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). MG-132 was from Sigma. The monoclonal anti-HA antibody (F-7) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), the monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was from Sigma, the monoclonal anti-filamin antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and the monoclonal anti-xpress© antibody was from Invitrogen. Enhanced chemiluminescence solutions and nitrocellulose membranes were fromAmersham Biosciences and Schleicher & Schuell, respectively. Minimal essential medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), methionine-free DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and newborn calf serum were purchased from Invitrogen. All media were supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. HEK 293 cells were cultured as described before (15Zhang Z. Hernandez-Lagunas L. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25093-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A7 and M2 cells were a generous gift from Dr. John Hartwig (Harvard University). Both cell lines were cultured in minimal essential medium with 8% newborn calf serum and 2% FBS. The medium of A7 cells contained 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). For transient transfections, cells were grown to 60–70% confluence and then transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A cDNA encoding the rabbit CTR was generated by PCR and cloned in the KpnI/HindIII sites of the p3XFLAG-CMV-13 vector (Sigma) to obtain a CTR with a C-terminal 3-fold FLAG tag. The same PCR product was cloned in theKpnI/HindIII site of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to obtain a C-terminal GFP-tagged CTR. Both constructs contained a HA tag in the extracellular N terminus of the receptor (after aa 29 of the original sequence). A construct expressing the CTR with three tandem Myc epitope tags at the C terminus was generated as described before (16Shyu J.F. Zhang Z. Hernandez-Lagunas L. Camerino C. Chen Y. Inoue D. Baron R. Horne W.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All CTR constructs were compared with the wild-type CTR with respect to ligand binding, phosphorylation after ligand stimulation, and cAMP generation and were found to be indistinguishable. A fragment spanning the seventh transmembrane domain and the C-terminal tail of the receptor (aa 373–474) was cloned between the HindIII and KpnI sites of the p3XFLAG-CMV-13 vector after generation by PCR. The same was done for the C-terminal tail without the seventh transmembrane domain (aa 397–474). A filamin fragment spanning the immunoglobulin-like repeats 20–23, obtained from a construct encoding the human filamin cDNA (gift of Dr. John Hartwig, Harvard University), was cloned in the XbaI/BamHI sites of the pcDNA4HisMaxA vector (Invitrogen). All PCR-derived constructs were sequenced by the Yale Keck Sequencing Facility. The HA-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor was a gift of Dr. Brian Kobilka (Stanford University). A cDNA encoding the C-terminal tail of the rabbit CTR (aa 397–474) was cloned in the bait vector pBTM116 and used to screen a mouse osteoclast-like library in pASV4, as described before (17Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The DNA of the colonies that were positive for both reporter assays was extracted and transformed inEscherichia coli, strain DH5α. The library plasmid was isolated, amplified, and retransformed in L40 cells already containing the bait plasmid to confirm the positive result. Cells were lysed in mRIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% IGEPAL, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were then centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C, 16,000 ×g, the protein concentrations were measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and equal amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation. 30 μl of protein-G-agarose slurry and typically 5 μg of antibody were suspended in 500 μl of PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in mRIPA buffer, then 500 μg of lysate protein and bovine serum albumin (0.2%) (w/v) were added, and the mix was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes on the beads were washed four times with washing buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 and once with PBS. Beads were boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE buffer, and samples were electrophoresed on precast 10% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes in 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. Membranes were incubated in the primary antibody for 2 h, washed three times for 15 min in TBST, and incubated for 1 h in 1:10,000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Promega). Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system from Amersham Biosciences. The surface expression of the CTR was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Cells in 6-well plates were trypsinized, and the trypsin activity was neutralized by addition of growth medium containing 10% dialyzed FBS. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold PBS. Usually about 3 × 105 cells were used for each experiment. Normal goat IgG was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. After 10 min of incubation, the anti-HA antibody was added to final concentration of 10 μg/ml. To measure cell surface expression, a 30-min incubation step was followed by resuspending cells in 100 μl of PBS containing 50 μg/ml phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes). After a final washing step, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 2% formaldehyde to fix the sample. Bound antibody was analyzed by fluorescence flow cytometry (FACScalibur; BD Biosciences). Win MDI software, version 2.8, was used for data analysis. To measure receptor endocytosis, a 30-min incubation step at 4 °C was followed by two washes in 100 μl of ice-cold PBS. The washed cells were resuspended in ice-cold DMEM, with or without 10 nm sCT. Cells were then quickly warmed to 37 °C in a water bath to allow endocytosis of the receptor for different time periods. Cells were then cooled to 4 °C, centrifuged, and resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 50 μg/ml PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes). After a final washing step, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 2% formaldehyde to fix the sample, and bound antibody was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were prepared as described for the internalization assay, except that cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of the anti-HA antibody to allow endocytosis of the CTR with the bound antibody. After cooling to 4 °C, cells were incubated with an acid strip solution (0.2 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 3) for 3 min to remove the surface-bound antibody. The acid strip reduced the amount of PE-conjugated secondary antibody binding to levels similar to controls without anti-HA antibody. Cells were then warmed to 37 °C for different time periods to allow recycling of the CTR. PE staining and FACS analysis were performed as described above. CTR-transfected cells in 10-cm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C to biotinylate cell surface proteins. Excess biotin was quenched by incubating in Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, (final concentration 50 mm) for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were transferred to medium prewarmed to 37 °C with or without 10 nm sCT and incubated at 37 °C for various times to allow endocytosis of the receptor and then chilled on ice to stop endocytosis. Biotin was cleaved from proteins on the cell surface by washing cells twice at 4 °C with 50 mm glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, 10% FBS. The cells were then washed twice for 10 min at 4 °C in iodoacetamide buffer (50 mm iodoacetamide, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) to quench residual glutathione. Cells were harvested in mRIPA supplemented with 1 mg/ml iodoacetamide. The FLAG-tagged CTR was immunoprecipitated, electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE without reducing agent, and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose. The endocytosed, biotinylated receptor was then detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). CTR-FLAG-transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and preincubated in methionine-free labeling DMEM medium, containing 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen) for 30 min. [35S]-Methionine (Amersham Biosciences) was added to a final activity of 150 μCi/ml. Cells were incubated for 90 min, then washed twice with chase medium (DMEM with 10% FBS, 2 mmmethionine), and incubated in chase medium for the indicated time periods. After the chase, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in mRIPA buffer. The CTR was immunoprecipitated and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was dried in a gel dryer at 80 °C for 2 h and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. MR x-ray film for at least 24 h. The x-ray film was scanned, and the intensity of the corresponding bands was quantified using the NIH Scion Image 1.62c software, checking that the bands of interest were in the linear range of the x-ray film. Cells were seeded in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and 24 h later were transfected with the GFP-tagged CTR constructs as described above. To acquire the images, the dish was placed in a heated stage (DH-35; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) in a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to maintain a temperature of 37 °C. The culture medium was replaced by 37 °C Na+-HEPES buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 290 mosmol/liter). All photobleaching experiments were carried out in the presence of 25 μm cycloheximide added 30 min before the start of the recordings to rule out contribution from new protein synthesis. A 63 × 1.25 numerical aperture water immersion objective was used. GFP was excited at 488 nm by an argon laser. Emission was measured in the green channel from 505–530 nm. Photobleaching was obtained by scanning the region of interest (a hand-drawn box, the contours of which surrounded the area to bleach) at 75% power and 100% transmission. Imaging was done by scanning the whole cell with attenuated transmission (1%). The fluorescence intensity in membrane areas of the bleached cell distant from the bleached spot, and as a control, the fluorescence intensity of the membrane of a neighboring, unbleached cell were measured every 6 s for 10 min after the bleaching. This procedure was repeated four times. Data were transferred to Excel, and for each data point the fluorescence intensity was expressed as percentage of the initial mean fluorescence intensity before bleaching. For analysis of the statistical significance of the observed differences, data from all independent experiments were pooled, mean values and S.E. were calculated, and a Student's t was test performed. A significant difference was assumed when p was <0.05. To study the ligand-independent and ligand-induced endocytosis of the CTR, we transfected HEK 293 cells with the CTR-FLAG construct and surface-labeled the cells with a cleavable biotin compound. Internalization of the receptor was allowed to proceed for different time periods, and the biotin remaining on the cell surface was stripped. The cells were lysed, and the FLAG-tagged CTR were immunoprecipitated and blotted with avidin (Fig.1 A) to detect the endocytosed CTR. We found that a substantial fraction of the CTR was internalized in the absence of ligand, whereas the presence of CT caused only a slightly higher amount of CTR internalization. To confirm this result with a more quantitative method, we performed a flow cytometry-based internalization assay. HEK 293 cells were transfected with C-terminally GFP-tagged, N-terminally HA-tagged CTR. After serum starving for at least 12 h, cells were incubated at 4 °C in the presence of an anti-HA antibody to label the extracellular HA tag. After this binding step, cells were quickly warmed to 37 °C and incubated in the presence or absence of 10 nm sCT for different time periods to allow endocytosis. The remaining anti-HA antibody bound to the CTR at the surface was then labeled with the PE-conjugated secondary antibody, and the cell-associated PE was quantified by FACS. This method also showed that a substantial fraction of the CTR on the surface was internalized in the absence of ligand, although more receptor was internalized in the presence of the ligand, with the difference statistically significant at 30 and 60 min (Fig.1 B). Co-expression of the dominant-negative dynamin I-K44A mutant, which blocks endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (18Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), failed to reduce tonic- or ligand-induced endocytosis of the CTR (data not shown). To determine whether the internalized CTR is recycled back to the cell surface, we allowed endocytosis of the CTR to proceed in the presence of the anti-HA antibody and then stripped surface-bound HA-antibody with an acid wash. The cells were then re-warmed for different time periods. Although the amount of antibody reappearing on the surface was clearly less than what had been endocytosed, consistent with the assumption by other investigators that non-covalently bound antibodies would be lost as the internalized receptor passes through acidified internal compartments (14Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we observed a clear increase in the amount of antibody on the cell surface after re-warming, indicating that at least some of the internalized CTR-antibody complex survived the passage through the endocytic vesicles and was recycled to the cell surface. The amount of antibody-decorated CTR on the cell surface reached a steady state by about 20 min. When CT was present during both internalization and recycling periods, significantly more of the CTR was recycled at 40 min (Fig. 1 C). These data, together with the result shown in Fig. 1 B, suggest that ligand binding induces both more internalization and more recycling of the CTR. We then determined the intracellular localization of the tonically internalized CTR, using a CTR fused at the C-terminal to GFP. Confocal microscopy showed substantial accumulation of the CTR-GFP within the cell (Fig. 2 A, left panel). The transferrin receptor, which is constitutively internalized and recycled back to the cell surface, colocalized with the CTR at the cell surface and in a vesicle-rich area in the center of the cell (data not shown). To determine whether the CTR was recycling to the cell surface from this region, we used the FLIP method in cells expressing the CTR-GFP by repeated photobleaching of the intracellular CTR-GFP accumulations. Fig. 2 shows a typical experiment. The intracellular accumulation of CTR-GFP was photobleached in one cell whereas an adjacent unbleached cell served as a control. The fluorescence intensity at the surface of the bleached cell began to decrease about 10 min after the initial bleaching and eventually decreased to about 50% of the initial level. The fluorescence of the neighboring unbleached cell was unchanged. This result strongly suggests that the constitutively endocytosed CTR is recycled back to the cell surface via the vesicle-rich area in the center of the cell. We suspected that an association of the C-terminal tail of the CTR with a cellular protein is necessary for targeting the CTR to the recycling compartment. To identify proteins that associate with the C-terminal tail of the CTR and might thereby promote the recycling of the receptor, we screened an osteoclast-like cell yeast two-hybrid library (17Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) with the CTR C-terminal tail (aa 398–474). Screening of 106 independent clones yielded five positive clones, one of which encoded the C-terminal region of filamin A, analogous to aa 2129–2647 of human filamin A, which contains the 19th to 24th immunoglobulin-like repeats and the second hinge region (19Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). Truncation mutants were used to map the region that binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the CTR. The fragments spanning aa 2129–2458 or aa 2129–2330 were active in the yeast two-hybrid assay, suggesting that the primary interacting region is between aa 2129 and 2330, corresponding to the immunoglobulin-like repeats 20 and 21. However, the activation was weaker than that of the original filamin clone, suggesting either that the smaller fragment folds differently or that sequences elsewhere in the original clone stabilized the binding to the CTR. The location of the filamin binding site on the CTR C-terminal domain was further refined using the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig.3 B). The strong activation in the reporter assays achieved by the complete C-terminal tail (aa 397–474) was seen only with a fragment spanning aa 422–474. The smaller fragment spanning aa 447–474 was also positive in both reporter assays, although less so than the full-length tail. This region contains no sequences that correspond to known protein binding domains such as PDZ, Src homology 2, or Src homology 3 domains. The CTR fragments more proximal to the seventh transmembrane domain (aa 397–447 and aa 397–422) also showed a consistent but much smaller activation in the reporter assays. The results suggest that aa 447–474 span the primary binding site for filamin but that other more proximal regions could be also contributing to stabilizing the filamin-CTR association. To show that the interaction of the CTR and filamin occurs in mammalian cells, we immunoprecipitated C-terminally FLAG-tagged CTR from HEK 293 cells and blotted for filamin (Fig. 3 C) or immunoprecipitated endogenous filamin and blotted for FLAG (data not shown). Both proteins were present in the immune complexes, regardless of the antibody used in the isolation, confirming an interaction of filamin and the CTR in mammalian cells. Treating the cells with sCT had no detectable effect on the amount of filamin that co-immunoprecipitated with the CTR (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the association between the CTR and filamin is not regulated by CTR-induced signaling effectors. To further confirm the CTR-filamin interaction, we examined the effect of overexpressing xpress©-tagged filamin repeats 20 to 23, the FLAG-tagged CTR cytoplasmic tail, or the FLAG-tagged CTR cytoplasmic tail plus 7th transmembrane domain on the interaction between the full-length CTR and filamin. Each of the fragments strongly reduced the co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous filamin with the Myc-tagged CTR (Fig. 3 D). To investigate the functional relevance of the association between filamin and the CTR we used M2 cells, which express no filamin A, and A7 cells, which are M2 cells stably transfected with filamin A (20Cunningham C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We transfected these cell lines with the CTR and analyzed CT-induced signal transduction by the CTR in the absence of filamin. We found no significant differences in the ligand-induced generation of cAMP, increase in intracellular calcium concentrations, or ERK phosphorylation in M2 and A7 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the association with filamin is not required for these signaling pathways of the CTR. However, Western blots indicated that there was less CTR in the M2 cells than in the A7 cells (Fig.4 A), and both confocal microscopy (Fig. 4 B) and FACS analysis (Fig. 4 C) indicated that there was less surface expression of the CTR in M2 cells than in the filamin-containing A7 cells. The lower expression of the CTR in the absence of filamin could result from lower de novo synthesis or from faster degradation of the CTR. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed a pulse-chase analysis of CTR degradation in M2 and A7 cells (Fig. 4 D). The synthesis of the CTR was similar in both cell lines (data not shown), but the extent of degradation of the CTR in the M2 cells was about twice that in A7 cells (Fig. 4 D, upper panel). Half of the labeled receptor in the M2 cells was degraded by 3 h, whereas more than 60% of the labeled receptor was still present in the A7 cells at 6 h (Fig. 4 D, upper panel). To rule out the possibility that the accelerated degradation was not specific for the CTR, we expressed another GPCR, the β2-adrenergic receptor, in M2 and A7 cells and examined its degradation by pulse-chase analysis. In contrast to the results obtained with the CTR, we found essentially no difference in the degradation of the β2-adrenergic receptor in the two cell lines (Fig. 4 D, lower panel). We next asked whether disrupting the filamin/CTR association also increased the degradation of the CTR. Filamin repeats 20–23 were co-expressed with the CTR in A7 and M2 cells, and the CTR degradation was measured in a pulse-chase assay (Fig. 4 E). The co-expression of the filamin fragment significantly increased the amount of degradation of the CTR in A7 cells. In contrast, and as expected, the expression of this fragment had little effect on the degradation of the CTR in M2 cells. We investigated the pathways involved in the degradation of the CTR by treating pulse-labele"

Recently it has been shown that RNS alone is sufficient and necessary to control Leishmania donovani infection in mice (Murray, H. W., and Nathan, C. F. (1999) J. Exp. Med. 189, 741–746). No enzymatic defense against RNS has been discovered inLeishmania to date.

Depending on the species involved, symptoms range from the self-healing cutaneous form (e.g. Leishmania major) to the fatal visceral form (e.g. Leishmania chagasi). The parasites are transmitted as promastigotes from the gut of its sandfly vector to mammalian host macrophages wherein they transform into amastigotes and proliferate. As a macrophage defense mechanism, nitric oxide (⋅NO),1 peroxynitrite (ONOO−), hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroperoxide (ROOH), and superoxide radicals ( O2⋅→) are produced in an attempt to destroy the parasites. These reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and oxygen species (ROS) readily react with proteins, DNA, and lipids and have been implicated in a wide variety of cell functions such as signal transduction, redox homeostasis, apoptosis, aging, activation of T lymphocytes, control of blood pressure, tumor progression, protection of eye tissue, and pathogen infection/defense (1Droge W.

Nathan C.F. J. Exp.

These studies suggest that further characterization of antioxidant molecules within Leishmaniaand the role that they play in parasite survival in the promastigote and amastigote stages could lead to the development of novel strategies to compromise parasite survival. Despite the ability of ROS and RNS to control Leishmaniainfection within macrophages, strains causing cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis persist long enough within macrophages to produce skin lesions or death. The molecular mechanisms by whichLeishmania circumvent the toxic effects of these reactive species is not fully understood. Some Leishmania molecules implicated in antioxidant defense against ROS include intracellular thiols (19Channon J.Y. Blackwell J.M.

Glutathione has recently been implicated in protecting L. major from ⋅NO-induced cytotoxicity (29Romao P.R. Fonseca S.G. Hothersall J.S. Noronha-Dutra A.A. Ferreira S.H. Cunha F.Q. Parasitology. 1999; 118: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To date, an enzymatic defense against RNS has not been identified inLeishmania. Peroxidoxins (or peroxiredoxins) are highly conserved enzymes found in all kingdoms ranging from bacteria to humans. 2-Cys peroxidoxin proteins are characterized by two conserved cysteine residues corresponding to approximately positions 47 and 170 and exist in nature predominantly as head-to-tail dimers, although high molecular weight multimers have been reported (25Barr S.D.

Dalton J.P. James E.R. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 139-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), with⋅OH recently being added to the substrate list (25Barr S.D. Gedamu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34279-34287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Peroxidoxins have also been implicated in detoxifying RNS in bacteria, yeast, and human cells (34Chen L. Xie Q.W. Nathan C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 795-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 35Wong C.M. Zhou Y. Ng R.W. Kung H.F. Jin D.Y. J. Biol.

We have previously isolated two peroxidoxin genes from L. chagasi that are differentially regulated, where LcPxn1 RNA transcripts are highly abundant in the amastigote stage and LcPxn2 transcripts are highly abundant in the promastigote stage (25Barr S.D. Gedamu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34279-34287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recombinant LcPxn1 protein was shown to detoxify H2O2, ROOH, and ⋅OH, but the mechanism of its action and the role that L. chagasi peroxidoxins play in detoxifying RNS and in parasite survival has not been characterized. In this report, we demonstrate that recombinant LcPxn1 protein, but not LcPxn2, can detoxify RNS in addition to ROS and show that LcPxn1 protects L. chagasi parasites from ROS- and RNS-mediated toxicity in vitro and enhances survival within macrophages. Furthermore, we have identified the key catalytic residues of LcPxn1 involved in detoxifying both ROS and RNS, which differ from peroxidoxins isolated from other organisms. LcPxn1 mutants C52A, C173A, and C52A/C173A were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis as previously described (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor NY1989Google Scholar). All peroxidoxin constructs were amplified using PCR, cloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences), and confirmed by sequencing. Transformed Escherichia coli DH5α cells were grown shaking at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin for 8 h, after which 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside was added to the culture and shaken overnight. GST fusion proteins were harvested by sonication and passed over a glutathione-agarose resin column as described by manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion proteins were cleaved with thrombin overnight at 24 °C and further purified, and protein purity (>95%) was verified on a SDS-PAGE gel. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL). Peroxide metabolism was measured as previously described (38Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm dithioerythritol (DTE), 50 μm H2O2 or 50 μm t-butyl hydroperoxide, and 0.125 μg/ml protein (preincubated with 0.2 mm DTE for 30 min at 37 °C). The reaction was stopped with the addition of 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v). 0.2 ml of 10 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate and 0.1 ml of 2.5 m potassium thiocyanate were added, and the peroxide concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 480 nm using known amounts of peroxide (1–50 μm) as a standard. All solutions were made fresh immediately before use. The production of ⋅OH and the ⋅OH-induced damage of 2-deoxy-d-ribose were measured as previously described (39Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). A 50-μl reaction mixture was set up to contain the following components to give the final concentrations as stated: 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 63 mmNaCl, 0.8 mm 2-deoxy-d-ribose, 0.2 mm DTE, and 0.125 μg/μl protein (proteins were preincubated in 0.2 mm DTE for 30 min at 37 °C). 21 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate was added, and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. 100 μl of thiobarbituric acid (1% w/v) and 100 μl of trichloroacetic acid (2.8% w/v) were then added to the mixture, and the mixture was boiled for 10 min. Fluorescence was measured in a 96-well plate using a SpectraMax Gemini plate reader (Molecular Devices) with six reads per well (excitation = 532 nm; emission = 553 nm). All solutions were made fresh immediately before use. 3 μmFeCl3, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm DTE were allowed to react for 10 min at 37 °C to generate ⋅OH as previously described (40Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Uhm T.B. Park J.W. Kim K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). 0.5 mg/ml protein (preincubated with 0.2 mm DTE for 30 min at 37 °C) was then added to the mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 2 μg of pGEM-2 plasmid (Promega) was then added to each tube, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The DNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide at a 100-V constant. All solutions were made fresh immediately before use. Reagent peroxynitrite was generated from acidified hydrogen peroxide and nitrite using the quenched-flow method (41Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 296-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and passaged over MnO2 column as previously described (42Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 322-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction assay was carried out as previously described (43Bhat V.B. Madyastha K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 μm DTE, 50 μm Pyrogallol Red (ε = 2.4 × 104mol−1.liter.cm−1) and 20 μmprotein at 25 °C. 20 μm of reagent peroxynitrite was added to the reaction for 5 min after which the absorbance at 542 nm was measured. All solutions were made fresh immediately before use. A reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 0.5 μg of intact pGEM-2 plasmid DNA, and 20 μmprotein was prepared as previously described (44Salgo M.G. Stone K. Squadrito G.L. Battista J.R. Pryor W.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). 50 μmreagent ONOO− was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The DNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide at a 100-V constant. All solutions were made fresh immediately before use. ⋅NO levels were measured as previously described (45Nims R.W. Cook J.C. Krishna M.C. Christodoulou D. Poore C.M. Miles A.M. Grisham M.B. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 100 mm sodium nitroprusside and 0.125 μg/ml protein were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 5 min. 2,2′-Azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was then added to the reaction mixture (5 mm final concentration), and the ⋅NO-induced oxidation of ABTS to ABTS+ was measured by monitoring the change in absorbance at 420 nm at room temperature. All solutions were made fresh immediately before use. TheLeishmania-specific expression vector pX63NEO (kindly provided by Dr. S. M. Beverley, Washington University in St. Louis, MO) was used to express LcPxn1, LcPxn1-C52A, LcPxn1-C173A, and LcPxn1-C52A/C173A in L. chagasi. The coding regions were PCR-amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-ACCAGGGATCC ATGTCCTGCGGTGACGCC-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-ACATCGGATCC TTACTTATTGTGATCGACCTTCAGGCC-3′) with incorporated BamHI sites (underlined). The pX63NEO vector and the PCR products were digested with BamHI, ligated, and sequenced for the correct orientation. To express LcPxn1 and LcPxn2 as GFP fusions, the coding region of GFP was PCR-amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-GTCGGATCC ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGG-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-CCGGAATTC GTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCC-3′). The stop codon of GFP was mutated from TAA to TAC (boldface). The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and purified. The coding region of LcPxn1 was PCR-amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-GTCGAATTC ATGTCCTGCGGTGACGCC-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-ACATCTCTAGA TTACTTATTGTGATCGACCTTCAGGCC-3′). The coding region of LcPxn2 was PCR- amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-GTCGAATTC ATGTCCTGCGGTGACGCC-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-GTCTCTAGA TTACTGTTTGCTGAAGTACC-3′). The PCR products of LcPxn1 and LcPxn2 were each digested withEcoRI and XbaI and purified. PCR products of GFP and LcPxn1 or LcPxn2 were mixed and ligated and cloned into theBamHI and XbaI restriction sites of the pXNEO vector (provided by Dr. S. M. Beverley). All constructs were re-confirmed by sequencing at the University of Calgary DNA Sequencing Laboratory. To detect GFP-LcPxn fusion proteins, 8 × 109 parasites were pelleted by centrifugation and washed once in ice-cold PBS. Parasites were resuspended in 2.5 ml of pre-chilled lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100) and placed on ice for 30 min. Lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × gfor 10 min and then 10,000 × g for a further 10 min at 4 °C. 40 μl of the supernatant was boiled in sample buffer (2% SDS, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Western blotting was performed using anti-GFP (1:2500) antibodies and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). To compare the overexpression of LcPxn1 and LcPxn1 mutants (Fig. 2), 5 × 106 parasites of each transfectant were washed in PBS, freeze-thawed, and boiled in sample buffer for 10 min before loading onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Samples were subjected to Western blot as described above with anti-LcPxn1 antibodies. Monoclonal antibody (E7) to β-tubulin was purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa. The [3H]uracil incorporation assay was performed as previously described (5Zarley J.H. Britigan B.E. Wilson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Chan J. Fujiwara T. Brennan P. McNeil M. Turco S.J. Sibille J.C. Snapper M. Aisen P. Bloom B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, triplicate samples of 2 × 106 midlog phase promastigotes or stationary phase promastigotes were washed with and resuspended in 100 μl of Krebs-Ringer phosphate-glucose solution, pH 7.4 (0.154 mNaCl, 0.154 m KCl, 0.11 m CaCl2, 0.154 m MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1m Na2HPO4·2H2O, pH 7.4, 10 mm glucose). Parasites were exposed for 2 h at 26 °C to either reagent 100 μmH2O2, 100 μm t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH), 5 mm sodium nitroprusside, 1 mm ONOO− or the ⋅OH-generating system.⋅OH was generated as previously described (20Chan J. Fujiwara T. Brennan P. McNeil M. Turco S.J. Sibille J.C. Snapper M. Aisen P. Bloom B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2453-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The⋅OH-generating system contained 1.0 mm xanthine, 2.4 × 10−2 units/ml xanthine oxidase, and 30 μm Fe2+ for 90 min at 26 °C. The parasites were then grown for another 2 h at 24 °C in the presence of 2 μCi of [3H]uracil (Amersham Biosciences) for measurement of RNA synthesis. The parasites were solubilized in 2 ml of solubilization solution (0.1% SDS, 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml uracil) for 15 min on ice. After 15 min, 200 μl of trichloroacetic acid (100% w/v) was added to the tubes, and then they were placed on ice for 15 min. Samples were then applied to Whatman GF-C glass microfiber filters and washed with 10 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v) and then with 10 ml of ice-cold ethanol (95%) using a vacuum apparatus. Filters were air-dried, placed in 2 ml of scintillation fluid, and monitored for incorporated [3H]uracil for 5 min. Infection of U937 cells from human origin (American Type Cell Collection, Rockville, MD) was carried out as previously described (47Streit J.A. Donelson J.E. Agey M.W. Wilson M.E. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1810-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). U937 cells were seeded at a concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in eight-chamber slides and differentiated into adherent macrophages by treatment with 7.5 ng of phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma) per milliliter of RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) (RPMI) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 72 h. Non-adherent cells were washed three to five times with warm RPMI media followed by incubation with L. chagasi parasites at a parasite to U937 cell ratio of 10:1 for 6 h. Non-engulfed parasites were washed away three to five times with warm RPMI and incubated in fresh RPMI media. The level of infection in 200 U937 cells was determined at 12, 24, and 48 h by optical microscopy following Diff Quick staining of cell preparations (48Muyombwe A. Olivier M. Ouellette M. Papadopoulou B. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Values are expressed as the average number of parasites per infected U937 cell. Assays containing reagent ONOO− or the⋅NO donor sodium nitroprusside and target molecules susceptible to RNS-induced oxidation were used to test whether recombinant LcPxn1 protein can detoxify RNS. Pyrogallol Red (PR) has been previously shown to be bleached by ONOO− but not by decomposed ONOO−, nitrite, or nitrate (49Balavoine G.G. Geletii Y.V. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 40-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). When added to the reaction mixture, recombinant LcPxn1 and the ONOO−scavenger Trolox significantly (p < 0.001) protected PR from bleaching compared with boiled LcPxn1, GST, and BSA controls (Fig. 1 A). DNA has also been shown to be a target of ONOO−, which converts the supercoiled DNA into a slower migrating nicked DNA (50Szabo C. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1753-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results observed above, LcPxn1 protein and Trolox were able to protect supercoiled DNA from ONOO−-induced nicking, whereas boiled LcPxn1, GST, and BSA were unable to provide protection (Fig. 1 A, inset). Known scavengers of H2O2, ⋅OH, ⋅NO, and O2⋅→ (catalase, mannitol, PTIO, and superoxide dismutase, respectively) did not significantly protect the PR from bleaching or the supercoiled DNA from nicking (data not shown). Recombinant LcPxn2 protein did not significantly protect PR (Fig. 1 A) or the supercoiled DNA from nicking (Fig. 1 A, inset) compared with boiled LcPxn2, GST, or BSA controls. A colorimetric assay for measuring ⋅NO produced from sodium nitroprusside was used to test the ability of recombinant LcPxn1 protein to protect ABTS from ⋅NO-induced oxidation into the strongly absorbing green ABTS+ complex (45Nims R.W. Cook J.C. Krishna M.C. Christodoulou D. Poore C.M. Miles A.M. Grisham M.B. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When added to the reaction mixture, LcPxn1 protein and the ⋅NO scavenger PTIO significantly (p < 0.0001) protected ABTS from oxidation compared with boiled LcPxn1 and GST controls (Fig.1 B). There was no significant difference in protection between LcPxn2 protein and boiled LcPxn2 or GST controls. As further controls, scavengers of H2O2, ⋅OH, ONOO−, and O2⋅→ (catalase, mannitol, Trolox, and superoxide dismutase, respectively) did not significantly protect ABTS from oxidation (data not shown). Taken together, the above data suggest that recombinant LcPxn1 protein is capable of detoxifying RNS whereas LcPxn2 does not appear to detoxify RNS. The two cysteine residues corresponding to Cys-47 and Cys-170 in all 2-Cys peroxidoxins are highly conserved among all organisms. The amino terminus Cys-47 has been implicated as the catalytic residue in the detoxification of H2O2and alkyl hydroperoxides (51Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 52Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and peroxynitrite (36Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To identify the catalytic residues in Leishmania LcPxn1, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding conserved Cys-52 and Cys-173 residues and constructed three recombinant LcPxn1 protein mutants containing Cys to Ala mutations (LcPxn1-C52A, LcPxn1-C173A, and LcPxn1- C52A/C173A). In studying the amino acid residues involved in detoxifying ROS, we found that LcPxn1-C52A protein failed to detoxify H2O2, t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH), and ⋅OH (p < 0.001 in each case) compared with wild-type LcPxn1 protein (Fig. 1, C, D, andE, respectively). In addition, LcPxn1-C52A protein failed to protect supercoiled DNA from ⋅OH-induced nicking (Fig.1 E, inset). Because there was no significant ROS-detoxifying activity by LcPxn1-C52A compared with boiled LcPxn1 or GST, Cys-52 appears to be essential for detoxifying ROS, which is consistent with previous findings with other peroxidoxins. There was no significant difference observed in the ability of LcPxn1-C173A to detoxify H2O2 (Fig. 1 C) or⋅OH (Fig. 1 E) compared with wild-type LcPxn1 and LcPxn1-C173A protected supercoiled DNA from ⋅OH-induced nicking (Fig. 1 E, inset). In contrast, LcPxn1-C173A did not demonstrate significant tBOOH-detoxifying activity compared with boiled LcPxn1 and GST (Fig. 1 D). Taken together, these results suggest that the Cys-173 residue is not essential for detoxifying H2O2 or ⋅OH but is essential in detoxifying tBOOH. LcPxn1-C52A/C173A protein did not demonstrate any significant activity against H2O2, tBOOH, or⋅OH compared with boiled LcPxn1 and GST and did not prevent supercoiled DNA from ⋅OH-induced nicking. LcPxn2 protein was found to detoxify only H2O2. It did not demonstrate significant activity toward tBOOH or ⋅OH (p > 0.05), nor did it protect DNA from⋅OH-induced nicking compared with controls (Fig. 1,C–E). In studying the amino acid residues involved in detoxifying RNS, we found that LcPxn1-C52A protein exhibited similar levels of activity in detoxifying ONOO− and protecting supercoiled DNA from ONOO−-induced nicking compared with wild-type LcPxn1 protein (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that Cys-52 is not essential for detoxifying ONOO−.

These proteins have been implicated in the inhibition of metastasis; however, the mechanisms involved have not been described. We demonstrated that overexpression of WISP-1 in H460 lung cancer cells inhibited lung metastasis and in vitro cell invasion and motility. We investigated the possibility that WISP-1 may regulate activation of Rac, a small GTPase important for cytoskeletal reorganizations during motility. In an indirect assay, WISP-1-expressing cells exhibited marked reduction in Rac activation compared with control cells. Blocking antibodies to αvβ5 and α1 integrins restored Rac activation in WISP-1 cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of WISP-1 on Rac lies downstream of integrins. Constitutively activated Rac mutant (RacG12V) was transfected into WISP-1 cells to restore Rac activation and these WISP-1/RacG12V transfectants were used for further studies. We performed microarray and real-time PCR analyses to identify genes involved in invasion that may be differentially regulated by WISP-1. Here, we showed decreased expression of metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) in WISP-1 cells compared with controls but increased expression in WISP-1/RacG12V cells. In an invasion assay across collagen I, an MMP-1 target matrix, WISP-1 cells were significantly less invasive compared with controls, whereas WISP-1/RacG12V cells showed elevated invasion levels.

CCN proteins are modular in structure, consisting of an N-terminal signal sequence followed by domains with sequence similarity to insulin-like growth factor-binding protein, von Willebrand factor C, thrombospondin type 1, and cysteine knot at the C terminus with the exception of WISP-2, which lacks the C terminus region (6Perbal B. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 57-79Google Scholar).WISP-1 and WISP-2 were isolated as differentially expressed genes from a subtractive hybridization of transcripts between Wnt-1-overexpressing C57MG mammary epithelial cells and control cells (5Pennica D.

Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14717-141722Google Scholar). Studies on the promoter of WISP-1 showed that cAMP-response element-binding protein binding sites played an important role in the transcriptional activation of WISP-1, while lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor binding sites characteristic of β-catenin signaling played a minor role (7Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref Google Scholar). WISP-3 was identified by homologous sequence searches; however, the regulation of its gene expression remains unknown (5Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Welsh J.W. Roy M.A. Lawrence D.A. Lee J. Brush J. Taneyhill L.A. Deuel B. Lew M. Watanabe C. Cohen R.L. Melhem M.F. Finley G.G. Quirke P. Goddard A.D. Hillan K.J. Gurney A.L. Botstein D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1707-1715Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor (2O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Google Scholar, 9Latinkic B.V. O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3261-3267Google Scholar), whereas CTGF appears to be regulated mainly by TGF-β (10Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Google Scholar). Nov, on the other hand, is down-regulated under serum conditions (11Scholz G. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 481-486Google Scholar).CCN proteins exhibit a variety of biological activities. CYR61 induces cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion through activation of αVβ3 integrins in endothelial cells (4Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Google Scholar). CTGF plays a key role downstream of TGF-β and SMAD signaling and stimulates production of fibronectin and collagen, important for wound closure (10Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Google Scholar, 12Duncan M.R. Frazier K.S. Abramson S. Williams S. Klapper H. Huang X. Grotendorst G.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1774-1786Google Scholar). Several members of this family of growth factors appear to have important roles in the development and homeostasis of bone and cartilage. The expression of CYR61 correlates with the early stage chondrocytic differentiation of limb bud mesenchyme (11Scholz G. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 481-486Google Scholar), whereas CTGF and Nov are expressed at a later stage during cartilage development. In addition, CYR61 promotes chondrogenesis of limb bud mesenchyme in in vitro cultures (13Wong M. Kireeva M. Kolesnikova T. et al.Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Google Scholar). Wnts are important developmental genes, known to regulate chondrocytic differentiation (14Hartmann C. Tabin C.J. Development. 2000; 127: 3141-3159Google Scholar), and WISP-1 and WISP-2 may play a role downstream of Wnt signaling in regulating this process. CCN proteins are also linked to degenerative cartilage diseases. Mutations in the gene of WISP-3 are associated with progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia, a disease characterized, in part, by the degeneration of cartilage (15Hurvitz J.R. Suwairi W.M. Van Hul W. El-Shanti H. Superti-Furga A. Roudier J. Holderbaum D. Pauli R.M. Herd J.K. Van Hul E.V. Rezai-Delui H. Legius E. Le Merrer M. Al-Alami J. Bahabri S.A. Warman M.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 94-98Google Scholar).CCN family members have also been implicated in tumorigenesis and metaplasia. Genomic copies and mRNA of WISP-1 and mRNA of WISP-3 were found to be significantly increased in colon carcinoma cell lines and in colon tumors compared with normal mucosa (4Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Google Scholar). The oncogenic properties of WISP-1 were apparent in normal rat kidney fibroblasts overexpressing the gene, which demonstrated morphological transformation and increased rates of cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in nude mice (10Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Google Scholar). WISP-1 also protected cells from p53-dependent apoptosis through activation of AKT, up-regulation of Bcl-XL, and inhibition of cytochromec release (16Fei S. Overholtzer M. Besser D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 46-57Google Scholar).While these proteins exert transforming and growth stimulatory effects on some cell types, they can also cause inhibition of growth and metastasis of tumor or transformed cells. The mouse equivalent of WISP-1, mELM1, was shown to be down-regulated in highly metastatic mouse melanoma cells. Consistently, upon mELM1 transfection and expression, the cells became less metastatic (17Hashimoto Y. Shindo-Okada N. Tani M. Nagamachi Y. Takeuchi K. Shiroishi T. Toma H. Yokota J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 289-296Google Scholar). In a differential display study, the expression of rCOP-1, the rat equivalent of WISP-2, was significantly down-regulated in cells transformed by both activated H-Ras and an inactivated mutant of p53. When rCOP-1 was reintroduced into transformed cells, a high incidence of death occurred in the transfected cells (18Zhang R. Averboukh L. Zhu W. Zhang H. Jo H. Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. Pardee A.B. Liang P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6131-6141Google Scholar). In Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts, Nov was shown to be down-regulated in a transcriptional and also post-transcriptional manner (11Scholz G. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 481-486Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of Nov was found to inhibit the growth of glioma cells (19Gupta N. Wang H. McLeod T.L. Naus C.C. Kyurkchiev S. Advani S. Yu J. Perbal B. Weichselbaum R.R. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 293-299Google Scholar). In non-small-cell lung cancer cells, CYR61 was shown to have tumor suppressor effects, and its expression was repressed in lung cancer samples compared with normal counterparts (20Tong X. Xie D. O'Kelly J. Miller C.W. Muller-Tidow C. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47709-47714Google Scholar).In the present paper, we showed that overexpression of WISP-1 in H460 cells reduced metastasis of these cells to the lungs in nude mice.In vitro studies demonstrated reduced invasion of WISP-1-expressing cells through MatrigelTM (BD Biosciences), a derivative of basement membranes. Metastasis and invasion require, in part, the migration of cells across the substratum. We showed that WISP-1-expressing cells were impaired in migration within Boyden chambers in response to serum. Biochemical pathways that regulate cell migration invoke the activation of small Rho-like GTPases, which function to reorganize cytoskeletal elements. WISP-1-expressing cells demonstrated marked inhibition of Rac activation. In the presence of blocking antibodies to integrins and WISP-1, Rac activation was restored. Transfection of a constitutively active Rac construct, RacG12V, into WISP-1 cells augmented the invasion and motility of these cells. Microarray analysis and real-time PCR showed that metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression was reduced in WISP-1 cells but was increased above control levels in RacG12V-transfected WISP-1 cells. These cells also showed increased invasion through collagen I, a substrate of MMP-1. These results were discussed in the context of WISP-1/integrin interactions and the effects on cell invasion and metastatic potential of lung cancer cells.DISCUSSIONMembers of the CCN family play important roles in development during chondrogenesis, skeletogenesis, and neurogenesis. In adults, they may serve to maintain matrix structure and composition and tissue homeostasis. How the natural functions of CCN proteins relate to cancer and other diseases is not well understood. In addition, the correlation between the incidence and progression of cancer with the expression of CCN proteins cannot be generalized across different types of cancer. This may be due to the presence of distinct cohorts of receptors and/or variable regulation of the ligands at the cell surface, such as cleavage by proteases, in a cell type-specific manner. In addition, the response of CCN proteins to a given environment is strongly influenced by its multidomain structure, which may regulate the formation of variable complexes of binding partners.In cancer, a destructive turn occurs when tumor cells acquire the ability to metastasize by spreading and colonizing host tissues. Loss of cadherins and cell adhesion contribute to the breakdown of a coherent epithelial organization. Of the two forms of highly metastatic cancer, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the latter conforms to this model and demonstrates a tendency to down-regulate the expression of cadherins (21Garber M.E. Troyanskaya O.G. Schluens K. Petersen S. Thaesler Z. Pacyna-Gengelbach M. van de Rijn M. Rosen G.D. Perou C.M. Whyte R.I. Altman R.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Petersen I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13784-13789Google Scholar). Tumor cells invade and migrate across the extracellular matrix and blood vessels, processes involving chemotactic and chemokinetic responses. While chemotaxis relies mainly on the paracrine expression of growth factors, chemokinesis occurs through autocrine stimulation. NSCLC cells, for example, respond to a number of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, insulin-like growth factor 2, and hepatocyte growth factor, which play a role in inducing chemotaxis (22Bredin C.G. Liu Z. Hauzenberger D. Klominek J. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 338-345Google Scholar). In a checkerboard analysis, H460, a NSCLC cell line with some neuroendocrine characteristics, responded in a chemotactic manner under low serum conditions (data not shown). SCLC, on the other hand, does not appear to be chemotactic but is chemokinetic through autocrine expression of neuroendocrine regulatory factors, such as bombesin (gastrin-releasing peptide), and stimulation of endogenous receptors (23Wistuba I.I. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 3-13Google Scholar).The mechanism of cell invasion involve both the secretion metalloproteinases, which digest basement membrane (24Noël A. Gilles C. Bajou K. Devy L. Kebers F. Lewalle J.M. Maquoi E. Munaut C. Remacle A. Foi-dart J.M. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 221-239Google Scholar), and the motility of cells. Motile cells adopt a polar morphology in the form of distinctive front and trailing edges. The motility of cells also require the cycling of localized attachment and detachment from the surface of matrices. The Rho family of GTPases has been characterized for their involvement in cellular actin reorganizations during the motility of cells (25Ridley A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 24-30Google Scholar). Small GTPases cycle between an active and inactive state through the hydrolysis of GTP. Cdc42 regulates pseudopod extensions, whereas Rac and Rho initiate the formation of lamellae and the establishment of stress fibers, respectively. The activities of Cdc42 and Rac propel cell motion by polarizing cells into a motile phenotype. Rho, on the other hand, generally, stabilized stress fibers and focal adhesions, thereby inhibiting cell motility (25Ridley A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 24-30Google Scholar).In this paper, we studied the effects of WISP-1, a Wnt-1-inducible factor belonging to the CCN family, on the metastasis and invasion of lung cancer cells. When H460 and H1299 lung cancer cells were transfected with WISP-1, lamellar structures were largely reduced, and the cells were less spread on the surface of tissue culture plates (16Fei S. Overholtzer M. Besser D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 46-57Google Scholar). 2L. L. Soon, T.-A. Yie, A. Shvarts, A. J. Levine, F. Su, and K.-M. Tchou-Wong, unpublished data. In vitromotility and invasion of WISP-1-expressing H460 and H1299 as well as the in vivo metastasis of H460/WISP-1 cells were significantly reduced compared with vector control cells. These results prompted the hypothesis that the activation of Rac may be inhibited by WISP-1, resulting in the reduction of lamellar structures, cell motility, and invasion.In an indirect assay for Rac activation, we observed a marked reduction in the activation of Rac for WISP-1 transfectants of both H460 and H1299 cells compared with control cells. Upon transfection of a constitutively active Rac mutant, RacG12V, increases in the motility and invasion of cells were observed for H460/WISP-1/RacG12V cells, demonstrating that the down-regulation of Rac activity by WISP-1 was responsible for the inhibition of cell motility and invasion.The activation of Rac occurs downstream of several pathways including integrin/Src kinase (26Suzuki-Inoue K. Yatomi Y. Asazuma N. Kainoh M. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2001; 98: 3708-3716Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor signaling (27Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 580-586Google Scholar). In addition, the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, Gi (28Ueda H. Morishita R. Yamauchi J. Itoh H. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6846-6852Google Scholar), and cAMP-dependent pathways (29O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47895-47900Google Scholar) have also been implicated in Rac-mediated cell spreading and migration. To understand how WISP-1 may be inhibiting Rac, a number of inhibitors were used in the Rac activation assay. We found that none of the inhibitors to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Src, G-proteins, and calmodulin were able to inhibit endogenous Rac activity significantly in control cells (data not shown). On the other hand, when inhibitory antibodies to several integrins were used, Rac activation in WISP-1 cells was restored to almost wild-type levels, while there was no effect on control cells. Similar observations were made using blocking antibodies to WISP-1. Therefore, the down-regulation of Rac activation in WISP-1 cells may be attributed to the interactions of WISP-1 with integrins.In addition, a consequence of WISP-1 overexpression is the down-regulation of MMP-1, a metalloproteinase involved in lung cancer metastasis, which may occur through WISP-1 inhibition of Rac activation. Consistently, the invasion of cells across collagen I, a substrate of MMP-1, was compromised in WISP-1-transfected cells but was increased in the WISP-1/RacG12V transfectants.It is unclear how WISP-1 may regulate Rac function through integrins. The mechanism may involve a shift in the balance of activatory and inhibitory signals. Mechanosensory effects mediated through integrins may produce cytoskeletal-mediated signaling operating through actin-myosin and microtubular dynamics (30Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the inhibition may occur through changes in activity of Rac regulators. As an example, mechanical stresses applied to fibroblasts resulted in the inhibition of Rac activity and lamellipodia formation, with implications that a guanine exchange factor may be responsible (31Katsumi A. Milanini J. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Kaunas R. Chien S. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 153-164Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of WISP-1 on integrin signaling may be multitiered. On one level, the activating functions of integrins may be altered or absent. On another level, a set of alternative reactions may occur, triggered by cell shape and cytoskeletal changes.Integrins are the only known receptors for CCN proteins, and receptor activation may produce a variety of effects. For example, interaction of CYR61 with integrin α6β1 promotes cell adhesion and chemotaxis in vascular smooth muscle cells (32Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Lindner V. Chen N. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1441-1450Google Scholar). In human skin fibroblasts, CYR61 stimulates migration and proliferation through integrin αvβ5 and integrin αvβ3, respectively (33Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Google Scholar). In contrast, when CYR61 was overexpressed in lung cancer cells, tumor growth was suppressed (20Tong X. Xie D. O'Kelly J. Miller C.W. Muller-Tidow C. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47709-47714Google Scholar).Similarly, WISP-1 was reported to have tumorigenic properties when expressed in normal rat kidney fibroblasts (7Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref Google Scholar), whereas in melanoma cells, contrasting effects were observed and WISP-1-expression resulted in the inhibition of tumorigenesis and metastasis. Consistent with the latter, we demonstrated that expression of WISP-1 in H460 lung cancer cells inhibited lung metastasis. In mammary cancer tissue from Wnt-1 transgenic mice, mesenchymal cells demonstrated high levels of expression of WISP-1, whereas in cancer cells, low levels or negative staining was observed. This suggests that the secretion of WISP-1 by stromal cells may have positive regulatory effects on cancer cells through paracrine signaling (5Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Welsh J.W. Roy M.A. Lawrence D.A. Lee J. Brush J. Taneyhill L.A. Deuel B. Lew M. Watanabe C. Cohen R.L. Melhem M.F. Finley G.G. Quirke P. Goddard A.D. Hillan K.J. Gurney A.L. Botstein D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14717-141722Google Scholar). On the other hand, autocrine WISP-1 production by cancer cells may result in the inhibition of tumorigenesis and metastasis, and therefore, its expression may be down-regulated in cancer. It is plausible that there may be differences between cancer and normal cells in the processing and presentation of WISP-1 on the cell surface. This in turn may cause variability in WISP-1 interactions with integrins that result in specific signaling and biological outcomes in their respective cell types. Some support for this comes from our unpublished data showing that the secreted form of WISP-1 from H460 lung cancer cells is highly glycosylated and that the pattern of glycosylation differs between cancer cells and normal fibroblasts. Investigations are being carried out to evaluate the functional significance of the data. Finally, further studies will be needed to determine if the expression or processing of WISP-1 in tumors may have prognostic value in predicting cancer metastasis. Wnt-induced secreted protein-1 (WISP-1)1 is a member of a family of cysteine-rich proteins called CCN factors that include connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), cysteine-rich 61 (CYR61), nephroblastoma overexpressed (Nov), WISP-2, and WISP-3 (1Bradham D.M.

Studies on the promoter of WISP-1 showed that cAMP-response element-binding protein binding sites played an important role in the transcriptional activation of WISP-1, while lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor binding sites characteristic of β-catenin signaling played a minor role (7Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref Google Scholar). WISP-3 was identified by homologous sequence searches; however, the regulation of its gene expression remains unknown (5Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Welsh J.W. Roy M.A. Lawrence D.A. Lee J. Brush J.

Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1707-1715Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor (2O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Google Scholar, 9Latinkic B.V. O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3261-3267Google Scholar), whereas CTGF appears to be regulated mainly by TGF-β (10Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Google Scholar). Nov, on the other hand, is down-regulated under serum conditions (11Scholz G. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 481-486Google Scholar). CCN proteins exhibit a variety of biological activities. CYR61 induces cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion through activation of αVβ3 integrins in endothelial cells (4Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Google Scholar). CTGF plays a key role downstream of TGF-β and SMAD signaling and stimulates production of fibronectin and collagen, important for wound closure (10Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Google Scholar, 12Duncan M.R. Frazier K.S. Abramson S. Williams S. Klapper H. Huang X. Grotendorst G.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1774-1786Google Scholar). Several members of this family of growth factors appear to have important roles in the development and homeostasis of bone and cartilage. The expression of CYR61 correlates with the early stage chondrocytic differentiation of limb bud mesenchyme (11Scholz G. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 481-486Google Scholar), whereas CTGF and Nov are expressed at a later stage during cartilage development. In addition, CYR61 promotes chondrogenesis of limb bud mesenchyme in in vitro cultures (13Wong M. Kireeva M. Kolesnikova T. et al.Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Google Scholar). Wnts are important developmental genes, known to regulate chondrocytic differentiation (14Hartmann C. Tabin C.J. Development. 2000; 127: 3141-3159Google Scholar), and WISP-1 and WISP-2 may play a role downstream of Wnt signaling in regulating this process. CCN proteins are also linked to degenerative cartilage diseases. Mutations in the gene of WISP-3 are associated with progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia, a disease characterized, in part, by the degeneration of cartilage (15Hurvitz J.R. Suwairi W.M. Van Hul W. El-Shanti H. Superti-Furga A. Roudier J. Holderbaum D. Pauli R.M. Herd J.K. Van Hul E.V. Rezai-Delui H. Legius E. Le Merrer M. Al-Alami J. Bahabri S.A. Warman M.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 94-98Google Scholar). CCN family members have also been implicated in tumorigenesis and metaplasia. Genomic copies and mRNA of WISP-1 and mRNA of WISP-3 were found to be significantly increased in colon carcinoma cell lines and in colon tumors compared with normal mucosa (4Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Google Scholar). The oncogenic properties of WISP-1 were apparent in normal rat kidney fibroblasts over"

Widely expressed in mammalian brain, they are involved in modulation of the glutamate transmission. By means of transfection of mGluR5 receptors in COS-7 cells and primary hippocampal neurons in culture followed by immunocytochemistry and quantitative image analysis and by a biochemical assay, we have studied the internalization of mGluR5 splice variants. mGluR5a and -5b were endocytosed in COS-7 cells as well as in axons and dendrites of cultured neurons. Endocytosis occurred even in the absence of receptor activity, because receptors mutated in the glutamate binding site were still internalized as well as receptors in which endogenous activity had been inhibited by an inverse agonist. We have measured a constitutive rate of endocytosis of 11.77/min for mGluR5a. We report for the first time the endocytosis pathway of mGluR5. Internalization of mGluR5 is not mediated by clathrin-coated pits. Indeed, inhibition of this pathway by Eps15 dominant negative mutants did not disturb their endocytosis. However, the large GTPase dynamin 2 is implicated in the endocytosis of mGluR5 in COS-7. mGluR5 is the first shown member of the group C G-protein coupled receptor family internalized by a nonconventional pathway.

It exerts its effects by binding to ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)1 belong to the seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Together with calcium-sensing receptors, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor B (GABAB) and pheromone, olfactory and taste receptors, mGluRs form the third family of GPCRs (group C) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Google Scholar and2Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 465-484Google Scholar). They have little homology with other GPCRs from groups A and B and are characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular domain that binds glutamate. Eight genes code for mGluRs that generate more than 15 proteins by alternative splicing. On the basis of their sequence similarity, pharmacology, and signal transduction mechanisms, mGluRs have been classified into three groups. Group 1 consists of mGluR1 and mGluR5 that are preferentially positively coupled to phospholipase C via Gq/11 proteins. mGluRs of group 2 and 3 are negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. Group 1 mGluRs are expressed in neuronal and glial cells within the brain, and receptor activation has been implicated in several forms of synaptic plasticity. Currently, very little is known about the targeting and trafficking mechanisms of mGluRs in cells. During the last few years, attention has focused mainly on endocytosis of a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors: the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Internalization of AMPA receptors in response to various stimuli is an important process for the rapid attenuation of neurotransmission during synaptic plasticity (3Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 315-324Google Scholar). By different approaches, it has been shown that AMPA receptors are endocytosed by a clathrin-coated pit-mediated process (4Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H. Luscher C. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14112-14117Google Scholar, 5Man Y.H. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Google Scholar, 6Wang Y.T. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2000; 25: 635-647Google Scholar). We are interested in understanding the endocytic properties of mGluR5. Alternative splicing of the mGluR5 gene generates two splice variants: mGluR5a and mGluR5b, which differ only by a 32-amino acid insertion in the intracellular C tail domain of mGluR5b. There is no functional difference between them except that mGluR5b seems to be the predominant form expressed in brain of adult animals (7Romano C. van den Pol A.N. O'Malley K.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 367: 403-412Google Scholar). Both splice variants as well as mGluR1a interact with the family of Homer proteins (2Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 465-484Google Scholar). The first identified member of this family, Homer1a, is a product of an immediate early gene expression, which is induced during intense neuronal activities. All Homers can bind to mGluR5 and mGluR1a by their amino terminus and also to other proteins of the postsynaptic density. Although most GPCRs undergo endocytosis, the conditions and mechanisms of this process can vary from receptor to receptor. Many of them are endocytosed via the clathrin-coated pit pathway but some are not (8Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 89: 139-147Google Scholar, 9Dautry-Varsat A. Marsh M. Endocytosis. Oxford University Press Inc., New York2001: 27-57Google Scholar, 10Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Google Scholar). Some have an agonist-induced endocytosis, and some are continuously endocytosed even in the absence of stimulation. These different behaviors should serve distinct physiological functions. By using transfection of epitope-tagged mGluR5 receptors in COS-7 cells and hippocampal cultured neurons we found that mGluR5a and -5b are endocytosed constitutively by a clathrin-independent pathway. We obtained anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; anti-Myc polyclonal antibody and anti-mGluR5 from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-HA polyclonal antibody from MBL (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.); anti-MAP2 polyclonal from Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd.; anti-α-adaptin monoclonal clone AP6 from Affinity Bioreagents Inc.; and Cy3-, Cy5-, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, minimum essential medium, F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Glutamax, and fetal bovine serum came from Invitrogen, and other supplements were from Sigma. 2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) was a kind gift from Dr. Rainer Kühn (NovartisPharma, Basel, Switzerland). Human holotransferrin was coupled to rhodamine (Rh-Tf) as described in Hémar et al. (11Hémar A. Olivo J.-C. Saffrich R. Williamson E. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9026-9034Google Scholar). Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin was from Pierce, and the streptavidin-agarose beads were from Sigma. The epitope-tagged rat mGluR5a and mGluR5b expression plasmids were constructed using, as a template, the pRKG5a and pRKG5b plasmids that encode mGluR5a and mGluR5b (12Joly C. Gomeza J. Brabet I. Curry K. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3970-3981Google Scholar). An MluI restriction site was inserted just after the signal peptide for the N-terminal epitope-tagged receptor (between the Ser22 and Ser23 codons of mGluR5a) using a PCR overlap extension method. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides coding the c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) or the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) with MluI cohesive ends were synthesized and used to introduce the c-Myc or the HA into the N-terminal MluI site. Using this method, we generated the plasmids pRKG5aNmyc (mGluR5-myc in Ref. 13Sergé A. Fourgeaud L. Hémar A. Choquet D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3910-3920Google Scholar), pRKG5bNmyc, pRKG5aNHA, and pRKG5bNHA encoding mGluR5aNmyc, mGluR5bNmyc, mGluR5aNHA, and mGluR5bNHA, respectively. By determining inositol phosphate accumulation in transfected cells as described previously (14Mary S. Gomeza J. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 425-432Google Scholar), we verified that the epitope tagging changed neither the G protein coupling nor the pharmacological profile of the receptor (TableI). Plasmids encoding mGluR5aNHA mutated in the glutamate binding site were obtained by using the QuikChange® strategy. Plasmids encoding the GFP-tagged dynamins, Dyn1-GFP, Dyn1K44A-GFP, Dyn2-GFP, and Dyn2K44A-GFP, were kindly provided by M. McNiven (15Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Google Scholar). To determine the role played by Eps15, we used two cDNAs kindly provided by A. Benmerah and A. Dautry-Varsat, one control GFP-DIIIΔ2 (16Benmerah A. Lamaze C.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum, 17 pyruvate (5.5 g/liter), and 2 mm Glutamax. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the different cDNAs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's indications. Hippocampal cells were prepared from 18-day-old rat embryos according to the method of Goslin and Banker (18Goslin K. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 251-281Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampi were dissociated by trypsin and mechanical treatment, plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 9500 cells/cm2, and maintained in a serum-free medium (N2 medium) suspended above a glia feeder layer. Adding 5 mm cytosine arabinoside prevented proliferation of nonneuronal cells. All experiments were performed in cells kept 8–12 days in culture. Neurons were transfected with designated plasmids using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's indications except that the cells were left only 1 h in contact with Effectene and DNA. To follow endocytosis of tagged receptors, antibodies anti-Myc (5 ॖg/ml) or anti-HA (1:100), diluted in conditioned culture medium, were incubated on living cells for 30 min at 37 °C. When specified, Rh-Tf was added at a concentration of 300 nm. Cells were either directly fixed by incubation for 20 min at room temperature in 47 paraformaldehyde, 47 sucrose in PBS, or remaining surface antibodies were stripped away with an acid wash (4-min incubation at 4 °C with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 2) before fixation. After fixation, cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS in order to quench aldehyde groups and then permeabilized in PBS, 0.27 bovine serum albumin, 0.057 saponin (permeabilizing buffer) for 40 min at 37 °C. If necessary, the cells were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with anti-MAP2 (1:2000) in permeabilizing buffer. After three washes in permeabilizing buffer, cells were incubated for 45 min at room temperature with fluorochrome-coupled secondary antibodies (Cy3 anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (1:500), fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-rabbit (1:100)), washed several times with permeabilizing buffer then in PBS, and finally mounted in Dabco/Moviol as described by Hémar et al. (19Hémar A. Subtil A. Lieb M. Morelon E. Hellio R. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 55-64Google Scholar). When the remaining surface anti-Myc (1:100) was visualized after having been incubated on living cells for 30 min at 37 °C, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with Cy3 anti-mouse secondary antibodies and then fixed and mounted in Dabco/Moviol. Immunofluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axiophot 2 microscope. Image acquisitions were done with a Quantix digital cooled CCD camera (Photometrix) driven by IP-labs (Scanalitics) software. Images were mounted with Adobe Photoshop. The detection and counting of endocytic vesicles was performed automatically by a computer program that uses an undecimated wavelet decomposition of the image. The program recognizes the vesicles by correlating and thresholding wavelet coefficients at different scales of analysis (20Olivo-Marin J.C. Pattern Recogn. 2002; 35: 1989-1996Google Scholar). Region masks defining the area occupied by the cell body and processes are determined by an automatic thresholding algorithm when processing fluorescently labeled neurons or by interactive drawing when analyzing COS-7 cells. Vesicles inside each cell are validated as the result of a logical AND operator between the vesicle image and the region masks. The results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the number of vesicles per cell surface unit. Statistical significance was assessed by using a Mann-Whitney test. The day before the experiment, COS-7 cells transfected with expression vector encoding untagged mGluR5a were pooled and plated in six-well plates in order to avoid variability in transfection efficiency between wells. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS (pH 8) and incubated with 1 ml of sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) diluted in PBS (pH 8) for 30 min at 4 °C. After two washes in PBS, two wells were kept at 4 °C (t0) in ice-cold PBS, and the others were incubated different times at 37 °C in prewarmed PBS. Cells were then washed twice in PBS. For each incubation time, one well was kept at 4 °C while the other was incubated three times for 15 min with 1 ml of cleavage solution (50 mm2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.7 at 4 °C)) and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. All of the wells were lysed by scraping in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, 17 Triton X-100, and 舠Complete舡 protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biosciences)). After 20 min on ice, each lysate was spun at 8000 × g for 10 min. 20 ॖl of each clarified lysate was kept for an estimation of the total quantity of mGluR5 at each point. 850 ॖl of each clarified lysate were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 ॖl of streptavidin-agarose beads. The beads were washed three times at 4 °C in lysis buffer and once in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The beads were extracted with SDS-sample buffer containing 1m dithiothreitol. The lysates and the extracted beads were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-mGluR5 antibody (0.8 ॖg/ॖl). The ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for chemiluminescent detection. Quantitative analysis of Western blots was performed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). We measured the amount of mGluR5 at the surface at t = 0 (i.e. biotinylated receptors at t = 0), the amount of surface and intracellular receptors (i.e. total biotinylated receptors) at each time of incubation at 37 °C, and the intracellular receptors (biotinylated receptors resistant to cleavage). We measured for each point the total amount of mGluR5 in order to calibrate these data. The percentage of internalized mGluR5 at timet was then calculated with the equation,7internalized(t)=100×intracellular(t)+(surface(t0)−total(t))surface(t0)Equation 1 where surface(t0) − total(t) represents the degraded receptors or endocytosed receptors which underwent biotin reduction inside the cell. The endocytosis rate was determined by fitting data to a single exponential function of the form y =A(1 −e(t/τ)), whereA is constant, using Kaleidagraph. The endocytosis rate is 1/τ. To investigate internalization of mGluR5 receptors, recombinant receptors were transiently expressed in heterologous COS-7 cells or in hippocampal neurons. In transfected COS-7 cells, the receptors are detected at the cell surface and also in high proportion (907) in intracellular compartments (putatively of the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways). 2A. Hémar, unpublished data. Since there is no available antibody against the extracellular part of mGluR5, we used mGluR5a and mGluR5b constructs containing the c-Myc or HA epitope tags at the extracellular N terminus, allowing specific labeling of surface-expressed receptors on living cells with anti-tag antibodies. Endocytosis immunoassay was performed as follows: 1) transfected cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with anti-tag antibodies; 2) remaining surface antibodies were or not stripped away with an acid wash; 3) finally, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies. Both splice variants, mGluR5aNmyc and mGluR5bNmyc, were endocytosed as shown by the presence of an acid wash-resistant punctiform labeling (Fig.1, E and F). The labeled compartments are endosomal structures, because they contain antibodies that have been internalized from culture medium. The antibody was internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, since no intracellular labeling was observed in nontransfected cells on the same coverslips (Fig. 1, compare A with C andB with D). The comparison of the images obtained with or without acid wash shows that there are still receptors at the cell surface (Fig. 1, compare E with A andF with B). The remaining surface labeling appears very different from that of the endocytic compartments. Remaining surface antibodies were revealed, after the incubation at 37 °C, under nonpermeabilizing conditions (i.e. at 4 °C without fixation and permeabilization (Fig. 1, G and H)). The labeling appears as smaller puncta compared with the intracellular labeling (Fig. 1, compare G with E andH with F). This shows that the binding of the antibody has not induced a severe down-regulation of the receptor at the surface. In any case, the cross-linking of the receptors by the bivalent anti-Myc antibody does not seem to be necessary for their internalization, since we observed the same labeling when anti-Myc Fab fragments were used. 3L. Fourgeaud and A. Hémar, unpublished data. In order to determine whether the mGluR5 receptors are also endocytosed in neurons, we performed the same experiments in primary cultures of rat embryonic hippocampal dissociated neurons. In transfected neurons, mGluR5a and -b are both expressed and endocytosed in dendrites and axons (Fig. 2). Indeed, after incubation at 37 °C, anti-Myc labeling appears as large fluorescent acid wash-resistant puncta in cell body and neurites (Fig. 2, Band C, and Fig. 2, E and F, with acid wash, compared with Fig. 2, A and D, without acid wash). The internalized receptors (in red) are found in dendrites labeled with the dendritic specific marker MAP2 (ingreen; Fig. 2, B and E) and in axons that do not contain MAP2 (Fig. 2, C and F). In the experimental conditions we used, mGluR5a or mGluR5b receptors are endocytosed without the addition of glutamate. This suggested that the receptors could be endocytosed constitutively, which means in the absence of ligand binding and/or activity. Although the first observations have been done in the absence of added agonist, one cannot rule out that such an agonist is produced by the cells and would induce the internalization of the receptor. To test this hypothesis, we studied the endocytosis of mutated receptors that have a reduced affinity for glutamate. We took advantage of the similarity of the glutamate binding site of another group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR1, to design the mutants. The binding site of mGluR1 has been crystallized, and the amino acids interacting with glutamate have been identified (21Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Google Scholar). We mutated into alanine the tyrosine at position 222 and the aspartate at position 304 of mGluR5a (mGluR5aNHA-Y222A and mGluR5aNHA-D304A, respectively). The EC50 for glutamate in activating the Y222A and D304A mutated receptors is 30- and >300-fold higher than that measured with the wild-type receptor, respectively (Table I). Both mutated receptors transfected in COS-7 cells were endocytosed (Fig.3, A and B). We have evaluated the endocytosis level by image analysis. We quantified the number of acid wash-resistant fluorescent spots (endosomes) per cell surface unit (Fig. 3C). The numbers obtained for both mutants are not significantly different from that of the wild type (wild type: 21.4 ± 1.2 spots/100 ॖm2, 2.1 × 104 ॖm2 explored in 47 cells analyzed; mGluR5aNHAY222A, 21.2 ± 2.9 spots/100 ॖm2, 6.2 × 103 ॖm2 explored in 11 cells analyzed,p = 0.8; mGluR5aNHAD304A, 20.7 ± 3.3 spots/100 ॖm2, 5.3 × 103 ॖm2explored in 10 cells analyzed, p = 0.7). We conclude that the binding of a ligand is not necessary for the endocytosis of mGluR5a. It has been shown that mGluR5 receptors display an endogenous constitutive activity that can be inhibited by the inverse agonist MPEP (22Pagano A. Ruegg D. Litschig S. Stoehr N. Stierlin C.

In order to look for endocytosis of mGluR5aNmyc in the absence of activity, we treated cells with 10 ॖm MPEP for 30 min before and during the anti-Myc incubation in our endocytosis assay. Fig. 3 shows that in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3D) and in neurons (Fig. 3E), mGluR5a is endocytosed even in the presence of MPEP. The quantifications of the images are presented in Fig.3F. The number of acid wash-resistant fluorescent spots was not decreased and even increased, showing that the endocytosis is not inhibited in the presence of MPEP (COS-7 without MPEP: 19.3 ± 0.9 spots/100 ॖm2, 3.8 × 104ॖm2 explored in 83 cells analyzed; COS-7 treated with MPEP: 28.3 ± 1.9 spots/100 ॖm2, 2.4 × 104 ॖm2 explored in 47 cells,p = 0.0002; neuron without MPEP: 42.9 ± 7.4 spots/100 ॖm2, 2.7 × 103ॖm2 explored in five cells; neuron treated with MPEP: 109.4 ± 13.2 spots/100 ॖm2, 2.7 × 103 ॖm2 explored in six cells,p = 0.0062). We conclude that neither agonist binding nor intrinsic activity of the receptor is necessary for endocytosis of mGluR5a. In order to evaluate the amount of receptors that undergo constitutive endocytosis we performed biotinylation assays of endocytosis on COS-7 cells transfected with untagged mGluR5a encoding vector. After biotinylation at 4 °C with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in PBS for different times. After purification on streptavidin-agarose beads and Western blot revealed with anti-mGluR5 antibodies, we measured the total (without cleavage of surface biotin) and intracellular (after cleavage) amounts of biotinylated receptors. Fig.4A shows the corresponding mGluR5 labeling on one Western blot. The amount of intracellular receptors increases with time while the total amount decreases. Since the experiment was done in PBS, this shows that the receptor is indeed constitutively endocytosed. We quantified the density of the bands and calculated the percentage of internalized receptors (Fig.4B, see 舠Experimental Procedures舡 for details). The time course of endocytosis can be well described by a single exponential and a time constant (τ) of 8.5 min. The rate of endocytosis is thus 11.77/min. This indicates that the constitutive endocytosis of mGluR5 is not due to bulk flow endocytosis of the membrane, since this value is significantly higher than 17/min (24Buckley K.M. Melikian H.E. Provoda C.J. Waring M.T. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 11-19Google Scholar). Several internalization pathways can coexist in a cell. The most extensively characterized mechanism of endocytosis is clathrin-mediated, but it has been recently evidenced that bona fide receptors can enter the cell by other pathways (reviewed in Refs. 9Dautry-Varsat A. Marsh M. Endocytosis. Oxford University Press Inc., New York2001: 27-57Google Scholar and 10Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Google Scholar). In order to discriminate between these pathways, the best tools now available are dominant negative mutants of proteins implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis like Eps15 and the dynamins. Overexpression of an EH-deleted dominant negative mutant of Eps15 (EΔ95/295) that still contains the binding site for the adaptor AP2 inhibits clathrin-coated pit assembly and blocks clathrin-dependent endocytosis (16Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Begue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Google Scholar, 17Benmerah A. Bayrou M. Cerf-Bensussan N. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1303-1311Google Scholar). We used this mutant to see if it could inhibit endocytosis of mGluR5a in COS-7 cells and in hippocampal neurons. We cotransfected GFP-tagged EΔ95/295 and mGluR5aNHA and looked for the endocytosis of anti-HA antibodies. In order to control the efficiency of the Eps15 mutant, Rh-Tf endocytosis was monitored in the same cells. Whereas Rh-Tf endocytosis is abolished (Fig. 5G), Fig. 5,E and F (for COS-7 cells) and Fig.6, C and D (for neurons) show that endocytosis of the receptor (Figs. 5F and6D) is still observed in cells coexpressing GFP-EΔ95/295 (Fig. 5E and 6C). Quantifications show that the endocytosis in the presence of dominant negative mutant of Eps15, GFP-EΔ95/295, is the same as in cells transfected with a control Eps15 construct, GFP-DIIIΔ2, lacking the AP2 binding site (Fig. 5, A and B, for COS-7; Fig. 6, Aand B, for neurons). The values are for COS-7 cells: GFP-DIIIΔ2, 15.9 ± 1.7 spots/100 ॖm2, 2 × 104 ॖm2 explored in 47 cells analyzed; GFP-EΔ95/295, 14 ± 0.8 spots/100 ॖm2, 2.2 × 104 ॖm2 explored in 54 cells analyzed,p = 0.8; and for the neurons, GFP-DIIIΔ2, 27.1 ± 6.5 spots/100 ॖm2, 3.9 × 103ॖm2 explored in nine cells analyzed; GFP-EΔ95/295, 36 ± 4.3 spots/100 ॖm2, 3.7 × 103ॖm2 explored in 10 cells analyzed, p = 0.09. Since Eps15 has not been implicated in pathways other than the clathrin-coated pits pathway (25Pelkmans L. Puntener D. Helenius A. Science. 2002; 296: 535-539Google Scholar), we conclude that mGluR5a is endocytosed through a nonclathrin-mediated pathway. Nevertheless, after endocytosis, the receptor is found at least partly in the same endosomes as transferrin endocytosed by clathrin-coated pits (Fig.5D). This has been observed also for the interleukin-2 receptor and more recently for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (19Hémar A. Subtil A. Lieb M. Morelon E. Hellio R. Dautry-Varsat A. J.

The resulting hyperpolarization promotes capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE), which, unlike BKCa channels, is inhibited by high Ca2+. To understand how the coordinated activation of plasma membrane ion channels with opposite Ca2+ sensitivity is orchestrated, the individual contribution of mitochondria and ER in regulation of subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]pm) was investigated. For organelle visualization, cells were transfected with DsRed and yellow cameleon targeted to mitochondria and ER. The patch pipette was placed far from any organelle (L1), close to ER (L3), or mitochondria (L2) and activity of BKCa channels was used to estimate local [Ca2+]pm. Under standard patch conditions (130 mm K+ in the bath), histamine increased [Ca2+]pm at L1 and L3 to ∼1.6 μm, whereas close to mitochondria [Ca2+]pm remained unchanged. If mitochondria moved apart from the pipette or in the presence of carbonyl cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhyrazone, [Ca2+]pm at L2 increased in response to histamine. Under standard patch conditions Ca2+ entry was negligible due to cell depolarization. Using a physiological patch approach (5.6 mm K+ in the bath), changes in [Ca2+]pm to histamine could be monitored without cell depolarization and, thus, in conditions where Ca2+ entry occurred. Here, histamine induced an initial transient Ca2+ elevation to ≥3.5 μm followed by a long lasting plateau at ∼1.2 μm in L1 and L3, whereas mitochondria kept neighboring [Ca2+]pm low during stimulation.

Adv. Pharmacol. 1991; 22: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the CCE represents the main mechanism for Ca2+entry in non-excitable cells and achieves long lasting elevation of [Ca2+]cyto. Although the actual protein(s) responsible for CCE is/are still under debate and matter of intense investigation, it has been clearly described that CCE is prevented by an elevation of Ca2+ at the mouth of the channel(s) (2Gilabert J.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14925-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the amount of Ca2+ that actually enters the cells through CCE critically depends on activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels to achieve a membrane hyperpolarization and, thus, provide the driving force for Ca2+ entry (7Groschner K. Graier W.F. Kukovetz W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Kamouchi M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1999; 18: 199-208PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, in endothelial cells, superficial ER (sER) domains create spatial Ca2+ gradients beneath the plasma membrane (subplasmalemmalCa2+control unit, SCCU) that result in local activation of BKCa channels (9Frieden M. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J.

Physiol. 1998; 513: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The existence of such localized Ca2+ elevation beneath the plasma membrane would explain, at least in part, the “Ca2+ paradox” that during cell stimulation activation of Ca2+-activated ion currents occurs simultaneously with the Ca2+-inhibitable CCE. However, we previously observed that, during a strong cell stimulation (i.e. 100 μm histamine), where BKCa channels get activated also in regions far from the ER, a strong CCE still takes place (10Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These findings emphasize that, although the sER contributes to Ca2+ influx by membrane hyperpolarization due to Ca2+-activated K+ channels, another phenomenon,i.e. local lowering/buffering of the subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]sub), has to occur simultaneously to facilitate CCE activity. Consequently, evidence was provided that mitochondria play a key role for CCE activity in non-excitable cells. In these experiments, in which mitochondria were depolarized by uncouplers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (i.e. the carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazones FCCP and CCCP), which results in inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, the maintenance of CCE was prevented (2Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Gilabert J.A. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B.

This phenomenon further referred to as “mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering” is thought to facilitate CCE by lowering subplasmalemmal Ca2+ at the mouth of this Ca2+-inhibitable Ca2+-entry pathway (14Duchen M.R. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, these carbonyl cyanide-based mitochondrial uncouplers prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling in a rather indirect way via abolishment of the H+ gradient, which results in a change of the mitochondrial pH and depolarization of the inner mitochondria membrane. Furthermore, these compounds have been found to affect the Ca2+ release from the ER (15Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and result in a depolarization of the plasma membrane (16Park K.S. Jo I. Pak K. Bae S.W. Rhim H. Suh S.H. Park J. Zhu H. So I. Kim K.W. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 443: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In view of the potential unspecific properties of mitochondrial uncouplers, ultimate proofs for the concept of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering are necessary. Therefore, this study was designed to find further and direct evidence of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering during cell stimulation in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell-derived cell line EA.hy926.DISCUSSIONIn this work we report that superficial domains of the mitochondria and the ER create opposite Ca2+ gradients upon cell stimulation with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonist histamine. Using the combination of high resolution fluorescence microscopy for visualization of organelle-targeted fluorescent proteins and electrophysiology for locally defined single channel recordings, we found that superficial mitochondria effectively buffer subplasmalemmal Ca2+ during cell stimulation despite a large increase in cytosolic Ca2+. On the contrary, superficial ER domains were observed to generate a high Ca2+ gradient beneath the cell membrane that results in cell hyperpolarization by activation of BKCa channels.One essential achievement of the present study was the simultaneous visualization of mitochondria and ER domains to allow an exact positioning of the patch pipette. Because the transfection efficiency of endothelial cells is rather low and the amount of expression of each individual fluorescent protein would need to be equal, a vector for double transfection was used. As shown in Fig. 1, a clear separation between mitochondria and ER could be realized by transfecting the cells with the vector pBudCE4.1 encoding ER-targeted YC4-ER and mitochondrial-targeted DsRed. Thus, this approach allowed distinct pipette positioning in respect to the ER and the mitochondria. Using the standard patch approach (i.e. 130 mmK+ outside) a strong activation of the BKCachannels in response to 100 μm histamine was found at the ER (L3) and far from any organelle (L1). These findings are consistent with our previous report in which 100 μmhistamine stimulated BKCa channels in pipette locations L1 and L3, whereas only at low histamine concentration (i.e. 10 μm) a spatial subplasmalemmal Ca2+ elevation occurred between the plasma membrane and the sER (i.e. L3) (10Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Localized Ca2+ events have been often reported in excitable and non-excitable cells (see Ref. 24Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar for review). Such localized elevations of subplasmalemmal [Ca2+]pm have been clearly shown in pancreatic acinar cells (25Cancela J.M. Van Coppenolle F. Galione A. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 909-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), cardiac myocytes (26Lipp P. Egger M. Niggli E. J. Physiol. 2002; 542: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), smooth muscle (27Perez G.J. Bonev A.D. Nelson M.T. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C1769-C1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or HeLa cells (28Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Brini M. Chiesa A. Filippin L. Pozzan T. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) where Ca2+ signaling has been found to constitute a multitude of local, highly controlled processes that include ion channels, pumps, and organelles. All these reports dealt with local elevation of Ca2+ in restricted areas of the cell. Although such high Ca2+ gradients have been found to constitute distinct triggers for the spatial modulation of Ca2+-activated mechanisms (24Berridge M.J. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), these studies fail to explain how during a cell stimulation that is accompanied with a large elevation in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration Ca2+-sensitive ion channels are still active despite the inhibitory action of Ca2+ on this pathway.As in most other non-excitable cells, Ca2+ enters endothelial cells through the so-called CCE pathway. Notably, the CCE is sensitive to elevation of Ca2+ at the mouth of one or more of the channels (2Gilabert J.A. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6401-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Gilabert J.A. Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2672-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4Hoth M.

Physiol. 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) we demonstrate that the subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration elevates up to 1.6 μm free Ca2+ under standard patch clamp conditions, and, although such high Ca2+ concentration is known to prevent CCE, a large CCE took place during strong cell stimulation (10Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because this paradox situation was found in many cells, a phenomenon of local subplasmalemmal Ca2+ lowering was postulated.

However, because the uncouplers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation have been reported to initiate Ca2+ release from the ER (15Landolfi B. Curci S. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Hofer A.M. J.

Pflügers Arch. 2002; 443: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering during cell stimulation needed to be studied directly.Thus, our present findings, that in isometric K+ bath conditions BKCa channel activation in response to 100 μm histamine was strongly reduced in the proximity of mitochondria, indicate for the first time that the increase in [Ca2+]pm in response to histamine was effectively reduced by superficial mitochondria. This direct demonstration of mitochondrial “Ca2+ buffering” was further confirmed in experiments where BKCa channel activity was restored after the superficial mitochondria displaced from the patch during the experiments. Such mitochondrial movements have been reported frequently (for review see Refs. 35Yaffe M.P. Nat. Cell. 1999; 1: 49-50Google Scholar and 36Yaffe M.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and are thought to result from mitochondrial movements along the microtubular network (37Krendel M. Sgourdas G. Bonder E.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Considering our recent findings that the BKCachannels are ubiquitously distributed in EA.hy926 cells (10Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), these data indicate that moving organelles affect the activity of neighboring plasma membrane channel. Thus, it seems possible that superficial organelles create their own distinct microenvironment along their way.The contribution of mitochondria to local Ca2+ buffering monitored by using the BKCa channels as Ca2+sensors was further supported by our findings that FCCP restored BKCa channel activation in patches close to mitochondria. Because mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering was measured in these experiments directly under controlled conditions (i.e.defined patch localization and clamped membrane potential), these data point to an elevation of [Ca2+]pm in response to histamine due to the lack of mitochondrial Ca2+sequestration under FCCP treatment. Also, although these data are consistent with previous experiments where uncouplers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were used to investigate the contribution of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering to CCE (2Gilabert J.A.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6744-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), this is the first time that FCCP was demonstrated to prevent subplasmalemmal mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering upon agonist stimulation on the single cell level.Remarkably, the activation of BKCa channels far from any organelle (L1), close to sER (L3) or next to mitochondria (L2) in the presence of FCCP, was found to be transient. This finding is quite surprising considering the long lasting cytosolic Ca2+elevation and membrane hyperpolarization found in these cells in response to 100 μm histamine (9Frieden M. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Paltauf-Doburzynska J. Frieden M. Spitaler M. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 501-514Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for the transient BKCa channel activation in the standard patch protocol is that, in standard bath solution (i.e. isometric K+) very little or no Ca2+ entry takes place as Ca2+ influx critically depends on the driving force that is most prominently provided by the activation of Ca2+-activated K+channels (8Kamouchi M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1999; 18: 199-208PubMed Google Scholar). This assumption is further supported by our data presented herein and previous reports that in endothelial cells Ca2+ entry depends critically on membrane hyperpolarization.Thus, out of these findings we conclude that experiments in which the standard patch approach was used do not allow a proper evaluation of the kinetics and the magnitude of spatial Ca2+ gradients due to the strong reduction of CCE under the depolarizing conditions used. These findings raise a number of important questions: What is the subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration achieved by cell stimulation under physiological conditions? Do mitochondria still buffer Ca2+ under physiological conditions where CCE occurs? And, finally, is our SCCU concept still accurate, although one can expect higher transmembrane Ca2+ movements?These aspects were verified in our experiments using a physiological patch that allowed the cell to manipulate its membrane potential freely while one can still follow single channel activity. Under these conditions, the driving force for Ca2+ entry is not diminished by artificial membrane depolarization, and, thus, a physiological CCE occurs. We believe that this approach, which reveals the actual patch potential (V pm), whole cell membrane potential (V wc), and [Ca2+]pm, represents a landmark for progress in the evaluation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Convincingly, under physiological but notstandard patch conditions Ca2+ entry occurs, which was indicated by the second long lasting activation of the BKCa located far from any organelle (Figs. 6 B,8 A, and 8 C). This biphasic activation of the BKCa channels occurred despite a long lasting cell membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 8, A and C), which was in the same range as that obtained in conventional current clamp protocol (i.e. approximately 30 mV). At pipette location L1, the estimated [Ca2+]pm elevations in response to histamine were also biphasic and revealed up to ∼3.5 and ∼1.2 μm during the initial transient (P1) and long lasting phase (P2), respectively. These levels of [Ca2+]pm correspond precisely to that found using membrane targeted ratiometric-pericam in pancreatic islet β-cells (38Pinton P. Tsuboi T. Ainscow E.K. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37702-37710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and confirm our approach of monitoring [Ca2+]pm by BKCa channels.When locating the pipette at sER domains (L3) the subplasmalemmal Ca2+ elevation in response to histamine exceeded that found in L1 (up to ∼6.3 and ∼1.3 μm during P1 and P2, respectively), whereas the onset of the second phase was faster. These data further support our previous concept on the specific role of the sER for local Ca2+ elevation (SCCU) (9Frieden M. Graier W.F. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Frieden M. Malli R. Samardzija M. Demaurex N. Graier W.F. J.

Physiol. 1998; 513: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, by introducing the physiological patch approach we demonstrate that even under strong cell stimulation the SCCU builds up a subplasmalemmal Ca2+ gradient in which the Ca2+ concentration is higher than in areas without sER.In our standard patch experiments the mitochondria have been found to buffer effectively neighboring Ca2+ in the subplasmalemmal area indicated by the lack of BKCa channel activation upon 100 μm histamine administration (Fig. 2). Using the physiological patch approach, it was of interest whether or not mitochondria are still able to buffer subplasmalemmal Ca2+in their neighborhood, although we have found a 3- to 6-fold higher subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration at L1 and L3 compared with our standard patch experiments. Remarkably, despite such high subplasmalemmal Ca2+ elevation to histamine far from any organelle and close to ER domains, superficial mitochondria were still capable of buffering [Ca2+]pm during histamine stimulation to 0.25 and 0.10 μm in P1 and P2, respectively. These data demonstrate that, during strong cell activation, mitochondria buffer subplasmalemmal Ca2+elevation by about 95 and 98% compared with the L1 and L3 pipette positions. Furthermore, during P2, the phase where the Ca2+-sensitive CCE takes place (29Madge L. Marshall I.C. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 351-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), subplasmalemmal mitochondria keep neighboring subplasmalemmal Ca2+ at basal levels. This is the first time that mitochondrial the “Ca2+ buffering” function was demonstrated directly under physiological conditions and without any pharmacological tools. Furthermore, these data convincingly prove the concept that superficial mitochondria indeed create a local microdomain of low Ca2+that might sustain the activity of the Ca2+-inhibitable CCE pathway.Our findings, that even under physiological conditions, superficial organelles are able to create opposite Ca2+ gradients and build their own Ca2+ dynamics in their microenvironment, have important implications because Ca2+ operates as a crucial messenger for numerous pivotal functions in the cell. In endothelial cells, Ca2+ regulates the production of vasoactive compounds (for review see Ref. 39Graier W.F. Sturek M. Kukovetz W.R. Endothelium. 1994; 1: 223-236Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the activation of transcription factors (e.g. NFκB) (40Hu Q. Deshpande S. Irani K. Ziegelstein R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33995-33998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and ion channels (41Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Due to the opposite characteristics of Ca2+gradients at superficial organelles during cell stimulation presented herein, the mechanisms for the versatility of Ca2+ as a ubiquitous second messenger becomes more transparent. In many cells, emptying of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 represents an initial signal that triggers activation of the so-called capacitative Ca2+ entry through non-voltage gated pathway(s) (CCE) (1Putney J.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1991; 22: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the CCE represents the main mechanism for Ca2+entry in non-excitable cells and achieves long lasting elevation of [Ca2+]cyto. Although the actual protein(s) responsible for CCE is/are still under debate and matter of intense investigation, it has been clearly described that CCE is prevented by an elevation of Ca2+ at the mouth of the channel(s) (2Gilabert J.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14925-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the amount of Ca2+ that actually enters the cells through CCE critically depends on activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels to achieve a membrane hyperpolarization and, thus, provide the driving force for Ca2+ entry (7Groschner K. Graier W.F. Kukovetz W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Kamouchi M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Gen."

Upon Fas/CD95 stimulation, BAP31 is cleaved within its cytosolic domain, generating proapoptotic p20 BAP31. In human KB epithelial cells expressing the caspase-resistant mutant crBAP31, Fas stimulation resulted in cleavage of BID and insertion of BAX into mitochondrial membrane, but subsequent oligomerization of BAX and BAK, egress of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and apoptosis were impaired. Bap31-null mouse cells expressing crBAP31 cannot generate the endogenous p20 BAP31 cleavage product, yet crBAP31 conferred resistance to cellular condensation and cytochrome c release in response to activation of ectopic FKBPcasp8 by FK1012z. Full-length BAP31, therefore, is a direct inhibitor of these caspase-8-initiated events, acting independently of its ability to sequester p20, with which it interacts. Employing a novel split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid screen for BAP31-interacting membrane proteins, the putative ion channel protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, A4, was detected and identified as a constitutive binding partner of BAP31 in human cells.

An emerging model for the regulation of apoptosis posits that BCL-2 family members regulate and integrate upstream death signals that ultimately cause a breach in the mitochondrial outer membrane, releasing factors that contribute to the demise of the cell (1Bouillet P.

Although multiple extrinsic and intrinsic pathways likely converge on mitochondria to achieve this end, the coupling of mitochondrial responses to upstream stimuli has been most intensively investigated for apoptosis initiated by cell surface death receptors. Activation of the Fas/CD95 signaling complex, for example, causes recruitment and processing of the two major isoforms of procaspase-8, -8/a and -8/b (for review, see Ref. 4Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). The resulting caspase-8 holoenzyme can then initiate a downstream cascade of events, including direct processing of effector procaspases such as procaspase-3, at least in certain contexts (5Scaffidi C.

Once released, cytochrome c becomes an integral constituent of the apoptosome, resulting in further amplification of a caspase cascade (18Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang W. Annu. Rev.

In addition to its role in the recruitment and regulation of the novel procaspase-8 isoform, procaspase-8L, in response to apoptotic signaling by oncogenic E1A (25Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Kuppig S. Reth M. Shore G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4331-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), BAP31 itself is a preferred substrate for caspase-8 (23Kim K.M. Adachi T. Nielsen P.J. Terashima M. Lamers M.C. Kohler G. Reth M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cleavage occurs at two identical sites (AAVD.G) in the human protein that flank the DECC (death effector-like coiled coil) domain within the cytosolic disposed C-terminal tail of BAP31 (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As a first step to investigate the contribution of BAP31 cleavage during apoptosis, we recently established a KB epithelial cell line that expresses caspase-resistant (cr) BAP31, in which the caspase-recognition Asp residues have been mutated to Ala. Caspase-8 activation that is independent of BAP31 in these cells is then achieved by stimulating the Fas death-inducing signaling complex (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this system, crBAP31 provided a remarkably pleiotropic resistance to Fas-mediated cytoplasmic apoptosis even though it had little influence on processing procaspases-8/a and -8/b and activation of downstream effector caspases. In contrast, apoptotic membrane blebbing/fragmentation and redistribution of actin were strongly inhibited, the cells retained a near normal morphology, and irreversible loss of cell growth potential after removal of the Fas stimulus was delayed (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Preservation of full-length BAP31 in the face of Fas stimulation also restrained the release of cytochromec from the mitochondria (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These results suggest, therefore, that cleavage of BAP31 during Fas-mediated cell death might regulate a proximal step that impacts several components of cytoplasmic apoptosis. endoplasmic reticulum cycloheximide caspase-resistant BAP31 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole death effector-like coiled coil enhanced green fluorescent protein green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin tumor necrosis factor wild type endoplasmic reticulum cycloheximide caspase-resistant BAP31 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole death effector-like coiled coil enhanced green fluorescent protein green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin tumor necrosis factor wild type Here, we have addressed two questions regarding the regulation of the Fas pathway by full-length BAP31. Is BAP31 itself a direct inhibitor of the Fas pathway rather than simply acting as a precursor for generating the proapoptotic caspase-8 cleavage product, p20BAP31? And, if so, does this activity of BAP31 depend on the association of BAP31 with other proteins located in the ER membrane? The routine procedures used in this study for measuring apoptotic cell death by microscopic examination of uptake of trypan blue, generation of cellular fractions, SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting and development of blots by enhanced chemoluminescence, and assays to measure release of cytochrome c from mitochondria have been documented in earlier publications (13Ruffolo S.C.

Human KB epithelial cell lines expressing wt BAP31-FLAG or crBAP31-FLAG were created and cultured as described previously (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Differentiated Bap31-null mouse embryonic stem cells were created as described (25Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Kuppig S. Reth M. Shore G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4331-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Stable expression of crBAP31-FLAG in differentiated Bap31-null cells was established by transfection (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol, and cells were cultured in Knockoutdulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) in the presence of 150 μg/ml G418. Clones were isolated which expressed crBAP31-FLAG at levels similar to the level of Bap31expressed in wt cells. HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. Stable cell lines expressing pcDNA3.1/hygromycin vector, pcDNA3.1/hygromycin- A4-HA, or pcDNA3.1/neomycin-crBAP31-FLAG were created, and A4/crBAP31 double expression cell lines were created by transfecting A4-HA into crBAP31-FLAG stable cell lines under a dual selection strategy. The expression vectors MFpk3HAFLICE (28Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) and pcDNA3-GFP were transiently cotransfected into differentiated Bap31-null or wt mouse embryonic stem cells. After 24 h, solvent (mixture of 50% ethanol and 50% dimethyl sulfoxide) containing or lacking FK1012z (final concentration, 1.0 nm), a derivative of FK1012 prepared by olefin metathesis using a modification of the procedure described by Diver and Schreiber (29Diver S.T. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5106-5109Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), was added. At the indicated times, cells were collected, and 25 μg of total lysates was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. For stable cell lines, cells were grown on coverslips for 24 h. They were treated with 0.5 μg/ml α-human Fas-activating antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated times. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained as described elsewhere (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized by confocal microscopy or by Nikon TE-FM Epi-fl microscopy. For analysis of the Bap31-null cells or their derivatives, the cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h. They were transfected, using LipofectAMINE 2000, with 0.2 μg of pCMS-EGFP (Clontech) and 0.8 μg of MFpk3HAFLICE (28Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar)/coverslip. 24 h later, they were treated with or without FK1012z, and the cells were subsequently fixed at the indicated times with 4% paraformaldehyde. Similarly, COS-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of A4-HA and 0.5 μg of BAP31-FLAG coverslip for 24 h before fixing and immunostaining. Nuclei were stained with DAPI and fluorescence analyzed by confocal microscopy or by Nikon TE-FM Epi-fl microscopy. The entire coding sequence of human BAP31 with NsiI-BsiwI linker at the 5′-end was generated by PCR using primers TCCGCTCGAGATGCATCTCTCTCTCTCGTACGATGAGTCTGCAGTGGACT and TCCGCTCGAGCTCTTCCTTCTTGTCCAT. Δwbp1 was excised from pRSB (Δwbp1-Cub-PLV) (30Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. Heesen S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and replaced with BAP31 to generate pRS305(BAP31-Cub-PLV). The yeast CUP1 promoter was created by PCR using primers CCAATGCATTGGATCCCATTACCGACATTTG and CCACGTACGGCTTGATATCGAATTCGT and inserted intoNsiI-BsiwI upstream of BAP31. The resulting plasmid, termed pRSB, was integrated into the CUP1gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ), and clones (termed pRSB-L40) were selected on leucine plates. The expression of the BAP31-Cub-PLV fusion protein was verified by immunoblotting using antibodies against BAP31 or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit IgG. CUP1-NubG with linkersSalI-EcoRI at the 5′-end andXhoI-BglII at the 3′-end of NubG was generated by PCR from pRS314(NubG-ALG5) (30Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. Heesen S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides TCGGCGGTGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAAC and AACTGCAGCTCGAGGAGAGAGAGATCTCCACCAGGGATCCCTTC. The resulting PCR products were ligated to pRS314 (NubG-ALG5 deleted) and sequenced thoroughly. Standard protocols were employed to generate double stranded cDNA from HeLa mRNA. Linkers containing restriction sites BglII-XhoI orSalI-EcoRI were added, and the resulting cDNAs were fractionated on a 10–30% sucrose gradient. Fractions containing cDNAs in the range of 2–13 kb were collected, ligated to pRSN(CUP1-NubG), and transformed into HB101 to create pRSC(CUP1-cDNA-NubG) libraries, using theSalI-EcoRI link, or pRS314(CUP1-NubG-cDNA) libraries, using the BglII-XhoI link. Four different size-selected libraries (averaging 5 × 106transformants/library) were generated for each orientation. Plasmid DNA were purified and used to transform pRSB-L40. All yeast transformations were done as described (31Wang B. Lemay S. Tsai S. Veillettete A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Routinely, 20 μg of DNA of each library was transformed into pRSB-L40 and clones were selected on leucine/tryptophane/histidine plates in the presence of 0.2 mm CuSO4 and 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. 50 independent clones were picked from each of the eight libraries, and their DNAs were isolated. After transformation into Escherichia coli DH5α, the sequences of individual clones were determined and compared with sequences deposited in NCBI data base using BLAST. Potential candidates were tested further for specificity by retransformation into pRSB-L40. The schematic in Fig.1A depicts the topology of human BAP31 in the membrane of the ER and denotes the two identical caspase recognition sites (AAVD.G) flanking the cytosolic disposed DECC domain in the protein (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Cleavage at these sites generates the products p27 and p20 (21; Fig. 1B). In contrast to the human protein, murine BAP31 lacks the distal caspase cleavage site and generates only the p20 product during apoptosis (24Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). 2B. Wang, M. Nguyen, D. G. Breckenridge, M. Stojanovic, P. A. Clemons, S. Kuppig, and G. C. Shore, unpublished data. Human crBAP31-FLAG was created by mutating the two caspase recognition aspartate residues to alanine and inserting the FLAG epitope immediately upstream from the canonical KKEE ER retrieval signal located at the extreme C terminus of the protein. Human KB epithelial cell lines were established which stably express crBAP31-FLAG at levels 2–3-fold higher than that of the endogenous BAP31 protein (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of these crBAP31-FLAG cells with 0.5 μg/ml agonistic antibody against Fas/CD95, in the presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) to enhance sensitivity to Fas activation (6Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.K. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), caspases, including caspase-8 and caspase-3, are activated. As a result, caspase targets such as endogenous BAP31 and poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase are cleaved (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As documented in Fig. 1B, the time course for this Fas-induced cleavage of endogenous BAP31 was very similar for wt parental KB cells and KB cells expressing crBAP31-FLAG, indicating that the activity of the upstream caspase is similar in the two cell types. Moreover, the two cell types express equivalent levels of Fas receptor (as determined by immunoblot; not shown) and, after stimulation, process procaspase-8/a and -8/b to a similar extent (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast to endogenous BAP31, however, crBAP31-FLAG was not cleaved (Fig.1B), and cells expressing crBAP31-FLAG resisted apoptotic membrane blebbing (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and loss of cell viability as assessed by the uptake of trypan blue (Fig. 1C), even though caspases are active in these cells. Caspase cleavage of the endogenous BAP31 in crBAP31-FLAG-expressing cells generated the proapoptotic fragment, p20 BAP31 (Fig. 1B); however, this truncated p20 BAP31 product was associated with excess crBAP31-FLAG (Fig. 1E) and remained nontoxic (21Nguyen M. Breckenridge D.G. Ducret A. Shore G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6731-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).2 In vitro, BAP31 exhibits a marked preference for cleavage by caspase-8 rather than by caspase-3 (24Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To extend this to a cellular context, MCF-7 mammary epithelial cells lacking caspase-3 were stimulated with TNF-α, which leads to high levels of caspase-8 activity but low or insignificant activation of caspases-1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -7, -9, or -10 (22Stegh A.H. Herrmann H. Lampel S. Weisenberg D. Andra K. Seper M. Wiche G. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5665-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, TNF-α stimulation of MCF-7 cells caused procaspase-8/a and -8/b to be processed, which correlated with the detectable cleavage of both BAP31 and BID. Thus, caspase-8 generates BAP31 and BID cleavage products as early events after TNF-α receptor activation in intact MCF-7 cells. To test the ability of full-length BAP31 to inhibit directly the apoptotic pathway initiated by caspase-8, as opposed to simply binding and sequestering the p20 cleavage product (Fig. 1E), crBAP31-FLAG was reconstituted in mouse cells from which the Bap31 gene had been deleted (Ref. 25Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Kuppig S. Reth M. Shore G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4331-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the cytochrome c release pathway was initiated by chemical activation of caspase-8. Because these Bap31-null cells do not express endogenous (i.e. cleavable) BAP31, their resistance to caspase-8 cannot be explained by the ability of crBAP31 to sequester the proapoptotic p20 cleavage product of endogenous Bap31 (Fig. 1, A and E). The response of Bap31-null/crBAP31-FLAG cells was compared with that ofBap31-null cells as control; again, the latter cannot generate the proapoptotic cleavage product of endogenousBap31, which could contribute to the outcome. MFpk3HAFLICE, a vector expressing a fusion protein in which triplicate copies of FKBP and an HA tag replace the prodomain of procaspase-8 (28Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), was transiently transfected intoBap31-null and Bap31-null/crBAP31-FLAG cells, together with vector expressing GFP. 24 h later, cells were treated with the FKBP-dimerizing chemical, FK1012z, which initiates aggregation and autoactivation of the caspase-8 fusion protein (28Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), or the cells were treated with vehicle alone. Commensurate with processing of FKBPcasp8 (Fig.2C), cotransfected GFP-expressing Bap31-null cells lacking crBAP31-FLAG condensed rapidly, whereas those expressing crBAP31-FLAG resisted this apoptotic response (Fig. 2, A andB). Moreover, cytochrome c remained punctate in cells expressing crBAP31 and treated with FK1012z, whereas it was found diffuse throughout the apoptotic cells lacking crBAP31 (Fig. 2,D and E). In both cell types, however, similar levels and processing of ectopic MFpk3HAFLICE in response to FK1012z were observed (Fig. 2C). Collectively, the results show that full-length (uncleaved) BAP31 is an inhibitor of caspase-8-driven cellular condensation and release of cytochromec from mitochondria. Moreover the results indicate that the p20 cleavage product of BAP31 is not essential for these caspase-8-initiated events but rather may provide an amplifying effect. As expected, Bap31-null cells expressing wt BAP31, which was cleaved and generated p20 after activation of caspase-8, were fully sensitive to the caspase-8-initiated events (not shown). Because a specific pathway has now been elucidated for Fas-induced cytochrome c egress from mitochondria, dependent on BID (3Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Oh S. Weiler K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 12: 1166-1173Crossref Scopus (826) Google Scholar), the individual steps on this pathway were analyzed in crBAP31-expressing KB cells (Fig.3A). Full-length BID was found in loose association with mitochondria isolated from these cells, where it remained extractable at pH 11.5 (not shown), indicative of a peripheral rather than integral association with membrane (33Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of the Fas pathway, BID was processed, and crBAP31 had little influence on this step (Fig. 3B,top panel). Similarly, crBAP31 exerted little influenc"

Here we show that purified human REV1 and REV7 proteins form a heterodimer in solution, which is stable through intensive purification steps. Results from biochemical analysis of the transferase reactions of the REV1-REV7 complex demonstrated, in contrast to the case of yeast Rev3 whose polymerase activity is stimulated by assembly with yeast Rev7, that human REV7 did not influence the stability, substrate specificity, or kinetic parameters of the transferase reactions of REV1 protein.

However, the other role of the REV1 gene in the mutagenesis pathway is not due to its action as a deoxycytidyl transferase.

Taylor J.S. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2875-2883Google Scholar). It is also capable of bypass replication of T-T cyclobutane dimers (20Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Google Scholar). These properties are likely to contribute to generation of mutations. Yeast strains carrying rev3 or rev7 mutations exhibit a similar phenotype on treatment with wide variety of DNA-damaging agents, supporting the conclusion that both act in the same process (5Lawrence C.W. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 425-435Google Scholar). The damage-induced mutagenesis pathway is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. Preservation of the functions of human REVgenes is supported by the finding that human cell lines expressing high levels of human REV1 or REV3 antisense RNA exhibit a much reduced frequency of 6-thioguanine-resistant mutants induced by UV (25Gibbs P.E. McGregor W.G. Maher V.M. Nisson P. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6876-6880Google Scholar, 26Gibbs P.E. Wang X.D. Li Z. McManus T.P. McGregor W.G. Lawrence C.W. Maher V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4186-4191Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of the REV1 protein are also conserved from yeast to humans (14Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Google Scholar, 15Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1630-1638Google Scholar). While the human DNA polymerase ζ has yet to be purified, there is no direct evidence for polymerase activity of human REV3 protein. Recently, Murakumo and coworkers found that human REV7 interacts with human REV1 and REV3 proteins in a yeast two-hybrid study, as confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments (27Murakumo Y. Roth T. Ishii H. Rasio D. Numata S. Croce C.M. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4391-4397Google Scholar, 28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar). With yeast proteins, a Rev1-Rev7 interaction has not been observed (20Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Google Scholar). The responsible domain in the human REV1 protein is not found in the yeast Rev1 counterpart but highly conserved in the mouse Rev1 protein (17Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Fukuda S. Sumii M. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3040-3046Google Scholar), suggesting a specificity for higher eucaryotes (28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar). In the present paper we provide several lines of evidence that human REV1 and REV7 form a stable heterodimer. In contrast to yeast Rev3, the human REV7 subunit does not affect the transferase activity or stability of the REV1 protein. A possible molecular role of the REV7 subunit may be to help assembly of the REV1 protein to a large complex containing REV3 and/or other DNA polymerases in higher eucaryotes. Human REV7 cDNA was amplified from HeLa cDNA by PCR with primers (5′-CATATGACCACGCTCACACGACAAGAC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGCTGAGAAGTCGAGGTT-3′) and cloned into a pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to yield plasmid pREV7. The nucleotide sequence was verified. Then aNdeI-EcoRI fragment of the pREV7 was inserted into the corresponding site of the pET20b(+) vector (Novagen) to yield plasmid pET-REV7, which produces intact REV7 protein under control of the T7 promoter. The REV1- and REV7- coexpressing plasmid (pBAD-REV7-REV1S) was constructed by insertion of the Klenow-treated XbaI-AvrII fragment of pET-REV7 into the Klenow-treated KpnI site of pBAD-I-REV1S (16Masuda Y. Kamiya K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 88-92Google Scholar). The pBAD-REV7-REV1S produces intact REV1S and REV7 proteins, regulated by the pBAD promoter of the arabinose operon. A plasmid producing a truncated his6-REV1S protein (245–847) was constructed by insertion of a PCR-amplified fragment into theNdeI-HindIII site of pET15b (Novagen). BL21 (DE3) (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar) harboring pET-REV7 was grown in 20 liters of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (250 ॖg/ml) at 15 °C with aeration until the culture reached an A600 value of 0.6. Isopropyl ॆ-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.2 mm, and the incubation was continued for 10 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 ml of buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/0.1 mm EDTA/10 mm ॆ-mercaptoethanol/107 sucrose) per 1 g of cells, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen cells were thawed in ice water and lysed after addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 0.1 mm by introduction of buffer I containing 100 mm spermidine, 1 m NaCl, and 4 mg/ml lysozyme to 10 mm, 100 mm, and 0.4 mg/ml, respectively. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, heated in a 37 °C water bath for 2 min, and then incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 75,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Although the majority of the induced REV7 protein was precipitated, a small amount was recovered in the soluble fraction. Subsequent column chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). We found that the intact REV7 protein has affinity for a nickel-chelating column. After adding imidazole to 10 mm to the crude lysate, it was applied at 0.5 ml/min to a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been treated with 0.1 m NiSO4 and equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/100 mm NaCl/107 glycerol/10 mmॆ-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 50 ml of equilibration buffer at 0.5 ml/min and then the REV7 protein was eluted with 50 ml of a linear gradient of 10–100 mm imidazole in buffer A. Fractions containing REV7 protein, which were eluted at about 50 mm imidazole, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/1 mm EDTA/1 mm dithiothreitol/107 glycerol), then loaded at 0.1 ml/min onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B. Unbound material was eluted in 1-column volume. The REV7 was eluted at around 6-column volumes, and fractions containing REV7 were collected then loaded at 0.1 ml/min onto a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer B, and the REV7 protein was eluted with 10 ml of a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in buffer B. The REV7 eluted at the beginning of the gradient, and then the peak fraction was loaded at 0.1 ml/min on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5/10 mm ॆ-mercaptoethanol/107 glycerol) containing 150 mm NaCl. The REV7 eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa with a Stokes' radius of 25 Å. The peak fractions of REV7 protein were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The bacterial strain, BL21 (DE3) (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar), harboring pBAD-REV7-REV1S was grown in 2 liters of SB medium (30Mayer M.P. Gene. 1995; 163: 41-46Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (250 ॖg/ml) with aeration until the culture reached an A600 value of 0.6.l-(+)-arabinose was added to 17, and the incubation was continued for 11 h. Then cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. The resultant cell paste was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer II (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5/500 mm NaCl/0.1 mm EDTA/10 mmॆ-mercaptoethanol) per 1 g of cells and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were thawed on ice and after addition of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 0.1 mm were lysed with 100 mm spermidine plus 4 mg/ml lysozyme (at 10 mm and 0.4 mg/ml, respectively) in buffer II. Subsequent column chromatography was carried out at 4 °C using an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). After adding imidazole to 10 mm, the lysate was applied at 0.1 ml/min to a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been treated with 0.1 m NiSO4, and then equilibrated with buffer D (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5/500 mm NaCl/10 mm ॆ-mercaptoethanol/107 glycerol) containing 10 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer at 0.1 ml/min, and then the REV1 and REV7 proteins were eluted with 10 ml of a linear gradient of 10–100 mmimidazole in buffer D. Fractions containing both REV1 and REV7 proteins, which were eluted at about 50 mm imidazole, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C containing 400 mm NaCl then loaded at 0.1 ml/min onto a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer at 0.1 ml/min, and then the REV1 and REV7 proteins were eluted with 10 ml of a linear gradient of 400–700 mm NaCl in buffer C. Fractions containing both REV1 and REV7 proteins, which eluted at about 490 mm NaCl, were loaded at 0.1 ml/min onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer C containing 500 mmNaCl. The REV1 and REV7 proteins coeluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 410 kDa with a Stokes' radius of 60.3 Å. The REV-REV7 complex peak fractions were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Intact REV1 protein and deletion derivatives of the his6-REV1 protein were purified as described previously (15Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Google Scholar,16Masuda Y. Kamiya K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 88-92Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using BSA (BIO-RAD) as the standard. REV1 protein (24 ॖg) and REV7 protein (3 ॖg) were mixed in 70 ॖl of buffer C containing 500 mm NaCl. For truncated his6-REV1 derivatives, ΔN407 (4.2 ॖg) and ΔC885 (4.8 ॖg) proteins (15Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Google Scholar) were mixed with REV7 (1.5 ॖg). After incubation on ice for 2 h, a 50-ॖl aliquot of the mixture was loaded on a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 (Amersham Biosciences) column and equilibrated with buffer C containing 500 mm NaCl, and fractions (40 ॖl) were collected using the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against REV7 was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Murakumo (Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan) (27Murakumo Y. Roth T. Ishii H. Rasio D. Numata S. Croce C.M. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4391-4397Google Scholar). To obtain polyclonal antibodies against REV1, his6-REV1S-(245–847) was expressed in BL21 (DE3) (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar) at 15 °C, purified as described previously (15Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Google Scholar), and used to immunize a rabbit. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad), and then probed with rabbit REV1 antiserum (1:1000 dilution) or rabbit REV7 antiserum (1:2000 dilution). The blots were visualized with the ECL blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Sucrose density gradient sedimentation was performed as described (31Maki H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4389-4392Google Scholar). The purified REV1 protein (15 ॖg), REV7 protein (7 ॖg), and REV1-REV7 complex (12 ॖg) were sedimented through 2 ml of 10–407 sucrose gradient in buffer C containing 500 mm or 150 mm NaCl by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm for 20 h in a TLS 55 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C, and fractions (100 ॖl) were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gel bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 according to the method of Sambrooket al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and quantified using NIH image 1.60 software. Sedimentation coefficients were determined relative to those of standard proteins sedimented in parallel gradients. The oligonucleotide templates 5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTTCAXCATACAGTCAGTG-3′ (X = G; 30G, A; 30A, T; 30T, C; 30 °C, tetrahydrofuran; 30F) and the primer 5′-CACTGACTGTATG-3′ (P13) were purchased (17Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Fukuda S. Sumii M. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3040-3046Google Scholar). The latter was labeled using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and annealed to the template. The standard reaction mixture (25 ॖl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 25 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm dNTP, 100 nm primer-template, and 1 ॖl of protein sample diluted with buffer C containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.1 mg/ml BSA as indicated. After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated time, reactions were terminated with 10 ॖl of stop solution (30 mm EDTA/947 formamide/0.057 bromphenol blue/0.057 xylene cyanol), and products were resolved on 207 polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea and autoradiographed at −80 °C. The amount of DNA present in each band was quantified using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Recently, Murakumo and coworkers reported that the human REV1 protein directly interacts with the human REV7 protein (28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar). To determine whether the purified REV1 and REV7 proteins (Fig.1A) form a stable complex, they were mixed and incubated on ice, and then the mixture was subjected to gel filtration chromatography in the presence of 500 mm NaCl (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡). When the individual proteins were loaded on the column, REV1 of 138 kDa eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 380 kDa (Fig. 1B,panel a), (16Masuda Y. Kamiya K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 88-92Google Scholar) and REV7 of 24 kDa eluted as a single peak at an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa (Fig. 1B, panel b). When the mixture of two proteins were developed on gel filtration chromatography, a limited but significant fraction of REV7 was coeluted with REV1 under these conditions in the presence of 500 mm NaCl (Fig. 1B, panel c), suggesting that REV1 and REV7 form a salt-resistant complex. The binding domain in REV1 for REV7 has been mapped to the C terminus (28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar). It was further examined using purified truncated his6-REV1 proteins. ΔN407 (lacking the BRCT domain of the N terminus) and ΔC885 (lacking the C terminus) (15Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Google Scholar) were mixed with purified REV7 and loaded on the gel filtration column, and then the eluted fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Both ΔN407 and ΔC885 proteins eluted at an apparent molecular mass of around 200 kDa on this gel filtration chromatography (15Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Tsunekuni N. Minami T. Sumii M. Miyagawa K. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15051-15058Google Scholar). When the eluted fractions were analyzed by Western blotting, signals of REV7 were detected in fractions containing ΔN407 protein (Fig. 1C, panel a), but not ΔC885 (Fig.1C, panel b), in agreement with the previous report that the C terminus of REV1 contains the interaction domain with REV7 (28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar). With in vitro reconstitution, only a limited fraction of the proteins formed complexes. To purify a large amount, we established a system coexpressing the REV1and REV7 genes in E. coli. The plasmid, pBAD-REV7-REV1S expressing both genes from the pBAD promoter as an operon, was employed with addition of arabinose as an inducer. SDS-PAGE analysis of the total proteins of the cells after induction revealed bands for REV1 and REV7 (Fig.2A, lane 2) with sizes in agreement with the predicted molecular masses of 138 and 24 kDa respectively. The mobilities of the proteins in the SDS-PAGE were identical to those of individually purified REV1 and REV7 (Fig.1A, data not shown). Previously, we found that the intact REV1 protein has an affinity for a nickel-chelating column, eluting at about 20 mm imidazole (16Masuda Y. Kamiya K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 88-92Google Scholar). When the crude lysate was loaded onto a nickel-chelating column, the REV1 fractions were eluted at about 50 mm imidazole and also contained REV7 as judged by Western blotting (data not shown). This higher than expected affinity of the REV1 fraction for the nickel-chelating column could be due to the actions of the REV7 protein, suggesting complex formation. Whereas REV7 alone did not bind to heparin-Sepharose, as described under 舠Experimental Procedures,舡 with the mixture a significant fraction of REV7 was retained in the column and coeluted with REV1 (data not shown). The peak fraction from the heparin column was further loaded onto a gel filtration column (Fig. 2C), and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed REV1 and REV7 to coelute (Fig. 2C, top panel). Furthermore, the proteins were verified by Western blotting. The membrane was probed with anti REV7 antiserum first (Fig. 2C,bottom panel), stripped, and then probed with anti-REV1 antiserum (Fig. 2C, middle panel). The antibodies specifically detected the respective proteins, and no cross-reaction was observed (data not shown). In the gel filtration chromatography final step of the purification, REV1, REV7, and the REV1-REV7 complex were eluted with apparent molecular masses of 380, 27, and 410 kDa, respectively. The respective Stokes' radiuses were 59, 25, and 60.3 Å (TableI). To determine the molecular masses in solution, they were analyzed by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. They all sedimented as single peaks, and the REV1-REV7 complex co-sedimented through the centrifugation (data not shown), suggesting again a stable association. The determined sedimentation coefficients are summarized in Table I. Employing the method described by Siegel and Monty (33Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Google Scholar), we calculated the molecular masses of REV1, REV7, and the REV1-REV7 complex to be 138, 13, and 141 kDa, respectively (Table I), suggesting REV1 and REV7 to be monomers and the REV1-REV7 complex a heterodimer in solution. Analysis of the stoichiometry of the REV1 and REV7 proteins in the complex by scanning of a SDS-PAGE gel visualized by Coomassie staining gave a REV1:REV7 ratio of 1:0.6, suggesting again that the REV1-REV7 complex is a heterodimer.Table IPhysicochemical properties of REV1, REV7, and the REV1-REV7 complexProteinStokes' radius1-aEach Stokes' radius was determined by Superdex 200 gel filtration using the size markers ferritin (61.0 Å), aldolase (48.1 Å), ovalbumin (30.5 Å), and ribonuclease A (16.4 Å), and the data were based on A280 values monitored during the chromatography.Sedimentation coefficient1-bEach sedimentation coefficient was determined with catalase (11.3 S), aldolase (7.4 S), albumin (4.2 S), and ribonuclease A (1.8 S) as size markers, and the data were based on the SDS-PAGE gel profile.Molecular mass1-cEach molecular mass was calculated from the Stokes' radius and the sedimentation coefficient assuming a partial specific volume of 0.73 (33).Å× 10−13 sec (S20,w)kDaREV11-dBuffer C containing 500 mm NaCl was used for the analysis.595.6138REV71-eBuffer C containing 150 mm NaCl was used for the analysis.251.213REV1-REV71-dBuffer C containing 500 mm NaCl was used for the analysis.60.35.61411-a Each Stokes' radius was determined by Superdex 200 gel filtration using the size markers ferritin (61.0 Å), aldolase (48.1 Å), ovalbumin (30.5 Å), and ribonuclease A (16.4 Å), and the data were based on A280 values monitored during the chromatography.1-b Each sedimentation coefficient was determined with catalase (11.3 S), aldolase (7.4 S), albumin (4.2 S), and ribonuclease A (1.8 S) as size markers, and the data were based on the SDS-PAGE gel profile.1-c Each molecular mass was calculated from the Stokes' radius and the sedimentation coefficient assuming a partial specific volume of 0.73 (33Siegel L.M.

Open table in a new tab The deoxycytidyl transferase activity of the REV1-REV7 complex was analyzed by primer extension assay using a template, with G as the nucleotide immediately downstream from the annealed primer. When equivalent amounts of REV1 and REV1-REV7 were subjected to the assay, the time course of the deoxycytidyl transferase reaction was identical (Fig.3A). To determine the stability of the proteins in this reaction condition, incubation at 30 °C was performed for the indicated times and then residual activity was examined. The half-lives (∼20 min) of both were almost the same (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that the REV7 protein did not affect the transferase activity or stability of the REV1 protein. Then the substrate specificity of the transferase reactions was analyzed using five different primer-templates in the presence of 100 ॖm dNTPs (Fig. 3C). In this experiment, the respective primer-templates differed only at the template nucleotide immediately downstream from the annealed primer (16Masuda Y. Kamiya K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 88-92Google Scholar). The REV1-REV7 complex inserts dCMP opposite template G, A, T, C, and an AP site and inserts dGMP and dTMP opposite template G (Fig. 3C). The ability of the REV1-REV7 complex was essentially identical to that of REV1 alone (16Masuda Y. Kamiya K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 88-92Google Scholar). To confirm this, the kinetic parameters with the REV1-REV7 complex were determined by steady-state gel kinetic assays (Table II). The assays were all carried out with a 5-min incubation because the time course of the reactions was linear until 10 min (Fig. 3A). In the deoxycytidyl transferase reaction, the template nucleotides slightly affectedkcat values, which were 3.7, 2.5, 1.6, 2.1, and 4.5 min−1 opposite templates G, A, T, C, and an AP site, respectively (Table II). The template nucleotides strongly affected theKm value for dCTP (Table II), the affinity of which for template G was 53, 310, 380, and 28 times higher than for templates A, T, C, and an AP site, respectively. These properties of the REV1-REV7 complex were essentially identical to those of REV1 alone (16Masuda Y. Kamiya K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 88-92Google Scholar).Table IIKinetic parameters of deoxycytidyl transferase reactions of the REV1-REV7 complexTemplatekcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1ॖmmin−1ॖm−1G3.70.645.8A2.5340.073T1.62000.0083C2.12400.0086AP4.5180.26Kinetic assays were performed for 5 min in 25-ॖl reaction solutions using 57 fmol (9.3 ng) or 113 fmol (19 ng) of REV1-REV7 complex and 2.5 pmol of the primer-templates shown in Fig. 3C. dCTP concentrations ranged from 1 to 2500 ॖm.

Recently, Murakumo and coworkers found that human REV1 binds to human REV7 at the C terminus (28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar), an interaction that has not been reported in yeast, S. cerevisiae (20Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Google Scholar). Comparison of amino acid sequences revealed the C-terminal region to be highly conserved in the human and mouse REV1 proteins but not in the yeast counterpart (17Masuda Y. Takahashi M. Fukuda S. Sumii M. Kamiya K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3040-3046Google Scholar,28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar). This suggests that the interaction was acquired in higher eucaryotes, although it is conceivable that it was lost in yeast during evolution and might play an important role in translesion DNA synthesis in mammalian cells (28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar). In this work, we provided several lines of evidence that the human REV7 forms a stable heterodimer with REV1 protein. Purified REV1 and REV7 were found to have a considerable potential to form complexes in vitro even in the presence of 500 mm NaCl. Furthermore, both proteins co-purified after several purification steps and co-sedimented through centrifugation with constant stoichiometry. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that exogenously expressed REV1 protein co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous REV7 protein in HeLa cells (28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar). The molecular masses of REV1, REV7, and the REV1-REV7 complex in solution were calculated using Stokes' radius and sedimentation coefficients to be 138, 13, and 141 kDa, respectively. The value for REV1 agrees with the theoretical molecular mass of 138 kDa, while that of REV7 is smaller than the theoretical 25 kDa, suggesting the proteins to be monomers in solution. The ratio of band densities of the REV1 and REV7 proteins on a SDS-PAGE gel was assigned 1:0.6, suggesting a stoichiometry of 1:1 (163 kDa) or 2:1 (301 kDa). The former value agrees well with our result of 141 kDa, suggesting that the REV1-REV7 complex is a heterodimer in solution. Previously, it was suggested that the REV7 forms a homodimer and interacts through a common interface with REV1 (28Murakumo Y. Ogura Y. Ishii H. Numata S. Ichihara M. Croce C.M. Fishel R. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35644-35651Google Scholar). However, it is very likely, considering the following, that purified REV7 exists as a monomer in solution: (i) the obtained molecular mass of 13 kDa from our experiments is much smaller than the theoretical molecular mass of 24 kDa; (ii) the purified REV7 has the potential to assemble with purified REV1. If REV7 formed a stable homodimer, it could not interact with free REV1 because the interaction interface would be hidden by the homodimerization. Therefore, we suggest that REV7-REV7 interaction is transient and dynamic or tightly regulated in vivo. Surprisingly, our results demonstrated that the REV7 did not influence the stability, substrate specificity, or kinetic parameters of the transferase reactions of REV1 protein in contrast to the case with yeast Rev3, which exhibits strongly enhanced DNA polymerase activity and stability on assembly with Rev7 (20Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1646-1649Google Scholar). It is possible that such enhancement is yeast-specific or alternatively that in higher eucaryotes one of the important functions of the human REV7 is to assemble the REV1 protein to a large complex containing REV3 and/or other DNA polymerases, and this function might be required for translesion DNA replication. We thank Dr. Yoshiki Murakumo (Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan) for antiserum against the human REV7 protein. We are grateful to Akiko Kamegashira for help with the initial stages of this work and to Kumiko Mizuno, Masako Okii, and Hatsue Wakayama for laboratory assistance."

Membrane fusion is, however, an exceedingly difficult process to go through without the assistant of specific proteins, because of the protective nature of the biological membranes. In the neuron, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)1 proteins play an essential role in promoting membrane fusion (1Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Google Scholar). It is proposed that assembly of the SNARE complex initially bridges two membranes, induces lipid mixing, and leads to the hemifusion state and the fusion pore, of which the detailed mechanism is largely unknown (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar, 3Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Google Scholar, 4Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Google Scholar, 5Brunger A.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 163-173Google Scholar). Progress has been made in understanding the biophysical principles of SNARE assembly. SNARE assembly starts with the interaction of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2 or synaptobrevin) with target plasma membrane SNAREs Syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25. Interactions between SNARE proteins are mediated by 舠SNARE motifs舡 that are essentially coiled coil sequences and are present in all SNARE proteins (3Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Google Scholar). For the SNARE complex, one SNARE motif each from Syntaxin 1A and VAMP2 and two from SNAP-25 assemble into a 110-Å-long four-stranded coiled coil (6Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.-K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Google Scholar, 7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar). It is worthwhile to note that target plasma membrane SNAREs Syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 also spontaneously assemble into a similar but less stable four-stranded coiled coil (8Xiao W. Poirier M.A. Bennett M.K. Shin Y.-K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 308-311Google Scholar, 9Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Google Scholar, 10Zhang F. Chen Y. Kweon D.-H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24294-24298Google Scholar). How does coiled coil formation lead to membrane fusion? There are two features of the SNARE coiled coil that might be important. First, the helices are all aligned parallel, suggesting the co-location of two membrane attachment points, which sets up a favorable geometry for membrane fusion (6Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.-K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Google Scholar, 7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar, 11Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Google Scholar, 12Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1087-1094Google Scholar, 13Katz L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Brennwald P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6200-6209Google Scholar). Second, the coiled coil is highly stable (14Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Google Scholar, 15Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Google Scholar). Therefore, coiled coil formation might have the capacity to overcome the repulsive force between two apposing membranes. Although this mechanistic model appears to be structurally and energetically attractive, there are caveats that require careful consideration. For example, if the SNARE core were tethered with flexible linkers to membrane domains, coiled coil formation might not be able to bring about membrane apposition no matter how strong the pulling force it generates because the energy would be dissipated. To validate this model, a direct coupling between the coiled coil and membranes appears to be necessary. Previously, Brunger and co-workers proposed a hypothetical model for the coiled coil-to-membrane coupling (7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar). In this model, the coiled coil is linked to transmembrane domains (TMD) as continuous helices. This model arbitrarily assumes some bending flexibility of helices in short amino acid stretches at the membrane-proximal region. Furthermore, helix-disrupting mutations or amino acid insertions in the linker region have little or only moderate effect on the SNARE fusion activity, inconsistent with this model (16McNew J.A. Weber T. Engelman D.M. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 415-421Google Scholar,17Wang Y. Dulubova I. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28598-28605Google Scholar). How then is the coiled coil energetically coupled to membranes? The answer to this fundamental question hinges on structural information of the connection of the coiled coils to the membranes. Recent EPR investigations of intact SNAREs using site-directed spin labeling EPR have yielded new results that not only confirm the existence of coupling between the coiled coil and the membrane but also suggest a tentative mechanism of the SNARE core-membrane coupling. EPR analysis indicated that the linker region of Syntaxin 1A, enriched with basic amino acid residues, is unstructured but laterally inserted into the membrane, tightly coupling the coiled coil to the membrane (18Kweon D.-H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.-K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9264-9268Google Scholar,19Kim C.S. Kweon D.-H. Shin Y.-K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10928-10933Google Scholar). Importantly, clusters of basic amino acid residues are found in the linker regions of all transmembrane SNAREs (20Weimbs T. Mostov K. Low S.H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 260-262Google Scholar), raising the possibility that SNARE linker regions generally insert into the membrane. Further, this tentative model offers a plausible explanation as to why this region is tolerant to helix-disrupting mutations. However, structure and membrane topology of the VAMP2 linker region is not experimentally confirmed yet. In this work, we report the EPR and fluorescence investigations of the membrane topology of the recombinant SNARE complex. Fluorescence quenching analysis revealed that the native Trp residues at positions 89 and 90 in VAMP2 are inserted into the acyl chain region of the bilayer. Further, the EPR results reveal that the core domain maintains the coiled coil structure up to residue 92, suggesting that the SNARE coiled coil is partially inserted into the head group region of the bilayer. The EPR data also suggest that the coiled coil penetrates into the membrane with an oblique angle. Taken together, the new results further establish the concept of the tight SNARE core-membrane coupling, providing structural basis for the force transmission from the core region to the membrane during SNARE assembly. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (DOPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(6,7)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (6,7-Br2-PC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(11,12)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (11,12-Br2-PC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). (1-Oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolinyl-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSSL) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Canada). The paramagnetic reagent, nickel (II)-ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (NiEDDA) was synthesized following the procedure described elsewhere (21Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Google Scholar). Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus RIL were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). n-Octylglucoside (OG) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Bio-beads SM2 was obtained from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Qiagen Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Ultrafree Centrifugal Devices Biomax-5K for proteins was obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was purchased from Qiagen. Glutathione-agarose, human thrombin, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, l-methionine, n-lauroyl sarcosine, Triton X-100, Tween 20, glycerol, l-methionine, isopropyl-ॆ-d-thiogalactopyranoside, dithiothreitol, ampicillin sodium salt, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and the low molecular weight size marker for SDS-PAGE were all purchased from Sigma. Full-length VAMP2 (amino acids 1–116), the soluble SNARE motif of Syntaxin 1A (or Syntaxin H3) (amino acids 191–266), and the C-terminal SNARE motif of SNAP-25 (SNAP-25(C)) (amino acids 125–206) are inserted in the pGEX-KG vector as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins (22Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N-terminal SNARE motif of SNAP-25 (SNAP-25(N)) (amino acids 1–82) is in the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) as a N-terminal His6-tagged protein. To introduce a unique cysteine site for the specific nitroxide attachment, native cysteine 103 of VAMP2 was changed to alanine. All of the mutants were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing (Iowa State University DNA Sequencing Facility). Recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus RIL and purified using glutathione-agarose chromatography. Briefly, the cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with glucose (2 g/liter), ampicillin (100 ॖg/ml), and chloramphenicol (50 ॖg/ml) until theA600 reached 0.6–0.8. After the addition of isopropyl-ॆ-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm), the cells were grown further for 5 h more at 30 °C for SNAP-25(C), at 22 °C for full-length VAMP2 but at 16 °C for the Syntaxin 1A H3 domain. To purify the protein, the frozen cell pellet was resuspended in PBST-Met buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with Tween 20 (0.057) (percentages are v/v unless otherwise mentioned), 10 mm l-methionine, 2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 ॖm leupeptin, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were broken by sonication on the ice bath. For full-length VAMP2, Triton X-100 (0.57 (v/v) and n-lauroyl sarcosine (0.57) were added to the solution before sonication. After nutation for 30 min, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then mixed with glutathione-agarose beads in PBST-Met buffer, and the mixture was left at 4 °C for 40 min. The protein bound-beads were washed with an excess volume of PBST-Met buffer for SNAP-25(C) and Syntaxin H3 or with PBST-Met-Triton buffer (PBST-Met with 0.57 Triton X-100) for full-length VAMP2. The cysteine mutants were spin-labeled, while the protein was bound to the beads. After washing the beads with PBST-Met-Triton buffer without dithiothreitol, a 10-fold molar excess of MTSSL was added. The sample was initially reacted with MTSSL at room temperature for 1 h and left to stand at 4 °C overnight. Free MTSSL was removed by washing with PBST-Met-Triton buffer, and the spin-labeled protein was cleaved off from the resin with thrombin in the cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.17 Triton X-100). The His6-tagged protein SNAP-25(N) was expressed inE. coli M15[pREP4] (Qiagen) and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography. Briefly, the cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with glucose (2 g/liter), ampicillin (100 ॖg/ml), and kanamycin (25 ॖg/ml) until theA600 reached 0.6–0.8. After the addition of isopropyl ॆ -d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm), the cells were grown further for 5 h more at 30 °C. For protein purification, the frozen cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 ॖmleupeptin). After sonication on ice, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads in buffer A. The mixture was left equilibrated at 4 °C for 40 min. After equilibration the beads were washed with an excess volume of buffer A. The protein concentration was estimated by Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The spin labeling efficiency was estimated by comparing the double integration with the standard Tempo sample at 100 ॖm. Spin labeling was nearly quantitative for all VAMP2 mutants. Two separate SNARE motifs of SNAP-25 lacking the long interhelical loop were used to avoid the formation of domain-swapped complex (23Kweon D.-H. Chen Y. Zhang F. Poirier M. Kim C.S. Shin Y.-K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5449-5452Google Scholar). While His6-tagged SNAP-25(N) was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin, excess amounts of purified Syntaxin 1A H3, SNAP-25(C), and full-length VAMP2 (molar ratio of 1:1:2) were added to the solution. The solution contained 0.27 Triton X-100. The mixture was left to stand at 4 °C for 60 h. After extensive washing with buffer A containing 0.67 (w/v) OG, the recombinant SNARE complex was eluted with buffer A with 250 mm imidazole and 0.67 (w/v) OG. The complex was concentrated using a Centricon (5 K cut-off). During the concentration process buffer was changed to buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 107 glycerol) with 0.67 (w/v) OG. The final protein concentration was in the range of 80–100 ॖm. Large unilamella vesicles with a 100-nm diameter (100 mm total lipids) were prepared in buffer B without OG using an extruder. Vesicles of POPC containing 15 mol 7 of DOPS were first mixed with two volumes of the SNARE complex. OG was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 0.67. After dilution with an equal volume of buffer B, the samples were dialyzed against the buffer B containing Bio-beads SM2 adsorbent at 4 °C for 40 h. During the dialysis, the buffer was changed three times. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min to remove both the protein precipitates and the fraction of large vesicles. EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a low noise microwave amplifier (Miteq, Hauppauge, NY) and a loop-gap resonator (Medical Advances, Milwaukee, WI). The modulation amplitude was set at no greater than one-fourth of the line width. The spectra were collected at room temperature in first derivative mode. The gas exchange to the protein sample was achieved with the TPX EPR tube for the loop-gap resonator. For individual mutants, the power saturation curves were obtained from the peak-to-peak amplitude of the central line (M = 0) of the first derivative EPR spectrum as a function of incident microwave power in the range 0.1–40 mW. Three power saturation curves were obtained after equilibration: (i) with N2, (ii) with air (O2), and (iii) with N2 in the presence of 200 mm NiEDDA. From saturation curves, the microwave powerP12 , where the first derivative amplitude is reduced to one-half of its unsaturated value, was calculated. The quantity ΔP12 is the difference inP12 values in the presence and absence of a paramagnetic reagent. The ΔP12 value is proportional to the diffusion co-efficient times the collision frequency of the nitroxide to the freely diffusing reagents such as oxygen and NiEDDA. Thus, ΔP12 is considered to be equivalent to the accessibility W. The immersion depth is calculated based on the reference curves determined from a set of lipid molecules spin-labeled at different acyl chain positions. For fluorescence measurements, membrane samples were prepared from the recombinant SNARE complex with the wild-type sequences. Total lipid concentration was ∼2.5 mm, whereas the concentration of the SNARE complex was 5 ॖm. For acrylamide quenching, appropriate amounts of the acrylamide stock solution (2 m) were added to the membrane sample to make the final concentration in the range of 0–160 mm, whereas lipids and protein concentrations remain constant among samples. The fluorescence measurements were carried out with PerkinElmer fluorescence spectrophotometer. The samples were excited at 285 nm, and the emission spectra were collected in the range of 300–400 nm. The total fluorescence intensity F was obtained by integrating the intensity in this spectral range. The degree of quenching was analyzed according to the following Stern-Volmer equation. F0/F=1+KSV[Q]Equation 1 where Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of acrylamide, respectively, KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant for collisional quenching, and [Q] is the concentration of the quencher. The equation predicts a linear behavior ofFo/F versus [Q] for a homogeneous solution (24Birks J.B. Photophysics of Aromatic Molecules. Wiley-Interscience, New York1970Google Scholar). After fluorescence measurements, the membrane samples were treated with Triton X-100 (final concentration, 17) to subsequently measure the acrylamide quenching in a detergent-solubilized state. To measure the membrane immersion depth of Trp residues, membrane samples containing two types of lipid quenchers were prepared. Lipid quencher, 6,7-Br2-PC or 11,12-Br2-PC, was added in replacement of part of POPC while maintaining the DOPC mole fraction at 157. The reconstitution of SNARE complex was carried out by the same procedure described above. The degree of quenching was determined as a function of the mole fraction of added brominated PC. The averaged immersion depth of two Trp residues was calculated according to the parallax analysis (25Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5312-5322Google Scholar, 26Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Google Scholar). The distance of the Trp residue from the bilayer center ZCF is given by the following.ZCF=LC1+[−ln(F1/F2)/πC−L2]/2LEquation 2 where LC1 represents the distance from the bilayer center to the shallow quencher (11 Å for 6,7-Br2-PC), C is the mole fraction of the quencher divided by the area of the lipid molecule (70 Å2), F1 andF2 are the relative fluorescence intensities of the shallow (6,7-Br2-PC) and deep quenchers (11,12-Br2-PC), respectively, and L is the difference in the depth of the two quenchers (0.9 Å/CH2 or CBr2 group). The thickness of the hydrophobic region was approximated to be ∼29 Å (27McIntosh T.J. Holloway P.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1783-1788Google Scholar). For the calculation of immersion depth, the data collected for the 0.4 molar fraction quencher were used. For fluorescence measurement the recombinant complex was assembled from full-length VAMP2, soluble Syntaxin 1A, and two separate SNARE motifs from SNAP-25 (Fig. 1). The TMD of Syntaxin 1A was not included this time to avoid the coexistence of two TMDs in one membrane and to best mimic the 舠hypothetical舡 trans-SNARE complex in which two TMDs are separately anchored to two apposing membranes. In the recombinant SNARE complex, there are total two native Trp residues. Both of them reside at the membrane-proximal region of VAMP2 (Trp89 and Trp90) and belong to the coiled coil in the core structure (Fig. 1). This is ideal for the investigation of the possible coiled coil-membrane coupling using fluorescence. First, to examine whether these residues are exposed to the solvent or not, we monitored Trp fluorescence in the presence of an added quencher acrylamide that is hydrophilic and partitions heavily into the solution phase. For the detergent-solubilized SNARE complex, the fluorescence intensity (F) decreases sharply as the acrylamide concentration increases, suggesting that Trp residues are solvent-exposed (Fig. 2a,open circles). In contrast, for the membrane-reconstituted complex, F decreases little in the presence of added acrylamide (Fig. 2a, closed circles). This result strongly implies that Trp residues in the SNARE complex are sequestered from the water phase, suggesting the possibility of insertion into the membrane. Next, the insertion of Trp residues into the membrane is probed utilizing brominated lipids in which bromines are attached to the acyl chain of the lipid. In the presence of a brominated lipid, Trp fluorescence is effectively quenched only when Trp is in contact with the acyl chain region of the membrane. Otherwise, we would expect a negligible effect. As the mole fraction of the brominated lipid increases, a significant decrease in F was observed (Fig.2b), suggesting that Trp residues are inserted into the membrane. The immersion depth of Trp residues was calculated based on quenching efficiencies by the shallow lipid quencher 6,7-Br2-PC (the lipid with bromines at the sixth and seventh carbon positions) and the deep lipid quencher 11,12-Br2-PC. Trp residues are ∼8.8 Å below the phosphate groups of lipids. Because there are two Trp residues, the immersion depth determined here must be an average depth of two residues. In conclusion, Trp89 and Trp90that belong to the coiled coil are inserted in the membrane in the SNARE complex. To investigate the membrane topology of the SNARE complex further using site-directed spin labeling EPR, residues of full-length VAMP2 near the membrane-water interface were replaced with cysteines, to which a nitroxide spin label was attached. We prepared 13 spin-labeled mutants (K83C–M95C) to explore the interfacial region with EPR (Fig. 1). For EPR measurements, the recombinant complex was assembled from spin-labeled VAMP2, soluble Syntaxin 1A, and two separate SNARE motifs from SNAP-25. All spin-labeled recombinant complexes were capable of forming the SDS-resistant complex, which is one characteristic feature of the core complex, as confirmed with SDS-PAGE (data not shown). After reconstitution of the SNARE complex into POPC vesicles containing 15 mol 7 of DOPS, the EPR spectra were collected for spin-labeled mutants at room temperature. The EPR spectrum is sensitive to the tumbling rate of the nitroxide. EPR spectra shown in Fig.3 are all relatively broad, indicating slow motion. Slow motional spectra represent motionally restricted nitroxides. There are three structural factors that might have contributed to the immobilization of the nitroxide (28Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Google Scholar, 29Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Google Scholar, 30Columbus L. Hubbell W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 288-295Google Scholar): (i) The motional restriction of the peptide backbone, because of the α-helical secondary structure, could have reduced the tumbling rate of the nitroxide. (ii) Tertiary interactions with other parts of the protein would slow down the motion of the nitroxide significantly. On the basis of the crystal structure (7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar), we expect that the four-stranded coiled coil structure extends up to residue 92, which gives rise to many potential tertiary contacts between helices. (iii) From the fluorescence measurement it is clearly shown that Trp89 and Trp90 are inserted into the acyl chain region of the bilayer. Therefore, we expect that a significant part of the region is immersed in the membrane, which exposes nitroxides into the viscous membrane environment and the high density head group region. It is likely that the combination of all three factors contributed to the EPR spectral broadening. Additionally, to examine the possibility of intermolecular interactions between SNARE complexes, we measured low temperature (130 K) EPR spectra in which the spectral broadening caused by the spin-spin interaction is readily identified (31Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Google Scholar). Comparison of the low temperature EPR spectra with the standard confirmed that SNARE complexes are separated from each other beyond the detectable distance range (less than 25 Å) (data not shown), eliminating the possibility of self-aggregation of the SNARE complex. It is interesting to note that EPR spectra for positions 93–95 are less broad than others. In fact, EPR spectra for these three positions closely resemble those observed for the nitroxide attached to the membrane-inserted linker region of Syntaxin 1A (18Kweon D.-H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.-K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9264-9268Google Scholar, 19Kim C.S. Kweon D.-H. Shin Y.-K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10928-10933Google Scholar). The EPR line shape is a useful parameter for the tumbling rate of the nitroxide that, in many cases, provides a qualitative assessment of the local environment surrounding the nitroxide (29Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Google Scholar). However, the line shape alone is often not sufficient to yield information pinpointing the secondary and the tertiary structures. Furthermore, the partial insertion of the protein into the bilayer makes the matters complicated for the SNARE complex. Here, we utilized the EPR saturation method to assess the local structure and the membrane topology of the linker region. For the nitroxide, the EPR saturation method measures the accessibility to a water-soluble paramagnetic reagent such as NiEDDA (WNiEDDA) to estimate the solvent exposure of the spin-labeled site, or the accessibility to a nonpolar paramagnetic reagent such as molecular oxygen (WO2) to probe, for example, the insertion into the membrane (32Macosko J.C. Kim C.-H. Shin Y.-K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1139-1148Google Scholar, 33Shin Y.-K. Levinthal C. Levinthal F. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 960-963Google Scholar, 34Altenbach C. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1088-1092Google Scholar). In Fig. 4 WNiEDDA and WO2 for the SNARE complex are plotted against the residue number, respectively. We observe an overall decrease of WNiEDDA, whereas we detect an overall increase of WO2. Interestingly, however, there are quite significant increases and decreases for WNiEDDA along the sequence, which might imply a secondary structure such as α-helix. Further, the WO2 values show variations that appear to be in opposite directions to those of WNiEDDA, although the trend is much less clear. Such an out-of-phase oscillatory behavior of WNiEDDA and WO2 has been previously found for α-helical peptides residing at membrane-water interface, which includes the fusion peptide of influenza hemagglutinin and a synthetic amphiphilic peptide (32Macosko J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2086259011,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family (also known as FGF-7), is an important protective factor for epithelial cells. The receptor for KGF (also called FGFR2-IIIb), which has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, is expressed specifically on epithelial cells and in the lung epithelium. Administration of KGF has been shown to protect the lung from various insults, but the mechanism of protection is not well understood. To understand the mechanism by which KGF exerts protective functions on epithelial cells, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify proteins that interact with the KGF receptor (KGFR). Here we show that the cytoplasmic domain of KGFR interacts with p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) 4, which is a new member of the PAK family. The PAKs are regulated by the Rho-family GTPases Rac and Cdc42. PAK4 is the most divergent member of the PAK family of proteins and may have distinct functions. However, stimuli that regulate PAK4 activity are not known. Our data show that PAK4 can associate with the KGFR, which is dependent on KGFR tyrosine kinase activity. We show that a dominant negative mutant of PAK4 blocks KGF-mediated inhibition of caspase-3 activation in epithelial cells subjected to oxidant stress. Our data demonstrate that PAK4 is an important mediator of the anti-apoptotic effects of KGF on epithelial cells.

Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The activities of FGFs are mediated by binding to receptors that have tyrosine kinase activity. To date, four FGF receptors have been described, namely FGFR1, FGFR 2, FGFR 3, FGFR 4, and their splice variants (3Ornitz D.M. Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3005.1-3005.12Crossref Google Scholar, 4Ornitz D.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 5McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Each FGF receptor contains an extracellular domain composed of 2–3 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like loops, a transmembrane segment, and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of FGFR1–3, the third Ig loop is encoded by two exons, an invariant exon called IIIa that is spliced to either exon IIIb or IIIc, yielding receptors with distinct ligand binding abilities. FGFR2-IIIb binds FGF1, FGF3, FGF7 (also called keratinocyte growth factor or KGF), and FGF10 (6Bellusci S. Grindley J. Emoto H. Itoh N. Hogan B.L. Development. 1997; 124: 4867-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Finch P.W. Cunha G.R. Rubin J.S. Wong J. Ron D. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It is expressed specifically on epithelial cells and is diffusely expressed in the day 11 lung (8Cardoso W.V. Itoh A. Nogawa H. Mason I. Brody J.S. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Gene-targeting studies have revealed an indispensable role for this receptor in mouse lung development. Transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative mutant of FGFR2-IIIb under the control of a lung-specific promoter exhibit embryonic lethality with grossly abnormal lung development with only two primordial epithelial tubes and no branching morphogenesis (9Peters K. Werner S. Liao X. Wert S. Whitsett J. Williams L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3296-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice with homozygous mutations in FGFR2-IIIb are viable until birth but show severe defects with no evidence of lung formation (10De Moerlooze L. Spencer-Dene B. Revest J. Hajihosseini M. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Development. 2000; 127: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key observation in these mice is that although the growth of organs such as lungs and limbs is initiated, further development is not sustained in the face of extensive apoptosis in the tissues (10De Moerlooze L. Spencer-Dene B. Revest J. Hajihosseini M. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Development. 2000; 127: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions between FGFR2-IIIb and its ligands are just as important in adults. For example, FGF7/KGF has been shown to be essential in wound reepithelialization after skin injury (11Werner S. Smola H. Liao X. Longaker M.T. Krieg T. Hofschneider P.H. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The administration of KGF has been shown to protect the lungs of animals from a variety of insults, including oxygen (12Panos R.J. Bak P.M. Simonet W.S. Rubin J.S. Smith L.J. J. Clin.

Biol. 1996; 15: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the detailed downstream signaling pathways that contribute to KGF-FGFR2-IIIb-mediated cell protection are not well understood. Here we show that FGFR2-IIIb interacts with a protein that shares 86% identity with a member of the PAK family of kinases, namely PAK4, previously identified in human cells (16Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). PAK proteins were originally described as downstream targets for the Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 (17Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar,18Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The PAK proteins can be essentially divided into two categories, Groups I and II, based on their structures (19Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In Group I are the proteins PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3. Each of these proteins has an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. The regulatory domain also includes the GTPase-binding domain, which mediates binding to Rac and Cdc42. These PAK members also bind to SH3 domain-containing adapter proteins such as Nck through the proline residues in the regulatory domain (17Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus interacts with yeast G protein βγ-subunits, which suggests that these PAK proteins may be regulated by heterotrimeric G proteins in mammalian cells. In Group II are PAK4 (16Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), PAK5, and PAK6 (19Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although overall human PAK4 resembles other PAK members in that it also contains an amino-terminal GTPase-binding domain and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain, it lacks a G protein βγ-binding domain or the ability to bind to Nck (16Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Even within the GTPase-binding domain and the kinase domain, it shares only 50% similarity with other PAK members (16Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although a role for PAK proteins in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization is well described, PAK proteins, particularly those belonging to Group II, have been implicated in other distinct cellular processes (19Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). For example, PAK6 has been shown to bind to the androgen receptor and repress androgen receptor-mediated gene transcription in the presence of the ligand androgen (20Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The different members of the PAK family have been shown to have different roles in the apoptotic response of cells. Although PAK2 promotes apoptosis (21Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 22Lee N. MacDonald H. Reinhard C. Halenbeck R. Roulston A. Shi T. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13642-13647Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), PAK1 has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal (23Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 24Schurmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Recently, PAK4 was shown to protect cells from apoptosis induced by multiple stimuli, including serum withdrawal, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) treatment, or UV irradiation (25Gnesutta N. Qu J. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14414-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although PAK4 has been shown to be a target for Cdc42, extracellular stimuli that regulate endogenous PAK4 activity have not been identified. Here, using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have identified an association between the KGFR and PAK4. Our studies suggest that this association may play an important role in the protective effects of KGF on epithelial cells. Duplex-ATMyeast two-hybrid system (OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) was used to identify KGFR-interacting proteins. The KGFR cytoplasmic domain containing the tyrosine kinase domain was cloned into the yeast expression plasmid pEG202-NLS, and the resulting bait construct was named pNEGKGFRc. Expression of the cytoplasmic domain of the KGFR in the yeast strain EGY194 led to autophosphorylation of the receptor as judged by immunoprecipitation with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and Western blotting with an anti-KGFR antibody. We first ensured that the bait construct, pNEGKGFRc containing the LexA-KGFRc fusion, did not activate reporter genes due to autoactivation. Autoactivation of the reporter gene lacZ was checked by co-transforming EGY194 with pNEGKGFRc and the reporter plasmid pSH18–34. No activation oflacZ was observed with the LexA-KGFRc fusion protein. To identify KGFR-interacting proteins, EGY194 was first transformed with pNEGKGFRc and pSH18–34, and the pretransformed EGY194 was next transformed with a cDNA expression library constructed from cDNA derived from a 19-day-old post-coital mouse embryo fused to the B42 activation domain HA-tagged expression vector pJG4–5. After selecting clones potentially expressing interacting proteins, the specificity of the interaction was confirmed by a yeast-mating assay. The expression plasmid isolated from the putative positive clone was introduced into EGY194 (a strain), and a combination of the bait plasmid (pNEGKGFRc) and reporter plasmid (pSH18–34) was introduced into EGY40 (α-strain) and used in the mating test. Appropriate controls were used in the mating assay. Among the positive clones, three independent clones contained sequences that matched with the sequence of human PAK4. Full-length cDNA of mPAK4 was cloned by 5′-RACE (Clontech). The mouse lung cDNA library (Clontech) was applied as a template in touchdown PCR using PfuTurbo (Stratagene), which amplified the full-length mPAK4 gene. The PCR product was subcloned into a TOPO vector (Invitrogen). SP6 and T7 primers were used for sequencing and, after sequence confirmation, the full-length cDNA was named mPAK4. The chimeric trk/KGFR plasmid was kindly provided by Martin Sachs (Akt-r-29; MDC Max-Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany). The mutagenesis of the tyrosine residues of trk-KGFR was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The sequences of the primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: (i) trk/KGFR(Y542F,Y543F), 5′-GGGATATCAACAACATAGA CttctttAAAAA GACCA CAA A TGGGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCCCATTTGTGGTCTTTTTaaagaaGTCTATGTTGTTGATATCCC-3′; (ii) trk/KGFR(Y352F), 5′-CCACTTTGGATCCTCTGGCAACTCaaaCTCGGAGACCCCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGGGTCTCCGAGtttGAGTTGCCAGAGGATCCAAAGTGG-3′; and (iii) trk/KGFR(Y655F), 5′-CTCACAACCAATGAGGAAttcTTGGATCTCACCCAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTGGGTGAGATCCaagAATTCCTCATTGGTTGTGAG-3′. Plasmids for the mammalian expression of HA-tagged full-length mPAK4 (pHA-mPAK4) and its amino-terminal (pHA-mPAK4/NT) domains were constructed by subcloning full-length or truncated cDNA encoding the amino-terminal domain of PAK4 into the NotI/Asp718 sites of the appropriate pCruz-HA vector for cloning in the correct reading frame (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To express the protein(s) of interest, the constructs were either transfected individually or co-transfected into HEK293 cells. 36 h post-transfection, cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h and then stimulated with or without KGF (100 ng/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or NGF (100 ng/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), depending on whether we wished to stimulate the endogenous receptor or the chimeric receptor in trk-KGFR-transfected cells. Cells were then lysed in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO3, and the complete protease-inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalog number 1697498). Protein concentration in the cell extracts was detected and measured using the DCTM protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, catalog number 500-0112). In general, the appropriate polyclonal antibody coupled with Sepharose was used for immunoprecipitation, and either unconjugated mouse monoclonal antibody or enzyme-conjugated antibody from the same species was used for immunoblotting. Cell extracts and the appropriate antibody coupled to Sepharose beads were incubated together at 4 °C for 12–16 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed fours times with IP buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with the appropriate antibodies. The antibodies used were anti-HA affinity matrix and anti-HA-peroxidase high affinity antibodies, catalog numbers 1815016 and 2013819 respectively (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-Bek (KGFR) antibody (SC122, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Grb2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (SC-255AC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibody (SC8034, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphotyrosine (pY) antibody pY99 (SC7020 AC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-TrkA antibody against the extracellular domain of TrkA (06574, Upstate Biotechnology). Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. To identify proteins that interact with FGFR2III-b/KGFR, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins that interact with the kinase (cytoplasmic) domain of KGFR. A murine embryonic cDNA library was screened for possible interactions with a chimeric bait comprising LexA and the cytoplasmic domain of KGFR. Among the several positive clones identified in this assay, three independent clones contained DNA fragments with open reading frames that were highly homologous to the carboxyl terminus of human PAK4. The corresponding full-length cDNA was cloned using 5′-RACE. Fig. 1 A shows the predicted amino acid sequence of the full-length cDNA. Domain search revealed the presence of a p21 Rho-binding domain (PBD) and a protein kinase domain (PKD) in hPAK4 (GenBankTM Accession number NM_005884). The amino acid sequence was found to share 86% identity with that of hPAK4 (Fig. 1 B) and less than 50% identity, only in the PKD domain, with the corresponding domain present in murine PAK1–3. We therefore consider this to be murine PAK4 (mPAK4; GenBankTM Accession number AY217016). We investigated whether endogenous KGFR and PAK4 associate with each other in HEK293 epithelial cells. HEK293 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-KGFR antibody or control immunoglobulin, and analysis of the immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-human PAK4 revealed the presence of PAK4 in immunoprecipitates obtained with the anti-PAK4 but not the control Ig (Fig. 2 A). The association between the two proteins was detected in the absence of KGF and was not appreciably augmented upon treatment of the cells with KGF. Interaction between these two proteins was also detected when HA-tagged murine PAK4 was used (Fig. 2 B). To further explore interactions between KGFR and PAK4, we expressed a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular ligand-binding domain of NGF (Trk) and the cytoplasmic domain of KGFR, which we termed trk-KGFR. The rationale for using the chimeric receptor was that, because epithelial cells do not express the NGF receptor, treatment of cells with NGF would allow us to specifically monitor the activity of the hybrid receptor without interference from the endogenous KGF receptor. Also, in the absence of an effective anti-KGFR antibody that could be used for immunoprecipitation, the anti-TrkA antibody was particularly useful. As shown in Fig. 2 C, at a lower level of trk-KGFR expression, NGF-stimulation was required for co-immunoprecipitation of trk-KGFR and PAK4 (Fig. 2 C). However, at higher levels of expression of the chimeric receptor, the association was readily detectable with (Fig. 2 C) or without (not shown) NGF stimulation. Because receptor tyrosine kinases are known to undergo ligand-independent activation (autophosphorylation) due to dimerization when the protein is overexpressed, it is possible that phosphorylation augments or stabilizes association between PAK4 and KGFR. We also found that the tyrosine residues 542 and 543, corresponding to tyrosine residues 653 and 654 in FGFR1 (which are autophosphorylation sites of KGFR), are critical for the association with PAK4 (Fig3 A). However, mutations of tyrosine residues 352 and 655 corresponding to tyrosine residues 463 and 766 in FGF receptor 1, the putative binding sites for Shc and PLC-γ, respectively, with FGF receptor 1 (26Mohammadi M.

It is to be noted that, compared with the wild type receptor, these mutant receptors displayed reduced basal autophosphorylation, which may be due to reduced receptor dimerization when these residues are mutated.Figure 3Association of mPAK4 with different mutant forms of trk/KGFR. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pHA-mPAK4 and ptrk/KGFR or the indicated mutants (mut). 36 h post-transfection, cells were serum deprived and then left with or without NGF (100 ng/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min. 0.4 mg of lysate protein was used for IP with anti-HA-coupled agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Bek (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-HA to demonstrate expression of HA-mPAK4.

Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The PAK family members have been shown to associate with the adapter protein Nck, which has similarities to Grb2 (30Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A. Knaus U.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, PAK4, the sequence of which is the most divergent of all PAK proteins, does not associate with Nck (16Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PAK4 has the ability to associate with Grb2. Because Nck and PAK1 have been shown to form a complex in the absence of growth factor stimulation (32Stoletov K.V. Ratcliffe K.E. Spring S.C. Terman B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22748-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we investigated whether PAK4 exists in a complex with Grb2 in unstimulated cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, anti-Grb2 antibody-immunoprecipitated PAK4 and KGF had no effect on Grb2-PAK4 association. We also investigated whether endogenous KGFR associates with Grb2. Immunoprecipitation of HEK293 cell extracts with anti-Bek but not control Ig led to co-immunoprecipitation of Grb2 as revealed by immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates with anti-Grb2 (Fig. 4 B). If anti-Bek and anti-Grb2 have comparable affinities for their respective proteins, then a comparison of the amount of Grb2 co-immunoprecipitated with KGFR with the net Grb2 obtained by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-Grb2 shows that a small fraction of Grb2 is complexed with KGFR in the cells, which probably reflects the level of KGFR expression in the cells. Also, we detected similar levels of Grb2 in the immunoprecipitate whether cells were left with or without KGF. To determine the importance of specific phosphorylation sites for KGFR-Grb2 association, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for trk-KGFR (wild type or individual mutants). We uniformly treated all cells with NGF to achieve maximum receptor activation, because overexpression of the wild type receptor consistently resulted in basal autophosphorylation and, therefore, only small differences between stimulated and unstimulated cells were expected (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4 C, the wild type receptor associated with Grb2 and the autophosphorylation site of the receptor was critical for this association. Again, the other tyrosine residues, Tyr352 and Tyr655, did not affect association with Grb2 and, similar to what was observed with PAK4, the mutation of Tyr352 actually augmented association of Grb2 with the receptor. The receptor-Grb2 complex also contained PAK4 (Fig. 4 D). Because the endogenous KGFR was found to associate with both PAK4 and Grb2 in the absence of KGF stimulation of cells, and because for both associations the autophosphorylation sites in the KGFR were found to be critical for association, it is possible that the endogenous KGFR (at least a fraction of the receptor) in HEK293 cells exists in an autophosphorylated state. Also, because Grb2 is widely expressed in many species, including yeasts, it is possible that the association between KGFR and PAK4 is indirect and mediated by Grb2, because Grb2 has been shown to bind to receptor tyrosine kinases in yeast two-hybrid assays. Also, we were unable to co-immunoprecipitate KGFR and PAK4 when the recombinant proteins were expressed in bacteria, which reinforces our suspicion that Grb2 mediates association between the receptor and PAK4. The association between PAK4 and KGFR (Fig.1) prompted us to investigate whether PAK4 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to receptor activation. As shown in Fig.5, activation of the hybrid receptor with NGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK4, which was clearly evident in cells that expressed higher levels of the chimeric receptor. The phosphorylation status paralleled that of the chimeric receptor. Thebottom panel of Fig. 5 demonstrates equivalent expression of HA-PAK4 in all cells. Because our data suggested an important role for PAK4 in cellular protection by KGF, we investigated whether interference of PAK4 function would influence anti-apoptotic functions induced by KGF in HEK293 cells. For this purpose, we treated HEK293 cells with H2O2, which has been shown to induce pro-apoptotic pathways in these cells (33Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Because apoptosis is associated with caspase-3 activation, a focal point of different pro-apoptotic pathways, we investigated the state of protein PARP, a substrate of caspase-3, in the cells under different conditions of treatment. Also, to inhibit the functions of endogenous PAK4, we overexpressed the N-terminal fragment of PAK4 lacking the kinase domain, the inactivation of which imparts dominant negative functions to PAK4 (16Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 34Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, treatment of cells with H2O2 promoted cleavage of the PARP protein. Cleavage of PARP was inhibited in the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-fluoromethylketone or KGF. However, when the PAK4 dominant negative mutant was expressed in the cells, KGF was unable to inhibit PARP cleavage. Furthermore, Fig. 6 C shows that the PAK4 mutant is able to interact with the KGF receptor. By binding to the receptor, the mutant is probably able to disrupt KGFR signaling to downstream pathways. In this study, we have identified PAK4 as a KGFR-interacting protein using a yeast two-hybrid assay. We show that this interaction has functional relevance, because expression of a dominant negative mutant of PAK4 prevented the inhibition of oxidant-induced caspase-3 activation by KGF in epithelial cells. It is interesting to note that just as mice deficient in the KGF receptor show organ malformation with evidence of enhanced apoptosis of developing organs such as the lung (9Peters K. Werner S. Liao X. Wert S. Whitsett J. Williams L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3296-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 10De Moerlooze L. Spencer-Dene B. Revest J. Hajihosseini M. Rosewell I. Dickson C.

Rein K.H. Schafer U. Pfister H. Jackle H. Heisenberg M. Raabe T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1223-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human PAK4 was identified as the most divergent member of the PAK family of proteins (16Abo A. Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Dan C. Fritsch A. Baud V. Belisle B. Minden A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6527-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The mouse PAK4 we cloned shares 86% homology with hPAK4, with greatest identity in the p21 Rho-binding domain and the protein kinase domain. In addition to its role as a cytoskeletal regulatory protein, PAK4 has been shown to induce anchorage-independent growth and promote cell survival in response to different stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor α and UV irradiation. Although important functions of PAK4 have been identified, factors that stimulate PAK4 activity have heretofore not been identified. The KGFR-PAK4 association, as identified in this study, provides a link between extracellular stimuli and endogenous PAK4 activity. We also show that the KGFR-PAK4 complex is dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of the KGFR and that PAK4 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon receptor activation. In previous studies, tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK1 was reported in v-ErbB-transformed cells, and dephosphorylation of PAK led to a reduction in PAK kinase activity (36McManus M.J. Boerner J.L. Danielsen A.J. Wang Z. Matsumura F. Maihle N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35328-35334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of PAK was not Ras-, Rac- or Cdc42-dependent, which led to the suggestion that this activity of PAK1 may be distinct from growth factor-induced mitogenic activity (36McManus M.J.

Similarly, PAK4 was also shown to promote anchorage-independent growth (34Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and both PAK1 and PAK4 have been shown to possess anti-apoptotic functions and cause phosphorylation and inactivation of the death-promoting protein Bad (23Tang Y.

It has been reported previously that PAK1 is recruited to growth factor receptors such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors through association with Nck (37Zhao Z.S.

We show that Grb2, an adaptor protein similar to Nck, associates with PAK4. Grb2 is recruited to ligand-activated growth factors, which results in targeting of the Ras guanylnucleotide exchange factor SOS to the plasma membrane location of Ras, which, in turn, promotes Raf-1 recruitment and activation of the MAP kinase pathway (28Klint P.

The association between Grb2 and PAK4 may involve the SH3 domains in Grb2 and the proline-rich PXXP residues in the p21-binding domain in PAK4. Thus, although independent studies have implicated both molecules, KGF and PAK4, in protection from cell death, our study connects them in a novel signaling axis that may have critical protective functions during organ development in the embryonic stage and during injury in adults.

In addition, we show that Jak-2/STAT-3-dependent induction of expression of cPLA2 is required for PDGF-BB-induced arachidonic acid release and growth in VSMC.

Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were growth-arrested by incubation in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 72 h and used to perform the experiments unless otherwise stated. VSMC were labeled with [3H]AA (0.3 μCi/ml) while growing exponentially; and at 90% confluence, cells were quiesced in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum and 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]AA for 72 h at 37 °C. Cells were then rinsed several times with DMEM. After rinsing, cells were added to 2 ml of DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of the indicated pharmacological inhibitors for 1 h, and [3H]AA release into the medium was measured as described previously (15Rao G.N. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 197-201Google Scholar). In the case of testing the effect of a dominant-negative STAT-3 mutant on [3H]AA release, cells were transfected first with expression plasmid DNA for the dominant-negative STAT-3 mutant, followed by labeling with [3H]AA. VSMC with and without appropriate treatments were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the indicated times. After labeling, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was suspended in cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and vortexed vigorously to lyse cells. After standing on ice for 20 min, the cell lysate mixture was passed through a Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filter. The filter was washed once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with cold 70% (v/v) ethanol. The filter was dried and placed in a liquid scintillation vial containing the scintillant fluid, and the radioactivity was measured in a Beckman LS 5000TA liquid scintillation counter. Nuclear extracts were prepared from treated or untreated VSMC as described previously (39Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R. Wu Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6003-6010Google Scholar). The protein content of the nuclear extracts was determined using a Micro BCATM protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Protein·DNA complexes were formed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 3 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15% glycerol, and 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 30 min on ice. In some experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-STAT-3 antibodies for 3 h prior to protein-DNA binding assay. The protein·DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel using 1× Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mm glycine, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase kit (Invitrogen) following the supplier's protocol. After appropriate treatments, VSMC were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed by thawing in 250 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. After standing on ice for 20 min, the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates containing an equal amount of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, AmershamBiosciences). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (AmershamBiosciences). VSMC were plated evenly onto 100-mm dishes and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At 50–80% confluence, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum, and cells were transfected with the pSIE-CAT plasmid using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty hours after transfection, VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of AG490 (25 μm) for 4 h, and cell extracts were prepared. VSMC lysates were normalized for protein and assayed for CAT activity using [14C]chloramphenicol and acetyl coenzyme A as substrates. In parallel experiments, VSMC were plated evenly onto 60-mm dishes and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells at 90% confluence were transfected with dominant-negative STAT-3 mutant plasmid (pFS3DM) DNA (5 μg/60-mm dish) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 16 h after transfection and incubated in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 36 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 36 h, and DNA synthesis was measured by pulse labeling cells with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the last 24 h of the 36-h treatment period as described above. All experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Data on AA release, cPLA2 activity, and DNA synthesis are presented as means ± S.D. The treatment effects were analyzed by Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. In the case of CAT activity, EMSA, and Western blot analyses, one representative set of data is shown. To understand the mitogenic signaling events of PDGF-BB in VSMC, we have studied the role of cPLA2. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for various times, and cell extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of protein from control and PDGF-BB-treated cells were analyzed by Western blotting for cPLA2 using its specific antibodies. PDGF-BB induced cPLA2 expression in a time-dependent manner, with 2- and 3-fold increases at 8 and 16 h of treatment, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The increase in cPLA2 expression induced by PDGF-BB also resulted in an increase in its activity as measured by hydrolysis of arachidonoyl thiophosphatidylcholine using a commercially available kit (Fig. 1 B). Earlier studies from other laboratories have reported that cPLA2 plays a role in AA release and growth in response to some agonists (15Rao G.N. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 197-201Google Scholar, 40Anderson K.M. Roshak A. Winkler J.D. McCord M. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30504-30511Google Scholar, 41Denson D.D. Worrell R.T. Middleton P. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C201-C209Google Scholar). To test the role of cPLA2 in receptor tyrosine kinase agonist-induced AA release and growth, we studied the effect of arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), a specific inhibitor cPLA2 (42Street I.P. Lin H.K. Laliberte F. Ghomashchi F. Wang Z. Perrier H. Tremblay N.M. Huang Z. Weech P.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5935-5940Google Scholar), on PDGF-BB-induced AA release and growth. Quiescent VSMC that were prelabeled with [3H]AA were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of AACOCF3 (10 μm) for 1 h, and [3H]AA release was measured. PDGF-BB stimulated [3H]AA release by ∼6-fold, and this effect was significantly inhibited by AACOCF3 (Fig.2 A). To understand the role of cPLA2 in PDGF-BB-induced growth, quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of AACOCF3 (10 μm) for 24 h, and growth was measured by pulse labeling cells with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the last 12 h of the 24-h incubation period and determining the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts/min. PDGF-BB stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation by 9-fold, and this response was completely inhibited by AACOCF3 (Fig. 2 B). AACOCF3 alone had no toxic effects in VSMC, at least for 72 h as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay.Figure 2AACOCF3, a selective inhibitor of cPLA2 , reduces PDGF-BB-induced AA release and DNA synthesis in VSMC.

Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for various times, and cell extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from the control and each treatment was analyzed by Western blotting for tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and STAT-3 using their phospho-specific antibodies. PDGF-BB stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both Jak-2 and STAT-3 in a time-dependent manner, with a maximum effect of 5–15-fold at 10 min and reaching basal levels by 4 h (Fig. 3 A). Jak proteins phosphorylate STAT proteins at tyrosine residues and activate them, although other mechanisms were also reported to be involved in the activation of these transcription factors (43Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Google Scholar, 44Sachsenmaier C. Sadowski H.B. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3583-3592Google Scholar). To determine whether PDGF-BB-stimulated STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by Jak-2, we tested the effect of AG490, a potent and specific inhibitor of Jak-2 (45Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Google Scholar). AG490 (25 μm) significantly inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 (Fig.3 B). The inhibition of PDGF-BB-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-3 by AG490 was not due to its toxic effects in VSMC, as this compound did not affect the viability of these cells over a period of 72 h as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Because earlier studies have reported that PDGF-BB phosphorylates STAT-3 independent of Jak-2 and involving the PDGFR, we also tested whether AG490 affects PDGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. AG490 had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR induced by PDGF-BB, a finding that suggests that the inhibitory effect of AG490 on STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation is specific. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT proteins undergo either homo- or heterodimerization and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind (in this case, STAT-3) to their consensus DNA-binding sequence present in the promoter regions of genes and induce transcription (33Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 46Ehret G.B. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Horvath C.M. Fritz S. Nabholz M. Bucher P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6675-6688Google Scholar). To test whether STAT-3, upon its tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB, translocates to the nucleus, quiescent cells were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 30 min, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared. An equal amount of protein from the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of control and PDGF-BB-treated cells was analyzed by Western blotting for the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-3. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-3 levels were detected only in the nuclear fraction of PDGF-BB-treated cells, and AG490 reduced these levels (Fig.4). To determine whether translocation of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-3 correlates with increased transcription activation, STAT-3 DNA-binding activity was measured. Quiescent VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 2 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. An equal amount of nuclear protein from the control and each treatment was analyzed by EMSA for STAT-3 DNA-binding activity using 32P-labeled STAT-3 consensus oligonucleotide as a probe. PDGF-BB increased STAT-3 DNA-binding activity by 6-fold, and it was inhibited by AG490 (Fig.5 A). Preincubation of nuclear extracts with anti-STAT-3 antibodies also significantly reduced PDGF-BB-induced protein·DNA complex formation (Fig. 5 A). This result suggests that PDGF-BB-induced protein·DNA complexes contain STAT-3 either as homo- or heterodimers with other members of the STAT transcription factor family. To confirm that increased STAT-3 DNA-binding activity leads to increased transactivation activity, cells were transiently transfected with a STAT-3-dependent reporter plasmid (pSIE-CAT), quiesced, and treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 4 h, and cell extracts were prepared. Cell extracts normalized for protein were assayed for CAT activity. PDGF-BB induced STAT-3-dependent CAT activity by 4-fold, and AG490 substantially inhibited this response (Fig. 5 B). To understand whether the Jak/STAT pathway plays a role in PDGF-BB-induced expression of cPLA2, we next studied the effect of AG490 on this event. AG490 completely inhibited PDGF-BB-induced cPLA2 expression (Fig.6 A). Consistent with this observation, AG490 also inhibited PDGF-BB-induced cPLA2activity (Fig. 6 B). To obtain additional evidence on the role of the Jak/STAT pathway in PDGF-BB-induced cPLA2 expression, we tested the effect of a dominant-negative STAT-3 mutant, FS3DM (38Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2147-2156Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 C, forced expression of FS3DM blocked PDGF-BB-induced expression of cPLA2. Next, we examined whether the inhibition of cPLA2 expression by AG490 and the dominant-negative STAT-3 mutant leads to decreased AA release. VSMC that were prelabeled with [3H]AA and quiesced were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of AG490 and/or forced expression of the dominant-negative STAT-3 mutant for 1 h, and [3H]AA release was measured. Both AG490 and the dominant-negative STAT-3 mutant substantially reduced PDGF-BB-induced [3H]AA release (Fig.7 A). To investigate whether the Jak/STAT-dependent induction of expression of cPLA2 and AA release are required for PDGF-BB-induced VSMC growth, the effects of AG490 and the dominant-negative STAT-3 mutant on PDGF-BB-stimulated DNA synthesis were studied. As shown in Fig.7 B, PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis was significantly reduced by both AG490 and FS3DM. To validate the effects of FS3DM on PDGF-BB-induced cPLA2 expression and DNA synthesis, its effect on endogenous STAT-3 DNA-binding activity was tested. Forced expression of FS3DM substantially reduced PDGF-BB-induced endogenous STAT-3·DNA complexes in VSMC (Fig. 7 C).Figure 5AG490 reduces PDGF-BB-induced STAT-3 DNA-binding activity and STAT-3-dependent reporter gene expression in VSMC.

A number of PLA2 enzymes, particularly group V secretory PLA2 and group IV cPLA2enzymes, are involved in agonist-induced AA release (31Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Google Scholar, 32Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Google Scholar, 47Kim Y.J. Kim K.P. Han S.K. Munoz N.M. Zhu X. Sano H. Leff A.R. Cho W. J.

Interestingly, cross-activation between secretory PLA2 and cPLA2 enzymes has been observed in acute and delayed production of eicosanoids in many cell types, including human neutrophils and murine macrophages and mast cells (30Fujishima H. Sanchez Mejia R.O. Bingham III, C.O. Lam B.K. Sapirstein A. Bonventre J.V. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4803-4807Google Scholar, 47Kim Y.J. Kim K.P. Han S.K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Google Scholar). Acute activation of cPLA2 in response to a number of agonists that are coupled to Ca2+ mobilization, particularly G protein-coupled receptor agonists, cytokines, and phorbol esters, is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and/or protein kinase C (49Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Siddiqi A.R. Bonventre J.V. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20146-20156Google Scholar, 50Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown for the first time that PDGF-BB stimulated sustained cPLA2 activity via induction of its expression. Furthermore, the sustained expression and activity of cPLA2 appeared to be mediated by and involved in Jak/STAT-dependent PDGF-BB-induced growth in VSMC. This conclusion is supported by the findings that AG490, a selective inhibitor of Jak-2, and a dominant-negative mutant of STAT-3 substantially reduced the expression and activity of cPLA2and DNA synthesis induced by PDGF-BB. Studies from other laboratories also indicate that cPLA2 plays a role in serum-induced growth in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (40Anderson K.M. Roshak A. Winkler J.D. McCord M. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30504-30511Google Scholar). A potential role for the Jak/STAT pathway in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and survival activities in many cell types, including hematopoietic cells, has been demonstrated (35Fukuda T. Ohtani T. Yoshida Y. Shirogane T. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6670-6677Google Scholar, 36Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.H. J. Biol.

Based on these findings and the present observations, it is likely that cPLA2 is one of the effector molecules that are involved in Jak/STAT signaling leading to induction of growth in VSMC by PDGF-BB. Some STAT transcription factors such as STAT-1 have also been reported to be involved in the induction of expression of cell cycle inhibitory molecules such as p21waf1/cip1 and pro-apoptotic enzymes such as caspase-1 and thereby in apoptosis (52Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Google Scholar, 53Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Google Scholar). In this regard, it is noteworthy that cPLA2-dependent AA release mediates oxidant-induced apoptosis in some cell types (54Panini S.R. Yang L. Rusinol A.E. Sinensky M.S. Bonventre J.V. Leslie C.C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1678-1686Google Scholar). In view of these findings, it can be speculated that cPLA2 is distal in the path of Jak/STAT signaling to cell proliferation and/or apoptosis. Future studies are required to test whether the responsiveness of cPLA2 to various agonists of cell growth and apoptosis is dependent on activation of different members of the STAT transcription factor family. In summary, we have reported for the first time that the receptor tyrosine kinase agonist PDGF-BB induces the expression of cPLA2 in a manner that is dependent on activation of the Jak/STAT pathway. In addition, we have shown that Jak/STAT-dependent induction of expression of cPLA2 and AA release are involved in PDGF-BB-induced growth in VSMC. We are thankful to Drs. Ralph A. Bradshaw and Howard Young for providing the pFS3DM and pSIE-CAT plasmids, respectively.

The LBD has a predominantly α-helical structure with an activation function-2 (AF-2) domain in the COOH-terminal helix (H12). The LBD is the main site of VDR interaction with its heterodimer partner retinoid X receptor (RXR) and basal transcription factors, and the AF-2 domain in combination with the hydrophobic cleft forms an interaction surface for transcriptional corepressors and coactivators (1Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 325-349Google Scholar, 2Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Google Scholar). In the absence of its ligand 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), VDR transcriptional activity is low due to interaction with corepressors such as N-CoR and SMRT and potentially through sequestration of the basal transcription factor TFIIB. Addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 causes dissociation of VDR-corepressor and VDR-TFIIB complexes, thereby relieving repression (3Dwivedi P.P. Muscat G.E. Bailey P.J. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 327-335Google Scholar, 4Tagami T. Lutz W.H. Kumar R. Jameson J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 358-363Google Scholar, 5Masuyama H. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 218-228Google Scholar). VDR ligand-dependent activation is facilitated by recruitment of at least one coactivator protein with intrinsic histone acetyl transferase activity, such as p160 coactivators. Recruitment of multiprotein cointegrator complexes including CBP/p300, p/CAF, and DRIP provide further regulation, coordinating interactions of the receptor with other proteins including basal transcription factors, RNA polymerase II, and the p160 coactivators (6Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref Google Scholar). The novel coregulator Ski-interacting protein (SKIP)/NCoA-62, which is structurally distinct from the p160 coactivators, was isolated through its interactions with both the Ski oncoprotein and VDR (7Baudino T.A.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1579-1586Google Scholar). It also interacts with other nuclear proteins including the repressor CBF-1 and the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein, can bind coregulators such as SMRT, Sin3A, HDAC2, and SRC-1, and interacts with Smad proteins to augment transforming growth factor-β-dependent transactivation (7Baudino T.A.

Figueroa J. Flanagan J.L. Hayman M.J. Eisman J.A. Kouzmenko A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18243-18248Google Scholar). SKIP/NCoA-62 functions in cell fate determination, alternatively facilitating gene repression by tethering CBF-1 to the corepressor SMRT and gene activation by tethering CBF-1 to the activator NotchIC (10Zhou S.F. Fujimuro M. Hsieh J.J.D. Chen L. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2400-2410Google Scholar). Such mutually exclusive interactions with coactivators and corepressors suggest that SKIP/NCoA-62 may facilitate coregulator switching. SKIP/NCoA-62 augments transactivation by the vitamin D, retinoic acid, estrogen, and glucocorticoid receptors (7Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. Macdonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Google Scholar), selectively binding the VDR:RXR heterodimer in a ligand-enhanced manner (13Zhang C. Baudino T.A. Dowd D.R. Tokumaru H. Wang W. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40614-40620Google Scholar). SKIP/NCoA-62 forms a ternary complex and acts synergistically with the p160 coactivator GRIP1 to augment VDR transactivation (13Zhang C. Baudino T.A. Dowd D.R. Tokumaru H. Wang W. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40614-40620Google Scholar). Consistent with such complex formation, p160 coactivators contact VDR through the AF-2 domain, whereas SKIP/NCoA-62 interactions with VDR are AF-2-independent. SKIP/NCoA-62 reportedly contacts helix H1 of the VDR LBD (residues 116–164 of human VDR) and the helix H10/H11 region (residues 373–403) but not helix H12 (7Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. Macdonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown, however, that SKIP/NCoA-62 could bind to the VDR:RXR heterodimer, leading to the conclusion that the heterodimerization interface (including helix H10/H11) could be excluded as a SKIP/NCoA-62 interaction surface (13Zhang C. Baudino T.A. Dowd D.R. Tokumaru H. Wang W. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40614-40620Google Scholar). In the present study, we further investigated structural aspects of VDR-SKIP/NCoA-62 interaction to determine how structure may mediate SKIP/NCoA-62 function. An interaction site was mapped to helix H10 of mouse VDR by mutational analysis. Alteration of structurally exposed amino acids of this helix markedly reduced 1,25(OH)2D3-independent interactions with SKIP/NCoA-62 but not ligand-dependent interactions with the p160 coactivators GRIP1 and RAC3. These same VDR residues were required for interaction with RXR regardless of ligand status and for ligand-independent interaction with TFIIB. The results indicate that a transcriptional coactivator, a basal transcription factor, and the VDR heterodimerization partner each interact with VDR at the same helix H10 interface, with varying ligand sensitivities. As SKIP/NCoA-62 interacts with both unliganded and liganded VDR, the data also suggest that it may modulate the ligand-regulated occupancy of this VDR surface by TFIIB and RXR. Mouse VDR (mVDR) was amplified from full-length cDNA (T. Kawada, Kyoto University) using wild type or mutant primers containing stop codons (for truncation mutants Δ397, Δ389, and Δ380) or point mutations and cloned into pSG5 (Stratagene) and pAS2–1 (Clontech). Mutant Δ389 was further mutated to create Δ389Q380E, Δ389D384K, Δ389R386E, and Δ389AX3, the last being a triple point mutant with coordinate Q380A, D384A, and R386A changes. Full-length wild type cDNA was similarly mutated to produce mutant AX3. Constructs pACTIISKIP (amino acids 145–536) (12Leong G.M. Subramaniam N. Figueroa J. Flanagan J.L. Hayman M.J. Eisman J.A.

Sutherland R.L. Eisman J.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1606-1615Google Scholar) have been described. A model of the mouse VDR LBD was built using the 1.8-Å resolution crystal structure of the liganded human VDR LBD as a template (Protein Data Bank accession code 1DB1; Ref. 2Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Google Scholar). Initial CLUSTALW (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar) alignments were performed using the LBD sequences of hRARα, -β, and -γ; hRXRα, -β, and -γ; hTRα and -β; hPPARα, -β, and -γ; and hVDR, rVDR, and mVDR, with subsequent analyses performed using hRARγ, hVDR, rVDR, and mVDR sequences. Modeling was performed using InsightII and Homology version 98 software (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The model of the LBD was built from residue 124 and required no insertions or deletions. Side chain rotamer positions were searched by retaining identical residues in their original positions, and automatically placing others based on their size and flexibility, placing large hydrophobic residues before small side chains. Species-related changes in the structure of mVDR due to the excised insertion domain or sequence differences, which are away from the ligand binding and interaction sites, are anticipated to be minor. pAS2–1mVDRWT or mutant constructs were transformed into SFY526 cells and tryptophan-selected. pACTIISKIP (amino acids 145–536), pACTIITFIIB, pACTIIβ-RXRα GAD424-GRIP1, and pGAD10-RAC3 were individually transformed into Y187 cells and leucine-selected. Haploid SFY526 and Y187 strains were mated and diploid strains selected with tryptophan and leucine. Six independent colonies from each diploid strain were tested in ligand assays as described previously (14Leong G.M. Wang K.S. Marton M.J. Blanco J.C. Wang I.M. Rolfes R.J. Ozato K. Segars J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2296-2305Google Scholar). Cell lysate protein content was determined (Bio-Rad), and β-galactosidase activity was assayed by chemiluminescence (Tropix). Lysates were prepared from diploid yeast strains (14Leong G.M. Wang K.S. Marton M.J. Blanco J.C. Wang I.M. Rolfes R.J. Ozato K. Segars J.H. J. Biol.

Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%), blotted, and probed with 9A7 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.) to detect VDR and anti-HA tag antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to detect HA-SKIP.

Bound proteins were eluted, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted with 9A7 antibody. pSG5WT and mutant VDR constructs, pSG5GRIP1 and pSG5RAC3, were transcribed and translatedin vitro using the TNTTM T7 quick coupled system (Promega). [35S]Methionine was incorporated into GRIP1 and RAC3 polypeptide products. Binding reactions were performed (21Mangelsdorf D.J. Pike J.W. Haussler M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 354-358Google Scholar) in the presence of 10−7m1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle. Complexes were immunoprecipitated with 9A7 antibody and anti-rat IgG-Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Bound complexes were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and dried gels were autoradiographed. COS-1 cells were transfected for 6 h using FuGENETM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 30 ng of pSG5WT or mutant, 450 ng of pGL3–24-hydroxylase-LUC reporter (3Dwivedi P.P. Muscat G.E. Bailey P.J. Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 20: 327-335Google Scholar), and 60 ng of pRSVβgal control plasmid. Cells were then treated with vehicle or 10−10, 10−8, or 10−6m1,25(OH)2D3 for 16 h, harvested, and assayed for luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase results. SKIP/NCoA-62 has been reported to interact with human VDR through residues 373–403 in the helix H10/H11 region, excluding the AF-2 domain (7Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. Macdonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Google Scholar). In the present study a series of truncation mutants in this region of the highly conserved mouse VDR were generated, deleting helices H12 (Δ397), H11, and H12 (Δ389) or part of H10 plus H11 and H12 (Δ380), the last mutation removing the highly conserved ninth heptad repeat (1Haussler M.R. Whitfield G.K. Haussler C.A. Hsieh J.C. Thompson P.D. Selznick S.H. Dominguez C.E. Jurutka P.W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 325-349Google Scholar) (Fig.1, A and B). Wild type VDR interacted with SKIP/NCoA-62 in the absence and presence of ligand in yeast two-hybrid assays, as did the Δ397 and Δ389 mutants (Fig. 2 A). The Δ380 mutant failed to interact with SKIP/NCoA-62, implicating mVDR residues 380–389 in this interaction.Figure 2SKIP/NCoA-62 interactions with VDR COOH-terminal mutants.

Electrophoresed products were probed for VDR protein levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A model of the mVDR LBD was built based on the highly homologous (89% identity) human VDR LBD (2Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Google Scholar). Residues 380–389 lie on helix H10 at the receptor surface (Fig. 1 C), forming part of an exposed ridge, with the polar or charged side chains of the conserved residues Gln-380, Asp-384, and Arg-386 particularly prominent midway along the helix. The guanidinium group of Arg-386 appears in a highly conserved bridge with Asp-337, stacked on Arg-338, making the aliphatic component of the side chain more prominent in the model structure. Based on the accessibility of the side chains to the exterior, flexibility in Gln-380, Asp-384, and Arg-386 is anticipated. To investigate their potential involvement in SKIP/NCoA-62 interaction, these three residues were individually mutated to retain similar bulk but altered charge in the context of Δ389 (Q380E, D384K, or R386E; Fig. 1 A). Each point mutation diminished VDR interaction with SKIP/NCoA-62 by 60–80% compared with wild type and Δ389 controls (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, coordinate mutation of these residues to alanine in the Δ389 context (Δ389AX3 mutant) decreased this interaction by 80%. Interaction of the full-length VDR AX3 mutant was limited to ∼25% of wild type in the absence of ligand, but approached wild type levels with 1,25(OH)2D3(Fig. 2 C). Wild type VDR interaction with GST-SKIP in vitro was also comparable both with and without ligand (Fig.2 D). Mutant AX3 bound less strongly, although without the ligand-induced increase in SKIP/NCoA-62 interaction seen in yeast. In contrast to SKIP/NCoA-62, interactions of the p160 coactivators GRIP1 and RAC3 with wild type and AX3 mutant VDR were entirely ligand-dependent (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, p160 coactivator interactions with AX3 were elevated by ∼50%, suggesting that residues Gln-380, Asp-384, and Arg-386 may negatively affect access of p160 coactivators to the hydrophobic cleft on the LBD. Neither Δ389 nor Δ389AX3 interacted with GRIP1 or RAC3, consistent with the AF-2 deletion. In vitro interactions between the p160 coactivators and VDR mutants were consistent with the yeast data (Fig. 3 B). Thus, VDR helix H10 is important for interaction with SKIP/NCoA-62 but not p160 coactivators. Effects of these helix H10 mutations on VDR function were assessed by transient transfection. Transactivation by either wild type or AX3 mutant VDR was 1,25(OH)2D3dose-responsive, but AX3 activity was limited to about 40% of wild type at the highest dose tested, despite comparable VDR protein levels (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the integrity of helix H10 residues Gln-380, Asp-384, and Arg-386 is necessary for efficient VDR transactivation. In addition to SKIP/NCoA-62, TFIIB and RXR also interact with this region of VDR (5Masuyama H. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 218-228Google Scholar,22Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1507-1517Google Scholar, 23Nakajima S. Hsieh J.C. MacDonald P.N. Galligan M.A. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 159-172Google Scholar, 24Nishikawa J. Kitaura M. Imagawa M. Nishihara T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 606-611Google Scholar), so their interactions with the helix H10 mutants were investigated. Two-hybrid interaction of wild type VDR with TFIIB was inhibited by 30% upon addition of 1,25(OH)2D3(Fig. 4 A), consistent with a previous report that VDR-TFIIB contact is inhibited by ligand (5Masuyama H. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 218-228Google Scholar). Interaction of AX3 with TFIIB in the absence of ligand was ∼25% of wild type, but reinstated to wild type level with 1,25(OH)2D3. Interaction of Δ389 with TFIIB was independent of ligand and at least as strong as wild type. In contrast, interaction of Δ389AX3 with TFIIB was notably diminished, with and without ligand. Binding of wild type VDR with GST-TFIIBin vitro was also inhibited by ligand (Fig. 4 B). AX3-TFIIB interaction was weaker than wildtype, but with no ligand-induced increase as in yeast. Unliganded wild type VDR interacted with RXR and was augmented ∼3-fold by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, unliganded AX3 did not interact with RXR, and 1,25(OH)2D3 induced interaction to only 30% of wild type level. Mutant Δ389-RXR interaction was comparable with wild type VDR without ligand and was unaffected by ligand treatment, as Δ389 does not bind 1,25(OH)2D3(data not shown). Coordinate alanine mutation completely abrogated Δ389AX3 interactions with RXR. In vitro binding data of VDR with RXR correlated with yeast results, as binding of wild type and AX3 to GST-RXR increased with ligand, with AX3 binding lower than wild type (Fig. 4 B). Together these data indicate that mVDR helix H10 residues 380, 384, and 386 are important for interactions with TFIIB and RXR as well as SKIP/NCoA-62. Ligand effects on these interactions of wild type VDR differed, as VDR-SKIP/NCoA-62 interactions were ligand-independent, whereas VDR-TFIIB interactions were inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D3 and those for VDR:RXR were augmented. SKIP/NCoA-62 is unique among nuclear receptor coregulators in that its interactions with VDR appear to be independent of the hydrophobic cleft/AF-2 domain interface, relying instead on an undefined LBD site. In this study we defined the structural nature of this interaction interface and highlighted its importance in VDR function and protein interactions. COOH-terminal mutagenesis of mVDR identified three helix H10 residues, Gln-380, Asp-384, and Arg-386, required for full interaction with SKIP/NCoA-62, but not with p160 coactivators. Distinct differences in ligand-responsive interactions between helix H10 mutants and SKIP/NCoA-62, TFIIB, or RXR were observed. Helix H10 mutation also attenuated VDR transactivation function, presumably as a result of disrupted interactions not only with TFIIB and RXR, but also with SKIP/NCoA-62. Wild type VDR interacted with SKIP/NCoA-62 in both the absence and presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, whereas its interaction with TFIIB was partially inhibited and with RXR was augmented by 1,25(OH)2D3, consistent with earlier reports (5Masuyama H. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 218-228Google Scholar, 7Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. Macdonald P.N. J. Biol.

Mutagenesis of mVDR H10 residues Gln-380, Asp-384, and Arg-386 markedly reduced ligand-independent interactions with SKIP/NCoA-62 and TFIIB and completely abrogated RXR interaction. Ligand treatment restored interactions with TFIIB fully, and with SKIP/NCoA-62 and RXR partially. Thus, in the absence of ligand the bulky side chains of these helix H10 residues appear to present a prominent interaction site, as their removal in AX3 attenuated protein-protein interactions. The reinstatement of interactions upon ligand treatment may result from a conformational change that brings additional interacting regions into play. This proposal is consistent with a requirement for hVDR helix H1 residues 116–165 for SKIP/NCoA-62 interaction (7Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. Macdonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Google Scholar), and for sites in the DNA binding and ligand binding domains of VDR for TFIIB and RXR interactions (22Masuyama H. Brownfield C.M. St-Arnaud R.

Interaction of SKIP/NCoA-62 with the VDR helix H10 interface would be compatible with concurrent binding of GRIP-1 to the AF-2-dependent hydrophobic cleft and thus consistent with ternary complex formation in the presence of ligand (13Zhang C. Baudino T.A. Dowd D.R. Tokumaru H. Wang W. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40614-40620Google Scholar). SKIP/NCoA-62 interaction with helix H10 of unliganded VDR would also be compatible with formation of a repressive ternary complex in the absence of ligand, as SKIP/NCoA-62 and unliganded VDR both interact with NCoR and SMRT (3Dwivedi P.P.

Furthermore, by analogy with its tethering function in the alternate recruitment of corepressors and coactivators in Notch pathway regulation (10Zhou S.F. Fujimuro M. Hsieh J.J.D. Chen L. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2400-2410Google Scholar), SKIP/NCoA-62 may perform a similar function in VDR signaling, i.e. coordinating interactions with unliganded VDR to mediate transcriptional repression and with liganded receptor to mediate a switch to transcriptional activation. This proposal is supported by the finding that SKIP/NCoA-62 can augment or repress VDR transactivation in a cell-specific manner (27Leong G.M. Eisman J.A. Hayman M.J. Gardiner E.M. Bone. 1998; 23: S256Google Scholar). Modulation of VDR protein interactions by SKIP/NCoA-62 may also help regulate its interactions with TFIIB and RXR. It has been proposed that ligand-induced disruption of VDR-TFIIB interactions releases TFIIB for incorporation into the transcription complex (5Masuyama H. Jefcoat Jr., S.C. MacDonald P.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 218-228Google Scholar). SKIP/NCoA-62 may regulate this transition through dynamic helix H10 interactions, as it can interact directly with TFIIB (data not shown) in addition to both unliganded and liganded VDR. Similarly, SKIP/NCoA-62 may facilitate RXR interaction with VDR when ligand is present, consistent with formation of a ternary complex between SKIP/NCoA-62 and the liganded VDR:RXR heterodimer (13Zhang C. Baudino T.A. Dowd D.R. Tokumaru H. Wang W. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40614-40620Google Scholar). Such a modulator role for SKIP/NCoA-62 may also be important for nuclear receptors other than VDR. Residues Gln-380, Asp-384, and Arg-386 are in the ninth heptad repeat region, which is highly conserved among the nuclear receptors. Consistent with this conservation, TFIIB interacts with RXRβ and TRβ (14Leong G.M. Wang K.S. Marton M.J. Blanco J.C. Wang I.M. Rolfes R.J. Ozato K. Segars J.H. J. Biol.

By extension, therefore, SKIP/NCoA-62 may also interact with nuclear receptors other than VDR via the helix H10 interface. In summary we have found that the coregulator SKIP/NCoA-62 interacts with VDR via a helix H10 interface that is functionally and physically distinct from the region bound by the AF-2-dependent p160 coactivators. This previously unidentified coactivator interaction surface is required for full VDR transactivation activity and comprises conserved residues from helix H10 that are also involved in TFIIB interaction and heterodimerization with RXR. Moreover, the interactions of SKIP/NCoA-62, TFIIB, and RXR with the VDR helix H10 interface are dynamic, with varying responses to ligand. This study elucidates the structural basis of VDR-SKIP/NCoA-62 interactions and suggests that SKIP/NCoA-62 may regulate the exchange between TFIIB and RXR at the VDR helix H10 interface. Furthermore, it highlights the novel role of SKIP/NCoA-62 in VDR transcriptional regulation, a role that may also extend to other nuclear receptors."

After almost a decade of very slow rates of deformation, Mauna Loa in Hawaii, the largest volcano on Earth, began inflating in May 2002; at the same time, a high-volume effusive episode began at its neighbour Kilauea. We have found a correlation between these events at a very short timescale, detected by continuous deformation monitoring. This remarkable observation suggests that there is a crustal-level interaction between the magma systems of Mauna Loa and Kilauea, reviving a century-old controversy over the relationship between these two volcanoes on the basis of differences in their lava chemistry and in their patterns of eruptive behaviour1,2,3,4,5."

Here we studied the effect of human chymase on (i) phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP)-mediated phospholipid (PL) transfer activity, and (ii) the ability of PLTP to generate pre-β-high density lipoprotein (HDL). Immunoblot analysis of PLTP after incubation with chymase for 6 h revealed, in addition to the original 80-kDa band, four specific proteolytic fragments of PLTP with approximate molecular masses of 70, 52, 48, and 31 kDa. This specific pattern of PLTP degradation remained stable for at least 24 h of incubation with chymase. Such proteolyzed PLTP had reduced ability (i) to transfer PL from liposome donor particles to acceptor HDL3 particles, and (ii) to facilitate the formation of pre-β-HDL. However, when PLTP was incubated with chymase in the presence of HDL3, only one major cleavage product of PLTP (48 kDa) was generated, and PL transfer activity was almost fully preserved. Moreover, chymase effectively depleted the pre-β-HDL particles generated from HDL3 by PLTP and significantly inhibited the high affinity component of cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells. These results suggest that the mast cells in human atherosclerotic lesions, by secreting chymase, may prevent PLTP-dependent formation of pre-β-HDL particles from HDL3 and so impair the anti-atherogenic function of PLTP.

This process is of special importance for macrophages, which, having no ability to regulate incoming cholesterol, are readily transformed into cholesterol-loaded foam cells. Several factors, such as apolipoproteins, lipolytic enzymes, lipid transfer proteins, and lipoprotein receptors, are involved in reverse cholesterol transport (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, efflux of cellular cholesterol is promoted by extracellular cholesterol acceptors. The primary and most efficient acceptors of cholesterol seem to be small discoidal lipid-poor pre-β-migrating high density lipoproteins (pre-β-HDL)1 (2Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). These particles interact with the cell membrane through a microsolubilization process that leads to uptake first of phospholipids and then of cholesterol from the membrane (3Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This process appears to be controlled by the ATP-binding cassette transporter protein 1 on the macrophage cell membrane (4Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G.

Olkkonen V. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 269-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PLTP-mediated remodeling of HDL can occur via two major pathways. (i) PLTP facilitates the transfer of excess surface phospholipids from post-lipolytic chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins to the HDL fraction, demonstrating the importance of this process for the maintenance of HDL levels (9Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). (ii) Human plasma PLTP in vitro converts small HDL3 particles into larger particles, with concomitant release of poorly lipidated apoA-I, which displays pre-β-mobility in agarose electrophoresis (10Jauhiainen M.

Moreover, in vivo, in both transiently expressed and transgenic mouse models of PLTP, an increased capacity of the plasma of mice overexpressing human PLTP to produce pre-β-HDL has been demonstrated (11Van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Thus, by influencing HDL size and composition, PLTP plays an important role in HDL metabolism and modulates its anti-atherogenic potential.Proteolytic enzymes, such as the mast cell-derived neutral protease chymase, have been shown to modify the composition and function of HDL particles profoundly. Mast cell chymase efficiently degrades apoA-I in isolated HDL3 fractions by specifically depleting the minor pre-β-migrating HDL particles, thus impairing the first step of reverse cholesterol transport in vitro (14Lee M. von Eckardstein A. Lindstedt L. Assmann G. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Chymase is a chymotrypsin-like protease with broad cleavage specificity; thus, not only apoA-I (15Lindstedt L. Lee M. Castro G.R. Fruchart J.-C. Kovanen P.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) but also other apolipoproteins (16Kokkonen J.O. Vartiainen M. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16067-16072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lee M. Calabresi L. Chiesa G. Franceschini G. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) constitute substrates for this enzyme. In this paper, we investigated whether chymase can degrade PLTP and whether such proteolysis would impede its key function in reverse cholesterol transport, i.e. generation of pre-β-HDL particles and their participation in the process of cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded macrophages.DISCUSSIONHere we describe how a human neutral protease, mast cell chymase, degrades and partially inactivates PLTP and how HDL3modulates this process. Moreover, high affinity efflux of cholesterol from the cholesterol-loaded macrophages, as mediated by PLTP-derived pre-β-HDL, was abolished by chymase treatment.Degradation of PLTP by chymase was a rapid process, and the first cleavage was demonstrated within 10 min of incubation. Interestingly, upon prolonged incubation, a pattern was observed reflecting that, despite the broad cleavage specificity of chymase, only four main, relatively stable PLTP fragments were produced. Such limited protease susceptibility suggests the presence of a restricted number of exposed amino acid sequences leading to specific chymase-accessible domains in PLTP.Two forms of PLTP have been fractionated from native human plasma by size exclusion chromatography (26Oka T. Kujiraoka T. Mayumi I. Egashira T. Takahashi S. Nanjee M.N. Miller N.E. Metso J. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Jauhiainen M. Hattori H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1651-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these fractions corresponds to an inactive form of PLTP that elutes between HDL and LDL, and most important, the other fraction containing active PLTP elutes in the position of HDL (27Kärkkäinen M.

Groener J.E.M. van Ramhorst E. van Tol A. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 90: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recent data based on PLTP molecular modeling and mutations at the N- and C-terminal regions of PLTP suggest that PLTP may have more than one HDL-binding site (29Huuskonen J. Wohlfahrt G. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Teleman O. Olkkonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1123-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Desrumaux C. Labeur C. Verhee A. Tavernier J.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, all the suggested docking sites of PLTP on HDL3 involve peptide bonds that are potential cleavage sites for chymase,i.e. they contain aromatic or branched-chain aliphatic amino acids (32Caughey G.H. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 66-70Google Scholar). When HDL3 was added to the incubation mixture containing PLTP and chymase, only one major degradation product of PLTP (of about 48 kDa) was observed, a finding compatible with the view that docking of PLTP onto HDL3 did alter the chymase-accessible sequences on PLTP. Interestingly, digestion of PLTP by chymase in the presence of HDL3 did not impair the phospholipid transfer function of PLTP. Notably, each of the HDL3 preparations used in this study also contained, in addition to intact PLTP (80 kDa), a PLTP degradation fragment of 48 kDa, i.e. similar in size to the major PLTP fragment produced by chymase in the presence of HDL3. Interestingly, the active form of PLTP purified from fresh human plasma has been resolved into two bands by PAGE, one corresponding to the 80-kDa band of intact PLTP and the other to a PLTP proteolytic fragment of 51 kDa with the N-terminal region located between amino acids 163 and 184 of the PLTP molecule (33Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbers T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Provided the Phe161 in the PLTP molecule is susceptible to cleavage by chymase, chymase-induced formation of a PLTP degradation fragment of this size could take place. Indeed, we cannot exclude the possibility that such a fragment would be included in the broad 48-kDa band generated by chymase. Identification of the hydrolytic sites on PLTP that are susceptible to chymase cleavage is currently under investigation in our laboratory.The mechanism underlying functional protection by a high concentration of HDL3 (5 mg/ml) of PLTP against chymase is of interest. This effect was also observed when HDL3 was present at a lower concentration (0.4 mg/ml; see Fig. 2), i.e. close to the physiological concentration range of HDL in the intimal fluid (34Smith E.B. Eur. Heart J. 1990; 11: 72-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, LDL, when added at a concentration similar to that present in the arterial intima (34Smith E.B. Eur. Heart J. 1990; 11: 72-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not protect PLTP against chymase. The fact that the active fraction of PLTP, when isolated from plasma by size exclusion chromatography, eluted in a position corresponding to that of large sized HDL particles (27Kärkkäinen M. Oka T. Olkkonen V.M. Metso J. Hattori H. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15413-15418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) has suggested that PLTP is in a fully active conformation when associated with HDL. The present overall results, in addition, allow the speculation that binding of PLTP to HDL3 prevents inactivation of PLTP by proteolytic cleavage, at least with chymase. It will be important to study whether such protection applies to other naturally occurring proteases as well.The finding that by treating HDL3 with chymase, the spontaneous, but not the PLTP-dependent, generation of pre-β-HDL from spherical HDL3 particles was abolished suggests that chymase depleted the most readily dissociating apoA-I molecules. The fact that pretreatment of HDL3 with chymase was, nevertheless, unable to abolish the generation of pre-β-HDL promoted by PLTP is compatible with the view that the bulk of the apoA-I remaining on the surface of α-HDL particles was available for active generation of pre-β-HDL during HDL remodeling. Our results indicate that proteolysis of HDL3 by chymase, which produces limited degradation of apoA-I, does not impair its interaction with plasma proteins, such as lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (35Lee M. Uboldi P. Giudice D. Catapano A.L. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 975-984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PLTP (this study) which are involved in HDL remodeling.High affinity efflux of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells has been defined as the component of the efflux of cellular cholesterol which operates in the low concentration range of a cholesterol acceptor (15Lindstedt L. Lee M. Castro G.R. Fruchart J.-C. Kovanen P.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This component of the efflux process has been demonstrated to be highly susceptible to protease treatment that specifically depletes various lipid-free or lipid-poor apolipoproteins from different kinds of cholesterol acceptors (14Lee M. von Eckardstein A. Lindstedt L. Assmann G. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Lindstedt L. Lee M. Castro G.R. Fruchart J.-C. Kovanen P.T. J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1475-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, it likely reflects the apolipoprotein-mediated pathway of cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells (36Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These observations provide further support for the notion that pre-β-HDLs have a crucial function as the primary acceptors of cellular cholesterol (2Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 37Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The present data demonstrate for the first time that pre-β-HDL particles generated by PLTP are responsible for the increased efflux of cholesterol from cultured macrophages and that this process is fully blocked by proteolysis of the formed pre-β-HDL by chymase, therefore suggesting that PLTP functions as an anti-atherogenic factor and contributes to the removal of accumulated cholesterol from lesion macrophages. Previous studies (11Van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Because plasma PLTP activity is significantly correlated with the ability of plasma to generate pre-β-HDL (11Van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P.

Lab. Invest. 2001; 61: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the present observation, made with cholesterol-loaded macrophages, is potentially of physiological relevance. Interestingly, it has also been reported that the ability of mildly trypsinized HDL to remove cholesterol from cultured fibroblasts is restored by PLTP (40Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Oram J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The anti-atherogenicity of PLTP was also reported recently by van Haperen et al. (11Van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) in mice overexpressing PLTP. Despite a lower HDL level in plasma of these mice, the elevated PLTP was more effective in preventing in vitroaccumulation of cholesterol in macrophages via increased formation of pre-β-HDL. Also in mice with adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PLTP, increased levels of pre-β-HDL were observed (12Föger B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Shamburek R.D. Parrot C.L. Talley G.D. Brewer B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27393-27400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Jaari S. van Dijk K.W. Olkkonen V.M. van der Zee A. Metso J. Hevekes L. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2001; 128: 781-792Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, PLTP deficiency in hyperlipidemic mice models has resulted in decreased atherosclerosis that was explained via the effects on VLDL secretion (41Jiang X.C. Qin S. Qiao C. Kawano K. Lin M. Skold A. Xiao X. Tall A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and strong overexpression of PLTP in mice heterozygous for the LDL receptor has been shown to increase the susceptibility to atherosclerosis (42Van Haperen R. van Tol A. van Gent T. Scheek L. Visser P. van der Kamp A. Grosveld F. de Crom R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48938-48943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, both the overexpression and gene knockout models are quite extreme conditions, and therefore, depending on the metabolic status, PLTP may display anti- or proatherogenic properties. Further studies are definitely needed to unravel the detailed mechanisms on the association of PLTP with atherosclerosis.In summary, the present results enable us to frame the following hypothesis. A fraction of the active PLTP in association with a subclass of HDL from the plasma compartment enters the arterial intima, where degranulated chymase-containing mast cells are present (43Kaartinen M. Penttilä A. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 966-972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the intimal fluid, the HDL-associated PLTP may maintain its activity despite the presence of chymase, so producing pre-β-HDL particles. However, in intimal areas with chymase-secreting mast cells, chymase-dependent depletion of the PLTP-generated pre-β-HDL particles could occur, thus causing an impairment of cholesterol efflux from macrophages via this local anti-atherogenic function of PLTP. Reverse cholesterol transport is a physiologically important route for removal of excess cholesterol from the membranes of peripheral cells and its transport to the liver for secretion into the bile. This process is of special importance for macrophages, which, having no ability to regulate incoming cholesterol, are readily transformed into cholesterol-loaded foam cells. Several factors, such as apolipoproteins, lipolytic enzymes, lipid transfer proteins, and lipoprotein receptors, are involved in reverse cholesterol transport (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, efflux of cellular cholesterol is promoted by extracellular cholesterol acceptors. The primary and most efficient acceptors of cholesterol seem to be small discoidal lipid-poor pre-β-migrating high density lipoproteins (pre-β-HDL)1 (2Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). These particles interact with the cell membrane through a microsolubilization process that leads to uptake first of phospholipids and then of cholesterol from the membrane (3Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This process appears to be controlled by the ATP-binding cassette transporter protein 1 on the macrophage cell membrane (4Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R25-R31Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), its transcription being regulated in part by the orphan nuclear receptor LXR. Activation of LXR in macrophages increases not only ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 but also the expression of genes encoding ABCG1 and apoE (5Venkateswaran A. Repa J.J.

Zhang Y. Bensch W.R. Kauffman R.F. Gao H. Ryan T.P. Liang Y. Eacho P.I. Jiang X.-C. J. Biol.

PLTP contributes to the remodeling of HDL by promoting net transfer and exchange of phospholipids among HDL subclasses and other lipoproteins (8Huuskonen J. Olkkonen V. Jauhiainen M. Ehnholm C. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 269-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PLTP-mediated remodeling of HDL can occur via two major pathways. (i) PLTP facilitates the transfer of excess surface phospholipids from post-lipolytic chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins to the HDL fraction, demonstrating the importance of this process for the maintenance of HDL levels (9Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). (ii) Human plasma PLTP in vitro converts small HDL3 particles into larger particles, with concomitant release of poorly lipidated apoA-I, which displays pre-β-mobility in agarose electrophoresis (10Jauhiainen M.

Moreover, in vivo, in both transiently expressed and transgenic mouse models of PLTP, an increased capacity of the plasma of mice overexpressing human PLTP to produce pre-β-HDL has been demonstrated (11Van Haperen R. van Tol A. Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Thus, by influencing HDL size and composition, PLTP plays an important role in HDL metabolism and modulates its anti-atherogenic potential. Proteolytic enzymes, such as the mast cell-derived neutral protease chymase, have been shown to modify the composition and function of HDL particles profoundly. Mast cell chymase efficiently degrades apoA-I in isolated HDL3 fractions by specifically depleting the minor pre-β-migrating HDL particles, thus impairing the first step of reverse cholesterol transport in vitro (14Lee M. von Eckardstein A. Lindstedt L. Assmann G. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Chymase is a chymotrypsin-like protease with broad cleavage specificity; thus, not only apoA-I (15Lindstedt L. Lee M. Castro G.R. Fruchart J.-C. Kovanen P.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) but also other apolipoproteins (16Kokkonen J.O. Vartiainen M. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol.

Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) constitute substrates for this enzyme. In this paper, we investigated whether chymase can degrade PLTP and whether such proteolysis would impede its key function in reverse cholesterol transport, i.e. generation of pre-β-HDL particles and their participation in the process of cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded macrophages. DISCUSSIONHere we describe how a human neutral protease, mast cell chymase, degrades and partially inactivates PLTP and how HDL3modulates this process. Moreover, high affinity efflux of cholesterol from the cholesterol-loaded macrophages, as mediated by PLTP-derived pre-β-HDL, was abolished by chymase treatment.Degradation of PLTP by chymase was a rapid process, and the first cleavage was demonstrated within 10 min of incubation. Interestingly, upon prolonged incubation, a pattern was observed reflecting that, despite the broad cleavage specificity of chymase, only four main, relatively stable PLTP fragments were produced. Such limited protease susceptibility suggests the presence of a restricted number of exposed amino acid sequences leading to specific chymase-accessible domains in PLTP.Two forms of PLTP have been fractionated from native human"

The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene is a case in point. Transcription of this gene is induced by glucagon (acting by the second messenger, cAMP), glucocorticoids, and retinoic acid, and it is dominantly repressed by insulin. These hormonal responses require the presence of different hormone response units (HRUs), which consist of constellations of DNA elements and associated transcription factors. These include the glucocorticoid response unit (GRU), cAMP response unit (CRU), retinoic acid response unit (RARU), and the insulin response unit. HRUs are known to have functional overlap. In particular, the cAMP response element of the CRU is also a component of the GRU. The purpose of this study was to determine whether known GRU or RARU elements or transcription factors function as components of the CRU. We show here that the glucocorticoid accessory factor binding site 1 and glucocorticoid accessory factor binding site 3 elements, which are components of both the GRU and RARU, are an important part of the CRU. Furthermore, we find that the transcription factor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor, and two coactivators, cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein and steroid receptor coactivator-1, participate in both the cAMP and glucocorticoid responses.

The hormonal regulation of PEPCK gene expression is mediated by the actions of a diverse array of transcription factors that bind to several DNA elements in the PEPCK gene promoter. The complex of factors and DNA elements required for a given hormone response is known as a hormone response unit (HRU) (5Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev.

This GRU consists of elements located between −467 and −300, including two tandem glucocorticoid receptor binding elements and several flanking accessory factor elements that are essential for a full response. These elements include gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3, which bind HNF-4/COUP-TF, HNF-3β, and COUP-TF, respectively (6Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

The PEPCK promoter also contains a retinoic acid response unit (RARU) that consists of two retinoic acid response elements (RARE1 and RARE2) that bind retinoic acid receptor heterodimers. RARE coincides with gAF1 of the GRU, whereas RARE2 coincides with gAF3 (12Hall R.K. Scott D.K. Noisin E.L. Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell.

Induction of PEPCK gene transcription by glucagon (cAMP) is mediated by a group of promoter elements and their respective transcription factors, known collectively as the cAMP response unit (CRU) (see Fig. 2 A). The PEPCK gene CRU consists of several known DNA elements located between positions −300 and −86 relative to the transcriptional start site, including the CRE and the P3 and P4 elements. P3(I) and P4(II) are essential for a full cAMP/PKA response (2Liu J.S. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

These elements are located between −300 and −200 and contain binding sites for the AP-1 and C/EBP family members. The CRE is located between −93 and −86 and binds to members of the CREB/cAMP response element modulator, C/EBP, and AP-1 families of transcription factors in vitro (11Yamada K. Duong D.T. Scott D.K.

The CRE has three functions: 1) it binds CREB as part of the basal promoter; 2) it is essential for the cAMP response, in which case CREB is phosphorylated on serine 133 by PKA; and 3) it is necessary for a full glucocorticoid response (2Liu J.S.

It is important that the action of these various hormones be integrated into a response that is appropriate for the particular physiologic situation. How such integration occurs at the molecular level has yet to be resolved, but the assembly of multiple HRUs in a single promoter may explain the phenomena of additivity, synergism, and dominant repression that are observed in the presence of different combinations of hormones. As the organization of the PEPCK promoter is further defined, it is also becoming apparent that many of the individual DNA elements are involved in multiple hormonal responses. As described above, both gAF1 and gAF3 from the GRU serve as RAREs in the RARU (12Hall R.K. Scott D.K. Noisin E.L. Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6260-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the gAF2 element, which is essential for the glucocorticoid response, is also part of the insulin response unit (20O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This study provides a more detailed understanding of the CRU and identifies elements common to the CRU, GRU, and RARU. We show here that a deletion of certain elements, specifically gAF1/RARE1 and gAF3/RARE2, greatly reduces the response of the PEPCK gene to cAMP. Furthermore, two coactivators, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and CREB-binding protein, are utilized by both the CRU and GRU to drive PEPCK gene transcription. PEPCK gene promoter truncations were constructed by PCR amplification of the appropriate regions of the PEPCK gene promoter in PEPCK/Luc. The primers used to amplify in the 5′ to 3′ direction were as follows: 1) the −467 primer 5′, CGGGGTACCCCGTGAATTCCCTTCTCATGACC 3′; 2) the −299 primer, 5′ CGGGGTACCCCGAGCCTATAGTTTGCATCAGC 3′; and 3) the −200 primer, 5′ CGGGGTACCCCGCAACATTCATTAACAACAGCAA 3′. The primers were paired with the reverse primer, 5′ TCCCCCCGGGGGGAACCTGGAGGCTCGCCTC 3′. The PCR amplification was carried out for 30 cycles. PCR products were digested with KpnI and BglII and inserted into pGL3b at the corresponding restriction sites. The −120 truncation of the PEPCK gene promoter was constructed by excising the PEPCK gene promoter from PEPCK/Luc with NcoI and inserting the resulting fragment into pGL3b at the corresponding restriction site. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to construct the −120, (GRU/RARU)/−200, AF3γm, and AF3Em plasmids. The sequence of all subcloned fragments was verified by DNA sequencing. The construct with G4DBD ligated to SRC-1 with residues 1179 and 1185 mutated to an alanine (referred to as G4SRC-1 Ala/Ala) was kindly provided by Dr. Bert O'Malley, Baylor College of Medicine. H4IIE hepatoma cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2.5% (v/v) newborn calf serum and 2.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cells were pelleted and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 2 ml of a calcium phosphate:DNA coprecipitate containing plasmid DNA. Cells were then plated in 10-cm2culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C. After 4 h, cells were treated with 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide in serum-containing medium for 5 min, washed with PBS, and incubated in serum-free media for 18 h. Cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and resuspended in 100 μl of luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized for the protein concentration in the cell lysate by using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Total RNA for both primer extension reactions was isolated with Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) using the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The PC28 and ACT25 oligonucleotides, which are complimentary to the mRNAs of the rat PEPCK and β-actin genes at positions 102–129 and 42–67, were used in primer extension assays, as described previously (21Sutherland C.

H4IIE cells (1 × 108 cells per condition) were washed with PBS and pre-incubated in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C for ≥48 h. Following hormone treatments, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C for 5 min. To arrest cross-linking, glycine was added directly to the media at a final concentration of 125 mm, and the cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were harvested with cell scraping buffer (1 ml per plate of ice-cold PBS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, pH 8, 0.4 mmNa2MoO4, 125 nm okadaic acid). Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × gfor 4 min at 4 °C, resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors), and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were transferred to pre-chilled Eppendorf tubes containing 25-μm-diameter glass beads (ratio of lysate to bead volume was 3:1), pre-washed with cell scraping buffer. To shear chromatin, the lysate/bead mixture was sonicated (VirSonic; 2.5-mm tip) on ice for 12 × 10-s pulses at a setting of 3 (output of 4–5 watts), yielding chromatin fragments of 100–600 bp in size. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove detritus, and the supernatant was divided into aliquots for subsequent 10-fold dilution in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). To provide a positive control for each condition, one undiluted aliquot was retained for further processing in parallel with all other samples at the reversal of cross-linking step. To reduce nonspecific background, each 1-ml chromatin sample was pre-cleared with 10 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), supplemented with 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene), for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, after which the beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Chromatin complexes were immunoprecipitated for 12–18 h at 4 °C while rotating with amounts (5–10 μg) of primary antibody optimized for selective immunoprecipitation of signal or without antibody to provide negative controls. Immune complexes were collected with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose + 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, while rotating for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed for 5 min at 4 °C with 1 ml of each of the following buffers in succession: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl), high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). Chromatin complexes were eluted from the beads in three consecutive 30-min rotating incubations with 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) at 22 °C. To reverse cross-linking and digest RNA present in the samples, NaCl (200 mm final concentration) and RNase mixture (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for ≥6 h. To digest proteins, samples were incubated at 45 °C for 90 min after the addition of the following at their final concentrations: 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 50 μg/ml proteinase K. Samples were extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). DNA was precipitated with 5 μg of glycogen azure (Sigma) and 2× volumes of 95% ethanol, and pellets were collected by microcentrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were resuspended in 100 μl of nuclease-free water (Promega) and stored at −80 °C for subsequent PCR analysis. CBP and SRC-1 are recruited to the PEPCK gene promoter in response to dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, as shown previously (22Duong D.T. Waltner-Law M.E. Sears R. Sealy L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 35: 32234-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 2D. T. Duong, unpublished data. cAMP typically causes a 2- to 3-fold induction of PEPCK mRNA levels in H4IIE cells, as confirmed in the experiment shown in Fig.1 A. We wanted to determine whether the same coactivators that associate with the PEPCK gene promoter after dexamethasone treatment also associate in response to cAMP. The ChIP assay was therefore used to directly identify proteins that interact with the PEPCK gene promoter in response to cAMP treatment of H4IIE cells in vivo (Fig. 1 B). We found that CBP interacts with the PEPCK promoter after cAMP treatment. This result was expected, because CBP action is regulated by cAMP signaling pathways (27Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 28Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). It was somewhat surprising to observe recruitment of SRC-1 to the PEPCK gene promoter in response to cAMP, however, because relatively few studies exist showing the involvement of this coactivator in cAMP action. SRC-1 is a coactivator with COUP-TF, which is an important mediator of the glucocorticoid response in the PEPCK gene, and CBP interacts with CREB on a variety of promoters. ChIP assays were therefore performed using a COUP-TF or CREB antibody. We found that COUP-TF is constitutively bound to the promoter, in agreement with previous electrophoretic gel shift mobility analysis of the PEPCK gene promoter (10Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CREB is also bound to the promoter under basal conditions, and binding was not increased when cells were treated with cAMP, as unchanging bands were detected under these conditions (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that CREB and COUP-TF are constitutively bound to the PEPCK gene promoter, whereas CBP and SRC-1 are recruited in response to cAMP treatment. The next set of experiments were performed to specifically locate the region of the PEPCK promoter targeted by COUP-TF, CREB, CBP, and SRC-1. The CRE is necessary for both cAMP- and glucocorticoid-mediated PEPCK gene expression, and CBP is likely to act through the proteins bound to this element. H4IIE rat hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with a construct that contains the region from −467 to +69 of the PEPCK gene promoter positioned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (referred to as PEPCK/Luc). This construct typically gives a 2- to 4-fold induction when cotransfected with the catalytic subunit of PKA in H4IIE cells (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 1and 3). For convenience, we refer to cAMP-mediated PEPCK gene expression in transient transfection assays as the PKA response, because this is the effector employed. The role of the CRE in PKA-stimulated PEPCK gene expression was examined next. Replacement of the CRE with a Gal4 DNA binding element (referred to as (C/G)-PEPCK/Luc) resulted in a 50% reduction of the PKA response (Fig.2 B, compare lanes 2 and 4). The same result was observed for the glucocorticoid response in earlier experiments, as either deletion of the CRE or its replacement with a Gal4 DNA binding element also reduces this response by 50% (6Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yamada K. Duong D.T. Scott D.K. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5880-5887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Others have shown that G4CREB (a chimeric construct in which the Gal4 DNA binding domain (G4DBD) is ligated to full-length CREB) is effective at restoring the PKA response when it binds to a Gal4 element that has replaced the CRE (29Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14375-14378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result is confirmed here, as G4CREB increased the PKA response ∼3-fold over that mediated by the G4DBD alone (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 7). The activity mediated by G4CREB is higher than that mediated by PKA alone. Wilson et al. (30Wilson H.L. McFie P.J. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43895-43902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed recently that, besides G4CREB, G4C/EBPα and G4C/EBPβ also mediate this response (30Wilson H.L. McFie P.J. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43895-43902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that different combinations of these factors bind to the CRE to mediate the PKA response of the endogenous PEPCK gene. CBP is an important coactivator for glucocorticoid-mediated PEPCK gene expression, and it has been shown to drive PEPCK gene transcription by interacting with proteins bound to the CRE (22Duong D.T. Waltner-Law M.E. Sears R. Sealy L. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 35: 32234-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The role of CBP at the CRE was therefore examined for the PKA response. CBP enhanced the PKA response of wild-type PEPCK/Luc by ∼2-fold (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 4) and of G4CREB by 3- to 4-fold (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 6 and8). A G4CBP construct was cotransfected with (C/G)-PEPCK/Luc to further explore the role of CBP in PKA-mediated gene expression (Fig.3 A). G4CBP, in the absence of cotransfected PKA, increased reporter gene activity 7-fold (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2). Cotransfection of PKA further increased the response to nearly 20-fold over the basal value (Fig. 3 A, lane 3); thus CBP has substantial activity at the CRE, even in the absence of CREB binding at the CRE. This activity is much greater than the 3- to 4-fold response observed in the experiment illustrated in Fig.2 B. CBP interacts with several coactivators to stimulate gene transcription. It is thus possible that CBP interacts with upstream coactivators to mediate the PKA response. A series of 5′ deletions (to positions −299, −200, −120, and −100 relative to the transcription start site) of (C/G)-PEPCK/Luc was constructed to examine the role of upstream promoter elements/factors in the PKA response. Truncation of the promoter to −299, which removes the GRU elements gAF1 (RARE1 of the RARU), gAF2, and gAF3 (RARE2 of the RARU), nearly abolished the PKA response when G4CBP is bound to a Gal4 element at the CRE (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and 5). Removal of the P3 and P4 regions by truncation to −200, or further deletion to −120, provides reporter gene constructs that exhibit no PKA response (Fig.3 A, lanes 6–9). Further truncation of the promoter to −100, which removes the CAAT box, an element that contains a binding site for the transcription factor NF1, resulted in a reporter gene with greatly decreased basal activity and no PKA responsiveness, even in the presence of G4CBP (Fig. 3 A, lanes 10and 11). To further investigate the involvement of the GRU/RARU DNA binding elements, in the context of the wild-type promoter, 5′ deletions (to −299, −200, and −120) were made in PEPCK/Luc (Fig. 3 B). In this circumstance, the PKA response was also inhibited by truncation of the PEPCK promoter to −299 (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Truncation of the promoter to −200 and −120 also resulted in a lack of stimulation by PKA (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5–8). In fact, there was a trend toward repression in the presence of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig. 3 B). The role of the GRU/RARU elements was further verified by adding these elements (bases −467 to −300 relative to the transcription start site) immediately upstream of the −200 construct, referred to as (GRU/RARU)/−200. H4IIE hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with this construct, and a restoration of the PKA response was observed (Fig. 3 B,lanes 9 and 10). These results confirm that some component of the GRU/RARU is necessary for full stimulation of PEPCK gene transcription by PKA. In addition to the CRE, the GRU consists of the elements gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3 that bind to HNF-4/COUP-TF, HNF-3β, and COUP-TF, respectively (8Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The RARU consists of two RAREs that are coincident with gAF1 and gAF3 and bind retinoic acid receptor (RAR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers (12Hall R.K. Scott D.K. Noisin E.L. Lucas P.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6260-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The gAF elements were initially identified by deletion and mutational analysis, and the identity of the factors that bind these elements was later confirmed using a electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay, the Gal4 system, and the ChIP assay. A similar approach was used to evaluate the role of the GRU/RARU in the PKA response, starting with the Gal4 system. Each of the GRU or RARU elements was replaced by a Gal4 DNA binding site, and these constructs were tested for PKA responsiveness. Replacement of gAF2 had no effect on the PKA response (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 1and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Mutation of either gAF1/RARE1 or gAF3/RARE2, however, significantly reduced this response (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 1 and2 with lanes 5 and 6 or withlanes 7 and 8). Because replacement of gAF3/RARE2 with the Gal4 DNA binding site was particularly detrimental to the PKA response, we focused our attention on this element. The gAF3/RARE2 element and an immediately adjacent E box bind COUP-TF and USF, respectively (Fig. 4 B, top) (10Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31909-31914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RARE2 is also a DR5-type RARE composed of three half-sites (α, β, and γ) (Fig. 4 B, top). RARE2 binds an RAR/RXR heterodimer but only in the presence of retinoic acid (13Scott D.K. Mitchell J.A. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6260-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text P"

To study the role of oxidative stress on laminin expression, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were co-cultured with HepG2 cells that do or do not express (E47 or C34 cells, respectively) CYP2E1, a potent generator of oxygen radicals. Co-incubation of HSC with E47 cells increased laminin β1 and γ1 proteins compared with co-incubation with C34 cells; this increase was prevented by antioxidants and CYP2E1 inhibitors. Similar results were observed in co-culture with primary hepatocytes from saline- or pyrazole-treated (with high levels of CYP2E1) rats. Laminin α1 chain was not detectable in the HSC in any of the systems; however, laminin α2 chain increased in HSC co-cultured with E47 cells. Synthesis but not turnover of laminin β1 and γ1 proteins was increased in HSC in the E47 co-culture. Laminin β1 and γ1 mRNAs were up-regulated in HSC in the E47 co-culture because of transcriptional activation of both genes. Transfection experiments in HSC with reporter constructs driven by the laminin γ1 promoter showed maximal responsiveness with the −230/+106 and the −1400/+106 constructs in the E47 system. Gel-shift assays demonstrated an increase in Sp1 binding to the laminin γ1 promoter in HSC when co-incubated with E47 cells, which was blocked by an anti-Sp1 antibody. Co-transfection of a Sp1 expression vector further increased the responsiveness of the −330LAMγ1-CATreporter vector in HSC in the HSC/E47 system.

To date, five α, three β, and two γ chains have been described, forming at least 12 trimeric laminin isoforms (1Tunggal P. Smyth N. Paulsson M. Ott M.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although laminins are distinguished by both subunit composition and tissue distribution, the overall domain structure is well conserved (1Tunggal P. Smyth N. Paulsson M. Ott M.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Laminin 1 (EHS laminin) is an 820-kDa heterotrimer consisting of one each of α1 (400-kDa), β1 (220-kDa), and γ1 (200-kDa) chains, and laminin 2 (Merosin) is an 800-kDa heterotrimer formed of α2 (380-kDa), β1 (220-kDa), and γ1 (200-kDa) chains. Both covalent and noncovalent interactions contribute to the basic structure of most laminins, a cruciform with three short arms and one long arm (2Sasaki M. Kleinman H.K. Huber H. Deutzmann R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16536-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The individual laminin subunits share a common structural motif composed of repeated epidermal growth factor-like domains interrupted by globular domains. A number of biological activities have been attributed to laminin, including cell attachment, differentiation, and migration, along with interactions with other matrix components (3Timpl R. Rohde H. Robey P.G. Rennard S.I. Foidart J.M. Martin G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9933-9937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin has also been implicated in the process of tumor invasion and metastasis (4Liotta L.A. Rao C.N. Barsky S.H. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 636-649PubMed Google Scholar). Different isoforms of the laminin molecule may vary with respect to tissue distribution and developmental expression. The β1 and the γ1 chains are expressed in most tissues that produce basement membranes, but their ratios vary considerably (5Boot-Handford R.P. Kurkinen M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12475-12478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the liver, increased deposition of laminins, the main noncollagenous glycoproteins in all basement membranes, was demonstrated in rats with chemically induced carcinoma (6Rescan P.Y. Clement B. Yamada Y. Segui-Real B. Baffet G. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Guillouzo A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 701-709PubMed Google Scholar) and within the lobule of livers from patients with malignancies (7Wever U.M. Albrechten R. Virchows. Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histopathol. 1992; 421: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, in normal adult livers, laminins are located mainly in the portal tracts and are only sparsely deposited in the space of Disse (8Clement B. Rescan P.Y. Baffet G. Loreal O. Lehry D. Campion J.P. Guillouzo A. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 794-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In human liver, the laminin isoforms have not been clearly identified so far, and only information from rodents is available. Rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC),1 the main source of extracellular matrix components in both normal and fibrotic livers, express β1, γ1, and an α chain of 380 kDa that probably corresponds to unprocessed form of the α2 chain (9Maher J.J. Tzagaraki C. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Normal adult hepatocytes do not express laminin 1 in vivo, but synthesize both β1 and γ1 chain mRNAs after a few hours in culture (6Rescan P.Y. Clement B. Yamada Y. Segui-Real B. Baffet G. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Guillouzo A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 701-709PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wever U.M. Albrechten R. Virchows. Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histopathol. 1992; 421: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Several hepatoma cell lines of either human or rat origin express both β1 and γ1 chains at high levels and a 380-kDa polypeptide that is genetically different from the α1 chain but stained by polyclonal anti-laminin antibodies (10Rescan P.Y. Clement B. Yamada Y. Glaise D. Segui-Real B. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Guillouzo A. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although most studies have focused on laminins polymerized into a basement membrane, much laminin is found freely soluble and diffusible. Furthermore, although the polymerization of laminin in vitro occurs by a self-assembly mechanism, basement membranes are formed at discrete sites close to the cell membrane (11Yurchenco P.D. Quan Y. Colognato H. Mathus T. Harrison D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of the mouse laminin γ1(LAMγ1) gene has been cloned and characterized (12Ogawa K. Burbelo P.D. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 163: 8384-8389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The LAMγ1 gene appears to contain two transcription start sites (−169 and −234) and it does not contain a TATA or CAAT box, however, it has several interesting features, including the presence of ten GC boxes, which act as putative binding sites for the redox-sensitive transcription factor Sp1 (two in tandem and the rest monomeric), and a stretch of nine nearly identical repeats of 11 nucleotides between −200 and −450 with the sequence 5′-CCC(G/T)CCC(A/T)CCT-3′. The consensus sequence for cAMP responsiveness is also present in the LAMγ1promoter and is similarly found in the promoters of other extracellular-matrix proteins (12Ogawa K. Burbelo P.D. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 163: 8384-8389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). These motifs act as transcription activators in several extracellular-matrix genes. The integrity of the CTC-rich region is required to promote LAMγ1activity. Consequently, it could be hypothesized that there is interplay between CTC and GC elements, GC boxes being predominant in the activation of truncated CTC-less LAMγ1promoter. The region from −830 to −224 appears to contain a negative regulatory element, which decreases the promoter activity of theLAMγ1 gene. Deletion of −94 to −61 nucleotides reduced the promoter activity by severalfold in HepG2 cells, and deletion of 20 bp from −41 to −21 completely abolished the promoter activity in HepG2 cells (13Kedar V. Freese E. Hempel F. Mol. Brain. Res. 1997; 47: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). On the other hand, theLAMγ1 promoter had a relatively high level of activity in NIH-3T3 cells, which synthesize little laminin. This result suggests that the 830-bp promoter segment may lack a negative regulatory element, which inhibits transcription in certain cells (12Ogawa K. Burbelo P.D. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 163: 8384-8389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Ethanol and several other low molecular weight agents induce cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), which is of special interest because it metabolizes and activates hepatic toxins as well as carcinogens and fatty acids (14Koop D.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). CYP2E1 is a loosely coupled enzyme that generates high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide radical and H2O2 (15Ekstrom G. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 16Gorsky L.D. Koop D.R. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6812-6817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidative stress plays an important role in mechanisms by which ethanol damages the liver (17Tsukamoto H. Lu S.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1335-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has carried out studies to evaluate whether hepatocytes with high levels of CYP2E1 can interact with nonparenchymal liver cells such as HSC via release of diffusable mediators (18Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 19Nieto N. Friedman S.L. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9853-9864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the present study we evaluated whether CYP2E1-derived oxidative stress could modulate the expression of basement-membrane proteins such as laminin, which are elevated during liver fibrosis, and the role of oxidative stress in this inductive up-regulation of laminin. The model used in most of the experiments described below is based on the co-culture of HepG2 cell lines that express (E47 cells) or do not express (C34 cells) the human CYP2E1 (20Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,21Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 795-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with primary HSC or with an immortalized rat stellate cell line (HSC-T6). Primary HSC were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (600 ± 25 g) (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, MA) byin situ liver perfusion with bacterial collagenase and pronase, followed by density-gradient centrifugation with Nycodenz according to published protocols (22Friedman S.L. Rockey D.C. McGuire R.F. Maher J.J. Boyles J.K. Yamasaki G. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Results of Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 were with the primary HSC whereas other results were carried out with the HSC-T6 cells. Cell viability (95%) was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method. Purity of the HSC fraction (97%) was determined as described previously (23Nieto N. Dominguez-Rosales J.A. Fontana L. Salazar A. Armendariz-Borunda J. Greenwel P. Rojkind M. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To extend results with the HepG2 cells to intact primary hepatocytes, selected experiments (Fig. 4) were carried out using hepatocytes isolated from saline control rats or from pyrazole-treated rats whose CYP2E1 levels are elevated about 3- to 4-fold (24Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 264: 1468-1473PubMed Google Scholar). Details on the co-culture model are shown in Fig.1. Cells were co-incubated using cell-culture inserts of 3-μm pore size to separate both cell populations; this allows study of the effect of diffusable CYP2E1-derived mediators from the hepatocyte on HSC functions, which resembles the physiological situation in the liver. The HSC were plated on the bottom and the HepG2 cells or the hepatocytes on the filter to create a gradient of the released mediators. The ratio of HepG2 or hepatocytes to HSC was 5:1, similar to that of parenchymal:nonparenchymal cells in liver. After overnight incubation of HSC alone in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and essential amino acids, the HSC medium was discarded, the cells were washed 5 times in MEM, and the cell-culture inserts containing the HepG2 cells or the primary hepatocytes were transferred along with their overnight culture medium. At this time all additions were made (t = 0 h). Plasmid DNA preparation as well as transfection procedures, Northern and Western blot analysis, nuclear run-on, the activities of antioxidant enzymes and glutathione (GSH) levels were carried out as previously described (23Nieto N.

Western blots were carried out routinely under denaturing conditions on cell lysates or with incubation media using anti-laminin 1 antibody (1/5000), which recognizes all α1, β1, and γ1 subunits (Sigma) or anti-laminin α2 chain antibody (1/2000), which recognizes only the N-terminal moiety of ∼300 kDa and not the C-terminal moiety of ∼75–80 kDa of the α2 chain (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The anti-Sp1 (1/2000), anti-tubulin (1/5000), and anti-fibrinogen (1/5000) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as secondary antibody (1:5000; Chemicon). In most of the Western blots, the laminin β1 and γ1 chains run very close and were difficult to separate during the electrophoresis (11Yurchenco P.D. Quan Y. Colognato H. Mathus T. Harrison D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), therefore bands have been labeled as laminin β1 and γ1, except for the Western blot in Fig. 2A in which both bands were clearly separated because of a longer run. Fig. 3,C and D show Western blots run in nondenaturing conditions.Figure 3Expression of laminin α2 chain in the co-cultures.

HSC lysates after 3 d (C) and 5 d (D) from the co-cultures were electrophoresed under nondenaturing conditions and incubated with anti-laminin 1 antibody. The same blots were incubated for β-tubulin as a control for loading. Arbitrary units under the blots refer to the ratio of laminin/β-tubulin. For D, arbitrary units refer to the ratio of the 800-kDa band/β-tubulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assay the synthesis of laminin β1 and γ1 subunits, the HSC-T6 cells or HSC-T6 co-cultured with the C34 or E47 cells were plated separately in 10% fetal bovine serum-MEM; after 12 h, the medium from the HSC was removed and the inserts containing the C34 or E47 cells together with their culture medium were transferred onto the plates containing the HSC; fresh medium was also added to the HSC that were plated with an empty insert as a reference group (not to be co-cultured with HepG2 cells). 22 h later, the media from the complete co-culture systems were replaced with methionine-cysteine-free MEM plus 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, the cells were incubated for 2 h, after which they were pulse-labeled with 150 μCi of EasyTagTMEXPRE35S35S Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h to study the synthesis of laminin β1 and γ1. A set of samples was pulsed for 2 h in the presence of 40 μm cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, as a control for the analysis of laminin β1 and γ1 synthesis. The cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at the indicated time points with 150 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To assay the turnover of laminin β1 and γ1, defined as the loss of [35S]methionine-labeled intracellular laminin β1 and γ1 when HSC-T6 cells were chased with cold methionine, plus secretion of [35S]methionine-labeled laminin β1 and γ1 into the medium, the co-cultures were treated as above but pulse-labeled with the EXPRE35S35S mix for 24 h. The cells were then washed three times and chased with complete MEM supplemented with 300 μg/ml of cold methionine. Cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h in the same lysis buffer. In all cases, laminin β1 and γ1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-laminin 1 IgG-protein G-agarose as follows: 40 μg of protein of cell lysates and 1 mg of protein from the culture medium were first incubated with 10 μl of preimmune rabbit serum for 15 min, followed by the addition of 50 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein G-agarose. After centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 rpm, the supernatant was incubated with anti-laminin 1 IgG by rocking overnight at 4 °C followed by addition of 50 μl of a suspension of protein G-agarose. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm, the pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer plus 2% SDS, and three times with 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. Laminins β1 and γ1 were eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli's buffer, samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm to remove the protein G-agarose, resolved on a 5% SDS-PAGE, and dried. The intensity of the radioactive signal was quantified using PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the ImageQuant software. To evaluate total protein synthesis by HSC, cells were treated as above and incubated with the EasyTagTMEXPRE35S35S labeling mix for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h, followed by addition of 30% trichloroacetic acid to stop the reaction. The cells were washed in 1x phosphate-buffered saline, and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were determined in a scintillation counter after resuspension of the pellets in scintillation liquid. To evaluate loss of [35S]methionine labeled HSC total protein, the co-cultures were pulse-labeled for 24 h as above, followed by chasing for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. The HSC were treated with 30% trichloroacetic acid and washed, and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated counts were determined as described above. Quantitative comparison of the intensity of the signal scanned in the PhosphorImager was performed using ImageQuant software. These constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihiko Yamada (National Institutes of Health) and were generated as described in Ref. 12Ogawa K. Burbelo P.D. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

This plasmid, pKH102, was linearized with NcoI and then partially digested with the exonuclease Bal31. HindIII linkers were attached, and the plasmid was self-ligated. One of the plasmids, pKH121, containing 106 bp of the 5′-untranslated region was selected. The 1-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment of pKH121 whose BamHI site was converted to NdeI by filling the end with Klenow fragment and attaching NdeI linker was inserted into the NdeI-HindIII site of pSVOCAT (27Chepelinsky A.B.

The −1400LAMγ1-CAT construct contains a 1.4-kb laminin γ1 promoter segment (+106 to −1300) cloned into the HindIII site of pSVOCAT. To generate the −2500LAMγ1-CAT construct, theSmaI segment from the intron 1 was cloned into theNdeI site of pKH130 (12Ogawa K. Burbelo P.D. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 163: 8384-8389Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (28Dignam J.R. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). HSC were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 100 μl of buffer A (10 mmHEPES pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml bestatin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.6% Igepal-SC560) were added. Cells were lysed for 15 min, and nuclei were isolated after centrifugation for 20 s at 13,000 rpm. Nuclei were washed in buffer A without Igepal-SC566, spun down for 20 s, the supernatant was discarded, and nuclear proteins were extracted in 40 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml bestatin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) by vortexing for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, and the supernatants were immediately frozen until analyzed. For electrophoretic mobility-shift assays, synthetic oligonucleotides for Sp1, AP1, and NFκB (Promega, Madison, WI) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 μl with 5 μg or 0.5 μg (for AP1) of the nuclear protein extract from HSC, 1 μl of 10× binding buffer containing 1 μg/μl of poly(dI-dC), and 20,000 cpm of labeled oligonucleotides at room temperature for 30 min. For competition studies, 1000-fold cold oligonucleotides were added along with labeled oligonucleotides. Antibodies raised against Sp1, AP1 (c-Jun/c-Fos), and NFκB (p50/p65) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were used for supershifting oligonucleotides-nuclear protein complexes. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6%) was performed at 150 volts for 2 h in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate/1 mm EDTA, pH 8). Southwestern (DNA-protein) blotting was performed by the method of Singh et al. (29Singh H. Lebowitz J.H. Baldwin A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of nuclear protein extract from HSC were electrophoresed on a SDS exponential 5–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in 25 mmTris, 190 mm glycine pH 8.3, and 20% methanol for 1 h. Nuclear proteins were electrotransferred onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes using the same buffer containing 0.1% SDS. After overnight transfer at 4 °C, the membranes were blocked in Blotto containing 10% nonfat dry milk in TNE buffer (50 mmTris pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). DNA binding was carried out for 3 h with TNE buffer containing 5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) and 2 × 105 cpm/ml [α-32P]dCTP multiprime-labeled 80-bp fragment (−230 to −150) derived from the −2500LAMγ1-CATconstruct by PCR amplification. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min each with TNE at room temperature and exposed in the PhosphorImager screen. The designation HSC refers to data found in the HSC incubated with an empty insert;HSC/C34 refers to results obtained in the HSC after co-culture with the C34 cells, whereasHSC/E47 refers to results obtained in the HSC after co-culture with the E47 cells. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Most of the experiments were repeated at least three times except for the nuclear run-on, which is from one experiment only. Statistical evaluation was carried out using Student's t test. Primary HSC were co-cultured with either the C34 or E47 cells. HSC lysates and aliquots of the incubation medium were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 d and analyzed by Western blot for the expression of different laminin chains. A time-dependent increase in laminin β1 (220 kDa) and γ1 (200 kDa) production was observed in both systems but was higher in the E47 co-culture when compared with the C34 co-culture (Fig.2A). At 3 d of co-culture there was a 2- to 4-fold increase in the HSC content of laminin β1 and γ1 chains, as well as a 3-fold increase in secretion of laminin β1 and γ1 to the medium of the E47 co-culture as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 2, B and C). β-Tubulin levels, as a control for loading, were identical in both co-cultures. This difference in the amount of laminin β1 and γ1 subunits in the culture medium in the E47 cell co-culture did not come from laminin β1 and γ1 produced by the E47 cells because the medium from C34 and E47 cells cultured alone did not show any significant differences in laminin β1 and γ1 content (Fig. 2D). High molecular weight bands in the 400-kDa region where laminin α1 would appear could not be detected in any of the blots in Fig. 2,B–D. When the same samples were blotted and incubated with anti-laminin α2 chain antibody, laminin α2 chain expression was observed, and higher expression of laminin α2 was detected intracellularly at 3 d inHSC co-cultured with E47 cells as compared with theHSC/C34 co-culture (Fig.3A) as well as in the culture medium (Fig. 3B). When the same cell extracts were electrophoresed under nondenaturing and nonreducing conditions, a dimer/s of about 400 kDa was observed after 3 d of culture, whereas a heterotrimer of about 800 kDa was observed after 5 d but not 3 d (Fig. 3, C and D) of culture. There was increased formation of the dimer/s at 3 d and the heterotrimer at 5 d in the HSC/E47 co-culture compared with theHSC/C34 co-culture, in agreement with the increase in the individual β1, γ1, and α2 laminin chains. Of note is the observation that the 800-kDa heterotrimer band was not detectable until day 5 of co-incubation with the HepG2 cells, which suggests that assembly of the α2 subunit (whose expression is also increased under higher oxidative stress conditions) with the β1 and γ1 subunits appears to be delayed with respect to the increase in levels of expression of the individual α2, β1, and γ1 laminin chains or the 400-kDa dimer/s. The laminin heterotrimer is believed to play the major role in laminin's action as a basement-membrane protein. Whether the presence of extracellular nonassembled α2, β1, γ1 chains has any physiological role is not known. To determine whether the increase by co-culturing HSC with E47 cells on laminin β1 and γ1 expression was ROS-mediated, the co-cultures were treated for 24 h with either 2000 units/ml catalase to decompose H2O2 or with 50 μm vitamin E to prevent lipid peroxidation, and laminin β1 and γ1 protein content was analyzed by Western blot. Fig.4A shows that both catalase and vitamin E prevented the increase in laminin β1 and γ1 subunits in HSC co-incubated with E47 cells; these antioxidants also decreased laminin β1 and γ1 in the"

In non-murine cells, the homologous repetitive element and C/EBPα are less concentrated.

This suggests that regulated compartmentalization of transcription factors may be functionally important (2Francastel C. Schübeler D. Martin D.I. Groudine M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The co-concentration of α-satellite DNA and C/EBPα at microscopically detectable pericentromeric heterochromatin permits the study of pericentromeric targeting of C/EBPα. Point and deletion mutations of C/EBPα that block pericentromeric targeting still block cellular proliferation (18Liu W. Enwright J.F. Hyun W. Day R.N. Schaufele F. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/3/6)PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that pericentromeric localization is not required for the antiproliferative effects of C/EBPα. In contrast, transcriptional activity is regulated by pericentromeric location. A C/EBPα mutant that no longer binds α-satellite DNA but that retains normal binding to some promoter binding sites also no longer concentrates at the pericentromeric subdomains of the nucleus. This altered specificity mutation releases C/EBPα from sequestration at the transcriptionally quiescent (11Schaufele F. Enwright J.F.I. Wang X. Teoh C. Srihari R. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A.

The sequestration of C/EBPα at pericentromeric heterochromatin may be accompanied by an alteration in C/EBPα structure. We investigated whether C/EBPα structure was different when localized at pericentromeric heterochromatin and at euchromatin in mouse pituitary progenitor cells. C/EBPα is a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a conserved, carboxyl-terminal dimerization and DNA binding domain (23Lee K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 9-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Baxevanis A.D. Vinson C.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 25Wedel A.

McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,27Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Transcription activation (TA) functions are present in more amino-terminal domains of C/EBPα (28Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30Pei D.Q. Shih C.H. Mol. Cell.

However, the relative positions of the bZIP and TA domains in the C/EBPα dimer are unknown under any in vitro or in vivo condition. We combined fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques to define the relative positions of the TA and bZIP domains in dimers of C/EBPα at different subregions of living cell nuclei. The TA and bZIP domains of full-length C/EBPα were labeled with the autofluorescent green and blue fluorescent proteins (GFP and BFP) and expressed in living cells. Like endogenous C/EBPα, fluorescent protein-labeled C/EBPα was constitutively nuclear and accumulated at pericentromeric heterochromatin (10Tang Q.Q.

Physik. 1948; 6: 54-75Google Scholar), the amount of energy transferred from BFP to GFP indicated the relative interactions between the fluorophore-tagged TA and bZIP domains at each site within the cell (34Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 6: 54-75Google Scholar, 35Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys.

FRET, normalized for the amounts of BFP and GFP present, was much higher when BFP and GFP were attached to the bZIP domains than to the TA domains. This indicated that the bZIP domains were closer to each other than were the TA domains in the C/EBPα dimer or that the interactions between the bZIP domains were kinetically more favorable (36Youvan D.C. Silva C.M. Bylina E.J. Coleman W.J. Dilworth M.R. Yang M.M. Biotechnol. Alia. 1997; 3: 1-18Google Scholar). Bimolecular interaction plots of the amount of FRET measured against the amounts of BFP and GFP-tagged C/EBPα present indicated identical kinetics for interactions between the bZIP and between the TA domains. FRET, measured at each of thousands of subregions throughout each nucleus, showed that the bZIP domains were further apart or interacted less well in C/EBPα dimers concentrated at the pericentromeric subregions than in dimers at the remaining euchromatic regions of the nucleus. In contrast, the spatial relationship between the TA and bZIP domains was identical at the pericentromeric and noncentromeric locations but was altered by incubating the cells with a phorbol ester. Thus, we provide the first characterization of the conformational state of a gene- and cell cycle-regulatory factor at localized positions within living nuclei. All C/EBPα fusion proteins were expressed under the control of the human cytomegalovirus after transfection by electroporation, as previously described, into pituitary progenitor GHFT1-5 cells (11Schaufele F.

The transfected cells were plated on number 1 borosilicate glass coverslips and grown 40–48 h post-transfection before imaging. Transfected cells grown for 24 h were treated with 10−8mPMA (Sigma) or control Me2SO drug vehicle for 1 day prior to imaging or to extract preparation for promoter activation studies (38Schaufele F.

The growth hormone promoter and the C/EBPα-sensitive promoter containing the growth hormone TATA box (−33 to +8 relative to the transcription start site) and a single growth hormone C/EBPα binding site (−239 to −219) have been previously characterized (11Schaufele F.

For the quantification of C/EBPα co-localization with Hoechst 33342-stained DNA in 3T3-L1 cells, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, and transfected GHFT1-5 cells, those cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed for 5 min with methanol, treated for 5 min with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked by incubation with 5% horse serum in PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of the C-18, anti-C/EBPα primary antibody (goat) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (sc-9314) in 0.5% horse serum in PBS. Slides were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of donkey, anti-goat, rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-2094). Following washing with PBS, slides were incubated for 5 min with 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and then washed three times with PBS. For the 3T3-L1 cell images shown in Fig. 1 B, the 14AA anti-C/EBPα primary antibody (rabbit) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-61) was used in conjunction with the donkey, anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-2095). All quantified FRET and co-localization data were collected on an Olympus IX-70 using Olympus ×40 Plan Apochromat objective (0.95 numerical aperture). The images shown in Fig. 1 A were collected using an Olympus ×100 Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective (1.40 numerical aperture). Chroma Corp. (Brattleboro, VT) filters and multi-band pass dichroic mirror (61000v2bs) were used together with Sutter Instruments (Novato, CA) λ-10 excitation and emission filter wheels, controlled by Universal Imaging Corp.(Downingtown, PA) Metamorph data acquisition software. The single, immobile, multi-band pass dichroic mirror in combination with mobile excitation and emission filters and the use of chromatically corrected objectives maximized the image registration required for pixel-by-pixel co-localization analysis and FRET nanoscopy. An Opti-Quip (Highland Hills, NY) model 1962 long term stabilizer was used to keep light intensity constant for accurate quantitative data collection. Antibody-stained slides were imaged by 1) exciting rhodamine with 550–560-nm light and collecting emissions from 580–630 nm, 2) exciting GFP with 480–495 nm light and collecting emissions at 500–530 nm, and 3) exciting Hoechst 33342 with 365–395-nm light and collecting emissions from 435–465 nm. Controls showed no fluorescence bleed-through of rhodamine, GFP, or Hoechst between these channels. For quantitative co-localization analysis (Figs. 1, C andD), focusing was done using the Hoechst channel so as to blind data collection to the presence and amounts of expressed C/EBPα. Once data collection parameters were established that ensured no saturation in any pixels, all integration times, camera gain, and pixel binning were kept constant to permit accurate quantitative comparisons of fluorescence amounts between different cell nuclei. Live cell imaging was used to analyze FRET between BFP and GFP-linked C/EBPα. Images were always collected in the following order: 1) acceptor (excitation filter 480–495 nm/emission filter 500–530 nm, 2) donor (365–395 nm/435–465 nm), 3) FRET (365–395 nm/500–530 nm). The acceptor and donor channels yielded no bleed-through between BFP and GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2). It is particularly important to collect the FRET channel after the donor channel to eliminate any possibility of false FRET signals arising from decreased donor emissions that would occur if BFP were photobleached during an initial collection in the FRET channel. Images were collected by focusing only for the GFP-labeled C/EBPα using the acceptor filter combination. This prevented, until data collection, the excitation of BFP, which is more prone than other GFP derivatives to photobleaching (31Day R.N. Periasamy A. Schaufele F. Methods. 2001; 25: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Practically, we had little difficulty with BFP photobleaching as was indicated by the reproducibility of our constants obtained from the control cells expressing only C/EBPα fusions with BFP (Fig. 2). All image analysis was done using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). For the analysis of C/EBPα co-localization with Hoechst, a region of no fluorescence adjacent to the cell was used to determine the average background level of fluorescence in each of the rhodamine, GFP, and Hoechst channels. The background amount was then subtracted from each pixel in each channel. Nuclei were identified as regions of contiguous pixels containing higher than background levels of blue fluorescence in the Hoechst channel. The selected region was transferred to the matched images collected in the rhodamine and GFP channels. For co-localization analysis of cells expressing C/EBPα fused to either BFP or GFP, nuclei were similarly identified as regions of contiguous pixels containing significantly higher than background levels of GFP fluorescence. Correlation coefficients were calculated by comparing the amounts of fluorescence measured in each matched pixel of two different channels using the Metamorph “correlation plot” application. The nuclei of cells expressing BFP- or GFP-tagged C/EBPα were identified from background-subtracted BFP or GFP fluorescent images as described above. The amounts of nuclear fluorescence collected from the acceptor (GFP) or donor (BFP) in each channel were expressed as ratios relative to the amount of fluorescence collected in the respective acceptor or donor channels (see Fig. 2). These spectral cross-talk ratios were used to calculate the contributions of BFP and GFP to each channel in cells co-expressing BFP- and GFP-labeled C/EBPα. Briefly, from the amount of acceptor fluorescence in each co-expressing cell was subtracted the minimal fluorescence contamination of C/EBPα-BFP to the acceptor channel (0.0013× donor fluorescence amount). The minimal contribution of C/EBPα-GFP to the donor channel (0.0040 times the BFP-corrected acceptor fluorescence) was similarly subtracted. Although these contaminations were negligible in the current experiments, they can be significant with other fluorophore or filter combinations 3F. Schaufele and R. N. Day, unpublished data. and must be accounted for. For calculating FRET and FRET efficiency from the nucleus, the fluorescence contribution of the acceptor C/EBPα-GFP then was subtracted from the background-subtracted FRET channel (0.0882 times the BFP-corrected acceptor fluorescence). The amount of remaining fluorescence in the FRET channel then was divided by the amount of remaining fluorescence in the donor channel. If the resulting ratio is the same as the ratio obtained from cells containing only donor (0.4719), then there was no FRET. If higher than 0.4719, energy was transferred from the donor to the acceptor. It is critical that the acceptor cross-talk into the FRET channel is accounted for. We have noticed, to date, a number of attempts by other laboratories to calculate FRET without taking into account the substantial contributions of the acceptor itself into the FRET channel. Simply measuring the ratio of the amount of fluorescence in the FRET and donor channels with only donor excitation incorporates acceptor bleed-through into the FRET channel. If not accounted for, this bleed-through increases the FRET/donor ratio and results in a false conclusion of interaction. Since the ratios measured are physical parameters of the fluorophores, correctly calculated FRET measurements are highly consistent between separate experiments, provided that all parameters affecting the relative ratios of fluorescence quantification in the donor, acceptor, and FRET channels are kept constant. This includes using the same 1) objective lens, 2) dichroic mirror, 3) excitation/emission filters, 4) camera, and 5) relative integration times for the different channels. All bleed-through-corrected measurements were downloaded into Microsoft Excel files and were expressed as a mean ± S.D. from multiple nuclei collected from two or more experiments. Statistically significant differences were determined using t tests. Slopes and y intercepts were calculated using Excel. 95% confidence intervals in the slopes were calculated using GraphPad (San Diego, CA) Prism software, using only data from the linear range (acceptor/donor amounts <5) and setting the line to have the correcty intercept of 0.47. Data collected over a wider acceptor/donor range was fit into a single order interaction plot using GraphPad Prism. The amount of FRET at each pixel was determined by applying our calculations directly on each image using Metamorph software. The backgrounds were determined as above and then subtracted from each pixel within each image using Metamorph arithmetic functions. Also subtracted from each pixel were the bleed-through contributions of BFP and GFP from matched pixels to the appropriate green, blue, and FRET channels. The bleed-through-corrected images contain the fluorescence values for BFP, GFP, and FRET, from which were calculated the FRET/donor and acceptor/donor ratios at each pixel in the image. Since C/EBPα should assume the same relative intranuclear distribution regardless of whether it is linked to BFP- or GFP, the high correlation coefficients observed for BFP- and GFP-linked C/EBPα expressed in the same cell confirmed the precise image registration required for this analysis. The formula y = mx + b was used to calculate the extent of FRET (m) at each pixel in every precisely registered image: y is the FRET/donor ratio at a single pixel, x is the acceptor/donor ratio at the same pixel, and b (the y intercept) is the FRET/donor ratio, where acceptor/donor = 0 (i.e. the constant determined from the donor alone control). The above FRET nanoscopy analyses were done in a semiautomated fashion by linking the calculations into a Metamorph journal. In the FRET analysis of cells co-expressing BFP and GFP-labeled C/EBPα, there was no counterstaining with the blue fluorescent Hoechst 33342, normally used to identify pericentromeric regions. Because of the high correlation of C/EBPα location with Hoechst 33342 staining (Fig. 1), pericentromeric regions within the nuclei were identified as pixels containing more than 1.2 times the average amount of background-subtracted GFP-tagged C/EBPα fluorescence. Visually and quantitatively, this corresponded well to pericentromeric regions identified by staining with the blue fluorescent Hoechst 33342 (40Zhang W.-H. Srihari R. Day R.N. Schaufele F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40373-40376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). FRET and the extent of FRET measurements were compared at and away from the marked pericentromeric regions using the co-localization application of Metamorph. The proportions of pixels showing specific extents of FRET were calculated using Metamorph by measuring the number of pixels of progressively higher slope using sequential threshold values. FRET efficiency varies with distance according to the relationship first described by Förster (34Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 6: 54-75Google Scholar): FRET efficiency (E) = (1 + (r/r o)6)−1, where r is the distance between two fluorophores andr o is the distance between two fluorophores at which energy transfer is 50% efficient. Other factors, including the interaction kinetics and the rotational orientation of the fluorophore, contribute to FRET efficiency and are included in more expansive equations (34Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 6: 54-75Google Scholar, 36Youvan D.C. Silva C.M. Bylina E.J. Coleman W.J. Dilworth M.R. Yang M.M. Biotechnol. Alia. 1997; 3: 1-18Google Scholar). The relative slopes from the linear portions of the FRET/donor versus acceptor/donor graphs are a close surrogate measurement of the relative FRET efficiencies (37Weatherman R.V. Chang C.-Y. Clegg N.J. Carroll D.C. Day R.N. Baxter J.D. McDonnell D.P. Scanlan T.S. Schaufele F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Determination of the actual FRET efficiency would depend upon equipment calibrations that equate fluorescence amounts with the amounts of each molecule. However, we can compare the relative FRET efficiencies for two different interactions as the ratio of the slopesE 1 and E 2, E1E2=1+(r2/r0)61+(r1/r0)6Equation 1 where r 2 and r 1are the BFP to GFP distances under the two conditions being examined;r o for FRET from BFP to GFP is 41.4 Å (33Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). By assuming hypothetical values for r 2 anywhere between 40 and 100 Å, we calculated the value ofr 1. We then determined the differences betweenr 2 and r 1 distances over a range of values for r 2. This indicated the range in average distances separating the fluorophores used to label the proteins under the two different experimental conditions. C/EBPα, fused at either its amino (GFP-C/EBPα) or carboxyl (C/EBPα-GFP) terminus with GFP, was transiently expressed in mouse pituitary progenitor GHFT1-5 cells. GHFT1-5 progenitor cells contain no endogenous C/EBPα (11Schaufele F. Enwright J.F.I. Wang X. Teoh C. Srihari R. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Day R.N. Mol.
