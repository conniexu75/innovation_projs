https://openalex.org/W2119885620,"Knowledge of both the global chromatin structure and the gene expression programs of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) should provide a robust means to assess whether the genomes of these cells have similar pluripotent states. Recent studies have suggested that ESCs and iPSCs represent different pluripotent states with substantially different gene expression profiles. We describe here a comparison of global chromatin structure and gene expression data for a panel of human ESCs and iPSCs. Genome-wide maps of nucleosomes with histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications indicate that there is little difference between ESCs and iPSCs with respect to these marks. Gene expression profiles confirm that the transcriptional programs of ESCs and iPSCs show very few consistent differences. Although some variation in chromatin structure and gene expression was observed in these cell lines, these variations did not serve to distinguish ESCs from iPSCs.

These iPSCs hold great potential for regenerative medicine because they are similar to pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and can be derived in a patient-specific manner from adult somatic cells (Yamanaka, 2007Yamanaka S.

However, recent studies comparing the gene expression profiles of ESCs and iPSCs have suggested that iPSCs are a unique cellular subtype distinct from ESCs (Chin et al., 2009Chin M.H. Mason M.J.

It is important to understand whether there are genuine differences in the global chromatin structure and the gene expression programs of human ESCs and iPSCs, given that such differences may impact the potential therapeutic use of iPSCs. Trithorax group (TrxG) and Polycomb group (PcG) protein complexes are key regulators of chromatin structures that are required for segmental identity in the developing embryo and contribute to maintenance of the pluripotent ESC state (Ringrose and Paro, 2004Ringrose L.

TrxG complexes catalyze histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H23K4me3) at promoters of protein-coding genes (Bernstein et al., 2002Bernstein B.E. Humphrey E.L. Erlich R.L. Schneider R. Bouman P.

The PcG protein complex PRC2 catalyzes histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which contributes to repression of developmental genes (Schuettengruber et al., 2007Schuettengruber B.

Histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone modifications are generally associated with transcriptionally active and repressed domains of the genome, respectively, although both modifications can occur at silent genes encoding developmental regulators that are poised for future activation (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E.

Genome-wide maps of these histone modifications, which produce robust signals in ChIP-Seq experiments, can be especially useful for comparing transcriptional and developmental states of cells, particularly when coupled with gene expression profiling. Microarray-based gene expression profiling has proven to be a powerful approach to characterize the transcriptional state of cells and to identify differences between cells of different types or states (Ebert and Golub, 2004Ebert B.L.

Comparing the gene expression profiles of ESCs and iPSCs could permit identification of any unique and consistent differences between these two cell types. However, comparative analysis of expression data can be challenging because of differences in the homogeneity of cell populations, cell handling, reagents, and analytical techniques. In comparing the expression profiles of ESCs and iPSCs, it is therefore important to use analytical methods that account for the noise in the data and require reproducible results across multiple experiments (Bammler et al., 2005Bammler T. Beyer R.P. Bhattacharya S. Boorman G.A. Boyles A. Bradford B.U. Bumgarner R.E. Bushel P.R. Chaturvedi K. Choi D. et al.Members of the Toxicogenomics Research ConsortiumStandardizing global gene expression analysis between laboratories and across platforms.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 351-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated whether a panel of human ESCs differs consistently from a panel of human iPSCs using both genome-wide maps of histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications and gene expression analysis. We have also reanalyzed a large collection of previously published gene expression data by using different analysis methods. Our results reveal that small variations in the chromatin structure or gene expression occur among different ESC and iPSC lines, but we do not observe a consistent signature that distinguishes iPSC lines from ESC lines when examined after extended culture. We used ChIP-Seq to map H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 occupancy genome-wide in six independent ESC lines and six independent iPSC lines grown under identical conditions (Figure 1). The ESCs included two male lines (BG01 and WIBR1) and four female lines (BG03, WIBR2, WIBR3, and WIBR7), each derived from a different donor (Lengner et al., 2010Lengner C.J. Gimelbrant A.A.

Muffat J. et al.Derivation of pre-X inactivation human embryonic stem cells under physiological oxygen concentrations.Cell. 2010; 141: 872-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The iPSC lines were generated from human fibroblasts with a doxycycline-inducible reprogramming system with OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4 genes (Hockemeyer et al., 2008Hockemeyer D. Soldner F. Cook E.G.

Four of the iPSCs were derived from a female donor (iPS A1, iPS C1, iPS4, and iPS A6; described and characterized in Hockemeyer et al., 2008Hockemeyer D. Soldner F. Cook E.G. Gao Q. Mitalipova M.

All iPSC lines contained integrated transgenes, but were doxycycline independent for growth, indicating that transgene expression was not required for propagation of these pluripotent cells. The maps of histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were highly similar at protein-coding and noncoding genes in all 12 ESC and iPSC lines when examined by enrichment profiles (Figures 1A and 1C), heat maps (Figures 1B and 1D), or inspection of gene tracks (Figures 1E and 1F). Nucleosomes with H3K4me3 occurred at the vast majority of protein-coding genes in both ESCs and iPSCs (∼85%), with maximal enrichment occurring ∼200 bp downstream of transcriptional start sites (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1E; Table S1 available online). H3K4me3-modified nucleosomes also occupied the start sites of known and predicted noncoding RNAs in both cell types, which include ESC-specific RNAs associated with pluripotency (Marson et al., 2008Marson A. Levine S.S. Cole M.F. Frampton G.M. Brambrink T. Johnstone S. Guenther M.G. Johnston W.K. Wernig M. Newman J. et al.Connecting microRNA genes to the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 134: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar) (Table S1). H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes occurred primarily in the promoters of ∼2000 repressed genes, many of which encode key regulators of development (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1F; Table S1). H3K27me3 marked small domains (1–5 kb) within certain gene promoter regions and large domains extending across >100 kb of the HOX gene clusters. These results indicate that the genomes of human iPSCs possess the general features of Trx- and PcG-mediated histone modifications previously described in ESCs (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E.

Inspection of gene tracks revealed some variation in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 nucleosome occupancy among these cells lines, prompting us to systematically compare the sets of genes occupied by these histone modifications in each cell line with the set occupied in all other lines (Figure 2; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We first performed all pairwise comparisons among the ESC lines and found that 1.4% ± 0.8% of genes had different H3K4me3 occupancy and 5.5% ± 2.0% of genes had different H3K27me3 occupancy. Similarly, 0.7% ± 0.3% genes varied for H3K4me3 and 6.0% ± 2.6% varied for H3K27me3 among the iPSC lines. Pairwise comparison of ESC and iPSC lines revealed that the variation for H3K4me3- (1.3% ± 0.7%) and H3K27me3- (6.0% ± 2.4%) occupied genes was not significantly different from the variation observed within ESC lines or within iPSC lines. In contrast, comparisons of the genes enriched for H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 between pluripotent cells (ESCs and iPSCs) and adult fibroblast cells revealed significantly larger differences (12.3% ± 0.4% for H3K4me3; 67.8% ± 2.8% for H3K27me3) (Figure 2; Table S2). Thus, we observed no more variation between ESCs and iPSCs than was evident within the ESC lines or within the iPSC lines. We also examined the magnitude of the ChIP-Seq peaks associated with each gene and again found that differences between ESCs and iPSCs were no greater than the differences observed within ESC lines and within iPSC lines (Table S2). These results suggest that there were few, if any, consistent differences in the set of genes occupied by H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 between these human ESCs and iPSCs. We developed a statistical method (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) to scan the entire genome and identify regions with significant differential H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 occupancy between ESCs and iPSCs. To confirm the sensitivity and specificity of this method, we compared all male ESC and iPSC lines to all female ESC and iPSC lines and found a number of regions with significant differences in histone modifications, which were located almost exclusively on the sex chromosomes, as expected (Table S3). We then compared female ESCs to female iPSCs and found that iPSCs showed increased H3K27me3 occupancy relative to ESCs at several X-linked genes including Xist. We believe these differences in occupancy are likely a consequence of exposing female iPSCs to high oxygen conditions during derivation, since high oxygen growth conditions induce X-inactivation in human pluripotent cells (Lengner et al., 2010Lengner C.J. Gimelbrant A.A. Erwin J.A. Cheng A.W. Guenther M.G. Welstead G.G. Alagappan R. Frampton G.M. Xu P. Muffat J. et al.Derivation of pre-X inactivation human embryonic stem cells under physiological oxygen concentrations.Cell. 2010; 141: 872-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To further validate our ability to detect chromatin differences, we compared all pluripotent cells (ESCs and iPSCs) to donor fibroblasts and observed a large number of regions with differences in histone modifications (Table S3) that were strongly associated with differences in gene expression (Figures 2C and 2D). We then applied this method to identify statistically significant differences in chromatin structure between ESCs and iPSCs and found 50 genomic regions (29 genes) with differential H3K4me3 occupancy and four regions (two genes) with differential H3K27me3 occupancy (Table S3). These regions of differential occupancy represent a tiny fraction of the genome (0.003%), and although there was no obvious theme associated with them, we considered several possible causes for the differential modification. First, we investigated whether these differences were due to the presence of exogenous reprogramming factors in iPSCs, but there were no significant differences in these chromatin modifications between transgene-containing and transgene-excised iPSCs (Table S2; Soldner et al., 2009Soldner F. Hockemeyer D. Beard C. Gao Q. Bell G.W. Cook E.G. Hargus G. Blak A. Cooper O.

Second, we investigated whether the chromatin differences between ESCs and iPSCs were due to residual epigenetic signatures left from the parental fibroblast cell line, but found no evidence that iPSCs contain H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 signatures that reflect their cell of origin (Table S4). Lastly, we examined whether any gene expression changes were associated with differences in histone modification between ESCs and iPSCs, but found that this was not the case (Figure S1). We conclude that there are a small number of regions in these human ESCs and iPSCs that show differences in H3K4me3- and H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes. These differences involve a small fraction of the genome and have little or no influence on gene expression. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these small chromatin differences observed in undifferentiated cells may exert subtle effects on cells upon differentiation. Although the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 profiles of the human ESCs and iPSCs were nearly identical, we investigated the possibility that there were differences in the gene expression profiles between these ESCs and iPSCs. All 12 ESC and iPSC lines, in addition to donor fibroblast cells, were subjected to expression profiling and the data were analyzed with a single-factor analysis of variance for testing statistical significance with a Bayesian model of measurement error and a false discovery rate correction for multiple hypothesis testing (Sharov et al., 2005Sharov A.A.

A web-based tool for principal component and significance analysis of microarray data.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2548-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We found zero genes with statistically significant differential expression between ESCs and iPSCs using this method. To gain greater statistical power to identify small differences in transcript levels between ESCs and iPSCs, we included expression data sets from several additional ESC and iPSC lines that were not used in the chromatin studies and repeated the analysis. In this panel of 39 samples, we found only four genes with statistically significant differential expression between ESCs and iPSCs (Figures 3A and 3B; Table S5). These results are consistent with a study that shows the overall mRNA and microRNA expression patterns of isogenic mouse ESCs and iPSCs are nearly indistinguishable within the exception of a few transcripts on chromosome 12qF1 (Stadtfeld et al., 2010Stadtfeld M.

Here, we show that the apoptosis, which is of a nonanoikis type, is caused by ROCK-dependent hyperactivation of actomyosin and efficiently suppressed by the myosin inhibitor Blebbistatin. The actomyosin hyperactivation is triggered by the loss of E-cadherin-dependent intercellular contact and also observed in dissociated mouse epiblast-derived pluripotent cells but not in mESCs. We reveal that Abr, a unique Rho-GEF family factor containing a functional Rac-GAP domain, is an indispensable upstream regulator of the apoptosis and ROCK/myosin hyperactivation. Rho activation coupled with Rac inhibition is induced in hESCs upon dissociation, but not in Abr-depleted hESCs or mESCs. Furthermore, artificial Rho or ROCK activation with Rac inhibition restores the vulnerability of Abr-depleted hESCs to dissociation-induced apoptosis. Thus, the Abr-dependent ""Rho-high/Rac-low"" state plays a decisive role in initiating the dissociation-induced actomyosin hyperactivation and apoptosis in hESCs."

In the central nervous system (CNS), stem cells reside throughout life in the forebrain, continuing to generate neurons and glia in the subventricular zone (SVZ) surrounding the lateral ventricle and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Recent studies have highlighted two important niches within the adult SVZ. One is the apical ependymal niche, which consists of ciliated ependymal cells and intercalated GFAP+ astrocyte-like type B cells that line the lateral ventricle. The other is the basal vasculature niche, which consists of a rich plexus of blood vessels and associated laminin-rich basal lamina. Apical type B cells associated with the ependymal-lined ventricle send processes to the SVZ plexus blood vessels, suggesting that they can be influenced by both fluid compartments (Mirzadeh et al., 2008Mirzadeh Z.

During lineage progression, GFAP+ type B stem cells become activated and upregulate EGFR to become GFAP+EGFR+. These cells then produce GFAP−EGFR+ transit-amplifying type C cells (Pastrana et al., 2009Pastrana E. Cheng L.C. Doetsch F.

Rapidly dividing type C cells in turn give rise to type A neuroblasts, progenitors that divide as they migrate, usually in chains of cells. In the dorsal SVZ, neuroblast chains often run parallel with blood vessels aligned anterior-posterior in the direction of the rostral migratory stream (Shen et al., 2008Shen Q. Wang Y. Kokovay E.

The ability of stem cells to locate and occupy niches is essential for aspects of normal stem cell biology and for regenerative medicine. It has not been established whether NPCs have the capacity to home to their niche, as has been observed for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which home to niches within the bone marrow under physiological conditions and following transplantation. HSCs use a variety of molecules for homing. The chemokine SDF1 and its receptor CXCR4 are important for attracting HSCs out of the blood and into the bone marrow and for retention of cells within the bone marrow niche (Chute, 2006Chute J.P. Stem cell homing.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2006; 13: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Kaplan et al., 2007Kaplan R.N. Psaila B. Lyden D. Niche-to-niche migration of bone-marrow-derived cells.Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). SDF1 is secreted by the bone marrow stroma, creating a gradient that binds to CXCR4 expressed by HSCs. This causes actin polymerization and upregulation of integrins, resulting in chemotaxis toward the source of SDF1 (Kijowski et al., 2001Kijowski J. Baj-Krzyworzeka M. Majka M. Reca R. Marquez L.A.

It is tempting to suggest that there might be a parallel function for SDF1/CXCR in attracting CNS stem cells toward the vascular niche. SDF1/CXCR4 signaling has been implicated in various types of CNS cell migration. For instance, during development, SDF1 directs hippocampal dentate granule cells (Bagri et al., 2002Bagri A. Gurney T. He X. Zou Y.R. Littman D.R. Tessier-Lavigne M. Pleasure S.J.

Here, we investigated whether adult SVZ stem lineage cells are capable of homing to blood vessels after transplantation and the role of SDF1 in the process. We found that transplanted adult SVZ progenitor cells integrate into the host SVZ and migrate toward blood vessels, both in vitro and in vivo. We show that SVZ cells express CXCR4 and that the vascular plexus and ependymal cells express SDF1. Moreover, we demonstrated that homing to the blood vessels is CXCR4/SDF1 mediated. Importantly, SDF1 has a different effect on different stages of the lineage: SDF1 does not notably stimulate movement of EGFR−Glast+ type B cells, which include the more primitive, quiescent stem cells. In contrast, SDF1 significantly stimulates chemotaxis of activated type B and type C cells and their adhesion to endothelial cells. SDF1 treatment results in upregulation of α6 integrin, which we showed previously enhances binding of NPCs to the vascular niche (Shen et al., 2008Shen Q. Wang Y. Kokovay E. Lin G. Chuang S.M. Goderie S.K. Roysam B. Temple S. Adult SVZ stem cells lie in a vascular niche: A quantitative analysis of niche cell-cell interactions.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and upregulation of EGFR on cells that are already EGFR+. This suggests a mechanism by which SDF1 could stimulate stem cells to move from ependymal to vascular niches as they progress from quiescence to activation. Furthermore, SDF1 promotes motility of type A neuroblasts, but has much less effect on their α6 integrin levels, consistent with endothelial-derived SDF1 stimulating their migration to the olfactory bulb. Previously, we and others measured the relationship of normal SVZ lineage cells to the surface of endothelial cells of the SVZ plexus, helping to define and quantify the adult CNS vascular niche (Shen et al., 2008Shen Q. Wang Y. Kokovay E. Lin G. Chuang S.M. Goderie S.K. Roysam B. Temple S.

A specialized vascular niche for adult neural stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Approximately 47% of dividing type B cells and 46% of type C cells were found within 5 microns of the vasculature. In contrast type A cells tended to be further away from the blood vessel surface (only 14% are within 5 microns). Although migrating chains of neuroblasts, especially in the dorsal aspect of the SVZ, appeared to run along with aligned blood vessels, most of the neuroblasts were not as close to the endothelial surface as were dividing type B and type C cells. To establish how NPCs integrate into the SVZ after transplantation and specifically whether they home to the vasculature, we stereotaxically injected NPCs derived from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice (in which all cells are GFP+) into the SVZ of wild-type mice and measured their relationship to the closest endothelial cell surface. Three days after transplantation, the SVZ region was dissected out as a whole mount and stained for laminin for visualization of the blood vessels (Figure 1A ). Donor GFP+ NPC-derived cells were predominantly seen next to the SVZ vasculature, many with prominent processes touching the vessels (Figure 1C). Some transplanted NPCs aligned along vessels, exhibiting an elongated morphology with extended leading processes (Figure 1D). Most (52.5% ± 5.2%) GFP+ cells were within 5 μm of the vasculature, ∼17% were 5–20 μm away and 33.4% ± 15.5% were more than 20 μm away (n = 3 SVZs) (Figure 1B). Thus, transplanted NPCs find their way to the vasculature in vivo, consistent with their having the ability to home to this niche. In order to investigate the process in more detail, we developed an accessible, in vitro, 3D homing assay. Organotypic SVZ wholemounts were freshly dissected from the adult brain, as described (Doetsch and Alvarez-Buylla, 1996Doetsch F. Alvarez-Buylla A. Network of tangential pathways for neuronal migration in adult mammalian brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These were plated on transwell filters in serum-free slice culture medium containing FGF2. GFP+ NPCs were dissociated to single cells and gently overlaid on the whole mount 2 hr after plating in the transwell. After 16 hr, the whole mounts were fixed and stained for laminin so that the SVZ blood vessels could be revealed (Figure 2A ), the GFP+ cells were located and quantified, and their distance from the nearest blood vessel surface was measured. In order to determine whether this was a general phenomenon, or dependent on region or stage, we performed this experiment on a variety of different donor NPCs: (1) NPCs derived from the embryonic cerebral cortex and cocultured with endothelial cells for 10 days to enrich for NSCs (Shen et al., 2004Shen Q. Goderie S.K. Jin L. Karanth N. Sun Y. Abramova N. Vincent P. Pumiglia K. Temple S. Endothelial cells stimulate self-renewal and expand neurogenesis of neural stem cells.Science. 2004; 304: 1338-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B), (2) adult SVZ NPCs that had been grown for 7 days as neurospheres (Figures 2C and 2D) to enrich for SVZ progenitor cells, or (3) acutely dissociated NPCs from the adult SVZ, representing homotopic and homochronic transplantation (Figure 2E). In all cases, the NPCs invaded the whole mount and integrated widely. Interestingly, what appeared to be chains of transplanted NPCs were sometimes observed in the dorsal portion of the SVZ (Figure 2D), a region where endogenous neuroblast chains are prominent. Despite the varied NPC sources, as found in the in vivo experiments, they were consistently located close to blood vessels. Quantification of the distance of GFP+ NPCs from the vasculature revealed that 66% ± 7.6% were located within 5 μm of blood vessels, significantly more than non-GFP+ cells in the SVZ (24.8% ± 2.5% p < 0.001) (Figure 2F). When we flipped the whole mount and cultured it ependymal-side down on the transwell, overlaid NPCs cells were still able to enter from the parenchymal, striatal side and preferentially associate with blood vessels, indicating that they could migrate further and along different routes to this destination (not shown). We then went on to examine the molecular mechanism whereby NPCs were able to locate blood vessels. Because the chemokine SDF1 is involved in HSC homing to the bone marrow niche (Chute, 2006Chute J.P. Stem cell homing.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2006; 13: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, Kaplan et al., 2007Kaplan R.N. Psaila B. Lyden D.

Persistent production of neurons from adult brain stem cells during recovery after stroke.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), we identified SDF1 as a candidate. Immunohistochemistry of SVZ whole mounts and coronal sections revealed that SDF1 was expressed by the ependymal cells (Figures 3A and 3B) and by the vasculature (Figures 3C and 3D), two critical SVZ niches. Furthermore, cultured endothelial cells express SDF1 (Figure S1 available online). The SDF1 receptor CXCR4 was expressed on all stages of SVZ lineage cells—the type B, type C, and type A cells in vivo (Figure S2), and in 1 day in vitro (DIV) cultured SVZ progenitor cells (Figure 4). Importantly, we found that CXCR4 was visible on transplanted NPCs associated with the vasculature after homing into the whole mount (Figures 3E and 3E′). Thus, the ligand is enriched in the niche and adult SVZ NPCs express the receptor, consistent with the hypothesis that this ligand-receptor pair is involved in SVZ NPC homing. SDF1 can bind a second chemokine receptor, CXCR7. In adult rat brain, CXCR7 was not detectable in the SVZ by in situ hybridization (Schonemeier et al., 2008Schonemeier B. Kolodziej A. Schulz S.

Scale bars represent 25 μm. See also Figure S2. CXCR4 signaling can be blocked by the receptor antagonist AMD3100 (De Clercq, 2000De Clercq E. Inhibition of HIV infection by bicyclams, highly potent and specific CXCR4 antagonists.Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 833-839PubMed Google Scholar). Adding different concentrations of AMD3100 into the medium gave a dose-dependent reduction in the number of cells that penetrated the whole mounts (p = 0.0048) (Figures 5A and 5B). We tested whether this was due to AMD3100 treatment causing NPC death or reduced proliferation. After the homing assay, we found activated caspase3 + eGFP+ cells were extremely rare with or without the drug, and there was no significant difference in the proliferative marker Ki67 in infiltrated cells after treatment with AMD3100 or vehicle (29.90% ± 1.20% and 28.65% ± 0.35%, respectively). AMD3100 did not reduce cultured NPC survival or proliferation (Figure S3). Hence, rather than selective survival or proliferation, a more likely explanation is that NPC migration into the whole mount is CXCR4 dependent. To further test this, we added various concentrations of SDF1 to the cell suspensions before overlaying them, thus binding available CXCR4 and diminishing the SDF1 gradient in the whole mount. This resulted in significantly fewer cells entering the whole mount (p = 0.0010) (Figure 5C). To confirm this result using another method, we generated shRNA knockdown lentiviral constructs to reduce CXCR4 expression. Transduction of NPCs with shRNAs targeting the open reading frame (ORF) or the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) resulted in 58% and 32% reduction, respectively, of CXCR4 transcript level compared to cells transduced with the empty vector (EV) control construct, and CXCR4 protein was also significantly reduced (Figure S3). NPCs were transduced with CXCR4 shRNA or with EV control lentivirus, then overlaid on separate whole mounts. The percentage of cells homing to the vasculature was significantly reduced after receptor knockdown (45.4% ± 10.8% of control for the ORF shRNA and 44.5% ± 6.2% of control for the 3′ UTR shRNA) (Figure 5D), bolstering the evidence that SDF1/CXCR4 is critical for transplanted NPCs to migrate to blood vessels. These results show that when NPCs are transplanted into the SVZ in vivo or into isolated SVZ whole mounts, they find their way preferentially to blood vessels. The process by which this occurs could be via directed chemotaxis, in which case, the NPCs would move toward the vessels, for example following a chemoattractant gradient. Alternatively, the NPCs could move randomly within the tissue and simply stop moving once they contact the blood vessel surface and associated extracellular matrix, which is enriched for laminin. To test whether NPCs home toward secreted factors from endothelial cells in a directed manner, we used a modified Boyden Chamber assay that measures chemotaxis. In this assay, NPCs suspended in serum-free media are loaded on top of a porous membrane that separates the NPCs from a bottom chamber filled with test or control media. Cells will move into the bottom chamber in response to a chemotactic test agent (Figure 5E). We tested whether NPCs would chemotax toward endothelial conditioned medium or to various concentrations of SDF1. Endothelial cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 3 days, and the conditioned medium was collected, filtered, and used in the chemotaxis assay. NPCs were attracted by endothelial-conditioned media and this was effectively blocked by applying the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (Figure 5F). This indicates that SDF1/CXCR4 is largely responsible for the ability of SVZ NPCs to chemotax toward blood vessel endothelial cells. Confirming this, NPCs displayed dose-dependent chemotaxis toward an SDF1 gradient (Figure 5F). Furthermore, when we stereotaxically transplanted adult SVZ neurosphere-expanded cells transduced with shCXCR4 into the SVZ in vivo, we observed fewer cells closely associated with the vasculature in comparison to EV control transduced cells (p = 0.0041) (Figure 5G). We conclude that, like HSCs, adult SVZ progenitors are able to move toward sources of SDF1 in a CXCR4- dependent manner and that this is a key factor in endothelial cell recruitment of NPCs to blood vessels. Prior studies showed that activated type B and type C cells, which are characterized by high EGFR expression (Pastrana et al., 2009Pastrana E. Cheng L.C. Doetsch F. Simultaneous prospective purification of adult subventricular zone neural stem cells and their progeny.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 6387-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), are found close to endothelial cell surfaces (Shen et al., 2008Shen Q. Wang Y. Kokovay E. Lin G. Chuang S.M. Goderie S.K.

Hence, we wanted to distinguish whether different types of progenitors are more or less attracted toward SDF1 released from endothelial cells. After performing the in vitro chemotaxis assay, we characterized, on the basis of marker expression (Figure 6A ), which cells had been attracted toward the SDF1 or the endothelial cell conditioned medium. The total population of cells that labeled with GFAP or GLAST antibodies (which includes astrocytes and both quiescent and activated type B stem cells) (Bolteu"

Human ESCs exhibit basal-apical polarity, junctional complexes, integrin-dependent matrix adhesion, and E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion, all characteristics shared by the epiblast epithelium of the intact mammalian embryo. After disruption of epithelial structures, programmed cell death is commonly observed. If individualized human ESCs are prevented from reattaching and forming colonies, their viability is significantly reduced. Here, we show that actin-myosin contraction is a critical effector of the cell death response to human ESC dissociation. Inhibition of myosin heavy chain ATPase, downregulation of myosin heavy chain, and downregulation of myosin light chain all increase survival and cloning efficiency of individualized human ESCs. ROCK inhibition decreases phosphorylation of myosin light chain, suggesting that inhibition of actin-myosin contraction is also the mechanism through which ROCK inhibitors increase cloning efficiency of human ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2075743485,"In cycling tissues, adult stem cells may be lost and subsequently replaced to ensure homeostasis. To examine the frequency of stem cell replacement, we analyzed the population dynamics of labeled stem cells in steady-state mouse spermatogenesis. Our results show that spermatogenic stem cells are continuously replaced, on average within 2 weeks. The analysis exposes a simple and robust scaling behavior of clone size distributions that shows stem cell replacement to be stochastic, meaning that stem cells are equipotent and equally likely to be lost or to multiply to replace their neighbors, irrespective of their clonal history. The surprisingly fast rate of stem cell replacement is supported experimentally by 3D clone morphology and by live-imaging of spermatogonial migration. These results suggest that short-lived stem cells may be a common feature of mammalian stem cell systems and reveal a natural mechanism for matching the rates of cell proliferation and loss in tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2084865454,"Pluripotent stem cells derived from both embryonic and reprogrammed somatic cells have significant potential for human regenerative medicine. Despite similarities in developmental potential, however, several groups have found fundamental differences between embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines that may have important implications for iPSC-based medical therapies. Using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we further studied the genetic homogeneity of iPSC and ESC lines by reanalyzing microarray gene expression data from seven different laboratories. Unexpectedly, this analysis revealed a strong correlation between gene expression signatures and specific laboratories in both ESC and iPSC lines. Nearly one-third of the genes with lab-specific expression signatures are also differentially expressed between ESCs and iPSCs. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that in vitro microenvironmental context differentially impacts the gene expression signatures of both iPSCs and ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W1977239542,"The authors find that the homeobox gene Dbx1 controls the fate of glutamatergic neurons in the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) that are indispensable for the generation of the respiratory rhythm. Establishment of commissural connections between the halves of the preBötC, which is critical for synchronous discharge, requires Robo3 expression by these neurons. Breathing is a bilaterally synchronous behavior that relies on a respiratory rhythm generator located in the brainstem. An essential component of this generator is the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), which paces inspirations. Little is known about the developmental origin of the interneuronal populations forming the preBötC oscillator network. We found that the homeobox gene Dbx1 controls the fate of glutamatergic interneurons required for preBötC rhythm generation in the mouse embryo. We also found that a conditional inactivation in Dbx1-derived cells of the roundabout homolog 3 (Robo3) gene, which is necessary for axonal midline crossing, resulted in left-right de-synchronization of the preBötC oscillator. Together, these findings identify Dbx1-derived interneurons as the core rhythmogenic elements of the preBötC oscillator and indicate that Robo3-dependent guidance signaling in these cells is required for bilaterally synchronous activity."
https://openalex.org/W2151037856,"An outstanding biological question is why tissue regeneration in mammals is limited, whereas urodele amphibians and teleost fish regenerate major structures, largely by cell cycle reentry. Upon inactivation of Rb, proliferation of postmitotic urodele skeletal muscle is induced, whereas in mammalian muscle this mechanism does not exist. We postulated that a tumor suppressor present in mammals but absent in regenerative vertebrates, the Ink4a product ARF (alternative reading frame), is a regeneration suppressor. Concomitant inactivation of Arf and Rb led to mammalian muscle cell cycle reentry, loss of differentiation properties, and upregulation of cytokinetic machinery. Single postmitotic myocytes were isolated by laser micro-dissection-catapulting, and transient suppression of Arf and Rb yielded myoblast colonies that retained the ability to differentiate and fuse into myofibers upon transplantation in vivo. These results show that differentiation of mammalian cells is reversed by inactivation of Arf and Rb and support the hypothesis that Arf evolved at the expense of regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2116806091,"ZIP14 is a transmembrane metal ion transporter that is abundantly expressed in the liver, heart, and pancreas. Previous studies of HEK 293 cells and the hepatocyte cell lines AML12 and HepG2 established that ZIP14 mediates the uptake of non-transferrin-bound iron, a form of iron that appears in the plasma during pathologic iron overload. In this study we investigated the role of ZIP14 in the cellular assimilation of iron from transferrin, the circulating plasma protein that normally delivers iron to cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. We also determined the subcellular localization of ZIP14 in HepG2 cells.

Confocal microscopic analysis of these cells detected ZIP14 at the plasma membrane and in endosomes containing internalized transferrin. HepG2 cells in which endogenous ZIP14 was suppressed by siRNA assimilated 50% less iron from transferrin compared with controls. The uptake of transferrin, however, was unaffected. We also found that ZIP14 can mediate the transport of iron at pH 6.5, the pH at which iron dissociates from transferrin within the endosome.

IntroductionMost cells acquire iron from transferrin (TF), 2The abbreviations used are: TFtransferrinAAVadeno-associated virusDMT1divalent metal transporter 1EEA1early endosome antigen 1Fe-TFiron-transferrinNTBInon-transferrin-bound ironSFMserum-free mediumTBItransferrin-bound ironTFRtransferrin receptorZIP14ZRT/IRT-like protein 14. a circulating plasma protein that can carry up to two ferric (Fe3+) iron atoms. After Fe-TF binds to cell surface TF receptor 1 (TFR1), the plasma membrane invaginates into clathrin-coated pits, which internalize the Fe-TF·TFR1 complex into endosomes. Upon endosomal acidification, Fe3+ is released and subsequently reduced to Fe2+. The liberated Fe2+ is then transported across the endosomal membrane and into the cytosol (1Graham R.M. Chua A.C. Herbison C.E. Olynyk J.K. Trinder D. World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).The assimilation of iron from TF has been best characterized in developing erythroid cells, the most avid consumers of TF-bound iron (TBI). In these cells, reduction of Fe3+ is catalyzed by the oxidoreductase Steap3 (2Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. Greer E.L. Antiochos B. McDonald A. Chen J. Sharp J.J. Fujiwara Y. Barker J.E. Fleming M.D. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and iron transport out of the endosome is facilitated by the transmembrane protein divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) (3Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M.

Blood. 1998; 92: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, mice lacking either Steap3 or DMT1 cannot incorporate sufficient iron into developing erythrocytes and become anemic (2Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. Greer E.L. Antiochos B. McDonald A.

After the erythroid marrow, the second largest consumer of TBI is the liver, accounting for 10–20% of iron exchange with the plasma (5Cheney B.A. Lothe K. Morgan E.H. Sood S.K. Finch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1967; 212: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, anemic Steap3-mutant mice or DMT1-null mice are able to take up iron into the liver (6Gunshin H. Fujiwara Y. Custodio A.O. Direnzo C. Robine S. Andrews N.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 7Lambe T. Simpson R.J. Dawson S. Bouriez-Jones T. Crockford T.L.

Blood. 2009; 113: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), indicating that Steap3 and DMT1 are dispensable for hepatic iron uptake.Under normal conditions, >95% of plasma iron is TBI. Studies in perfused rat liver document that the liver takes up TBI, almost exclusively into hepatocytes (8Morgan E.H. Smith G.D. Peters T.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In iron overload conditions, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, the liver can also take up non-TF-bound iron (NTBI), a form of iron that appears in the plasma when the iron-carrying capacity of TF becomes exceeded (9Chua A.C. Olynyk J.K. Leedman P.J. Trinder D. Blood. 2004; 104: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The uptake of NTBI into hepatocyte cell lines is mediated, at least in part, by the transmembrane protein ZIP14, a member of the ZIP family of metal ion transporters (10Gao J. Zhao N. Knutson M.D. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21462-21468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Liuzzi J.P. Aydemir F. Nam H. Knutson M.D. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that expression of HFE, the hemochromatosis protein, in HepG2 cells decreased ZIP14 levels, apparently by decreasing ZIP14 stability (10Gao J. Zhao N. Knutson M.D. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21462-21468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Importantly, the reduction in ZIP14 was associated with not only a diminished uptake of NTBI but also a decrease in the assimilation of iron from TF, suggesting that ZIP14 participates in both pathways of iron acquisition. In the present study, we investigated the role of ZIP14 in the cellular assimilation of iron from TF, the pH dependence of ZIP14-mediated iron uptake, and the subcellular localization of endogenous ZIP14. We found that overexpression of ZIP14 increased the assimilation of iron from TF and enhanced cellular iron uptake at pH 7.5 and 6.5. Endogenous ZIP14 in HepG2 cells localized to the plasma membrane and partially co-localized with endosomes containing internalized Fe-TF. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous ZIP14 decreased the assimilation of iron from TF without decreasing the uptake of TF or the levels of TFR1. These results suggest that ZIP14 participates in the assimilation of iron from TF in addition to playing a role in NTBI uptake.DISCUSSIONZIP14 is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the solute carrier 39 (SLC39A) family, which includes 14 known mammalian members. ZIP14 was first characterized in 2005 by Taylor et al. (17Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Nicholson R.I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), who showed that ZIP14 overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stimulated the uptake of zinc into the cytosol. In 2006, Liuzzi et al. (11Liuzzi J.P. Aydemir F. Nam H. Knutson M.D. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of ZIP14 in HEK 293 cells and Sf9 insect cells enhanced not only the uptake of zinc, but also iron. The iron was presented to the cells as ferric citrate, the major form of NTBI that appears in plasma in conditions of iron overload (22Grootveld M. Bell J.D. Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. Bomford A. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4417-4422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, suppression of endogenous ZIP14 with siRNA in AML12 cells, a mouse hepatocyte cell line, resulted in reduced uptake of NTBI from ferric citrate. Subsequently, Gao et al. (10Gao J. Zhao N. Knutson M.D. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21462-21468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that ZIP14 overexpression stimulated NTBI uptake in HeLa cells and that suppression of endogenous ZIP14 in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, decreased NTBI uptake. Together, these data provide strong support that ZIP14 mediates NTBI uptake into cells (Fig. 8). A physiologic role for ZIP14 in NTBI uptake is suggested by the observation that human ZIP14 is expressed most abundantly in liver, heart, and pancreas (17Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Nicholson R.I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the tissues that preferentially accumulate iron in iron overload disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis.In addition to clearing NTBI rapidly, the liver readily takes up TBI and assimilates the iron (8Morgan E.H. Smith G.D. Peters T.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Studies in isolated primary mouse and rat hepatocytes have shown that TBI can inhibit the uptake of NTBI (and vice versa), suggesting that NTBI and TBI share a common membrane iron transporter (9Chua A.C. Olynyk J.K. Leedman P.J. Trinder D. Blood. 2004; 104: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 23Graham R.M. Morgan E.H. Baker E. Eur. J.

Our previous study in HepG2 cells suggested that ZIP14 may represent this common transporter. Specifically, we found that HFE expression resulted in a down-regulation of ZIP14 that was associated with reduced uptake and assimilation of iron when the iron was presented to the cells as either NTBI or TBI (10Gao J. Zhao N. Knutson M.D. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21462-21468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).In the present study we tested the hypothesis that ZIP14 plays a role in the assimilation of iron from TF. First, we found that transfection of HEK 293T cells with ZIP14 stimulated the assimilation of iron from TF. The enhanced assimilation of iron was not associated with changes in the levels of TFR1 or DMT1, which could also affect this process. These data suggest that ZIP14, rather than TFR1 or DMT1, is limiting for iron assimilation by this pathway in HEK 293T cells. That DMT1 is not limiting is further supported by the observation that the assimilation of iron from TF was unaffected in HEK 293T cells stably transfected with DMT1 (25Wetli H.A. Buckett P.D. Wessling-Resnick M. Chem. Biol. 2006; 13: 965-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A similar lack of an effect of DMT1 transfection on the assimilation of iron from TF has also been observed in CHO cells (26Zhang A.S. Canonne-Hergaux F. Gruenheid S. Gros P. Ponka P. Exp. Hematol. 2008; 36: 1227-1235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and in the human hepatoma cell line HLF (27Shindo M. Torimoto Y. Saito H. Motomura W. Ikuta K. Sato K. Fujimoto Y. Kohgo Y. Hepatol. Res. 2006; 35: 152-162PubMed Google Scholar).As in human liver, ZIP14 is abundantly expressed in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line that possesses many of the key features of hepatocytes (18Bokhari M. Carnachan R.J. Cameron N.R. Przyborski S.A. J. Anat. 2007; 211: 567-576PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes and hepatoma cells are known to take up Fe-TF by several mechanisms including a high affinity, low capacity TFR1-mediated endocytic pathway and a low affinity, high capacity TFR1-independent pathway (28Morgan E.H. Baker E. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2810-2816PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ikuta K. Zak O. Aisen P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 340-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Trinder D. Morgan E.H. Baker E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Trinder D. Zak O. Aisen P. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In primary mouse hepatocytes and HuH7 hepatoma cells, the TFR1-mediated pathway saturates at low TF concentrations between 50 and 100 nm (31Trinder D. Zak O. Aisen P. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Chua A.C. Herbison C.E. Drake S.F. Graham R.M. Olynyk J.K. Trinder D. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1737-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we document that in HepG2 cells incubated with 100 nm TF, knockdown of endogenous ZIP14-FLAG resulted in 45% less assimilation of iron from TF compared with controls. A similar decrement in iron assimilation from 100 nm TF was observed in wild-type HepG2 cells in which ZIP14 expression was suppressed (supplemental Fig. S1). These data provide strong support that ZIP14 plays a role in the assimilation of iron from TF, presumably through the high affinity, low capacity TFR1-mediated endocytic pathway (Fig. 8). Consistent with this possibility is the observation that endogenous ZIP14 in HepG2 cells partially co-localizes with endocytosed holo-TF, the early endosome marker EEA1, and TFR1. Moreover, ZIP14 is able to mediate the transport of iron at pH 6.5, the pH at which more than 50% of iron dissociates from TF in the endosome (33Núñez M.T. Gaete V. Watkins J.A. Glass J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6688-6692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).ZIP14 also partially co-localized with LAMP1, a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes, which usually have a pH of <6.0. Because ZIP14 does not appear to transport iron at pH 5.5, it seems unlikely that ZIP14 would function as an iron transporter in these more acidic organelles. A more effective transporter under lower pH conditions would be DMT1, which transports iron optimally at pH 5.5 (34Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar) and which localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes (35Tabuchi M. Yoshimori T. Yamaguchi K. Yoshida T. Kishi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22220-22228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Recently, Herbison et al. (36Herbison C.E. Thorstensen K. Chua A.C. Graham R.M. Leedman P. Olynyk J.K. Trinder D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 297: C1567-C1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showed that knockdown of TFR1 in HuH7 cells resulted in 80% less assimilation of iron from 50 nm TF compared with controls. The lower iron levels were due to diminished uptake of TF because TF uptake was also 80% lower. In our study, knockdown of ZIP14 in HepG2 cells did not affect the uptake of TF, but it did reduce the assimilation of iron from TF by 50%. These data indicate that ZIP14 is required for efficient cellular assimilation of iron from internalized TF.In humans, plasma TF concentrations typically range between 25 and 50 μm. Saturation of TF with iron normally fluctuates between 20 and 55%, but can reach 100% in iron overload. At physiologic concentrations of TF, hepatocytes can take up TBI via a TFR1-independent pathway (29Ikuta K. Zak O. Aisen P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 340-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Trinder D. Zak O. Aisen P. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Trinder D. Morgan E. Baker E. Hepatology. 1986; 6: 852-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in this pathway, however, remain poorly defined.The ability of ZIP14 to enhance the assimilation of iron from TF may be relevant to the hypoferremia (and anemia) of inflammation. In response to inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or turpentine, plasma iron levels rapidly decrease and hepatic iron levels increase (38Nemeth E. Rivera S. Gabayan V. Keller C. Taudorf S. Pedersen B.K. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 39Sheikh N. Dudas J. Ramadori G. Lab. Invest. 2007; 87: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The hypoferremia results predominantly from a blockade of iron release from reticuloendothelial macrophages, the main suppliers of iron to the plasma (40Knutson M. Wessling-Resnick M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 61-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because the liver houses the largest population of reticuloendothelial macrophages (i.e. Kupffer cells), hepatic iron levels increase. During inflammation, iron release is also reduced from hepatocytes, further elevating hepatic iron concentrations. Increased hepatic uptake of plasma iron, which is normally >95% TBI, may additionally contribute to the hypoferremia of inflammation. Studies in isolated rat hepatocytes have shown that LPS markedly increases the assimilation of iron from internalized TF (41Potter B.J. Blades B. McHugh T.A. Nunes R.M. Beloqui O. Slott P.A. Rand J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1989; 257: G524-G531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly in HepG2 cells, stimulation with the inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), enhanced the assimilation of iron from TF by 48% (42Hirayama M. Kohgo Y. Kondo H. Shintani N. Fujikawa K. Sasaki K. Kato J. Niitsu Y. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because LPS, turpentine, and IL-6 have all been shown to increase levels of ZIP14 potently in mouse liver and in isolated hepatocytes (19Liuzzi J.P. Lichten L.A. Rivera S. Blanchard R.K. Aydemir T.B. Knutson M.D. Ganz T. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6843-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), it is possible that ZIP14 contributes to the hypoferremia of inflammation by stimulating the assimilation of iron from plasma TF.Until now, DMT1 was the only transmembrane transport protein that has been proposed to participate in hepatocyte assimilation of iron from TF (1Graham R.M. Chua A.C. Herbison C.E. Olynyk J.K. Trinder D. World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Data from the present study suggest that ZIP14, which is expressed in HepG2 cells at 10 times higher levels than DMT1, participates in the assimilation of iron from TF. Future studies in whole animals will be needed to define the in vivo role of ZIP14 in iron uptake by the liver and other tissues/cell types. Of particular interest is the placenta, which has been shown to express ZIP14 (17Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Nicholson R.I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Placental iron transport involves endocytosis of TF from the maternal circulation and dissociation of iron from TF prior to export into the fetal circulation (43McArdle H.J. Andersen H.S. Jones H. Gambling L. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2008; 20: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The transport of iron out of the endosome in syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placenta was thought to be mediated by DMT1 (44Georgieff M.K. Wobken J.K. Welle J. Burdo J.R. Connor J.R. Placenta. 2000; 21: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), until the generation of DMT1 knock-out mice demonstrated that it was not required (6Gunshin H. Fujiwara Y. Custodio A.O. Direnzo C. Robine S. Andrews N.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). If ZIP14 localizes to endosomes in syncytiotrophoblast cells as it does in HepG2 cells, it seems plausible that ZIP14 plays a role in placental iron transfer. IntroductionMost cells acquire iron from transferrin (TF), 2The abbreviations used are: TFtransferrinAAVadeno-associated virusDMT1divalent metal transporter 1EEA1early endosome antigen 1Fe-TFiron-transferrinNTBInon-transferrin-bound ironSFMserum-free mediumTBItransferrin-bound ironTFRtransferrin receptorZIP14ZRT/IRT-like protein 14. a circulating plasma protein that can carry up to two ferric (Fe3+) iron atoms. After Fe-TF binds to cell surface TF receptor 1 (TFR1), the plasma membrane invaginates into clathrin-coated pits, which internalize the Fe-TF·TFR1 complex into endosomes. Upon endosomal acidification, Fe3+ is released and subsequently reduced to Fe2+. The liberated Fe2+ is then transported across the endosomal membrane and into the cytosol (1Graham R.M. Chua A.C. Herbison C.E. Olynyk J.K. Trinder D. World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).The assimilation of iron from TF has been best characterized in developing erythroid cells, the most avid consumers of TF-bound iron (TBI). In these cells, reduction of Fe3+ is catalyzed by the oxidoreductase Steap3 (2Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. Greer E.L. Antiochos B. McDonald A. Chen J. Sharp J.J. Fujiwara Y. Barker J.E. Fleming M.D. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and iron transport out of the endosome is facilitated by the transmembrane protein divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) (3Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 4Su M.A. Trenor C.C. Fleming J.C. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, mice lacking either Steap3 or DMT1 cannot incorporate sufficient iron into developing erythrocytes and become anemic (2Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. Greer E.L. Antiochos B. McDonald A. Chen J. Sharp J.J. Fujiwara Y. Barker J.E. Fleming M.D. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 3Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). After the erythroid marrow, the second largest consumer of TBI is the liver, accounting for 10–20% of iron exchange with the plasma (5Cheney B.A. Lothe K. Morgan E.H. Sood S.K. Finch C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1967; 212: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, anemic Steap3-mutant mice or DMT1-null mice are able to take up iron into the liver (6Gunshin H. Fujiwara Y. Custodio A.O. Direnzo C. Robine S. Andrews N.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 7Lambe T. Simpson R.J. Dawson S. Bouriez-Jones T. Crockford T.L. Lepherd M. Latunde-Dada G.O. Robinson H. Raja K.B. Campagna D.R. Villarreal Jr., G. Ellory J.C. Goodnow C.C. Fleming M.D. McKie A.T. Cornall R.J. Blood. 2009; 113: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), indicating that Steap3 and DMT1 are dispensable for hepatic iron uptake.Under normal conditions, >95% of plasma iron is TBI. Studies in perfused rat liver document that the liver takes up TBI, almost exclusively into hepatocytes (8Morgan E.H. Smith G.D. Peters T.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In iron overload conditions, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, the liver can also take up non-TF-bound iron (NTBI), a form of iron that appears in the plasma when the iron-carrying capacity of TF becomes exceeded (9Chua A.C. Olynyk J.K. Leedman P.J. Trinder D. Blood. 2004; 104: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The uptake of NTBI into hepatocyte cell lines is mediated, at least in part, by the transmembrane protein ZIP14, a member of the ZIP family of metal ion transporters (10Gao J. Zhao N. Knutson M.D. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21462-21468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Liuzzi J.P. Aydemir F. Nam H. Knutson M.D. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that expression of HFE, the hemochromatosis protein, in HepG2 cells decreased ZIP14 levels, apparently by decreasing ZIP14 stability (10Gao J. Zhao N. Knutson M.D. Enns C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21462-21468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Importantly, the reduction in ZIP14 was associated with not only a diminished uptake of NTBI but also a decrease in the assimilation of iron from TF, suggesting that ZIP14 participates in both pathways of iron acquisition. In the present study, we investigated the role of ZIP14 in the cellular assimilation of iron from TF, the pH dependence of ZIP14-mediated iron uptake, and the subcellular localization of endogenous ZIP14. We found that overexpression of ZIP14 increased the assimilation of iron from TF and enhanced cellular iron uptake at pH 7.5 and 6.5. Endogenous ZIP14 in HepG2 cells localized to the plasma membrane and partially co-localized with endosomes containing internalized Fe-TF. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous ZIP14 decreased the assimilation of iron from TF without decreasing the uptake of TF or the levels of TFR1. These results suggest that ZIP14 participates in the assimilation of iron from TF in addition to playing a role in NTBI uptake."

We have identified a pentatricopeptide repeat protein in a genetic screen for mutants resistant to inhibition of root growth by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis and consequently named BIR6 (BSO-insensitive roots 6). BIR6 is involved in splicing of intron 1 of the mitochondrial nad7 transcript. Loss-of-function mutations in BIR6 result in a strongly reduced accumulation of fully processed nad7 transcript. This affects assembly of Complex I and results in moderate growth retardation. In agreement with disruption of Complex I function, the genes encoding alternative NADH oxidizing enzymes are induced in the mutant, and the mutant plants are less sensitive to mannitol and salt stress. Mutation in the BIR6 gene allowed normal root growth in presence of BSO and strongly attenuated depletion of glutathione content at these conditions. The same phenotype was observed with other mutants affected in function of Complex I, thus reinforcing the importance of Complex I function for cellular redox homeostasis.

For the genetic screen, Col-0 seeds were treated with 0.5% ethane methyl sulfonate, and progeny from ∼600 plants were screened. Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and distributed on square MS-0.8% phytagel plates supplemented with 1.25 mm BSO, and after 48 h at 4 °C, the plates were placed vertically in a growth room under a cycle of 16 h of light/8 h of dark at a constant temperature of 20 °C, 60% relative humidity, and light intensity of 160 μmol m−2 s−1 for 7 days. Mature plants were grown in a controlled environment chamber under a cycle of 10 h of light/14 h of dark at a constant temperature of 22 °C for short day conditions or in light supplemented greenhouse at 16 h of light/8 h of dark for long days. The analysis of cysteine and GSH was performed exactly as described (29Koprivova A. North K.A. Kopriva S.

The RNA was extracted from 6-day-old seedlings grown in the presence of 1.25 mm BSO by phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) extraction and LiCl precipitation, treated with DNase I, and repurified using the Qiagen RNeasy plant mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeling, hybridization, and detection using three biological replicates of both wild type Col-0 and bir6-2 plants and the Arabidopsis Gene Expression Microarray v.4 chip (Agilent) were performed by Cogenics service. Only genes flagged by the scanner software as “present” in all three replicates of either genotype were included in further analysis. The expression data were normalized according to the AtGenExpress recommendations using a global mean normalization excluding the top and bottom 2% of the data. Additional quality control was introduced to remove the genes with the most variable expression from further consideration. Standard deviations across the three replicates for each genotype were determined, and genes with a standard deviation greater than 15% of the signal intensity were eliminated from further analysis. Fold changes in expression levels were calculated from the means of the three biological replicates, and their statistical significance was tested by the Cyber-T test (30Baldi P. Long A.D.

Oligonucleotide primers BIR6B1 (aaaaagcaggctccacattacacactctcgtc) and BIR6B2 (agaaagctgggtcagctgcagcaccaaagag) were designed to amplify a genomic DNA fragment including a 1,100-bp 5′-promoter region (to the end of the adjacent gene) and to terminate just before translational stop site of BIR6 to form a C-terminal translational fusion with GFP. The BIR6pro::BIR6 fragment was amplified by PCR from Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 genomic DNA using KOD plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The resultant fragment was cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Invitrogen) and fully sequenced. The fragment was introduced into pDONR207 donor vector and subsequently to pBin-GFP-C (a gift from J. Doonan, John Innes Centre) by Gateway® technology. For complementation of the mutant phenotype, the BIR6 was expressed under the control of its own promoter. The construct was prepared in the same way except that a primer BIR6CB2 (agaaagctgggtcaattgggtgacataatacc) was used instead of BIR6B2 to incorporate a stop codon between the BIR6 coding region and GFP. Arabidopsis transformation and selection was performed as described in Ref. 28Mugford S.G. Yoshimoto N. Reichelt M. Wirtz M. Hill L. Mugford S.T. Nakazato Y. Noji M. Takahashi H. Kramell R. Gigolashvili T. Flügge U.I. Wasternack C. Gershenzon J. Hell R. Saito K. Kopriva S. Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 910-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar. The increase in BIR6 transcript in the overexpressing lines was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Two lines with the highest BIR6 mRNA levels were selected for further analysis. To compare mRNA levels of alternative NADH oxidizing enzymes, total RNA was isolated by RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase I treatment as described by the manufacturer. First strand cDNA was synthesized using a oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II (Invitrogen) from 2 μg of total RNA. Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S1) and a SYBR Green I fluorescence-based assay kit (DyNAmo SYBR Green qPCR kit; Finnzymes). The PCR was performed using an Opticon 2 real time PCR machine (MJ Research) for 2 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles consisting of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 20 s at 72 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C, followed by a subsequent standard dissociation protocol to ensure that each amplicon was a single product. All of the quantifications were normalized to ubiquitin UBQ10. The RT-PCRs were performed in triplicate for each of the three independent samples. Arabidopsis plants were imaged on a Zeiss 510 meta laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany) using either ×10/0.45 air or ×63/1.2 water immersion objectives. The fluorescent z-stack of images of the plants was taken at 1024 × 1024 pixels (size, 1.16–0.04 μm2) with a 0.5–3-μm z step size. GFP was excited at 488 nm, emitted light was collected at 505–550 nm, and a transmitted light image was collected for reference. The ImageJ program was used to adjust image brightness, contrast, color merging, and maximum intensity projection of images from z sections. The first 300 bp of the coding sequence of BIR6 were amplified according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and the primers 5′-ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggcttcgaaggagatagaaccatgtacagatcaatggcaatcctg and 5′-ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtctccacctccggatccctccaatttcctcagaacgtaaat containing the attB sites for Gateway® cloning. The PCR product was cloned into the Gateway® pDONR207 vector using the Gateway® BP ClonaseTM enzyme mix (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. The entry clone and a Gateway® cloning cassette (pDest/pgem/CGFP; kindly provided by Prof Whelan) (33Carrie C. Kühn K. Murcha M.W. Duncan O. Small I.D. O'Toole N. Whelan J. Plant J. 2009; 57: 1128-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were used for LR recombination to clone the first 300 bp of BIR6 in frame with the coding region of the GFP. The mitochondrial targeting sequence of yeast Cox4 fused to mCherry in pBIN20 (34Nelson B.K. Cai X. Nebenfhr A. Plant J. 2007; 51: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar) was used as a mitochondrial control. The constructs were biolistically transformed into Arabidopsis cultured cells as previously described (35Thirkettle-Watts D. McCabe T.C. Clifton R. Moore C. Finnegan P.M. Day D.A. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1158-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In brief, the GFP and mCherry plasmids (5 μg each) were co-precipitated onto 1-μm gold particles and transformed using the biolistic PDS-1000/He system (Bio-Rad). Particles were bombarded onto 2 ml of Arabidopsis cultured cells resting on filter paper on osmoticum plates (2.17 g/liter Murashige and Skoog Modified Basal Salt Mixture, 30 g/liter sucrose, 0.5 mg/liter naphthalene acetic acid, 0.05 mg/liter kinetin, 36.44 g/liter mannitol). After bombardment, the cells were placed in the dark at 22 °C. Fluorescence images were obtained 24 h after transformation using an Olympus BX61 epifluorescence microscope with excitation wavelengths of 460/480 nm (GFP) and 535/555 nm (mCherry) and emission wavelengths of 495–540 nm (GFP) and 570–625 nm (mCherry) using CellR̂ imaging software. Arabidopsis seeds were germinated on soil and grown at 22 °C under an 8-h photoperiod for isolation of RNA. Leaf RNA was isolated using the plant RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse transcription step was performed on 3 μg of DNase-treated RNA (Ambion DNase; for 1 h at 37 °C), using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers as described before. To check whether we could detect the fully spliced NAD7 transcript in the bir6 mutants, RT-PCR was performed using primers designed to amplify between NAD7 exons 1 and 5. COX2 and actin 2–8 transcripts were used as controls for RNA quality (primer sequences in supplementary Table S2). To detect and quantify the splicing of mitochondrial mRNAs, primers were designed to amplify 100–200-bp regions spanning intron-exon regions (unspliced forms) and in exons (spliced forms) of each mitochondrial gene. The complete list of these primers is given in supplemental Table S3. Transcript levels of mitochondrial transcripts were determined using the primers listed in supplemental Table S4. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 SYBR GreenI Master Mix (Roche Applied Science) and a Roche LightCycler 480 real time PCR system with the following thermal cycling program: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. The data were analyzed using the LightCycler 480 software version 1.5 (Roche Applied Science). Mitochondria were isolated from 3-week-old seedlings grown hydroponically in half-strength MS medium, and Blue native (BN)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described (36de Longevialle A.F. Meyer E.H. Andrés C. Taylor N.L. Lurin C. Millar A.H. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Proteins separated by BN-PAGE were transferred onto PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) in cathode buffer for 15 h at 40 mA, using a Bio-Rad Mini transblot cell. The membrane was then destained with ethanol and restained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the complexes and subsequently destained before any further treatment. Immunodetection was performed using either an anti-NAD9 antibody (37Lamattina L. Gonzalez D. Gualberto J. Grienenberger J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) at a 1/50,000 dilution or an anti-NAD6 antibody at a 1/4,000 dilution, followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1/10,000 dilution) and subsequently revealed using ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). The anti-NAD6 antibody was raised in rabbit by Auspep Pty. Ltd. (Parkville, Australia) using an 18-mer synthetic peptide from the plant-specific C-terminal hydrophilic part of NAD6 (KVKRQDVFRRNAIDFRRTIMRRT), linked to the diphtheria toxoid. We performed a genetic screen to isolate mutants tolerant to inhibition of root growth by BSO (25Vernoux T. Wilson R.C. Seeley K.A. Reichheld J.P. Muroy S. Brown S. Maughan S.C. Cobbett C.S.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2331-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Among the 10 bir mutants isolated, we chose the bir6 mutant for further analysis because, apart from maintaining normal root growth on BSO plates, the plants were significantly smaller than WT. High resolution mapping was used to identify the BIR6 gene as At3g48250. Sequencing the gene revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 746 after the ATG, resulting in a change of Trp-248 into a premature stop codon (Fig. 1). The gene encodes a member of a PPR protein family. BIR6 is a relatively small member of the family containing eight repeats of the pentatricopeptide motif (Fig. 1B). To verify that the phenotype is caused by this mutation, we obtained two T-DNA insertion alleles of bir6. The T-DNA lines SALK_000310 (bir6-2; Col-0 background) (38Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N.

Pelletier G. Caboche M. Lecharny A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) contain T-DNA insertions in the BIR6 coding region (Fig. 1A). BSO does not inhibit root growth of bir6-2 (Fig. 1C) and bir6-3 (not shown) to the same extent as Col-0, similar to the original bir6 mutant (from now on denoted as bir6-1). To complement the bir6-1 mutant, we transformed it with a construct containing the BIR6 open reading frame under control of the native promoter. The roots of the complemented mutants were inhibited by BSO to the same extent as in WT plants (Fig. 1C). Apart from the BSO-insensitive roots phenotype, the bir6-1 mutants, as well as both T-DNA mutants, were significantly smaller after 5 weeks with short days than corresponding WT plants (Fig. 1D). This phenotype was correlated with a lack of BIR6 transcript in leaves of the bir6-2 and bir6-3 plants (Fig. 1E). The premature stop codon in bir6-1 also resulted in a strong reduction of BIR6 mRNA levels, probably because of the degradation of the transcript through the nonsense mediated decay pathway (40Kerényi Z. Mérai Z. Hiripi L. Benkovics A. Gyula P. Lacomme C. Barta E. Nagy F. Silhavy D. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because the phenotype of bir6-2 and bir6-1 was identical, and the original mutant was derived from EMS mutagenesis and could carry other mutations, we performed most other experiments with bir6-2. To find out the molecular function of BIR6, we analyzed Col-0 plants expressing BIR6 fused to GFP by confocal microscopy. The GFP signal (driven by the BIR6 promoter) was strong in all cells of shoots and roots of young seedlings, pointing to constitutive expression of the gene (supplemental Fig. S2, A–F). On a subcellular level, the GFP signal was localized to mitochondria of shoot and root cells (supplemental Fig. S2, G–L). To confirm the targeting of BIR6 to mitochondria, the BIR6::GFP construct was transfected into Arabidopsis cells together with a mitochondrial marker, COX4 fused to red fluorescent protein (Fig. 2). The overlay of the green and red fluorescence clearly shows that BIR6 is localized exclusively in the mitochondria. To identify metabolic processes affected by the bir6 mutation, we performed a microarray analysis with bir6-2 and Col-0 seedlings grown for 6 days in the presence of BSO. However, despite the growth phenotype of the bir6-2 plants, only 32 genes were found to be differentially expressed (fold change threshold, 2-fold; q value threshold, 0.05). Of these, 16 genes were more highly expressed in bir6-2, and 16 were more highly expressed in the WT (supplemental Table S5). None of these genes, however, pointed to specific defects in the mutant that would explain the phenotype. Iterative group analysis using the Aracyc classification of metabolic pathways revealed several pathways and enzyme activities up-regulated in bir6-2, such as indole-3-acetic acid synthesis, glyoxylate cycle, cyanate degradation, and most importantly alternative oxidase (supplemental Tables S6 and S8) as well as pathways down-regulated in bir6-2 (supplemental Tables S7 and S9). Among the up-regulated genes in the microarray analysis was an NADH oxidizing enzyme, NADH dehydrogenase (NDB3). Indeed, the transcript levels of two genes each from the families of alternative oxidases, AOX1A and AOX1B, and NADH dehydrogenases, NDB3 and NDB4, were higher in bir6-2 than in Col-0 as determined by quantitative PCR (Fig. 3). Three of the genes were induced by BSO in Col-0. Because genes corresponding to these two families are often induced in mutants in mitochondrial respiration, specifically Complex I (19Sabar M. De Paepe R. de Kouchkovsky Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 36de Longevialle A.F. Meyer E.H. Andrés C. Taylor N.L. Lurin C. Millar A.H. Small I.D. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we deduced that BIR6 might be functionally linked to mitochondrial respiratory Complex I. We analyzed the entire bir6-2 mitochondrial transcriptome for alterations in RNA abundance by RT-qPCR (supplemental Fig. S3). No obviously significant departures from wild type levels were observed. Such analyses, however, do not exclude alterations in RNA splicing because they do not differentiate between spliced and unspliced transcripts. Hence we also specifically examined splicing of the 23 introns in mitochondrial mRNAs from all three bir6 mutants (Fig. 4A). The results show a clear defect in splicing of nad7 intron 1 that disappears when the wild type BIR6 gene was reintroduced into bir6-1. nad7 is composed of five exons and four introns, which are cis-spliced (Fig. 4B). The splicing of the other three nad7 introns appears unaffected in bir6 mutants, and indeed none of the other mitochondrial splicing events are drastically altered in all three bir6 mutant alleles. The defect in nad7 splicing, a"

Because no bone formation occurs in Osx-null mice, Osterix is thought to be an essential regulator of osteoblast differentiation. We report that, in several mesenchymal and osteoblastic cell types, BMP-2 induces an increase in expression of the two isoforms of Osterix arising from two alternative promoters. We identified a consensus Sp1 sequence (GGGCGG) as Osterix binding regions in the fibromodulin and the bone sialoprotein promoters in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that Osterix is a novel substrate for p38 MAPK in vitro and in vivo and that Ser-73 and Ser-77 are the regulatory sites phosphorylated by p38. Our data also demonstrate that Osterix is able to increase recruitment of p300 and Brg1 to the promoters of its target genes fibromodulin and bone sialoprotein in vivo and that it directly associates with these cofactors through protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation of Osterix at Ser-73/77 increased its ability to recruit p300 and SWI/SNF to either fibromodulin or bone sialoprotein promoters. We therefore propose that Osterix binds to Sp1 sequences on target gene promoters and that its phosphorylation by p38 enhances recruitment of coactivators to form transcriptionally active complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2048438540,"Proteins found in the root exudates are thought to play a role in the interactions between plants and soil organisms. To gain a better understanding of protein secretion by roots, we conducted a systematic proteomic analysis of the root exudates of Arabidopsis thaliana at different plant developmental stages. In total, we identified 111 proteins secreted by roots, the majority of which were exuded constitutively during all stages of development. However, defense-related proteins such as chitinases, glucanases, myrosinases, and others showed enhanced secretion during flowering. Defense-impaired mutants npr1-1 and NahG showed lower levels of secretion of defense proteins at flowering compared with the wild type. The flowering-defective mutants fca-1, stm-4, and co-1 showed almost undetectable levels of defense proteins in their root exudates at similar time points. In contrast, root secretions of defense-enhanced cpr5-2 mutants showed higher levels of defense proteins. The proteomics data were positively correlated with enzymatic activity assays for defense proteins and with in silico gene expression analysis of genes specifically expressed in roots of Arabidopsis. In conclusion, our results show a clear correlation between defense-related proteins secreted by roots and flowering time."
https://openalex.org/W2067645873,"We have crossed ERp57(flx/flx) mice with commercially available mice expressing villin-driven cre-recombinase. Lysates of intestinal epithelial cells were prepared from knock-out (KO) mice and littermates (LM) and used in Western blot analyses with Ab099 against the N terminus of the 1,25D(3)-MARRS (membrane-associated, rapid response steroid-binding) receptor: LM mice exhibited one positive band, which was absent in preparations from KO mice. Saturation analyses of cell lysates with [(3)H]1,25D(3) revealed negligible binding in preparations from either female or male KOs. Lysates from female and male LM mice had similar affinities but different numbers of binding sites. Isolated enterocytes were tested for steroid-stimulated calcium uptake. Treatment of cells from female or male LM mice with 1,25D(3) elicited enhanced calcium uptake in females and males within 5 min. Intestinal cells from KO mice exhibited a severely blunted or completely absent response to hormone. Confocal microscopy of intestinal cells revealed the presence of cell surface vitamin D receptors. However, antibodies to the vitamin D receptor failed to block 1,25D(3)-stimulated calcium uptake. In chick enterocytes we have found that the PKA pathway mediates calcium uptake. The time course for activation of PKA in mouse enterocytes paralleled that for enhanced calcium uptake and for LM females reached 250% of controls within 5 min, and 150% of controls in cells prepared from LM males. Enterocytes from female or male KO mice failed to exhibit steroid hormone-stimulated PKA activity, but did respond to forskolin with enhanced calcium uptake. We conclude that the 1,25D(3)-MARRS receptor is of central importance to steroid hormone-stimulated calcium uptake in mammalian intestinal cells."

Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2485) Google Scholar). There are two major pathways leading to NF-κB activation. The canonical pathway requires IκB kinase (IKK) 2The abbreviations used are: IKKIκB kinaseNIKNF-κB-inducing kinaseZnFzinc fingeraaamino acidsUbubiquitin. complex, consisting of IKKα/β/γ, whose activation results in the phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB proteins and the nuclear translocation of p50-containing NF-κB complex (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). The noncanonical pathway requires NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which cooperates with IKKα to induce NF-κB2 (p100) processing to p52, thereby resulting in translocation of the p52-RelB complex to the nucleus (1Vallabhapurapu S.

We here demonstrate that ZFP91 is an atypical E3 ligase activating NIK via Lys63-linked ubiquitination in the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONAlthough mounting evidence suggests that Lys63-linked ubiquitination plays a key role in the activation of protein kinases in multiple pathways leading to NF-κB activation (14Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 15Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it has not been known whether Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK is important for NIK activation. This study may provide an answer to the question of how noncanonical NF-κB signaling is activated via Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK. We demonstrated for the first time the molecular function of a novel E3 ligase ZFP91: the stabilization and activation of NIK via conjugation of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains. It is of note that, despite the absence of a known E3 ligase domain, ZFP91 efficiently catalyzed non-degradative Lys63-linked ubiquitination with a specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc13.The E3 ligases are critical components that are needed to determine the enzymatic specificity in the ubiquitin cascade as a result of direct interaction with substrates (31Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). E3 ligases can generally be classified into two families: RING-type E3 ligases and HECT-type E3 ligases (23Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. Annu. Rev.

A20 is a protein that contains an N-terminal ovarian tumor domain and novel ZnF domains in the C-terminal portion of the protein, which mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzyme to the substrate (18Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Comparable with A20 composed of seven consecutive ZnF domains, the ZFP91 is also a ZnF protein having consecutive five ZnF domains. We obtained substantive evidence that ZFP91 functions as an E3 ligase of NIK. The evidence is noted as follows: 1) ZFP91 and NIK form a stable complex, 2) ZFP91 catalyzes NIK ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro, and 3) the enzymatic activity is dependent on active site cysteines in the ZnF domain as demonstrated in the A20 (18Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Therefore, NIK might be a physiological substrate for the ZFP91 E3 ligase.Our findings suggest that Ubc13 is required for the activation of noncanonical NF-κB by ZFP91-mediated Lys63 ubiquitination of NIK. It has previously been shown that Ubc13 is dispensable for IL-1- and TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation in Ubc13-deficient MEF cells, and processing of p100 to p52 was normal in Ubc13-deficient B cells stimulated with CD154 and BAFF (32Yamamoto M. Okamoto T. Takeda K. Sato S. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Saitoh T. Yamamoto N. Sakurai H. Ishii K.J. Yamaoka S. Kawai T. Matsuura Y. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ubc13 is essential for Tax-linked Lys63 ubiquitination and subsequent activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway in Ubc13-deficient MEF cells (33Shembade N. Harhaj N.S. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Harhaj E.W. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 13735-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms used by ZFP91 to activate noncanonical NF-κB are similar with the Tax. In ZFP91-mediated noncanonical NF-κB activation, the role of Ubc13 is to facilitate Lys63-linked ubiquitination of ZFP91 (Fig. 5, A–C), which in turn mediates the ubiquitination of NIK (Fig. 5D) and activates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway.NIK was originally identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase interacting with TRAF2 (34Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of both aly/aly mice, which harbor a NIK-inactivating mutation, and Nik−/− mice revealed that NIK is mainly involved in activation of the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway (35Yin L.

It is well documented that TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 form an E3 ligase complex, and importantly, in this complex, cIAP1/2 act as Lys48-specific E3 ligases in the negative regulation of NIK and noncanonical NF-κB activation (21Vallabhapurapu S.

These results could raise the question of whether ZFP91 regulates cIAP1/2 and TRAF2 E3 ligase activity to influence Lys48-linked ubiquitination of NIK. We showed, however, that ZFP91 did not inhibit TRAF2 and cIAP1 E3 ligase activity (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 and 3). In addition, the fact that TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 catalyze Lys63-linked ubiquitination (21Vallabhapurapu S. Matsuzawa A. Zhang W. Tseng P.H. Keats J.J. Wang H. Vignali D.A. Bergsagel P.L. Karin M. Nat.

Chem. 2004; 279: 33185-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) could also raise the possibility that the TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 ubiquitin ligase complex may be responsible for the Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK. However, TRAF2 and cIAP1 did not induce Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK (Fig. 4D, lane 6) and did not alter the Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK by ZFP91 (Fig. 4D, lanes 7 and 8). These results indicated that NIK is regulated not only in its stabilization via dissociation of the NIK-TRAF3-TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complex but also in its activation via Lys63-linked ubiquitination.This study also uncovered that Lys63-specific ubiquitination is linked to the phosphorylation at Thr559 in the activation loop of NIK. The association of ubiquitination with the phosphorylation of protein kinase is not unprecedented in protein kinase activation. For example, the activation of MEKK1 coincides with ubiquitination and phosphorylation (41Gallagher E. Enzler T. Matsuzawa A. Anzelon-Mills A. Otero D. Holzer R. Janssen E. Gao M. Karin M. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, TAK1 is activated by unanchored Lys63-specific ubiquitin chains (42Xia Z.P. Sun L. Chen X. Pineda G. Jiang X. Adhikari A. Zeng W. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2009; 461: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that Lys63-linked ubiquitination of IL-1β receptor-associated kinase 1 is critical for IKK activation (43Windheim M. Stafford M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our results also suggest that the dominant negative function of NIK mutants K429A/K430A and T559A (4Lin X. Mu Y. Cunningham Jr., E.T. Marcu K.B. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) could be at least in part associated with their incapability to be ubiquitinated by ZFP91. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular relationship between Lys63-linked ubiquitination and activation of NIK.Collectively, our current studies explore the mechanism by which ZFP91 induces noncanonical NF-κB activation through the ZFP91-mediated Lys63-ubiquitination of NIK. These studies also suggest that ZFP91 may have a role in the pathophysiology of the NIK-driven immune system in a variety of diseases. IntroductionThe transcription factor NF-κB plays a central role in immune responses, development, and cell proliferation (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev.

The canonical pathway requires IκB kinase (IKK) 2The abbreviations used are: IKKIκB kinaseNIKNF-κB-inducing kinaseZnFzinc fingeraaamino acidsUbubiquitin. complex, consisting of IKKα/β/γ, whose activation results in the phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB proteins and the nuclear translocation of p50-containing NF-κB complex (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). The noncanonical pathway requires NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which cooperates with IKKα to induce NF-κB2 (p100) processing to p52, thereby resulting in translocation of the p52-RelB complex to the nucleus (1Vallabhapurapu S.

Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5899-5907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then activates IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates p100 for proteasome-dependent processing to p52 (5Xiao G. Rabson A.B. Young W. Qing G. Qu Z. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).

In this study, a cDNA microarray analysis with a diterpenoid kamebakaurin, which specifically inhibits DNA binding by the p50 subunit of NF-κB complex (16Lee J.H. Koo T.H. Hwang B.Y. Lee J.J. J. Biol.

We here demonstrate that ZFP91 is an atypical E3 ligase activating NIK via Lys63-linked ubiquitination in the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. DISCUSSIONAlthough mounting evidence suggests that Lys63-linked ubiquitination plays a key role in the activation of protein kinases in multiple pathways leading to NF-κB activation (14Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 15Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it has not been known whether Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK is important for NIK activation. This study may provide an answer to the question of how noncanonical NF-κB signaling is activated via Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK. We demonstrated for the first time the molecular function of a novel E3 ligase ZFP91: the stabilization and activation of NIK via conjugation of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains. It is of note that, despite the absence of a known E3 ligase domain, ZFP91 efficiently catalyzed non-degradative Lys63-linked ubiquitination with a specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc13.The E3 ligases are critical components that are needed to determine the enzymatic specificity in the ubiquitin cascade as a result of direct interaction with substrates (31Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). E3 ligases can generally be classified into two families: RING-type E3 ligases and HECT-type E3 ligases (23Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar, 24Bernassola F. Karin M. Ciechanover A. Melino G. Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 10-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Additionally, the A20-type ZnF represents a novel class of E3 ligases. A20 is a protein that contains an N-terminal ovarian tumor domain and novel ZnF domains in the C-terminal portion of the protein, which mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzyme to the substrate (18Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Comparable with A20 composed of seven consecutive ZnF domains, the ZFP91 is also a ZnF protein having consecutive five ZnF domains. We obtained substantive evidence that ZFP91 functions as an E3 ligase of NIK. The evidence is noted as follows: 1) ZFP91 and NIK form a stable complex, 2) ZFP91 catalyzes NIK ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro, and 3) the enzymatic activity is dependent on active site cysteines in the ZnF domain as demonstrated in the A20 (18Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Therefore, NIK might be a physiological substrate for the ZFP91 E3 ligase.Our findings suggest that Ubc13 is required for the activation of noncanonical NF-κB by ZFP91-mediated Lys63 ubiquitination of NIK. It has previously been shown that Ubc13 is dispensable for IL-1- and TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation in Ubc13-deficient MEF cells, and processing of p100 to p52 was normal in Ubc13-deficient B cells stimulated with CD154 and BAFF (32Yamamoto M. Okamoto T. Takeda K. Sato S. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Saitoh T. Yamamoto N. Sakurai H. Ishii K.J. Yamaoka S. Kawai T. Matsuura Y. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ubc13 is essential for Tax-linked Lys63 ubiquitination and subsequent activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway in Ubc13-deficient MEF cells (33Shembade N. Harhaj N.S.

Thus, the mechanisms used by ZFP91 to activate noncanonical NF-κB are similar with the Tax. In ZFP91-mediated noncanonical NF-κB activation, the role of Ubc13 is to facilitate Lys63-linked ubiquitination of ZFP91 (Fig. 5, A–C), which in turn mediates the ubiquitination of NIK (Fig. 5D) and activates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway.NIK was originally identified as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase interacting with TRAF2 (34Malinin N.L.

However, TRAF2 and cIAP1 did not induce Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK (Fig. 4D, lane 6) and did not alter the Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK by ZFP91 (Fig. 4D, lanes 7 and 8). These results indicated that NIK is regulated not only in its stabilization via dissociation of the NIK-TRAF3-TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complex but also in its activation via Lys63-linked ubiquitination.This study also uncovered that Lys63-specific ubiquitination is linked to the phosphorylation at Thr559 in the activation loop of NIK. The association of ubiquitination with the phosphorylation of protein kinase is not unprecedented in protein kinase activation. For example, the activation of MEKK1 coincides with ubiquitination and phosphorylation (41Gallagher E. Enzler T. Matsuzawa A. Anzelon-Mills A. Otero D. Holzer R. Janssen E. Gao M. Karin M. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, TAK1 is activated by unanchored Lys63-specific ubiquitin chains (42Xia Z.P. Sun L. Chen X. Pineda G. Jiang X. Adhikari A. Zeng W. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2009; 461: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that Lys63-linked ubiquitination of IL-1β receptor-associated kinase 1 is critical for IKK activation (43Windheim M. Stafford M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our results also suggest that the dominant negative function of NIK mutants K429A/K430A and T559A (4Lin X. Mu Y.

Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar) could be at least in part associated with their incapability to be ubiquitinated by ZFP91. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular relationship between Lys63-linked ubiquitination and activation of NIK.Collectively, our current studies explore the mechanism by which ZFP91 induces noncanonical NF-κB activation through the ZFP91-mediated Lys63-ubiquitination of NIK. These studies also suggest that ZFP91 may have a role in the pathophysiology of the NIK-driven immune system in a variety of diseases. Although mounting evidence suggests that Lys63-linked ubiquitination plays a key role in the activation of protein kinases in multiple pathways leading to NF-κB activation (14Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 15Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it has not been known whether Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK is important for NIK activation. This study may provide an answer to the question of how noncanonical NF-κB signaling is activated via Lys63-linked ubiquitination of NIK. We demonstrated for the first time the molecular function of a novel E3 ligase ZFP91: the stabilization and activation of NIK via conjugation of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains. It is of note that, despite the absence of a known E3 ligase domain, ZFP91 efficiently catalyzed non-degradative Lys63-linked ubiquitination with a specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc13. The E3 ligases are critical components that are needed to determine the enzymatic specificity in the ubiquitin cascade as a result of direct interaction with substrates (31Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). E3 ligases can generally be classified into two families: RING-type E3 ligases and HECT-type E3 ligases (23Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar, 24Bernassola F. Karin M. Ciechanover A. Melino G. Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 10-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Additionally, the A20-type ZnF represents a novel class of E3 ligases. A20 is a protein that contains an N-terminal ovarian tumor domain and novel ZnF domains in the C-terminal portion of the protein, which mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzyme to the substrate (18Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Comparable with A20 composed of seven consecutive ZnF domains, the ZFP91 is also a ZnF protein having consecutive five ZnF domains. We obtained substantive evidence that ZFP91 functions as an E3 ligase of NIK. The evidence is noted as follows: 1) ZFP91 and NIK form a stable complex, 2) ZFP91 catalyzes NIK ubiquitination in vivo and in vitro, and 3) the enzymatic activity is dependent on active site cysteines in the ZnF domain as demonstrated in the A20 (18Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Therefore, NIK might be a physiological substrate for the ZFP91 E3 ligase. Our findings suggest that Ubc13 is required for the activation of noncanonical NF-κB by ZFP91-mediated Lys63 ubiquitination of NIK. It has previously been shown that Ubc13 is dispensable for IL-1- and TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation in Ubc13-deficient MEF cells, and processing of p100 to p52 was normal in Ubc13-deficient B cells stimulated with CD154 and BAFF (32Yamamoto M. Okamoto T. Takeda K. Sato S. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Saitoh T. Yamamoto N. Sakurai H. Ishii K.J. Yamaoka S. Kawai T. Matsuura Y. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ubc13 is essential for Tax-linked Lys63 ubiquitination and subsequent activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway in Ubc13-deficient MEF cells (33Shembade N. Harhaj N.S. Yamamoto M. Akira S. Harhaj E.W. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 13735-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2045278366,"Ecm29 is a 200-kDa HEAT repeat protein that binds the 26 S proteasome. Genome-wide two-hybrid screens and mass spectrometry have identified molecular motors, endosomal components, and ubiquitin-proteasome factors as Ecm29-interacting proteins. The C-terminal half of human Ecm29 binds myosins and kinesins; its N-terminal region binds the endocytic proteins, Vps11, Rab11-FIP4, and rabaptin. Whereas full-length FLAG-Ecm29, its C-terminal half, and a small central fragment of Ecm29 remain bound to glycerol-gradient-separated 26 S proteasomes, the N-terminal half of Ecm29 does not. Confocal microscopy showed that Ecm-26 S proteasomes are present on flotillin-positive endosomes, but they are virtually absent from caveolin- and clathrin-decorated endosomes. Expression of the small central fragment of Ecm29 markedly reduces proteasome association with flotillin-positive endosomes. Identification of regions within Ecm29 capable of binding molecular motors, endosomal proteins, and the 26 S proteasome supports the hypothesis that Ecm29 serves as an adaptor for coupling 26 S proteasomes to specific cellular compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2058024663,"Integrin-growth factor receptor cross-talk plays a role in growth factor signaling, but the specifics are unclear. In a current model, integrins and growth factor receptors independently bind to their ligands (extracellular matrix and growth factors, respectively). We discovered that neuregulin-1 (NRG1), either as an isolated EGF-like domain or as a native multi-domain form, binds to integrins αvβ3 (with a K(D) of 1.36 × 10(-7) m) and α6β4. Docking simulation predicted that three Lys residues at positions 180, 184, and 186 of the EGF-like domain are involved in integrin binding. Mutating these residues to Glu individually or in combination markedly suppressed integrin binding and ErbB3 phosphorylation. Mutating all three Lys residues to Glu (the 3KE mutation) did not affect the ability of NRG1 to bind to ErbB3 but markedly reduced the ability of NRG1 to induce ErbB3 phosphorylation and AKT and Erk1/2 activation in MCF-7 and T47D human breast cancer cells. This suggests that direct integrin binding to NRG1 is critical for NRG1/ErbB signaling. Notably, stimulation of cells with WT NRG1 induced co-precipitation of ErbB3 with α6β4 and with αvβ3 to a much lower extent. This suggests that WT NRG1 induces integrin-NRG1-ErbB3 ternary complex formation. In contrast, the 3KE mutant was much less effective in inducing ternary complex formation than WT NRG1, suggesting that this process depends on the ability of NRG1 to bind to integrins. These results suggest that direct NRG1-integrin interaction mediates integrin-ErbB cross-talk and that α6β4 plays a major role in NRG-ErbB signaling in these cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2094294016,"Alzheimer disease neurons are characterized by extraneuronal plaques formed by aggregated amyloid-β peptide and by intraneuronal tangles composed of fibrillar aggregates of the microtubule-associated Tau protein. Tau is mostly found in a hyperphosphorylated form in these tangles. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is a proline-directed kinase generally considered as one of the major players that (hyper)phosphorylates Tau. The kinase phosphorylates mainly (Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs and is believed to require a priming activity by another kinase. Here, we use an in vitro phosphorylation assay and NMR spectroscopy to characterize in a qualitative and quantitative manner the phosphorylation of Tau by GSK3β. We find that three residues can be phosphorylated (Ser-396, Ser-400, and Ser-404) by GSK3β alone, without priming. Ser-404 is essential in this process, as its mutation to Ala prevents all activity of GSK3β. However, priming enhances the catalytic efficacy of the kinase, as initial phosphorylation of Ser-214 by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) leads to the rapid modification by GSK3β of four regularly spaced additional sites. Because the regular incorporation of negative charges by GSK3β leads to a potential parallel between phospho-Tau and heparin, we investigated its interaction with the heparin/low density lipoprotein receptor binding domain of human apolipoprotein E. We indeed observed an interaction between the GSK3β-promoted regular phospho-pattern on Tau and the apolipoprotein E fragment but none in the absence of phosphorylation or the presence of an irregular phosphorylation pattern by the prolonged activity of PKA. Apolipoprotein E is therefore able to discriminate and interact with specific phosphorylation patterns of Tau."
https://openalex.org/W1970417068,"ERM proteins are regulated by phosphorylation of the most C-terminal threonine residue, switching them from an activated to an inactivated form. However, little is known about the control of this regulation. Previous work in our group demonstrated that secretion of acid sphingomyelinase acts upstream of ERM dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis in ERM regulation. To define the role of specific lipids, we employed recombinant bacterial sphingomyelinase (bSMase) as a direct probe of SM metabolism at the plasma membrane. bSMase induced a rapid dose- and time-dependent decrease in ERM dephosphorylation. ERM dephosphorylation was driven by ceramide generation and not by sphingomyelin depletion, as shown using recombinant sphingomyelinase D. The generation of ceramide at the plasma membrane was sufficient for ERM regulation, and no intracellular SM hydrolysis was required, as was visualized using Venus-tagged lysenin probe, which specifically binds SM. Interestingly, hydrolysis of plasma membrane bSMase-induced ceramide using bacterial ceramidase caused ERM hyperphosphorylation and formation of cell surface protrusions. The effects of plasma membrane ceramide hydrolysis were due to sphingosine 1-phosphate formation, as ERM phosphorylation was blocked by an inhibitor of sphingosine kinase and induced by sphingosine 1-phosphate. Taken together, these results demonstrate a new regulatory mechanism of ERM phosphorylation by sphingolipids with opposing actions of ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate. The approach also defines a tool kit to probe sphingolipid signaling at the plasma membrane. ERM proteins are regulated by phosphorylation of the most C-terminal threonine residue, switching them from an activated to an inactivated form. However, little is known about the control of this regulation. Previous work in our group demonstrated that secretion of acid sphingomyelinase acts upstream of ERM dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis in ERM regulation. To define the role of specific lipids, we employed recombinant bacterial sphingomyelinase (bSMase) as a direct probe of SM metabolism at the plasma membrane. bSMase induced a rapid dose- and time-dependent decrease in ERM dephosphorylation. ERM dephosphorylation was driven by ceramide generation and not by sphingomyelin depletion, as shown using recombinant sphingomyelinase D. The generation of ceramide at the plasma membrane was sufficient for ERM regulation, and no intracellular SM hydrolysis was required, as was visualized using Venus-tagged lysenin probe, which specifically binds SM. Interestingly, hydrolysis of plasma membrane bSMase-induced ceramide using bacterial ceramidase caused ERM hyperphosphorylation and formation of cell surface protrusions. The effects of plasma membrane ceramide hydrolysis were due to sphingosine 1-phosphate formation, as ERM phosphorylation was blocked by an inhibitor of sphingosine kinase and induced by sphingosine 1-phosphate. Taken together, these results demonstrate a new regulatory mechanism of ERM phosphorylation by sphingolipids with opposing actions of ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate. The approach also defines a tool kit to probe sphingolipid signaling at the plasma membrane. Ezrin (82 kDa), radixin (80 kDa), and moesin (75 kDa), known as the ERM proteins, link the plasma membrane to the cortical cytoskeleton. These proteins have been found to be enriched in specialized plasma membrane domains such as microvilli, lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and other membrane protrusions (1Bretscher A. Edwards K.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The function of ERM proteins is regulated by a two-step process based on an open (active) and closed (inactive) conformation. In the closed conformation, the N terminus domain (FERM) and the C terminus domain (C-ERMAD) interact with each other in a self-folded, dormant state, and the proteins rest in the cytosol. This folding is regulated by phosphorylation on the very C-terminal threonine residue (ezrin Thr567, radixin Thr564, and moesin Thr558), which leads to the open, active conformation. In the active conformation, the FERM domain interacts with the plasma membrane, and with several membrane-associated proteins (CD95, CD44, intercellular adhesion molecule (I-CAM), CD43, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTCR), and NHE1), and the C-ERMAD domain interacts with actin filaments in the submembrane cortex (9Hirao M.

Given these connections, it became important to identify the specific bioactive SLs required for this dephosphorylation as well as their topological implications and how other SLs in the SL network would affect ERM phosphorylation. sphingolipid bacterial sphingomyelinase bacterial ceramidase sphingomyelinase D sphingosine kinase inhibitor (p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl) sphingomyelin sphingosine sphingosine 1-phosphate ceramide 1-phosphate long acyl chain very long acyl chain. In this study, we demonstrate that ERM dephosphorylation is acutely regulated by hydrolysis of SM at the plasma membrane. We developed tools (Fig. 1) to show that the effect of sphingomyelinases on ERM dephosphorylation is caused by generation of ceramide and not by a decrease in sphingomyelin per se, or by generation of more complex SLs. We also show that dephosphorylation of ERM can be strongly overcome by hydrolysis of ceramide. Using for the first time bacterial ceramidase (bCDase) in cells, we found that hydrolysis of ceramide at the plasma membrane rapidly induces hyperphosphorylated ERM proteins. We further implicate S1P as a novel inducer of ERM phosphorylation. We propose a new model of regulation of ERM proteins by competing roles for ceramide and S1P generated at the plasma membrane. High glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, and rhodamine phalloidin were from Invitrogen. Sphingomyelinase from Bacillus cereus, bovine serum albumin (BSA), essentially fatty acid free, and protamine sulfate were from Sigma. Bovine sphingomyelin, N-hexadecanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C16 ceramide), N-nervonoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C24:1 ceramide), d-erythro-sphingosine, and d-erythro-sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Antiphospho-ERM proteins, anti-ezrin, anti-moesin, and anti-radixin, were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Draq5 was from Alexis (Carlsbad, CA). HeLa cells were originally purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. When FBS-free medium was used, medium was supplemented with 0.1% of BSA. All recombinant protocols were carried out following standard protocols. The plasmid encoding sphingomyelinase D (SMase d-pET30) from Loxosceles reclusa containing a N-terminal His6 tag, was a kind gift from Dr. Kevin R. Lynch (University of Virginia, School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA). The plasmid and recombinant bacteria for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ceramidase and Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase were obtained previously by our group (29Wu B.X. Snook C.F. Tani M. Büllesbach E.E.

In all cases, the plasmid was introduced by transformation into an Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS competent cell strain (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For optimization of expression, the E. coli SMase d-BL21 was grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) containing selective antibiotic. The protein induction was tested at different concentrations of inducer isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 0.1–1 mm), various times of induction (3, 8, and 24 h), and different temperatures (25, 30, and 37 °C), following standard procedures. After optimization, the induction condition for bCDase expression was carried out using 0.1 mm IPTG in M9 minimum medium for 24 h at 30 °C before harvest. For bSMase and SMase D, the conditions were 0.5 mm IPTG in LB medium for 24 h at 25 °C. For lysenin, the optimum conditions were 1 mm IPTG in LB medium for 24 h at 37 °C. For immunofluorescence analysis of cells with/without bSMase, SMase D, and/or bCDase treatment or exogenous SL treatments, HeLa cells were plated onto uncoated glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) at 100,000 cells/dish and incubated overnight; medium was changed to FBS-free DMEM, 0.1% BSA for 2 h, and cells were treated with the exogenous enzymes/exogenous SLs for the times indicated under “Results.” Cells were fixed by addition of warmed (37 °C) 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min, and samples were washed with PBS, if required, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked for 20 min at room temperature in PBS containing 2% of human serum. Primary antibodies were added for 18 h at 4 °C diluted in PBS with 2% of human serum. Samples were examined, and images were collected using a confocal microscope (LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) using a 64× objective, and data were imported into Volocity software (Improvision). Medium was removed from cells, and the lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS was added immediately, sonicated briefly (10 s), and boiled for 5 min. Samples were normalized to protein using BCA protein assay, and 10–20 μg were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% or 4–20% gradient Tris-HCl) using the Bio-Rad Criterion system. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat milk, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody following the manufacturer's protocol. After treatment, cells were washed two times with cold PBS and collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were used for lipid extraction. Two ml of 2:3 70% isopropanol/ethyl acetate were added directly to the cells. Internal standards for SLs (50 pmol each of analyzed species) were added to each sample. The samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g, and the upper phase was transferred to a new glass tube, and the lower phase was re-extracted adding 2 ml of the same extraction solution (4 ml). The two upper phases were combined in the same tube and used to measure SLs and inorganic phosphate. The identification of SL species was performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole MS operating in a multiple reaction monitoring positive ionization mode as described previously (31Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; 39: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Results from MS analysis were normalized by total inorganic phosphate (32Van Veldhoven P.P. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) present in the sample after a Bligh & Dyer extraction (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar). Km was measured using detergent/lipid mixed micelles with d-erythro-C16 or C24:1 ceramide as a substrate at different concentrations (from 0.1 to 20 μm) in a 50 mm (pH 7.1) Tris buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (final concentration), with a total volume of 100 μl. The enzymatic reaction was started by adding 1 ng of purified enzyme. The enzymatic reaction was continued for 30 min at 37 °C, and it was stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (1:1). The organic phase was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The Km was calculated using Prism software. Mean values ± S.E. of five different experiments are reported (**, p < 0.05 and ***, p < 0.01 as determined by one-way analysis of variance, Dunnett's post-test). SM is a structural constituent of mammalian cell membranes, mainly found at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane but is also found extracellularly in serum lipoproteins (34Jenkins R.W. Canals D. Hannun Y.A. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 836-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The effects of bSMase on ERM proteins reported previously by our group (20Zeidan Y.H. Jenkins R.W. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) could be exerted by the effect of bSMase on cellular SM or on the SM associated with lipoproteins found in FBS. We observed that FBS used in cell culture is rich in SM, consistent with previous studies (35Chigorno V. Giannotta C. Ottico E. Sciannamblo M. Mikulak J. Prinetti A. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2668-2675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, bSMase treatment of FBS medium caused hydrolysis of SM not only in the cells but also in the medium. Mass spectrometric analysis of FBS demonstrated high levels of SM (Fig. 2A), although ceramide, Sph, and sphingosine 1-phosphate were not detected. Bacterial SMase rapidly hydrolyzed SM from FBS medium generating ceramide (Fig. 2B). Thus, FBS contains SM that can be converted into ceramide, as an extra source of SL to the cells, and makes the system more complex. Additionally, bSMase-mediated hydrolysis of lipoprotein SM to ceramide has been shown to induce LDL aggregation. LDL aggregates can act as potent signaling molecules on their own (36Yan Z.Q. Hansson G.K. Immunol. Rev. 2007; 219: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because bSMase in FBS-free medium was sufficient to induce ERM dephosphorylation (Fig. 2C) and to avoid this confounding source of extracellular signaling, all subsequent experiments were conducted in FBS-free medium. Previous results from our group implicated acid sphingomyelinase in ezrin dephosphorylation (20Zeidan Y.H. Jenkins R.W. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To determine the specific bioactive SLs involved and their roles, HeLa cells were treated with bSMase using different doses and different times. After bSMase treatment, ERM proteins underwent dephosphorylation as early as 2 min and started recovering after 20–30 min with maximal effects seen at 50 milliunits/ml (Fig. 3A). Because phosphorylation of ERM proteins is closely related to their association with the plasma membrane and cortical actin, the localization of ERM proteins after bSMase treatment was studied. HeLa cells were treated with bSMase (25 milliunits/ml) for 10 min and examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3B). In resting cells, phospho-ERM proteins were localized in protrusions of the plasma membrane colocalizing with actin filaments, and total ERM protein was localized to both the cytosol and plasma membrane, particularly enriched in plasma membrane protrusions. After bSMase treatment, the phospho-ERM signal disappeared; thus demonstrating the cellular dephosphorylation of ERM and ruling out artifacts resulting from post-lysis of cells. Importantly, the total ERM signal became more cytosolic and disappeared from the plasma membrane protrusions. Therefore, bSMase was sufficient to induce ERM dephosphorylation and its relocalization from plasma membrane to cytosol. Although SM is enriched in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, it also exists in other intracellular membranes. Using cell fractionation on HL-60 cells, Linardic and Hannun (37Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23530-23537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that bSMase acted only at the plasma membrane but not on intracellular SM. To corroborate and extend these data, we purified a Venus-tagged, nontoxic mutant of lysenin protein, which specifically binds SM (38Kiyokawa E. Makino A. Ishii K. Otsuka N. Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Kobayashi T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9766-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and has been used as an SM-staining probe (39Gupta V.R. Patel H.K. Kostolansky S.S. Ballivian R.A. Eichberg J. Blanke S.R. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000073Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, HeLa cells were treated with bSMase for different times, and nonpermeabilized cells were stained with lysenin-Venus protein and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4, upper panels). Afterward, the cells were permeabilized and restained to allow lysenin-Venus to bind the intracellular SM (Fig. 4, lower panels). Thus, before bSMase treatment, SM was distributed evenly across the cell surface, including cell protrusions. After bSMase treatment, as early as 1 min, SM at the plasma membrane was decreased significantly, and it disappeared completely after 10 min of treatment. However, the intracellular SM was not hydrolyzed by bSMase. Furthermore, to support these data, HeLa cells were treated with tagged bSMase-His6 and analyzed by Western blotting, bSMase-His6 was not detected in the cell lysates in up to 1-h treatments (results not shown). Considering that bSMase caused ERM dephosphorylation as early as 1–2 min, and bSMase only hydrolyzed SM from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane but could not hydrolyze intracellular SM, at least at short times, we could conclude that hydrolysis of SM from the outer leaflet was sufficient to induce ERM dephosphorylation. In mammalian cells, the composition of sphingomyelin analyzed by mass spectrometry has been shown to be cell- and organism-specific. Furthermore, it is not known which species of SM are enriched in specific subcellular membranes. Moreover, different acyl chain length SLs as well as different subcellular localizations have been proposed to drive diverse actions in cells. To study the effect of bSMase on the SM profile of the external leaflet of the plasma membrane, various SL species were analyzed before and after bSMase treatment. Before bSMase treatment, the main SM species in HeLa cells were the C16 and C24:1 acyl chain, which also were the main acyl chains for ceramide, hexosyl ceramide, and lactosyl ceramide (Fig. 5A). After bSMase treatment, no major changes were measured for hexosyl ceramides, lactosyl ceramides, Sph, or S1P (data not shown). On the other hand, almost all the sphingomyelin species were decreased. Importantly, bSMase action showed preference for the long acyl chain species (e.g. C16) at early times (2 and 5 min), with additional hydrolysis of C24 and C24:1 SM at later times, and little changes were detected for C26 and C26:1 (Fig. 5B). Simultaneously, the long acyl chain ceramide species increased at early points (2 min) and faster than the very long acyl chain species that increased only after 5 min. As seen with SM, no changes were detected for the C26 and C26:1 ceramide species (Fig. 5C). Thus, the above results showed a correlation between bSMase-induced dephosphorylated ERM at 2 min and the lipidomic data, showing a preferential hydrolysis of long chain species (C14 to C20) versus very long species (C22 to C26) at 2 min. Thus, the decrease of long chain SM or the generation of long chain ceramide was sufficient to dephosphorylate ERM proteins, although a role for very long chain ceramide in regulation of ERM phosphorylation at later time points cannot be excluded. Normally, when bSMase is used in cells, the effects of bSMase have been attributed to ceramide generation or sphingomyelin removal from the plasma membrane, but distinguishing the effects of SM loss versus ceramide formation is challenging. In this context, SMase D hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to generate ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) instead of ceramide. To distinguish the effects on ERM phosphorylation by decreasing sphingomyelin from generating ceramide at the plasma membrane, His-tagged SMase D from the spider Loxosceles sp. was expressed in E. coli and purified (supplemental Table 2). Next, HeLa cells were treated with bSMase and SMase D at concentrations producing a similar decrease in sphingomyelin (Fig. 6A). As expected, whereas bSMase produced ceramide, SMase D produced mainly C1P although a small increase in ceramide levels were detected at short times, presumably by dephosphorylation of C1P (Fig. 6A). Next, the effects of the two sphingomyelinases on ERM phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blot. Only bSMase treatment but not SMase D treatment led to ERM dephosphorylation, showing that ceramide generation and not the decrease of SM induced ERM dephosphorylation (Fig. 6B). Analysis by confocal microscopy also confirmed that although bSMase was able to induce ERM dephosphorylation, SMase D was not (Fig. 6C). Moreover, when HeLa cells were first treated with SMase D and then with bSMase, the latter lost its ability to induce ERM dephosphorylation (Fig. 6C, last panel), consistent with the loss of the SM substrate for bSMase after SMase D treatment. As seen with bSMase, SMase D hydrolyzed plasma membrane SM but had no effect on intracellular SM (Fig. 6D). These data strongly suggest that SM is not the active compound required to keep ERM phosphorylated at the plasma membrane but that ceramide at the plasma membrane is required to induce the dephosphorylation. To further implicate ceramide at the plasma membrane and distinguish its effects from those of potential subsequent metabolites, we purified bCDase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (supplemental Table 1) to decrease the ceramide levels at the plasma membrane and study how that would affect ERM phosphorylation. Initially, to study how the basal levels of ceramide could affect ERM proteins, HeLa cells were treated with bCDase and harvested at different times. Surprisingly, no changes in ceramide levels were detected after bCDase treatment, suggesting that ceramide levels in the plasma membrane of resting cells are very low. However, when HeLa cells were pretreated with bSMase to generate ceramide and then treated with bCDase, the ceramide generated after bSMase treatment started to decrease (Fig. 7A), generating Sph, and, somewhat unexpectedly, very high levels of S1P in cells (Fig. 7C) as well as in medium (Fig. 7D). Notably, bCDase preferentially decreased long acyl chain ceramides but had no effect on very long acyl chain ceramides (Fig. 7B). Functionally, ceramide hydrolysis generated by bCDase had a profound effect on ERM phosphorylation. As shown for ceramide production, when HeLa cells were pretreated with bSMase, bCDase caused significant ERM hyperphosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7F). The hyperphosphorylation of ERM appeared in cell protrusions surrounding the cells completely (Fig. 7G). Thus, ceramide hydrolysis produced not only a recovery in ERM phosphorylation levels but also a hyperphosphorylation of ERM, suggesting that formation of Sph and/or S1P might promote ERM phosphorylation. To study whether the selective loss of long chain ceramide in cells treated with bCDase was due to accessibility to different pools of ceramide or to a different substrate preference, the in vitro kinetics of bCDase toward a long chain ceramide (C16 ceramide) and very long chain ceramide (C24:1) were determined (Fig. 7E). BCDase showed similar Vmax values toward C16 and C24:1 ceramide species, and moderately different in Km values from 1.4 μm in C16 ceramide to 4.6 μm in C24:1 ceramide (Fig. 7E, right panel), indicating the enzymes do exhibit a slight in vitro preference for long chain ceramide over very long chain ceramide. However, the amount required for the in vitro assays was 1/5000 the amount used in the studies in cell culture (Fig. 7E, left panel) to avoid excess of enzyme and maintain Michaelis-Menten conditions of modest substrate consumption. The higher concentrations used in cell studies were designed to achieve total conversion of ceramide in the membrane and, as such, should be much less susceptible to relatively small differences in Km. Thus, the selective loss of C16 ceramide but not C24:1 ceramide in cells treated with b"

Here, we investigated the role of the Rho kinase pathway in the morphology and migration of hematopoietic progenitors using an ex vivo co-culture consisting of human primary CD34(+) progenitors and mesenchymal stromal cells. The addition of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 led to the abolishment of the uropod and microvillar-like structures of hematopoietic progenitors, concomitant with a redistribution of proteins found therein (prominin-1 and ezrin). Y-27632-treated cells displayed a deficiency in migration. Time-lapse video microscopy revealed impairment of the rear pole retraction. Interestingly, the knockdown of ROCK I, but not ROCK II, using RNA interference (RNAi) was sufficient to cause the referred morphological and migrational changes. Unexpectedly, the addition of nocodazole to either Y-27632- or ROCK I RNAi-treated cells could restore their polarized morphology and migration suggesting an active role for the microtubule network in tail retraction. Finally, we could demonstrate using RNAi that RhoA, the upstream regulator of ROCK, is involved in these processes. Collectively, our data provide new insights regarding the role of RhoA/ROCK I and the microtubules in the migration of stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2066577113,"Chitinases hydrolyze chitin, an insoluble linear polymer of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (NAG)(n), into nutrient sources. Bacillus cereus NCTU2 chitinase (ChiNCTU2) predominantly produces chitobioses and belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 18. The crystal structure of wild-type ChiNCTU2 comprises only a catalytic domain, unlike other chitinases that are equipped with additional chitin binding and insertion domains to bind substrates into the active site. Lacking chitin binding and chitin insertion domains, ChiNCTU2 utilizes two dynamic loops (Gly-67-Thr-69 and Ile-106-Val-112) to interact with (NAG)(n), generating novel substrate binding and distortion for catalysis. Gln-109 is crucial for direct binding with substrates, leading to conformational changes of two loops with a maximum shift of ∼4.6 Å along the binding cleft. The structures of E145Q, E145Q/Y227F, and E145G/Y227F mutants complexed with (NAG)(n) reveal (NAG)(2), (NAG)(2), and (NAG)(4) in the active site, respectively, implying various stages of reaction: before hydrolysis, E145G/Y227F with (NAG)(4); in an intermediate state, E145Q/Y227F with a boat-form NAG at the -1 subsite, -1-(NAG); after hydrolysis, E145Q with a chair form -1-(NAG). Several residues were confirmed to play catalytic roles: Glu-145 in cleavage of the glycosidic bond between -1-(NAG) and +1-(NAG); Tyr-227 in the conformational change of -1-(NAG); Asp-143 and Gln-225 in stabilizing the conformation of -1-(NAG). Additionally, Glu-190 acts in the process of product release, and Tyr-193 coordinates with water for catalysis. Residues Asp-143, E145Q, Glu-190, and Tyr-193 exhibit multiple conformations for functions. The inhibitors zinc ions and cyclo-(l-His-l-Pro) are located at various positions and confirm the catalytic-site topology. Together with kinetics analyses of related mutants, the structures of ChiNCTU2 and its mutant complexes with (NAG)(n) provide new insights into its substrate binding and the mechanistic action."
https://openalex.org/W1975082963,"Amyloid peptide (Aβ) aggregation in the brain is a characteristic feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Previously, we reported the discovery of focally elevated creatine deposits in brain tissue from TgCRND8 mice, which express double mutant (K670N/M671L and V717F) amyloid protein precursor. In this study, frozen hippocampal tissue sections from 5-, 8-, 11-, 14-, and 17-month old TgCRND8 and littermate control mice were examined with Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy to explore the distribution of lipid, creatine, and dense core plaque deposits. Lipid distribution throughout the hippocampus was similar in transgenic (Tg) and non-Tg littermates at all ages. Dense core plaques were always found to lie within a thin (30-50 μm) lipid envelope, confirmed by imaging through serial sections. Creatine deposits were found in all TgCRND8 mice; the extent of deposition increased with age. Minor creatine deposits appeared in the oldest littermate controls. Distribution in the serial sections showed moderate correlation between layers, slightly disturbed by the freeze/thaw process. Creatine deposits in Tg mice were not specifically co-localized with plaques or lipid halos. The dimension of the lipid envelope is comparable with that of the diffuse halo of nonaggregated amyloid, implying a dynamic association in vivo, postulated to have a significant role in the evolving neurotoxicity."

Glomerular podocytes are the major barrier to the filtration of serum proteins, and altered podocyte function and/or reduced podocyte number is a key event in the pathogenesis of DN. We have previously shown that podocytes are a target for GH action. To elucidate the molecular basis for the effects of GH on the podocyte, we conducted microarray and RT-quantitative PCR analyses of immortalized human podocytes and identified zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) to be up-regulated in a GH dose- and time-dependent manner. We established that the GH-dependent increase in ZEB2 levels is associated with increased transcription of a ZEB2 natural antisense transcript required for efficient translation of the ZEB2 transcript. GH down-regulated expression of E- and P-cadherins, targets of ZEB2, and inhibited E-cadherin promoter activity. Mutation of ZEB2 binding sites on the E-cadherin promoter abolished this effect of GH on the E-cadherin promoter. Whereas GH increased podocyte permeability to albumin in a paracellular albumin influx assay, shRNA-mediated knockdown of ZEB2 expression abrogated this effect. We conclude that GH increases expression of ZEB2 in part by increasing expression of a ZEB2 natural antisense transcript. GH-dependent increase in ZEB2 expression results in loss of P- and E-cadherins in podocytes and increased podocyte permeability to albumin. Decreased expression of P- and E-cadherins is implicated in podocyte dysfunction and epithelial-mesenchymal transition observed in DN.

In addition to growth, GH affects the metabolism of fat, protein, and carbohydrate (1Møller N. Jørgensen J.O. Endocr. Rev. 2009; 30: 152-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). GH exerts these actions both by its direct effect on target organs and by stimulating the production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). At the tissue level, these pleiotropic actions of GH result from the interaction of GH with a specific cell surface receptor, the GH receptor (GHR). Whereas the GHR is ubiquitously expressed, the role and effects of GH have been most intensely investigated in organs and tissues such as liver, bone, muscle, and adipocytes in which GHR expression is substantial and are thus considered canonical targets of GH action. However, recent reports have highlighted the biological effects and physiological relevance of GH action in non-canonical targets such as the blastocyst (2Pantaleon M. Whiteside E.J. Harvey M.B.

Our previous study had identified the glomerular podocyte as a target of GH action with podocytes expressing functional GHR and exhibiting GH-dependent activation of canonical GH signaling pathways (12Reddy G.R. Pushpanathan M.J. Ransom R.F. Holzman L.B. Brosius 3rd, F.C. Diakonova M. Mathieson P. Saleem M.A. List E.O. Kopchick J.J. Frank S.J. Menon R.K. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2045-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Podocytes are visceral epithelial cells of the renal glomerulus. These cells, which have a complex cellular architecture that includes a cell body and primary, secondary, and tertiary foot processes, are generally considered to be terminally differentiated. Individual foot processes interdigitate with that of neighboring cells and also attach to the underlying glomerular basement membrane. Podocyte foot processes, glomerular basement membrane, and the fenestrated endothelial cells together form the glomerular filtration barrier that ensures filtration of water and solutes while preventing loss of albumin and other proteins. The cell-cell junctions between the podocyte foot processes are bridged by slit diaphragms, which play a significant role in glomerular filtration. The absolute number of podocytes and their functional integrity are critical for maintenance of normal renal function. Proteinuria ensues when the structure of podocytes is destroyed by disruption of the slit diaphragm and loss of foot processes (effacement). Podocyte injury and loss have been observed in human and experimental models of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and other glomerular diseases (13Stitt-Cavanagh E. MacLeod L. Kennedy C.

The cellular and molecular basis for GH action in the podocyte is unclear. In the current study, we report a molecular basis for GH action in the podocyte with the identification of zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2), also known as zinc finger homeobox 1B (ZFHX1B), as a target of GH action in the podocyte. We demonstrate that GH-dependent increase in ZEB2 expression is due to increased ZEB2 promoter activity and the induction of a ZEB2 natural antisense transcript (ZEB2-NAT). Our studies further elucidate the functional implications of this novel GH action with demonstration of GH-dependent repression of canonical targets of ZEB2, E-and P-cadherins, with associated changes in podocyte function. Conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cells (MPC-5) (17Endlich N. Kress K.R. Reiser J. Uttenweiler D. Kriz W. Mundel P. Endlich K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 413-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown according to a protocol detailed previously (18Mundel P. Reiser J. Zúñiga Mejía Borja A. Pavenstädt H. Davidson G.R. Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured under growth-permissive conditions on rat tail collagen type I-coated plastic dishes (BD Biosciences) at 33 °C with 100% relative humidity and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10 units/ml mouse recombinant γ-interferon (Sigma). To induce differentiation, podocytes were maintained in non-permissive conditions at 37 °C without γ-interferon for 14 days prior to experimentation. Under these culture conditions, cells stopped proliferating and were identified as differentiated podocytes by their arborized morphology and induction of podocyte-specific proteins such as synaptopodin (data not shown). Cells were routinely maintained for 12–16 h in serum-free medium before experimentation. Human podocytes (19Saleem M.A. O'Hare M.J. Reiser J. Coward R.J. Inward C.D. Farren T. Xing C.Y. Ni L. Mathieson P.W. Mundel P. J. Am. Soc.

These cells were induced to differentiate using a protocol similar to that outlined above for the murine podocytes. HepG2 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Fully differentiated human podocytes were cultured overnight in serum-free medium and then exposed to human GH (500 ng/ml) for 1, 5, and 30 min. Total RNA was extracted from these cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by repurification using a column (Qiagen, RNeasy minikit) according to the manufacture's protocol. In-column DNase digestion was performed for each sample to remove genomic DNA. RNA samples were analyzed for concentration and purity using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer, and integrity was checked using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Affymetrix Human 2.0 Plus arrays (Affymetrix) were used in this study. Standard Affymetrix protocols were followed for sample labeling, hybridization, and image scanning at the University of Michigan microarray core facility. Total RNA was isolated and purified from differentiated human podocytes as described above. ZEB2-NAT primer sequences were as published (20Beltran M. Puig I. Peña C. García J.M. Alvarez A.B. Peña R. Bonilla F. de Herreros A.G. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 756-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Total RNA was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and PCR was performed with NAT primers using Extend Long PCR DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). The reaction conditions were as follows: initial RT for 10 min at 25 °C, stringent RT for 45 min at 48 °C followed by inactivation of reverse transcriptase at 94 °C for 5 min, and PCR cycles of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 3 min. A final extension was carried out at 68 °C for 7 min. The following primers were used: NAT primer 1F, 5′-CCT CCC GAC ACT CTT GGC GA-3′; NAT primer 2F, 5′-GGG CGA GTG GGC TTC CT-3′; NAT primer 2R, 5′-CGA TAA GAG CGG ATC AGA TGG C-3′; β-globulin 1, 5′-CCA ATC TGC TCA CAC AGG ATA GAG AGG GCA GG-3′; and β-globulin 2, 5′-CCT TGA GGC TGT CCA AGT GAT TCA GGC CAT CG-3′. Primer Express software (PE Biosystems) was used to design primers and probes for ZEB2 (encompassing exons 7 and 8) and E-cadherin (encompassing exons 5 and 6). The sequences of primers and probes used in the study are as follows: ZEB2 primer 1, 5′-CAA GGA GCA GGT AAT CGC AAG T-3′; ZEB2 primer 2, 5′-GAA CGT CAA ACC CGT GAG CAT-3′; ZEB2 probe, 5′-CAA ATG CAC AGA GTG TGG CAA GGC C-3′; E-cadherin primer 1, 5′-CGC ATT GCC ACA TAC ACT CTC T-3′; E-cadherin primer 2, 5′-CCA TTG GAT CCT CAA CTG CAT-3′; E-cadherin probe, 5′-CTC TCA CGC TGT GTC ATC CAA CGG-3′; P-cadherin primer 1, 5′-ACC GAC CAG AAT GAC CAC AAG-3′; and P-cadherin primer 2, 5′-AGA AGT ACC TGG TAG GAC TCC CTC TAA-3′. The E-cadherin and ZEB2 probes were labeled with fluorescent reporter dye VIC (Applied Biosystems), and the GAPDH probe was labeled with FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein). Normalization and validation of data were carried out using GAPDH as an internal control, and data were compared between GH-treated and untreated samples according to the comparative CT method (21Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17477) Google Scholar). Using a separate tube RT-PCR protocol (PE Biosystems), 4-ng aliquots of total RNA were analyzed. After RT at 48 °C for 30 min, samples were subjected to PCR analysis using the following cycling parameters: 95 °C × 10 min; 95 °C × 15 s → 60 °C × 1 min for 40 cycles. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate in individual assays performed on three or more occasions. E-cadherin-luciferase reporter construct was a gift from Dr. Eric Fearon (University of Michigan). ZEB2 binding sites in E-cadherin promoter (E2 box1 and E2 box3) were mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the EndoFree plasmid maxikit (Qiagen), and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. ZEB2- and ZEB2-NAT-luciferase reporter constructs (20Beltran M. Puig I. Peña C. García J.M. Alvarez A.B. Peña R. Bonilla F. de Herreros A.G. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 756-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Antonio García de Herreros (Institut Municipal d'Investigació Mèdica-Hospital del Mar, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain). HepG2 cells (2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates) were cotransfected with luciferase reporter plasmids (2 μg/well) and internal control, pRL-TK (Promega; 0.2 μg/well), expressing the Renilla luciferase. Transfections were performed using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, the cells were starved for 12–16 h and then treated with GH (500 ng/ml) for specified time periods. To measure luciferase activity, the wells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were harvested with 200 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Following a brief freeze-thaw cycle, the insoluble debris were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 2 min at 14,000 × g. 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were then immediately processed for sequential quantitation of both firefly and Renilla luciferase activity (Dual-Luciferase Assay System, Promega) using a Monolight TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). The activity of the cotransfected Renilla reporter plasmid was used for normalization of transfection efficiency. All transfections experiments were performed in triplicates. Cells were lysed in protein lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was quantified via the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of cell lysates were resolved through 4–16% gradient polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was probed with suitable primary and secondary antibodies and then developed by the ECL chemiluminescence method (Pierce). The primary antibodies against ZEB2 (Abnova) and E- and P-cadherins (BD Biosciences) were used in a 1:1000 dilution. When indicated, the membrane was then stripped and reblotted with anti-tubulin antiserum (Sigma; 1:1000) to verify equality of sample loading. A panel of five lentiviruses expressing unique ZEB2 shRNA sequences was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Proliferating human podocytes were plated in a 6-well plate at 40% confluence (2 × 105 cells/well) and cultured overnight for 12–16 h. The cells were then pretreated with Polybrene (6 μg/ml for 20 h), infected with lentiviral particles, and incubated at 33 °C. The following day the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing puromycin (1 μg/ml) as a selection marker. The puromycin-resistant cells were induced to differentiate using the protocol detailed above, and ZEB2 expression was measured in the differentiated cells using RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Human podocytes were plated on a 12-well plate with collagen-coated Transwell filters (Corning) (6–7 × 104 cells/well) and differentiated at nonpermissive conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 14 days. The cells were then placed in serum-free medium overnight and treated with GH (500 ng/ml) for 48 h. Subsequently, the serum-free medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with a 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 mixture to preserve cadherin junctions. 2 ml of RMPI 1640 medium with 40 mg/ml BSA was then placed in the bottom chamber, and 0.3 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (without albumin) was placed in the top chamber. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, aliquots of medium were collected from the top chamber at various (1-, 2-, and 4-h) time points, and albumin concentration was measured in these aliquots using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance was measured at 562 nm using an ELx 800 plate reader (BioTek). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Moderated F-statistics (Limma R package) was used to analyze microarray data. p values <0.01 and <0.001 were used to distinguish differentially expressed genes in the GH-treated podocytes compared with untreated podocytes. SPSS software (SPSS, Inc.) was used to apply Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests to analyze statistical differences between the distributions of two or multiple independent samples, respectively. p values equal to or less than 0.05 were considered significant. To identify the cellular basis for GH action in the podocyte, we used microarray analysis to conduct an unbiased survey of genes regulated in a GH-dependent manner in the podocyte. Immortalized human podocytes were exposed to GH (500 ng/ml) for varying time periods, and mRNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analysis. Threshold and probabilistic filtering of the data at a high stringency of p < 0.001 identified several genes that were altered in a GH-dependent manner (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE21327). ZEB2, whose expression was increased in a GH-dependent manner, was chosen for further analysis based on potential biological significance given the established role of ZEB2 in TGF-β signaling and the importance of TGF-β in the pathogenesis of renal disorders (22Hills C.E. Squires P.E. Am. J. Nephrol. 2010; 31: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Chen S. Jim B. Ziyadeh F.N. Semin.

ZEB2 is also known as ZFHX1B and Smad interaction protein 1 (SIP1); we refer to this gene as ZEB2 throughout this study. Results obtained from the microarray analysis were confirmed by quantitative real time RT-PCR measurement of the steady state abundance of ZEB2 mRNA. For this purpose, immortalized human podocytes were exposed to GH, and mRNA was harvested at various time periods. These experiments revealed that levels of ZEB2 mRNA, normalized to GAPDH expression, were increased 2.0- (24 h), 2.8- (48 h), and 4.8-fold (72 h) following exposure of podocytes to GH (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting of lysates from podocytes exposed to GH also revealed a GH dose- and time-dependent increase in the levels of ZEB2 protein (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, the effects of GH were maximal at a concentration of 500 ng/ml, and the effect plateaued at 48–72 h of exposure to GH. We next assayed the effect of GH on the ZEB2 promoter. GH stimulation of HepG2 cells transiently transfected with a ZEB2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct verified GH-dependent increase in ZEB2 promoter activity (Fig. 1D). A canonical action of GH is stimulation of production of IGF-1. To exclude the possibility that the observed effect of GH on ZEB2 expression was mediated by locally produced IGF-1, we exposed differentiated human podocytes to IGF-1 and measured ZEB2 expression in these cells. These results indicate that IGF-1 failed to stimulate expression of ZEB2 mRNA (data not shown) and protein (Fig. 1E) in these cells. These results suggest that GH-dependent increase in ZEB2 expression is independent of IGF-1 in this model system and experimental paradigm. A previous report had described a NAT of ZEB2 implicated in Snail1-induced expression of ZEB2 (20Beltran M. Puig I. Peña C. García J.M. Alvarez A.B. Peña R. Bonilla F. de Herreros A.G. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 756-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In this model, Snail1 induced the expression of a ZEB2-NAT that overlaps with a donor splice site. Thus, ZEB2-NAT by binding to the complementary sense strand inhibited the splicing and processing of the cognate 5′-UTR ZEB2 intron (Fig. 2A). This ZEB2 intron also contains an internal ribosome entry site, and thus, the maintenance of the intron by the NAT facilitates ZEB2 translation and augments ZEB2 expression. We investigated this mechanism in the GH-dependent induction of ZEB2 in the glomerular podocyte. We obtained preliminary evidence of expression of the antisense transcript by demonstrating the presence of the internal ribosome entry site-containing intron in RNA from human podocyte cells exposed to GH (Fig. 2B). Hence, PCR amplification with the 1F/2R primer dyad of RNA prepared from cells naïve to GH yielded a 236-bp product predicted from splicing of the intron. In contrast, in cells exposed to GH, this PCR yielded an additional band of ∼2.7 kb that would infer the presence of the unspliced intron in this RNA. We further confirmed these results with another set of primers, 2F/2R. These results indicate that the abundance of the intron containing the 554-bp product was much greater in RNA from cells exposed to GH (Fig. 2B). Measurement of ZEB2 antisense RNA via quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the increase in levels of the transcript following stimulation of the cells with GH (Fig. 2C). We next assayed the effect of GH on the promoter of the ZEB2-NAT. Exposure of HepG2 cells transiently transfected with a NAT promoter-luciferase reporter construct to GH verified GH-dependent increase in NAT promoter activity (Fig. 2D). These results support a role for ZEB2-NAT expression in the observed GH-dependent increase in ZEB2 expression in the glomerular podocyte. ZEB2 regulates several genes that are involved with cell junctions and cell-cell adhesion, and previous studies have established that ZEB2 is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin and P-cadherin gene expression. E-cadherin, a hemophilic Ca2+-dependent transmembrane adhesion protein, is also expressed in the glomerular podocyte (25Reiser J. Kriz W. Kretzler M. Mundel P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Having established that GH increases ZEB2 expression, we next analyzed the expression of E-cadherin in human podocytes exposed to GH. These experiments revealed a GH-dependent down-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein expression (Fig. 3, B and C). The decrement in E-cadherin expression was dose-dependent and could be demonstrated up to 72 h following exposure to GH (Fig. 3B). These effects of GH on ZEB2 and E-cadherin expression could also be demonstrated in murine podocytes (Fig. 3, D and E). P-cadherin is a component of the slit diaphragm apparatus of the glomerular podocyte. Our results reveal that, similar to E-cadherin expression, expression of P-cadherin mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4B) was decreased in human podocytes exposed to GH. The time and dose dependence of the effect of GH on P-cadherin expression was similar to that observed for E-cadherin. ZEB2 protein is characterized by a homeodomain flanked by two clusters of zinc fingers. Whereas each zinc finger cluster binds independently to CACCT sequences, a full-length monomeric ZEB2 can bind with high affinity to bipartite elements in the target gene composed of one CAGGTG target site and one CACCTG target site (26Remacle J.E.

The mouse and human E-cadherin promoters have a conserved modular structure with positive regulatory elements including two E2 boxes (CACCTG) that bind ZEB2 and transduce the suppressive action of ZEB2 on E-cadherin expression (Fig. 5A) (27Behrens J.

The results described above indicate that GH increases expression of ZEB2 in the glomerular podocyte and also decreases E-cadherin expression in these cells. Based on the temporal relationship between these two effects of GH in the podocyte, we hypothesized that the effect of GH on E-cadherin expression was transduced by the increase in ZEB2 expression. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of GH on the E-cadherin promoter. For this purpose, an E-cadherin promoter-luciferase reporter construct was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, and luciferase activity was measured. These results indicate that GH induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the activity of the E-cadherin promoter (Fig. 5, B and C). To verify that the observed effect of GH on the E-cadherin promoter was due to alteration in interaction of ZEB2 with the E-cadherin promoter, we engineered an E-cadherin-promoter luciferase construct with mutation in the E2 boxes that bind ZEB2 and tested the effect of GH on the activity of this mutant luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 5A). These experiments reveal that, in contrast to the wild type E-cadherin promoter-reporter construct, GH failed to alter the activity of the mutant E-cadherin promoter-reporter construct (Fig. 5C). Hence, these results support a model wherein GH decreases E-cadherin expression via an increase in ZEB2 expression in the glomerular podocyte. We next ascertained whether ZEB2 played an essential role in the GH-dependent decrease in E-cadherin expression. For this purpose, we used shRNA lentivirus to engineer human podocytes with specific knockdown of ZEB2 expression. The decrement in ZEB2 expression was confirmed by both RT-qPCR of mRNA and immunoblotting of cell lysates (Fig. 6, A and B). After having confirmed the efficacy and specificity of the shRNA lentivirus-mediated knockdown, these cells were exposed to GH, and the levels of E-cadherin were measured by immunoblotting. In podocytes infected with lentivirus expressing ZEB2 shRNA, GH failed to elicit a decrease in E-cadherin expression (Fig. 6C). Hence, these results indicate that ZEB2 is essential for transducing the effect of GH on E-cadherin expression in the glomerul"
https://openalex.org/W2044063308,"Pikachurin, the most recently identified ligand of dystroglycan, plays a crucial role in the formation of the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. It is known that glycosylation of dystroglycan is necessary for its ligand binding activity, and hypoglycosylation is associated with a group of muscular dystrophies that often involve eye abnormalities. Because little is known about the interaction between pikachurin and dystroglycan and its impact on molecular pathogenesis, here we characterize the interaction using deletion constructs and mouse models of muscular dystrophies with glycosylation defects (<i>Large</i><sup>myd</sup> and <i>POMGnT1</i>-deficient mice). Pikachurin-dystroglycan binding is calcium-dependent and relatively less sensitive to inhibition by heparin and high NaCl concentration, as compared with other dystroglycan ligand proteins. Using deletion constructs of the laminin globular domains in the pikachurin C terminus, we show that a certain steric structure formed by the second and the third laminin globular domains is necessary for the pikachurin-dystroglycan interaction. Binding assays using dystroglycan deletion constructs and tissue samples from <i>Large</i>-deficient (<i>Large</i><sup>myd</sup>) mice show that Large-dependent modification of dystroglycan is necessary for pikachurin binding. In addition, the ability of pikachurin to bind to dystroglycan prepared from <i>POMGnT1</i>-deficient mice is severely reduced, suggesting that modification of the GlcNAc-β1,2-branch on <i>O</i>-mannose is also necessary for the interaction. Immunofluorescence analysis reveals a disruption of pikachurin localization in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse of these model animals. Together, our data demonstrate that post-translational modification on <i>O</i>-mannose, which is mediated by Large and POMGnT1, is essential for pikachurin binding and proper localization, and suggest that their disruption underlies the molecular pathogenesis of eye abnormalities in a group of muscular dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W2037303704,"The principal protein of high density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, in the lipid-free state contains two tertiary structure domains comprising an N-terminal helix bundle and a less organized C-terminal domain. It is not known how the properties of these domains modulate the formation and size distribution of apoA-I-containing nascent HDL particles created by ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-mediated efflux of cellular phospholipid and cholesterol. To address this issue, proteins corresponding to the two domains of human apoA-I (residues 1–189 and 190–243) and mouse apoA-I (residues 1–186 and 187–240) together with some human/mouse domain hybrids were examined for their abilities to form HDL particles when incubated with either ABCA1-expressing cells or phospholipid multilamellar vesicles. Incubation of human apoA-I with cells gave rise to two sizes of HDL particles (hydrodynamic diameter, 8 and 10 nm), and removal or disruption of the C-terminal domain eliminated the formation of the smaller particle. Variations in apoA-I domain structure and physical properties exerted similar effects on the rates of formation and sizes of HDL particles created by either spontaneous solubilization of phospholipid multilamellar vesicles or the ABCA1-mediated efflux of cellular lipids. It follows that the sizes of nascent HDL particles are determined at the point at which cellular phospholipid and cholesterol are solubilized by apoA-I; apparently, this is the rate-determining step in the overall ABCA1-mediated cellular lipid efflux process. The stability of the apoA-I N-terminal helix bundle domain and the hydrophobicity of the C-terminal domain are important determinants of both nascent HDL particle size and their rate of formation.

Not surprisingly, the size of a discoidal HDL particle is dependent upon the number of apoA-I molecules located in it; smaller discs contain two apoA-I molecules, and larger particles contain up to four apoA-I molecules. In addition to these quaternary structure effects, the tertiary structure of apoA-I (and other apolipoproteins that interact with ABCA1 to form HDL particles) also is likely to play a role. Heretofore, this issue has not been investigated systematically, although it is known that human and mouse apoA-I give rise to different sizes of HDL particles in mice (23Rubin E.M. Ishida B.Y.

The transformed DE3 cells were cultured in LB medium at 37 °C and expression of the Trx-apoA-I fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. After sonicating the bacterial pellet, the lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant loaded onto a nickel-chelating, histidine-binding resin column (Novagen, Carlsbad, CA). The Trx-apoA-I fusion protein bound to the column was eluted, pooled, and dialyzed against 20 mm NH4HCO3.

Replotting Fig. 1A so the apoA-I domain concentrations are expressed in molar terms (data not shown) shows that the sum of the efflux contributions of the isolated N- and C-terminal domain fragments is less than the efflux observed with the equivalent concentration of intact WT apoA-I. This result implies that the N- and C-terminal domains cooperate to enhance FC efflux to human apoA-I via ABCA1.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for cholesterol efflux to ApoA-I from J774/BHK cellsApolipoproteinFC effluxJ774 cellsBHK cellsRelative VmaxaThe cellular cholesterol released from J774 cells to 20 μg/ml of WT human apoA-I was 9 ± 3%/4 h (n = 21) (mean ± S.D.), and all Vmax values are normalized to this value.KmRelative catalytic efficiencybThe catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) for WT human apoA-I-mediated efflux from J774 cells was 1.6 ± 0.5% FC efflux (4 h)−1 (μg apo/ml)−1 (mean ± S.D.), and all catalytic efficiencies are normalized to this value.Relative VmaxcThe cellular cholesterol released from BHK cells to 20 μg/ml of WT human apoA-I was 28 ± 4%/4 h (n = 12), and all of Vmax values are normalized to this value.KmRelative catalytic efficiencydThe catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) for WT human apoA-I-mediated efflux from BHK cells was 4.2 ± 0.6% FC efflux (4 h)−1 (μg apo/ml)−1, and all catalytic efficiencies are normalized to this value.μg Apo/mlμg Apo/mlWT ApoA-I (H)1.05.7 ± 0.2 (n = 15)1.01.06.7 ± 0.4 (n = 12)1.01–189(H)1.8 ± 0.06 (n = 6)31.8 ± 1.7 (n = 6)0.31.8 ± 0.3 (n = 3)28.5 ± 6.1 (n = 3)0.4190–243(H)0.8 ± 0.04 (n = 6)11 ± 1.2 (n = 6)0.41.4 ± 0.2 (n = 3)20.4 ± 4.0 (n = 3)0.45WT ApoA-I (M)2.5 ± 0.04 (n = 15)24 ± 0.6 (n = 15)0.61.5 ± 0.1 (n = 3)14.7 ± 2.0 (n = 3)0.71–186(M)1.8 ± 0.05 (n = 3)2.3 ± 0.2 (n = 3)4.41.4 ± 0.1 (n = 3)5.7 ± 1.0 (n = 3)1.6H1–189M187–2401.6 ± 0.1 (n = 3)9.6 ± 1.3 (n = 3)0.91.3 ± 0.1 (n = 3)34.3 ± 2.3 (n = 3)0.25M1–186H190–2431.3 ± 0.06 (n = 3)3.5 ± 0.5 (n = 3)2.11.5 ± 0.1 (n = 3)6.06 ± 1.0 (n = 3)1.7a The cellular cholesterol released from J774 cells to 20 μg/ml of WT human apoA-I was 9 ± 3%/4 h (n = 21) (mean ± S.D.), and all Vmax values are normalized to this value.b The catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) for WT human apoA-I-mediated efflux from J774 cells was 1.6 ± 0.5% FC efflux (4 h)−1 (μg apo/ml)−1 (mean ± S.D.), and all catalytic efficiencies are normalized to this value.c The cellular cholesterol released from BHK cells to 20 μg/ml of WT human apoA-I was 28 ± 4%/4 h (n = 12), and all of Vmax values are normalized to this value.d The catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) for WT human apoA-I-mediated efflux from BHK cells was 4.2 ± 0.6% FC efflux (4 h)−1 (μg apo/ml)−1, and all catalytic efficiencies are normalized to this value. Open table in a new tab The altered N- and C-terminal tertiary domain structures in mouse apoA-I compared with human apoA-I lead to variations in FC efflux via ABCA1. Thus, WT mouse apoA-I is less effective than human apoA-I (Fig. 1B) and the relative catalytic efficiency is 0.6 for WT apoA-I (M) (Table 1). This decreased efflux efficiency occurs even though there is no species disparity between mouse apoA-I and J774 cells that express the murine ABCA1 transporter. In marked contrast to the situation with human apoA-I (Fig. 1A), the isolated mouse N-terminal helix bundle domain apoA-I 1–186(M) is much more effective at promoting FC efflux than the intact mouse apoA-I molecule (Fig. 1B). This effect is demonstrated by the increase in relative catalytic efficiency to a value of 4.4 for apoA-I 1–186(M) (Table 1); this value is ∼7- and 4-fold higher than the values for WT mouse and human apoA-I, respectively. The isolated mouse apoA-I C-terminal domain, apoA-I 187–240(M), fails to promote FC efflux (Fig. 1B) which is consistent with the high polarity and poor lipid-binding abilities of this domain (24Tanaka M. Koyama M. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Nickel M. Lund-Katz S. Saito H. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 2172-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 2 and Table 1 for FC efflux from BHK cells (which express human ABCA1) to the same human and mouse apoA-I domains reveal similar trends to those described above for experiments with J774 cells. It follows that mouse and human ABCA1 respond similarly to alterations in apoA-I structure. Again, the data in Fig. 2A indicate that the contributions of the two tertiary structure domains in the intact human apoA-I molecule are greater than their combined contributions when added separately to the cells. Fig. 2B demonstrates that the isolated mouse N-terminal domain, apoA-I 1–186(M), is more efficient at promoting FC efflux than WT mouse apoA-I. Human/mouse hybrid apoA-I molecules in which the N- and C-terminal domains are interchanged were employed to further investigate the domain contributions to FC efflux via ABCA1. Substituting the mouse C-terminal domain into human apoA-I to create apoA-I H1–189M187–240 has little effect on FC efflux from J774 cells (Fig. 3A and Table 1). However, the increase in Km for efflux from BHK cells (Fig. 3B) reduces the relative catalytic efficiency to a value of 0.25 (Table 1); the reasons for this effect are not entirely clear, but perhaps the composition of the BHK cell plasma membrane makes the system more sensitive to the increase in polarity of the C-terminal domain in the hybrid human apoA-I molecule. Substitution of the human C-terminal domain into the mouse apoA-I molecule, to give the hybrid apoA-I M1–186H190–243, increases the relative catalytic efficiency ∼3-fold relative to WT apoA-I (M) and ∼2-fold relative to WT apoA-I (H) for both cell types (Table 1). The gel filtration profiles in Fig. 4A confirm prior work with J774 murine macrophages showing that the apoA-I (H)/ABCA1 reaction in this system leads to the appearance in the extracellular medium of a heterogeneous population of apoA-I-containing nascent HDL particles (16Liu L.

SHP2 recruitment contributes to the ability of RET to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and promote survival and neurite outgrowth in primary neurons. Furthermore, we find that activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by forskolin reduces the recruitment of SHP2 to RET and negatively affects ligand-mediated neurite outgrowth. In agreement with this, mutation of Ser696, a known PKA phosphorylation site in RET, enhances SHP2 binding to the receptor and eliminates the effect of forskolin on ligand-induced outgrowth. Together, these findings establish SHP2 as a novel positive regulator of the neurotrophic activities of RET and reveal Tyr687 as a critical platform for integration of RET and PKA signals.

Although a number of genes have been reported to be under the control of p38, the basic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by this SAPK remain uncharacterized. Here we show that in response to osmotic shock, anisomycin- or TNFα-activated p38 SAPK is recruited to stress-induced genes. The MAPKK MKK6 is also found at stress-responsive promoters. The recruitment of RNA polymerase II complex to the target promoters requires p38 activity. Moreover, when tethered to DNA as a LexA fusion protein, p38 activates transcription in a stress-regulated manner. Thus, p38 activity allows for recruitment of RNA polymerase and transcription initiation. p38 directly phosphorylates and interacts with the transcription factor Elk1. p38 activity is necessary for the recruitment of Elk1 to the c-Fos promoter, and knocking down Elk1 by siRNAs compromises both p38 recruitment to the c-Fos promoter and c-Fos transcriptional up-regulation upon osmostress. In addition, p38 recruitment to the osmoinducible gene Cox2 and the TNFα target gene IL8 is mediated by the transcription factors AP1 and NFκB, respectively. Therefore, anchoring of active SAPK to target genes is mediated by transcription factors. The presence of active p38 at open reading frames also suggests the involvement of the SAPK in elongation.

Taken together, SAPK recruitment to target genes appears to be a broad mechanism to regulate transcription that has been preserved from yeast to mammals. Exposure to stress requires rapid and efficient adaptive responses to maximize cell survival. Cells have signal transduction systems designed to produce rapid outcomes in response to extracellular stimuli. Eukaryotic organisms contain multiple MAPK families organized in discrete cascades that respond to mitogens and stress. A prototype member of the SAPK family is the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), which plays an essential role in proper cell adaptation to extracellular stimuli (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar, 2Wagner E.F. Nebreda A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). Both mitogenic (MAPKs) and stress activated protein kinases (SAPKs) have been widely reported to regulate gene expression through the direct phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, which are responsible for the activation of target genes. However, this canonical molecular mechanism of gene expression regulation has been challenged by numerous studies showing that activated MAPKs regulate gene expression by using a broad range of molecular mechanisms (3Whitmarsh A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In yeast, activation upon osmostress of the SAPK Hog1, the homolog of the mammalian p38 SAPKs, results in major reprogramming of the gene expression capacity of cells by regulation of several steps of the transcription process. Active Hog1 not only directly phosphorylates several transcription factors to alter their activities (4Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Ariño J. Serrano R. Posas F.

Once at the promoters, Hog1 serves as a platform to recruit general transcription factors, chromatin-modifying activities, and RNA Pol II (7Alepuz P.M. de Nadal E. Zapater M. Ammerer G. Posas F.

In addition, Hog1 plays a role during elongation when recruited at open reading frames (ORFs) (9Proft M. Mas G. de Nadal E. Vendrell A. Noriega N. Struhl K. Posas F. Mol.

To date, the knowledge of how higher eukaryote MAPKs regulate gene expression is more limited, in part due to the higher complexity imposed by the presence of at least three parallel MAPKs cascades: the JNK, p38 SAPK, and ERK cascades, capable of responding to a broad range of environmental stresses and physiological stimuli (11Zhang Y. Dong C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2771-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, it is known that there is a strong structural and functional preservation of MAP kinases and adaptive responses from yeast to mammals (12Sheikh-Hamad D. Gustin M.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 287: F1102-F1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Of note, recruitment to chromatin of ERK MAPK together and other signaling kinases have been reported (13Vicent G.P.

Also, there is evidence that p38 is recruited to muscle-specific gene promoters during muscle development suggesting that indeed SAPKs might play an important role at the chromatin (16Simone C. Forcales S.V. Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N. Latella L. Puri P.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). A recent wide-genome study has shown that osmostress-activated p38 SAPK induces a complex time-dependent gene expression pattern (17Ferreiro I. Joaquin M. Islam A. Gomez-Lopez G. Barragan M. Lombardía L. Domínguez O. Pisano D. Lopez-Bigas N. Nebreda A.R. Posas F. BMC Genomics. 2010; 11: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although it has been well established that p38 SAPK contributes to the stabilization of 3′ AU-rich mRNAs (18Dean J.L. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), the fact that stress-induced p38 SAPK quickly promotes the accumulation of certain mRNAs suggests that p38 SAPK activation directly up-regulates stress-induced gene transcription. The evidence that yeast Hog1 directly binds to stress-induced gene promoters to drive transcription prompted us to ask whether similar mechanisms of gene expression control could be working in mammalian cells. In contrast to yeast Hog1, activation of mammalian p38 occurs in response to several stimuli. Osmostress signaling is mediated by the MAP3K MEKK4/MTK1 (19Takekawa M. Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A more recent study has shown that osmostress promotes the recruitment of the malcavernin/OSM protein to membrane ruffles, where it serves as a scaffold that brings together the MAP3K MEKK3 with the upstream activator Rac (20Uhlik M.T. Abell A.N. Johnson N.L. Sun W. Cuevas B.D. Lobel-Rice K.E. Horne E.A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Johnson G.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Upon TNFα binding to the TNF receptor, a cascade of events leads to the activation of a plethora of MAP3Ks such as NIK, MEKK1, and ASK1(21Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). On the other hand, anisomycin binding to ribosomes induces a ribotoxic stress signaling pathway involving the MAP3K MLK7/ZAK(22Wang X. Mader M.M. Toth J.E. Yu X. Jin N. Campbell R.M. Smallwood J.K. Christe M.E. Chatterjee A. Goodson Jr., T.J. Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Bloem L.J. J. Biol.

Here, we show that regardless the signaling pathway used to activate p38, this SAPK is recruited to stress-responsive genes mediating the recruitment of RNA polymerase II complex. In response to osmostress, p38 is recruited and regulates gene expression of genes such as c-Fos by binding to Elk1 transcription factor, which serve as anchor to locate p38 SAPK activity to stress-responsive promoters. We furthered extended our observations to AP1 and NFκB as anchors for p38. Moreover, stress-activated p38 SAPK was also found to be recruited to ORFs. Altogether, p38 SAPK recruitment to stress-induced promoters through the interaction with a specific transcription factor and to the ORFs appears to be a rather common molecular mechanism used to regulate gene expression that has been preserved throughout evolution from yeast to mammals.

HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids or small interference RNAs (siRNAs) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) or DharmaFECT Duo Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon) respectively according to the manufacturer's directions for at least 48 h before treatments and harvesting. mouse embryonic fibroblast. The following plasmids were used: pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), pEFmlinkMKK6DD was obtained from Dr. A. R. Nebreda (CNIO, Madrid), pCDNA3-3HA-p38α was provided by Dr. D. Engelberg (The Hebrew University of Israel, Jerusalem), pELK1-Flag was gifted by Dr. A. Fellicielo (Università Federico II, Naples), pL8G5luc was donated by Dr. T. C. Südhof (Stanford University School of Medicine, Standford, CA), pCDNA3-LexA-DBD (expressing the LexA DNA binding domain) was generated from pCDNA3-LexA-Vp16 by removing the VP16 fragment by double digestion with KspI and BamHI followed by klenow dNTP fill-in and T4 ligase re-ligation; pCDNA3-LexA-DBD-p38α was generated by cloning the mouse p38α SAPK in-frame with the LexA-DBD. Briefly the p38α SAPK was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides containing flanking KspI and BamHI restriction sites for directional cloning into the KspI- and BamHI-digested pCDNA3-LexA-Vp16. p38α-DsRed and p38α-GFP were obtained by cloning mouse p38α in-frame with the fluorescent protein markers DsRed and GFP, respectively. All cloned constructs were checked by sequencing. The following siRNAs were used: Elk1 (sc-35290) and GFP (sc-45924) siRNAs were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; the c-Jun siRNA (6203) was from Cell Signaling. The antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-HA, mouse monoclonal anti-Myc, mouse monoclonal anti-Flag (Sigma, S2220), mouse monoclonal anti-RNA Pol II (Abcam, clone 8WG16), rabbit polyclonal anti-IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-371), rabbit polyclonal anti-p38α SAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-535), rabbit monoclonal anti-pp38 SAPK (Cell Signaling, clone 3D7), rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK (Cell Signaling, 9252), rabbit polyclonal anti-ppJNK (Cell Signaling, clone 81E11), mouse monoclonal anti-ppERK (Cell Signaling, clone E10), rabbit monoclonal anti-ERK (Cell Signaling, clone 137F5), rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Jun (Cell Signaling, clone 60A8) and rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP27 (Stressgen, SPA-523). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 500 μl of IP/lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, supplemented with the protease inhibitors 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were then cleared by microcentrifugation. A tenth of the lysate was retained as a whole cell extract input, and the remaining 90% was subjected to immunoprecipitation. Briefly, protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were washed twice with cold IP/lysis buffer and incubated with the appropriate antibody at 4 °C for at least 1 h. The protein A-Sepharose beads conjugated to the antibodies were then added to cleared cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C with orbital agitation. Immunoprecipitates were then washed four times with cold IP/lysis buffer before the addition of SDS-loading buffer. Both whole cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), and further analyzed by Western blotting. Proteins were visualized with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or an anti-mouse antibodies and the Enhanced Chemiluminiscence kit (GE Healthcare). Total RNA was purified from HeLa cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of total RNA was then converted to cDNA using the reverse transcriptase Superscript kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mRNA levels of the c-Fos, Elk1, interleukin 8 (IL8), and Cox2 were analyzed by PCR or real-time PCR using a DNA Biosystems 7700 sequence detector and the SYBR Green kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCRs were performed in triplicates and referenced to the GAPDH mRNA levels. The following oligonucleotides were designed with Primer3 (25Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): c-Fos ORF For: AAAAGGAGAATCCGAAGGGA and Rev: GCAACCCACAGAGTACCTAC; Elk1 ORF For: TTTAATGGGTTGGGAGTCTT and Rev: AGACAAAGGAATGGCTTCTC; IL8 ORF) For: TGCCTGACTTAAGGAATCAT, and Rev: CAAAAACTTCTCCACAACCC; Cox2 ORF For: AACATTTTTTTGAAAATTTCAG Rev: ATCTCTAATGGATTCTTCTTACTCAC. Treated HeLa cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Cell lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation. Luciferase reporter activity was measured from cell supernatants using a Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) and a Microlumat LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies). The total amount of protein found in the cell extracts was measured with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Protein-corrected luciferase reporter activities were performed in triplicates and represented as a fold-induction over the pCDNA3-LexA-DBD signal, which was considered as the basal. Protein-DNA interactions were cross-linked in cell cultures by the direct addition of 1% (v/v) formaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 0.125 m glycine for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and harvested in PBS containing 4 μg/ml Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Pelleted cells were then lysed on ice for 10 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mm EDTA containing 4 μg/ml of Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture. Lysates were sonicated in a Bioruptor water bath (Diagenode) set at full power with 0.5 min sonication/0.5 min resting intervals at 4 °C for 12 min. Next samples were centrifuged, and the chromatin was quantified from the supernatants with a nanodrop apparatus. Under these sonication conditions, DNA was fragmented in a range of 200–700 bp. 10% of the volume was retained as an input, and ∼40 μg of chromatin was used per IP and diluted in ChIP buffer (6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl supplemented with 4 μg/ml Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture). Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were conjugated by orbital mixing overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody before being added to the diluted cell extracts. After a further overnight incubation at 4 °C, dynabeads were serially washed with the following buffers: low ionic strength (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0. 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), high ionic strength (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0. 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA) and TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA). Protein-DNA complexes were eluted from the dynabeads by incubation at room temperature with elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS). Protein-DNA cross-linking was reversed by adding 200 mm NaCl and incubated for 4 h at 65 °C in 200 mm NaCl followed by incubation for 1 h at 45 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 20 μg of proteinase K solution (Novagen). DNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated. Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were analyzed by PCR or real-time PCR as described above Real-time PCRs were performed in triplicates, referenced to the inputs, and represented as fold induction over the mock transfected cells, which was considered as the basal binding. Negative controls were also made in the absence of DNA to rule out nonspecific DNA amplifications. In addition, in all experiments that we performed ChIPs on tagged proteins (either HA or Myc), we always carried out a mock ChIP where the corresponding empty vector plasmid had been transfected. The mock sample is precipitated using the same antibody as the rest of the ChIPs. In that case, any amplification coming from the mock IP is regarded as background. In the case that an endogenous protein is ChIPed, then we carried out either a no-antibody control or an anti-tubulin antibody. In ChIP experiments carried out in this study to detect binding of the endogenous p38 SAPK in wild-type MEFs as well as in MEFs cells lacking p38α, we used the same antibody (anti-p38) in both types of cells. PCR primers for individual genes were designed with Primer3 (25Rozen S. Skaletsky H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 132: 365-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate DNA fragments between 100 and 200 base pairs. The sequences used are the followings: c-Fos promoter For: GAGCAGTTCCCGTCAATCC and Rev: GCATTTCGCAGTTCCTGTCT; Cox2 promoter For: CCCCTCTGCTCCCAAATT and Rev: CGCTCACTGCAAGTCGTAT; IL8 promoter, For: GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAATC and Rev: TTCCTTCCGGTGGTTTCTTC; GAPDH promoter For: TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG, and Rev: TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA. Data analysis was carried out with Prism software (GraphPad). Responses among different treatments were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. The results are presented as means ± S.D. To understand how p38 SAPK promotes gene transcription, we focused our studies on c-Fos transcription regulation upon osmotress. The treatment of HeLa cells with 100 mm NaCl provoked a rapid increase of phosphorylated p38 SAPK with a peak between 45′ and 60′ which steadily decreased over time (Fig. 1A). p38 SAPK phosphorylation correlated with its accumulation into the nucleus (supplemental Fig. S1). Importantly, osmostress specifically induced p38 phosphorylation and activation, as assessed by monitoring the p38 SAPK downstream target HSP27, with neither affecting the phosphorylation of JNK nor ERK under the experimental conditions tested (Fig. 1B). Notably, osmostress-induced p38 activation correlated with c-Fos mRNA accumulation. c-Fos induction was fully prevented by pretreating HeLa cells with the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580. Osmostress did not have any effect on the mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH which was used as a control (Fig. 1C). These results clearly show that osmostress up-regulates c-Fos transcription in a p38 SAPK-dependent manner. To assess whether binding of p38 was occurring at stress-regulated genes, we analyzed the recruitment of p38 at c-Fos. We transfected HeLa cells with a HA-tagged p38 and performed a ChIP analysis using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody to specifically pull down p38. Osmostress specifically enhanced the recruitment of p38 at the c-Fos promoter (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the activity of p38 was essential for this process because the addition of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 fully prevented osmostress-induced p38 recruitment at the c-Fos promoter (Fig. 2A). In yeast, it has also been shown that the p38 SAPK ortholog Hog1 is recruited at osmostress-induced gene ORFs in addition to promoters (8de Nadal E. Posas F. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Proft M. Mas G. de Nadal E. Vendrell A. Noriega N. Struhl K. Posas F. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Then, we monitored the presence of p38 SAPK at the coding regions of c-Fos and found that p38 was also present at ORFs. Notably, the presence of p38 at the ORF was also dependent on its activity because it was abolished by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 2A). Therefore, p38 is recruited to both promoter and ORF regions of stress-responsive genes such as c-Fos. Previous reports have shown that MEK1 is recruited to ERK dependent genes (26Lawrence M.C. McGlynn K. Shao C. Duan L. Naziruddin B. Levy M.F. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13315-13320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We then assessed whether MKK6, a MAPKK for p38, is able to bind to stress-responsive genes. We performed ChIP assays monitoring Myc-tagged MKK6 and found that the MAP2K is able to bind to c-Fos and IL8 also in response to high osmolarity. Importantly, binding of MKK6 is also abolished in the presence of SB203580 (Fig. 2B). Although this binding was weak, it is consistently observed in several independent experiments (Fig. 2C). To further characterize the binding of p38 at c-Fos in response to osmostress, we treated wild-type and p38α knockout MEFs with osmostress and ChIP p38 using a specific anti-p38α antibody. NaCl cell treatment specifically induced the recruitment of the endogenous p38 SAPK to the mouse c-Fos promoter after 45′ of salt addition on wild-type MEFs but not in p38α knockout MEFs (Fig. 2D). p38 was not recruited to the GAPDH housekeeping gene promoter (Fig. 2D). Therefore, p38 binds at the c-Fos osmostress-responsive promoter in response to high osmolarity. Transcription initiation requires the loading of the RNA Pol II and the basal transcription machinery to promoters. In addition, we have previously shown that p38 and RNA Pol II interact in vivo (7Alepuz P.M. de Nadal E. Zapater M. Ammerer G. Posas F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2433-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and therefore it might be a possibility that recruiting activated p38 SAPK to stress-induced gene promoters, such as the c-Fos promoter, is a step necessary to induce gene transcription. To confirm that osmostress specifically induced the RNA Pol II recruitment at c-Fos promoter, we performed a ChIP analysis on HeLa cells stressed with NaCl for 15′ and 30′ using a specific RNA Pol II monoclonal antibody. RNA Pol II was not present at the c-Fos promoter under non-stress conditions. Meanwhile, the addition of salt induced the recruitment of the RNA Pol II to the c-Fos promoter after 30′ of osmostress. In contrast to c-Fos, RNA pol II was always present at the promoter of the housekeeping gene GAPDH (Fig. 3A). We then assessed whether the presence of RNA Pol II required p38 activity. HeLa cells were pretreated with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 prior to salt addition, and then RNA Pol II recruitment to the c-Fos promoter was followed by ChIP. Binding of RNA Pol II was completely abolished in cells with inhibited p38 (Fig. 3B). Altogether, RNA Pol II recruitment at the osmostress-induced c-Fos promoter correlates with transcription activation and accumulation of the c-Fos mRNA in a p38-dependent manner. We next addressed whether tethering p38 to a promoter was sufficient to stimulate gene expression. We fused full-length p38 to the LexA DNA binding domain. The LexA-p38 fusion protein was then co-transfected in HeLa cells in the presence of an artificial gene promoter carrying 6× LexA DNA binding sites upstream of the Luciferase reporter. LexA-p38 activation was induced either by co-transfecting the active p38 MAPKK MKK6DD or by treating cells with 100 mm NaCl. Ectopically expression of MKK6DD and osmostress specifically induced the phosphorylation of both the endogenous p38 SAPK and the LexA-p38 SAPK similarly (Fig, 4A) without either affecting the phosphorylation of JNK or ERK (data not shown). Tethering LexA-p38 at the reporter gene did not produce a significant increase in the luciferase reporter activity, which indicates that binding of p38 to a gene promoter is not sufficient to activate gene transcription. However, both MKK6DD and osmostress induced the transcriptional activity of the LexA-p38 fusion protein (Fig. 4). Therefore, once recruited at the promoter, active p38 is able to induce gene expression. Correspondingly, impairing p38 SAPK activation by addition of the p38 inhibitor (Birb 796) prevented the LexA-Luc gene promoter activation (Fig. 4). Thus, active promoter-bound SAPK kinase is sufficient to drive gene transcription. Because p38 does not have a defined DNA binding domain, its binding to gene promoters might not be direct. This prompted us to ask how p38 was recruited to the c-Fos promoter. It has been shown that the c-Fos promoter can be regulated by several transcription factors which respond to a broad range of cell stimuli (27Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Among those transcription factors, the Elk1 transcription factor had previously been shown to be targeted by MAPKs (28Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 29Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus we first asked whether p38 SAPK and Elk1 could interact with each other. We co-transfected HeLa cells with HA-tagged p38 and Flag-tagged Elk1 and performed two immunoprecipitations either with anti-HA or anti-Flag specific monoclonal antibodies. The transcription factor Elk1 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with p38 MAPK and the p38 MAPK co-immunoprecipitated with Elk1 indicating that both proteins can interact with each other in vivo (Fig. 5A). Such an interaction suggested that Elk1 might be a substrate for p38. To address this question we co-transfected HeLa cells with HA-tagged p38 and Flag-tagged Elk1 in the absence or presence of the constitutive active p38 MAPKK MKK6DD. Elk1 phosphorylation status was analyzed by following the change in the electrophoretic mobility of the Elk1 protein on a SDS/PAGE gel by Western blot using the anti-Flag antibody. Indeed p38 SAPK activation produced a slower migrating band corresponding to phosphorylated Elk1 protein. Notably, the phosphorylation of Elk1 was fully blocked by treating the cells with a specific p38 inhibitor (Birb 0796). We then assessed whether osmostress also induced Elk1 phosphorylation. Cells were treated for 30 or 60 min with 100 mm NaCl in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitor (Birb 0796), and Elk1 was monitored as before. As shown in Fig. 5B, an osmotic shock was also able to induce the phosphorylation of Elk1 protein in a p38-dependent"
https://openalex.org/W2134446796,"Ligand-induced dimerization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB-1/EGFR) involves conformational changes that expose an extracellular dimerization interface. Subsequent alterations within the cytoplasmic kinase domain, which culminate in tyrosine phosphorylation, are less understood. Our study addressed this question by using two strategies: a chimeric receptor approach employed ErbB-3, whose defective kinase domain was replaced by the respective part of EGFR. The implanted full-length kinase, unlike its subdomains, conferred dimerization and catalysis. The data infer that the kinase function of EGFR is restrained by the carboxyl tail; once grafted distally to the ectopic tail of ErbB-3, the kinase domain acquires quasi-dimerization and activation. In an attempt to alternatively refold the cytoplasmic tail, our other approach employed kinase inhibitors. Biophysical measurements and covalent cross-linking analyses showed that inhibitors targeting the active conformation of EGFR, in contrast to a compound recognizing the inactive conformation, induce quasi-dimers in a manner similar to the chimeric ErbB-3 molecule. Collectively, these observations unveil kinase domain-mediated quasi-dimers, which are regulated by an autoinhibitory carboxyl tail. On the basis of these observations, we propose that quasi-dimers precede formation of ligand-induced, fully active dimers, which are stabilized by both extracellular and intracellular receptor-receptor interactions."

To further understand the signaling and regulatory network of ethylene, we used a phenotype-based screening strategy to identify chemical compounds interfering with the ethylene response in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. By screening a collection of 10,000 structurally diverse small molecules, we identified compounds suppressing the constitutive triple response phenotype in the ethylene overproducer mutant <i>eto1-4</i>. The compounds reduced the expression of a reporter gene responsive to ethylene and the otherwise elevated level of ethylene in <i>eto1-4</i>. Structure and function analysis revealed that the compounds contained a quinazolinone backbone. Further studies with genetic mutants and transgenic plants involved in the ethylene pathway showed that the compounds inhibited ethylene biosynthesis at the step of converting <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by ACC synthase. Biochemical studies with <i>in vitro</i> activity assay and enzyme kinetics analysis indicated that a representative compound was an uncompetitive inhibitor of ACC synthase. Finally, global gene expression profiling uncovered a significant number of genes that were co-regulated by the compounds and aminoethoxyvinylglycine, a potent inhibitor of ACC synthase.

https://openalex.org/W2148984531,"The corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2a (CRF2(a)R) belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors.

Vale W.W. Dautzenberg F.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The CRF1R is expressed mainly in the anterior pituitary and plays a central role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis in mammals (3Denver R.J. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2009; 1163: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It binds CRF with high affinity and mediates ACTH release from the pituitary leading to cortisol biosynthesis in the adrenal cortex. A large body of evidence points to a major role of the receptor in mediating CRF effects in anxiety and depressive disorders (4Hauger R.L. Risbrough V. Oakley R.H. Olivares-Reyes J.A.

Des. 2009; 15: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In the case of the CRF2R, three splice variants have been described as follows: the CRF2(a)R, CRF2(b)R, and CRF2(c)R. All splice variants bind CRF with low affinity and the urocortins 1–3 with high affinity. They are involved in the regulation of feeding behavior (7Spina M. Merlo-Pich E. Chan R.K. Basso A.M. Rivier J. Vale W. Koob G.F. Science. 1996; 273: 1561-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) and in recovery from a stress response (8Coste S.C. Kesterson R.A. Heldwein K.A. Stevens S.L.

Genet. 2000; 24: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). It is likely that they are also involved in modulating anxiety-related behavior.Both the CRF1R and the CRF2(a)R usually couple to the Gs/adenylyl cyclase system and consequently increase cytosolic cAMP as a second messenger. However, a promiscuous coupling behavior was described previously in particular for the CRF1R involving also G proteins of the Gi, Go, and Gq families (9Grammatopoulos D.K. Dai Y. Randeva H.S.

Dautzenberg F.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the case of the CRF1R, coupling to Gs at low agonist occupancy and to Gi at high occupancy leads to a typical bell-shaped concentration-response curve in cAMP accumulation assays (12Milan-Lobo L. Gsandtner I. Gaubitzer E. Rünzler D. Buchmayer F. Köhler G. Bonci A. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 1196-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).The CRF receptors belong to the small group of GPCRs (5–10%) possessing putative N-terminal signal peptides that are cleaved off after mediating the ER targeting/insertion process (13Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Higy M. Junne T. Spiess M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12716-12722Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The majority (90–95%) of the GPCRs do not possess cleavable signal peptides. Here, one of the transmembrane helices of the mature receptors (usually TM1) mediates ER targeting/insertion as an uncleaved signal anchor sequence (13Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The reason why some membrane proteins, including GPCRs, require additional signal peptides, whereas others do not, is not completely understood.An initial function of a signal sequence (cleaved signal peptide or uncleaved signal anchor sequence) is to mediate targeting of the nascent chain to the translocon complex of the ER by binding the signal recognition particle. Moreover, the signal sequence opens the Sec61 protein-conducting channel to integrate the nascent chain into the bilayer. In the case of the CRF1R and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, it was shown by deletion mutants that a cleavable signal peptide is indeed necessary for efficient receptor biosynthesis at the ER membrane (15Alken M.

J. 2005; 390: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Huang Y. Wilkinson G. Willars G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 159: 237-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, additional functions were described for other GPCRs. In the case of the endothelin B receptor, the signal peptide facilitated N tail translocation across the ER membrane (17Köchl R. Alken M. Rutz C. Krause G. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16131-16138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The CRF(2a)R, in contrast, possesses an uncleaved pseudo signal peptide that is unable to mediate ER targeting/insertion, remains uncleaved at the extracellular mature N tail of the receptor, and thus forms an additional hydrophobic domain (18Rutz C. Renner A. Alken M. Schulz K. Beyermann M. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24910-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conventional signal peptide functions are blocked in the pseudo signal peptide by a single amino acid residue (Asn13), and conversion to a conventional cleaved signal peptide is achieved by mutation of this residue (18Rutz C. Renner A. Alken M. Schulz K. Beyermann M. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24910-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To date, the pseudo signal peptide of the CRF2(a)R is a unique extracellular domain in the GPCR protein family. One function of the pseudo signal peptide may be to increase the portion of correctly folded receptors in the early secretory pathway (18Rutz C. Renner A. Alken M. Schulz K. Beyermann M. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24910-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we have assessed its functions in comparison with the conventional signal peptide of the homologous CRF1R. We show that the presence of the pseudo signal peptide leads to a very low receptor expression. Moreover, although the presence of the pseudo signal peptide did not affect coupling to the Gs protein, Gi coupling of the CRF2(a)R was impaired.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe cDNA encoding the rat CRF1R and CRF2(a)R was a gift from U.

All other reagents were from Sigma. Data of the cAMP RIA were analyzed using the program RadLig Software 6.0 (Cambridge, UK) and GraphPad Prism version 3.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego).DNA ManipulationsStandard DNA manipulations were carried out according to the handbooks of Sambrook and Russel (19Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the plasmid constructs were verified using the FS dye terminator kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany).Plasmid ConstructsThe constructs used in this study are schematically shown in Fig. 1 (details of the cloning procedures on request).Marker Protein FusionsConstructs CRF2(a).NT and CRF1.NT represent GFP fusions to the N tails of the CRF2(a)R (position Ala121) and the CRF1R (position Ala119), respectively, in the vector pSecTag2A. In construct SP1-CRF2(a).NT, the pseudo signal peptide of the CRF2(a)R was replaced by the conventional signal peptide of the CRF1R. Conversely, in construct SP2-CRF1.NT, the signal peptide of the CRF1R was replaced by the pseudo signal peptide of the CRF2(a)R. In construct pN13A-CRF2(a), residue Asn13 of the CRF2(a).NT construct was replaced by an alanine residue to convert the pseudo signal peptide into a conventional, cleaved signal peptide (18Rutz C. Renner A. Alken M. Schulz K. Beyermann M. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24910-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In all marker protein fusion constructs, an additional C-terminal His6 sequence was added to allow their purification.Full-length Receptor ConstructsPlasmids pCRF2(a)R and pCRF1R encode the full-length CRF2(a)R and CRF1R in the vector plasmid pEGFP-N1. The receptors were C-terminally tagged with a GFP moiety at position Val411 (CRF2(a)R) and Thr413 (CRF1R) thereby deleting the stop codons. Plasmids pΔSP-CRF2(a)R and pΔSP-CRF1R encode the corresponding signal peptide deletion mutants. Plasmids pSP1-CRF2(a)R and pSP2-CRF1R encode the corresponding signal peptide swap mutants. In construct pN13A-CRF2(a)R, the pseudo signal peptide of the CRF2(a)R was converted to a conventional signal peptide (see above).Cell Culture and TransfectionCells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) and mouse anterior pituitary tumor cells (AtT-20 cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Transfection of the cells with LipofectamineTM 2000 and PEI was carried out according to the supplier's recommendations.Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy, Colocalization of Constructs with Plasma Membrane Marker Trypan Blue1.5 × 105 HEK 293 cells grown for 24 h in a 35-mm diameter dish containing a poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip were transfected with 0.8 μg of plasmid DNA and PEI according to the supplier's recommendations. Cells were incubated overnight, washed once with PBS, and transferred immediately into a self-made chamber (details on request). Cells were covered with 1 ml of PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and trypan blue was added to a final concentration of 0.05%. After 1 min of staining, GFP and trypan blue fluorescence signals were visualized at room temperature on a Zeiss LSM510-META inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (objective lens, ×100/1.3 oil; optical section, <0.8 μm; multitrack mode; GFP, λexc, 488 nm, argon laser; BP filter, 500–530 nm; trypan blue; λexc, 543 nm HeNe laser; LP filter, 560 nm). The overlay of both signals was computed using the Zeiss LSM510 acquisition software (release 3.2 SP2). Images were imported into Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc.), and contrast was adjusted to approximate the original image. The overlay of the signals was computed, and the images were processed as described previously above.Quantification of Plasma Membrane GFP Fluorescence Intensities by Automated MicroscopyFor quantification of the plasma membrane fluorescence signals of the receptor, 7 × 104 HEK 293 cells were grown for 24 h on 24-well microtiter plates and transfected with PEI according to the supplier's recommendations. Cells were incubated overnight, and the cell culture medium was removed, and the nuclei of the cells were stained for 30 min with 1 μm Hoechst-33342 diluted in medium. The staining solution was removed, and the plasma membranes were stained for 1 min with 0.1% (w/v) trypan blue diluted in PBS. After staining, plates were transferred to a Cellomics Array Scan VTI automated microscope and analyzed using the Array Scan VTI software (version 5.6.1.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Hoechst-33342 and trypan blue fluorescence signals were used to define nuclei and plasma membrane masks, respectively. Intracellular masks were defined as the difference between plasma membrane and nuclei masks. For each well, colocalization of the GFP fluorescence signals of the receptor with the plasma membrane and intracellular masks was measured for 1 × 103 transfected cells using the Array Scan VTI software. In addition to automated microscopy, plasma membrane expression of the receptor constructs was also quantified by conventional cell surface biotinylation assays as described previously (20Wüller S. Wiesner B. Löffler A. Furkert J. Krause G. Hermosilla R. Schaefer M. Schuelein R. Rosenthal W. Oksche A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47254-47263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Quantification of Plasma Membrane GFP Fluorescence Intensities by Confocal LSM Microscopy or Flow Cytometry MeasurementsPlasma membrane GFP fluorescence signals of individual transiently transfected HEK 293 cells were quantified by confocal LSM microscopy as described previously (15Alken M. Rutz C. Köchl R. Donalies U. Oueslati M. Furkert J. Wietfeld D. Hermosilla R. Scholz A. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GFP fluorescence signals were colocalized with the plasma membrane marker trypan blue, and their intensity was quantified using an 8-bit grayscale and the Zeiss LSM510 acquisition software (release 3.2 SP2). Quantification of the plasma membrane GFP fluorescence signals was carried out with at least 20 cells. For the flow cytometry measurements, 1 × 106 stably transfected HEK 293 cells were grown on 12-well plates for 48 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were transferred in PBS into a flow cytometry tube and incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-CRF1R antibody (1:400, 30 min, 4 °C) directed against the N tail of the receptor. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, 30 min, 4 °C). Cell surface fluorescence signals of 104 cells were analyzed using a FACSCanto II apparatus (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FCS Express software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles). Nontransfected HEK 293 cells were used in the measurements to subtract the fluorescence background.Quantitative Detection of Secreted GFP Marker Protein FusionsSecreted GFP marker proteins from transiently transfected HEK 293 cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting and fluorimetric measurements as described previously (15Alken M. Rutz C. Köchl R. Donalies U. Oueslati M. Furkert J. Wietfeld D. Hermosilla R. Scholz A. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were isolated from the cell culture medium via their His tag using TALON metal affinity resin beads. Proteins were quantified either by measuring their GFP signals fluorimetrically (λexc = 488 nm, λem = 507 nm) or by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:4,000) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG 1:1,500).Immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged Full-length Receptor Constructs; Treatment with PNGaseF and/or EndoH; Detection of Coimmunoprecipitated CalnexinThe previously described immunoprecipitation procedure was used (18Rutz C. Renner A. Alken M. Schulz K. Beyermann M. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24910-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, receptors were precipitated from transiently transfected HEK 293 cells using the rabbit anti-GFP antiserum 02. Optional treatment of the precipitated receptors with EndoH or PNGaseF was carried out according to the supplier's recommendations. Receptors were detected by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:4,000) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1,500). Coprecipitated calnexin was detected using a polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (1:1,000) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000).Cell Surface Biotinylation AssayCell surface proteins were labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin as described previously (15Alken M. Rutz C. Köchl R. Donalies U. Oueslati M. Furkert J. Wietfeld D. Hermosilla R. Scholz A. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Total receptors were precipitated using the rabbit anti-GFP antiserum 02 as described above. Receptors were deglycosylated with PNGaseF according to the supplier's recommendations and analyzed by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting using a polyclonal rabbit anti-biotin antibody (1:5,000, cell surface receptors) and a monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibody (1:4,000, total receptors) on the same blot. Following incubation with secondary antibodies (DyLight 800-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and DyLight 680-conjugated anti-mouse IgG; 1:10,000 each), immunoreactive protein bands were detected using the OdysseyTM infrared imaging system and the application software 2.1 (Li-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).cAMP Accumulation AssayActivation of the full-length receptor constructs was monitored by measuring sauvagine-mediated cAMP accumulation as described previously (cAMP RIA) (21Grantcharova E. Furkert J. Reusch H.P. Krell H.W. Papsdorf G. Beyermann M. Schulein R. Rosenthal W. Oksche A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43933-43941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have analyzed the function of the pseudo signal peptide of the CRF2(a)R in comparison with the conventional signal peptide of the CRF1R. Two results were obtained for the significance of this unique GPCR domain as follows. (i) The presence of the pseudo signal peptide causes a very low cell surface receptor expression. (ii) Moreover, it abolishes Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity.The observed lower cell surface expression is accompanied by an increase in intracellularly retained receptors that are present in their immature form in the early secretory pathway (high mannose and nonglycosylated forms, Fig. 5). These results indicate that the presence of the pseudo signal peptide decreases folding efficiency, consequently leading to more misfolded receptors that are retained by the QCS of the early secretory pathway. Indeed, we could detect a stronger association of the pseudo signal peptide-bearing constructs with the lectin chaperone calnexin (Fig. 6). Molinari and Helenius (24Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the calnexin/calreticulin system of the QCS interacts directly with membrane proteins when an N-glycosylation site is present within the N-terminal 50 residues. The uncleaved pseudo signal peptide introduces an additional asparagine residue that is indeed N-glycosylated (Asn13, see Ref. 18Rutz C. Renner A. Alken M. Schulz K. Beyermann M. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24910-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This may facilitate the observed stronger interaction of unfolded or partially folded receptors with these lectin chaperones. Unfortunately, this hypothesis is difficult to address experimentally because mutation of Asn13 also converts the pseudo signal peptide into a conventional signal peptide that is cleaved off (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) (18Rutz C. Renner A. Alken M. Schulz K. Beyermann M. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24910-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An alternative way by which the pseudo signal peptide may decrease folding efficiency is by impairing N tail translocation during protein integration into the ER membrane by the translocon machinery.The experiments in this study compare the functional significance of the CRF2(a)R pseudo signal peptide with that of the conventional CRF1R signal peptide. Interestingly, deletion of the signal peptide of the CRF2(a)R without replacing it by another sequence leads to a further increase in the amount of immature receptor forms (Ref. 18Rutz C. Renner A. Alken M. Schulz K. Beyermann M. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24910-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; mutant ΔSP-CRF2(a)R). Thus, when the CRF2(a)R is considered alone, the pseudo signal peptide also seems to facilitate folding to a certain extent. These data may be put together as follows. The CRF2(a)R without its pseudo signal peptide or another signal sequence is expressed almost exclusively in its immature form in the early secretory pathway. The presence of the pseudo signal peptide somewhat increases folding efficiency that is, however, still very low in comparison with that mediated by the presence of a conventional signal peptide.The fact that the pseudo signal peptide prevents Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 7) seems not to be due to the decreased cell surface expression caused by this domain. Decreasing cell surface expression of CRF1R to the level of construct SP2-CRF1R still leads to a bell-shaped concentration-response curve (Fig. 8, A–C). Obviously, the presence of the pseudo signal peptide favors receptor conformations that are unable to couple to Gi. Such a function should, however, be independent of ligand binding, because affinities of the CRF2(a)R for both its selective and specific agonists are not influenced by the pseudo signal peptide (18Rutz C. Renner A. Alken M. Schulz K. Beyermann M. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. Schuelein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24910-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that heterodimerization may affect selectivity of GPCRs for the different G proteins. An influence on Gi coupling, for example, was observed upon coexpression of μ- and δ-opioid receptors (25Charles A.C. Mostovskaya N. Asas K. Evans C.J. Dankovich M.L. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26George S.R. Fan T. Xie Z. Tse R. Tam V. Varghese G. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26128-26135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and CCR5/CCR2 chemokine receptors (27Mellado M. Rodríguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. Fernández S. Martín de Ana A. Jones D.R. Torán J.L. Martínez-A C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2497-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). If one speculates that homodimerization may also influence G protein selectivity, the presence of the pseudo signal peptide may prevent receptor dimerization and in turn impair Gi coupling. This speculation should be addressed in a future study.In the case of the CRF2(b)R subtype, it was shown recently that this receptor is able to couple to Gi at high agonist occupancy (12Milan-Lobo L. Gsandtner I. Gaubitzer E. Rünzler D. Buchmayer F. Köhler G. Bonci A. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 1196-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in contrast to the CRF2(a)R subtype studied here. It is long known that signal peptide sequences, even of closely related proteins, have a conserved conformation but do not share sequence homologies (28von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar, 29von Heijne G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Indeed, the pseudo signal peptide of the CRF2(a)R and the corresponding sequence of the CRF2(b)R differ completely in their sequence (MDAALLLSLLEANCSLALA, CRF2(a)R versus MGTPGSLPSAQLLLCLFSLLPVLQVA, CRF2(b)R). Signal peptide prediction by the SignalP 3.0 program (30Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5609) Google Scholar) indicates a cleavage probability of 98% for the CRF2(b)R, and it is thus conceivable that it possesses a conventional signal peptide like the CRF1R.The properties mediated by the pseudo signal peptide of the CRF2(a)R were entirely transferable to the CRF1R in the signal peptide exchange experiments. The sequence may consequently be considered as a novel transport signal negatively influencing receptor processing. The reason why it is advantageous to keep CRF2(a)R expression low by this unique domain remains elusive. However, the fact that the bell-shaped concentration-response curve and thus Gi coupling is also observed in the case of the endogenous CRF1R (Fig. 7B) indicates that the use of these different signal sequences may play a role in vivo.Finally, it is intriguing to speculate that the pseudo signal peptide is part of a novel mechanism regulating cell surface expression of GPCRs. Although the pseudo signal peptide fai"

To better understand these issues, we studied a range of synthetic peptides: specifically those equating to the N1 (residues 23–110) and N2 (23–89) fragments derived from constitutive processing of PrPC and including those representing arbitrarily defined component domains of the N terminus of mouse prion protein.

At pH 5, typical of early endosomes, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation showed the highest affinity binding occurred with N1 and N2, selective for anionic lipid species. Of particular note, the absence of binding by individual peptides representing component domains underscored the importance of the combination of the octapeptide repeat and the N-terminal polybasic regions for effective membrane interaction.

In the present study, we identified CDC-like kinase 2 (CLK2) as a new substrate of AKT activation and elucidated its role in cell survival to ionizing radiation. AKT directly binds to and phosphorylates CLK2 on serine 34 and threonine 127, in vitro and in vivo. CLK2 phosphorylation was detected in HeLa cells overexpressing active AKT. In addition, we demonstrated that ionizing radiation induces CLK2 phosphorylation via AKT activation. In contrast, the suppression of endogenous AKT expression by siRNA inhibited CLK2 phosphorylation in response to 2 gray of γ-ray or insulin. Furthermore, we examined the effect of CLK2 on the survival of irradiated CCD-18Lu cells overexpressing Myc-CLK2. CLK2 overexpression significantly increased cell growth and inhibited cell death induced by 2 gray. The role of CLK2 in cell survival to ionizing radiation was dependent on the phosphorylation of serine 34 and threonine 127.

Ionizing radiation regulates cell survival by activating a variety of signaling cascades, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway.

CLK2 and CLK3 have been shown to phosphorylate serine/arginine-rich proteins of the spliceosomal complex, which control alternative splicing (29Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem.

Therefore, CLK2 may be regulated by a number of kinases and phosphatases. However, the upstream molecules of CLK family kinases are still largely unknown, but may play an important and evolutionarily conserved role in signal transduction.

Given the diverse roles of the AKT pathway in the cellular response to ionizing radiation, it is important to identify new physiological substrates of activated AKT and to elucidate their biological functions. In this study, we first show that CLK2 is a novel substrate for AKT and that CLK2 phosphorylation by activated AKT leads to cell survival following ionizing radiation. Polyclonal anti-CLK2 (N-terminal) antibody was purchased from ABGENT (San Diego, CA), anti-phospho-Ser/Thr from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473), anti-AKT, anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β, and anti-MEK1/2 from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Monoclonal anti-Myc tag and anti-phospho-MEK1/2 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., anti-actin from Sigma, and anti-GAPDH from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). LY294002 and wortmannin were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., and insulin and other chemicals from Sigma. Human lung fibroblast CCD-18Lu cells and HeLa cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). CCD-18Lu and HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 95% air and 5% CO2. The pUSEamp-AKT1 (wild type) and pUSEamp-myr-AKT1 (activated) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The pcDNA3.1-myc-CLK2 was kindly provided by Dr. Sungkwan An. The dominant-negative mutants of human CLK2 cDNAs (S34A, S36A, and T127A) were generated by PCR with WT CLK2 cDNA as the template. Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells per dish 1 day prior to irradiation. Cells were irradiated with a total dose of 0.05, 0.2, or 2 Gy at a dose rate of 0.8 Gy/min using a 137Cs γ-irradiator (IBL 437C, CIS Bio International Co., France). To measure the viability of the irradiated cells, MTT assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). For the determination of cell proliferation, colorimetric immunoassay was performed using Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU colorimetric assay kit (Roche Applied Science). For the quantification of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation was detected using HT TiterTACS Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were lysed with SDS lysis buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue, then boiled for 10 min. Protein contents were measured using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Samples were diluted with the lysis buffer containing 1.28 m β-mercaptoethanol. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween-20 (0.1%, v/v) at 4 °C overnight, then incubated with primary antibody for 3 h, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, protein A/G beads (Pierce) were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and boiled for 3 min after addition of sample loading buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatants were used for immunoblot analysis. For in vitro kinase assays, cell lysates were incubated with anti-CLK2 or anti-Myc antibody at 4 °C for 2 h and then protein A/G beads (Pierce) were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer. To measure CLK2 phosphorylation, in vitro kinase assays were performed using an AKT kinase assay kit with recombinant active AKT protein and immunoprecipitated CLK2, according to the manufacturer's instruction (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) fusion protein was used as a positive control for the AKT kinase assays. To knockdown AKT or CLK2 expression in CCD-18Lu cells, cells were transfected with siRNA SMARTpool AKT1 (Dharmacon Inc., Chicago, IL) or siRNA SMARTpool CLK2 (Dharmacon Inc.) using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), according to the manufacturer's instructions. ON-TARGETplus GAPDH siRNA (Dharmacon Inc.) was used as a control. To identify novel substrates of AKT, we systematically screened the bioinformation data base for proteins containing an AKT consensus phosphorylation site. We identified CLK2 as a new candidate for AKT target protein. First, to determine whether AKT binds to CLK2, we prepared GST recombinant AKT protein and combined it in a reaction with 35S-labeled CLK2 protein. 35S-Labeled p27, one of the AKT-binding proteins, was used as a positive control for the in vitro binding assay. The results of GST pull-down suggested that CLK2 associates with AKT (Fig. 1A). To confirm the in vivo CLK2 binding to AKT, we transfected HeLa cells with myc-CLK2 and then immunoprecipitated endogenous AKT followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibody. Fig. 1B shows that CLK2 was co-immunoprecipitated with AKT, suggesting that AKT interacts directly with CLK2, in vivo. We then asked whether CLK2 is directly phosphorylated by AKT. We transfected myc-CLK2 into HeLa cells, and then immunoprecipitated CLK2 was incubated in vitro with recombinant active AKT. GSK-3 fusion protein was used as a positive control for the AKT kinase assay. We found that CLK2 was phosphorylated by AKT (Fig. 1C). We further examined the association between endogenous CLK2 and endogenous AKT. HeLa cells were transfected with siNon-Target (mock) or siRNA specific for CLK2 (siCLK2) and then the immunoprecipitation assay was performed. Endogenous CLK2 bound to endogenous AKT in parent and mock-control cells, but not in CLK2 knockdown cells (Fig. 1D). To assay for in vivo CLK2 phosphorylation, HeLa cells were transfected with vacant vector, wild type (WT-AKT), or myristoylated active Akt (Myr-AKT) cDNA. The phosphorylation of endogenous CLK2 was then estimated by immunoprecipitation from cells with anti-CLK2 antibody and followed by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-Ser/Thr antibody. As shown in Fig. 1E, CLK2 phosphorylation was detected in HeLa cells overexpressing active AKT. These results suggest that CLK2 is a new substrate of AKT activation. We previously reported that ionizing radiation induces AKT activation and peaks 4 h post-irradiation (20Park H.S. Yun Y. Kim C.S. Yang K.H. Jeong M. Ahn S.K. Jin Y.W. Nam S.Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 88: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We first sought to determine whether ionizing radiation induces CLK2 phosphorylation in normal human lung fibroblast CCD-18Lu cells. Thus, CLK2 phosphorylation was assessed after irradiation with either 0.05 or 2 Gy (Fig. 2A). Both 0.05 and 2 Gy induced the phosphorylation of CLK2, which peaked 4 h post-irradiation. To determine whether CLK2 phosphorylation following ionizing radiation is regulated by AKT activation, we pretreated CCD-18Lu cells with PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 (50 μm) or wortmannin (200 nm), followed by ionizing radiation or insulin (10 μg/ml). Both LY294002 and wortmannin treatment blocked AKT activation in response to low-dose radiation of 0.05 Gy or insulin, and markedly decreased 0.05 Gy- or insulin-induced CLK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Irradiation with 2 Gy γ-ray also induced CLK2 phosphorylation, which was inhibited by LY294002 or wortmannin (Fig. 2C). To confirm that endogenous AKT activation is related to CLK2 phosphorylation induced by radiation or insulin, we transfected CCD-18Lu cells with siNon-Target or siRNA specific for AKT (siAKT) directed against the AKT1 isoform. AKT was markedly depleted 24 h after siAKT transfection (Fig. 3). CLK2 protein levels were not changed in AKT knockdown cells compared with control cells transfected with siNon-Target. However, CLK2 phosphorylation in response to 2 Gy of γ-ray or insulin was decreased in AKT knockdown cells 4 h after irradiation or 15 min after insulin treatment (Fig. 3). To eliminate the possibility of the potential off-target effect by siAKT, we examined whether AKT activation is correlated with the regulation of p-MEK1/2 and MEK1/2 expression, which is an upstream molecule of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The expressions of both p-MEK1/2 and MEK1/2 were not changed by AKT knockdown (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that CLK2 phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation is specifically regulated by AKT activation. In exploring the sequence of CLK2 for putative AKT phosphorylation sites, we found that amino acids 29–35, RRRSRSW, 31–37, RSRSWSS, and 122–128, RRRSRTF, match the AKT consensus phosphorylation motif (Fig. 4A). To identify CLK2 phosphorylation sites, we generated several CLK2 point mutants in which Ser34, Ser36, and Thr127 were converted to alanine (S34A, S36A, and T127A). We transfected HeLa cells with vacant vector, WT, S34A, S36A, and T127A mutants, and then immunoprecipitated Myc-CLK2 was incubated with recombinant active AKT, in vitro. To monitor the phosphorylation status of CLK2, Western blot analysis was then performed with anti-phospho-Ser/Thr antibody (Fig. 4B). CLK2 phosphorylation by active AKT was blocked in S34A and T127A mutants, although CLK2 phosphorylation remained intact in the S36A mutant compared with the wild type (Fig. 4B). To confirm the CLK2 phosphorylation sites in vivo, CCD-18Lu cells were transfected with WT, S34A, S36A, and T127A mutants and then treated with insulin. The S34A and T127A mutants blocked the phosphorylation of CLK2 induced by insulin compared with wild type, although CLK2 phosphorylation was detected in the S36A mutant (Fig. 4C). In addition, interestingly, phosphorylated CLK2 bound to p-AKT, but the mutants of S34A and T127A did not bind to phosphorylated AKT. However, WT-CLK2 and the mutants of S34A, S36A, and T127A bound to AKT (Fig. 4C). We then generated a double mutant of CLK2 in which both Ser34 and Thr127 were converted to alanine (S34A/T127A) and transfected it into CCD-18Lu cells. When the cells were exposed to 2 Gy of γ-ray, CLK2 phosphorylation was not detected in the S34A, T127A, and S34A/T127A mutants (Fig. 4D). Although WT-CLK2 and all of the mutants (S34A, S36A, T127A, and S34A/T127A) bound to AKT, phosphorylated CLK2 at Ser34 and Thr127 sites bound to phosphorylated AKT (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that activated AKT induced by ionizing radiation or insulin binds to CLK2 and potently phosphorylates CLK2 at Ser34 and Thr127 sites. To examine the role of CLK2 on cell survival after irradiation, CCD-18Lu cells were transfected with control vector or myc-CLK2. Western blot was performed to confirm Myc-CLK2 overexpression (Fig. 5A). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were irradiated with γ-rays of 0.05, 0.2, and 2 Gy and cell viability was assayed 48 h later. CLK2 overexpression significantly increased cell growth in untreated and 0.05 or 0.2 Gy-irradiated cells and inhibited cell death in 2 Gy-irradiated cells compared with the vector control (Fig. 5B). We confirmed that CLK2 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation in untreated and irradiated cells (Fig. 5C) and blocked apoptosis induced by high dose radiation of 2 Gy (Fig. 5D). We also investigated whether the depletion of endogenous CLK2 affects radiation sensitivity in CCD-18Lu cells. Cells were transfected with siNon-Target or siRNAs against CLK2 (siCLK2) or GAPDH (siGAPDH), which is used as a control to eliminate the possibility of the potential off-target effect. Western blot was performed to detect the level of target gene depletion by siRNAs (Fig. 5E). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were irradiated with γ-rays of 0.05, 0.2, or 2 Gy and cell viability was assayed 48 h later. GAPDH knockdown did not affect cell viabilities after low dose radiation of 0.05 or 0.2 Gy compared with the mock control, but slightly increased cell death in response to high dose radiation of 2 Gy (Fig. 5F). However, the suppression of endogenous CLK2 significantly inhibited cell growth after irradiation of γ-rays compared with siGAPDH (Fig. 5, F and G) and enhanced apoptosis induced by 2 Gy (Fig. 5H). This results show that CLK2 is correlated with the regulation of cell survival to ionizing radiation. To investigate whether CLK2 phosphorylation affects radiation sensitivity, CCD-18Lu cells were transfected with control vector, WT-CLK2, or CLK2 mutants. We first confirmed the overexpression levels of WT-CLK2 and CLK2 mutants (Fig. 6A). At 24 h after transfection, cells were irradiated with γ-rays of 2 Gy and cell viability was assayed 48 h later. As shown in Fig. 6B, vector control cells exposed to 2 Gy had higher levels of cell death compared with untreated cells. The overexpression of WT-CLK2 or S36A mutant blocked radiation-induced cell death, but S34A, T127A, and S34A/T127A mutants did not have any effect on radiation-induced cell death. To confirm whether the inhibition of cell death by CLK2 phosphorylation is correlated with the regulation of apoptosis, we performed DNA fragmentation assay (Fig. 6C). Vector control cells exposed to 2 Gy showed apoptosis compared with untreated vector control, but the overexpression of WT-CLK2 or S36A mutant blocked 2 Gy-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6C). To expand our study of the role of CLK2 phosphorylation in low dose radiation sensitivity, we performed cell viability (Fig. 6D) and cell proliferation assays (Fig. 6E) after irradiation of 0.05 Gy. Interestingly, overexpression of WT-CLK2 or the S36A mutant increased cell proliferation after irradiation of 0.05 Gy, but S34A, T127A, and S34A/T127A mutants did not have any effect on cell growth, suggesting that CLK2 phosphorylation correlates with cell proliferation after low dose radiation (Fig. 6, D and E). These results demonstrate that CLK2 phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation plays important roles in the regulation of cell survival. Protein phosphorylation by AKT is an important regulatory mechanism in the control of diverse cellular functions, such as cell cycle, survival, and signal transduction pathways. In this study, we identified and characterized CLK2 as a novel substrate of AKT. AKT directly binds and phosphorylates CLK2, in vitro and in vivo. We found that ionizing radiation induces CLK2 phosphorylation via AKT activation, in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CLK2 phosphorylation plays a critical role in cell proliferation following low dose radiation and prevents cell death following high dose radiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the role of CLK2 as a novel target of AKT in controlling the cellular response to ionizing radiation. CLK2 is a member of the CLK family of kinases, which contains an serine/arginine-rich domain (23Douville E. Duncan P. Abraham N. Bell J.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Nayler O. Stamm S. Ullrich A. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The CLK family kinases phosphorylate protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-1B and serine/arginine-rich proteins, such as ASF/SF2 (32Moeslein F.M. Myers M.P. Landreth G.E. J. Biol.

Although CLK2 was reported to regulate its nuclear localization by autophosphorylating serine 141 (31Nayler O. Schnorrer F. Stamm S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34341-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), CLK2 phosphorylation might be regulated by upstream kinases that influence its localization and activity (31Nayler O. Schnorrer F. Stamm S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34341-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Lee K. Du C. Horn M. Rabinow L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27299-27303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory machinery for CLK2 phosphorylation and its function still remain to be elucidated. We discovered that CLK2 protein contains the AKT consensus phosphorylation motif, RXRXX(S/T)X, which suggested it is a novel AKT substrate. We demonstrated that AKT binds directly to CLK2 and phosphorylates it in vitro. The overexpression of active AKT-induced CLK2 phosphorylation in HeLa cells, suggesting that CLK2 is a genuine AKT substrate. We previously reported that AKT is potently activated in response to ionizing radiation and regulates ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis (20Park H.S. Yun Y. Kim C.S. Yang K.H. Jeong M. Ahn S.K. Jin Y.W. Nam S.Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 88: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To identify whether ionizing radiation-induced AKT activation is related to CLK2 phosphorylation, we measured CLK2 phosphorylation after irradiation. Both 0.05 and 2 Gy induced CLK2 phosphorylation, which peaked at 4 h post-irradiation. The inhibition of AKT activation by LY294002 or wortmannin blocked radiation-induced CLK2 phosphorylation. Insulin was also shown to induce CLK2 phosphorylation, which was inhibited by PI3K inhibitors. Moreover, CLK2 phosphorylation in response to radiation or insulin was blocked in AKT knockdown cells, suggesting that CLK2 phosphorylation is regulated by activated AKT, in vivo. However, as shown in Fig. 4, CLK2 possesses three putative AKT consensus phosphorylation motifs, Ser34, Ser36, and Thr127; however, Ser36 was not phosphorylated by active AKT. Both Ser34 and Thr127 were phosphorylated by active AKT, in vitro, and phosphorylation of these sites was induced by radiation or insulin, in vivo. In addition, phosphorylated CLK2 at these sites bound to phosphorylated AKT. When both residues Ser34 and Thr127 were mutated to alanine, CLK2 phosphorylation in response to radiation was no different from the single mutant forms, S34A or T127A. The CLK family kinases have been suggested to play an important role in the regulation of mRNA splicing, which is critical to the control of cellular gene expression (30Duncan P.I. Stojdl D.F.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). CLK1 was shown to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade, including ERKs and pp90Rsk (36Myers M.P. Murphy M.B. Landreth G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6954-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the importance of the CLK family in the control of gene expression and signal transduction has been suggested, its biological function is unclear. Here, we found that CLK2 overexpression increased cell growth induced by low dose radiation (0.05 or 0.2 Gy) and blocked cell death induced by high dose radiation (2 Gy). Moreover, the depletion of endogenous CLK2 by siRNA also decreased cell viability following both low and high dose irradiations. Our findings suggest that CLK2 is correlated with cell proliferation and cell protection against high dose radiation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that CLK2 phosphorylation is correlated with the regulation of cell survival after irradiation. Interestingly, the overexpression of WT-CLK2 and the S36A mutant blocked 2 Gy-induced cell death, but S34A, T127A, and S34A/T127A mutants did not have any protective effect. In addition, CLK2 phosphorylation affected cell proliferation after low dose radiation. Our data suggest that CLK2 phosphorylation on Ser34 and Thr127 in response to radiation plays important roles in the regulation of cell survival. CLKs were previously shown to change cellular localization depending on phosphorylation status. CLK2 localization and catalytic activity influenced by phosphorylation may be associated with the regulation of downstream molecules. We have sought to determine the change of CLK2 localization and subsequent regulation of CLK2 targets in response to ionizing radiation. However, although much more work is required to understand the biological function of CLK2, we have identified CLK2 as a direct target of AKT and characterized the role of CLK2 phosphorylation in the cellular response to ionizing radiation. As far as we know, this study provides the first evidence that sensitivity to ionizing radiation is, at least in part, regulated by CLK2 phosphorylation via activated AKT."
https://openalex.org/W2022838559,"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the first and usually rate-limiting enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Under normal physiological conditions, polyamine content and ODC enzyme activity are highly regulated. However, the induction of ODC activity is an early step in neoplastic transformation. The studies described here use normal mouse keratinocytes (C5N cells), and spindle carcinoma cells (A5 cells) to explore the regulation of ODC in nonmelanoma skin cancer development. Previous results have shown that induction of ODC activity is both necessary and sufficient for the promotion of skin tumors. We see a marked increase in ODC enzyme activity in A5 cells compared with C5N keratinocytes, which correlates with a 4-fold stabilization of ODC mRNA. These data suggest that ODC is post-transcriptionally regulated in skin tumor development. Thus, we sought to investigate whether the ODC transcript interacts with the RNA-binding protein HuR, which is known to bind to and stabilize its target mRNAs. We show that HuR is able to bind to the ODC 3′-UTR in A5 cells but not in C5N cells. Immunofluorescence results reveal that HuR is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of A5 cells, whereas C5N cells exhibit strictly nuclear localization of HuR. Knockdown experiments in A5 cells showed that when HuR is depleted, ODC RNA becomes less stable, and ODC enzyme activity decreases. Together, these data support the hypothesis that HuR plays a causative role in ODC up-regulation during nonmelanoma skin cancer development by binding to and stabilizing the ODC transcript.

Knockdown experiments in A5 cells showed that when HuR is depleted, ODC RNA becomes less stable, and ODC enzyme activity decreases. Together, these data support the hypothesis that HuR plays a causative role in ODC up-regulation during nonmelanoma skin cancer development by binding to and stabilizing the ODC transcript.

Polyamines are small, ubiquitous polycations and are necessary for normal cell growth and development. Thus, the ablation of ODC is lethal in utero (3Pendeville H. Carpino N. Marine J.C. Takahashi Y. Muller M. Martial J.A. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6549-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because of their charge, polyamines are able to bind to RNA, DNA, and proteins and thereby influence gene expression (4Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 42: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Both polyamine content and ODC enzyme activity are tightly regulated in cells, and ODC is induced in response to a variety of proliferative stimuli by alterations in its transcription, translation, and protein degradation (5Bello-Fernandez C.

Moreover, a link between human nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the most prevalent cancer in the United States, and elevated ODC enzyme activity levels has been described (18Bailey H.H. Kim K.

Control of mRNA decay is a rapid means of regulating the expression of mRNAs (23Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). RBPs bind to adenosine- and uracil-rich elements (AREs), sequences classically located within the 3′-UTR of labile mRNAs (24Parker R. Sheth U. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). These sequences behave as cis-acting elements and are located in numerous proto-oncogene, cytokine, and transcription factor mRNAs (25Audic Y. Hartley R.S. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 479-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Three categories of RBPs have been defined: those that stabilize mRNA, those that destabilize mRNA, and those that can both stabilize and destabilize mRNA (26Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene. 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that some RBPs can alter the translational efficiency of their bound RNA transcript (27Mazan-Mamczarz K. Galbán S. López de Silanes I. Martindale J.L. Atasoy U.

Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). HuR (human antigen R) belongs to the family of Hu proteins that are highly homologous to the embryonic lethal abnormal vision family of proteins. Unlike its family members HuB, HuC, and HuD, which are expressed exclusively in neurons, HuR is ubiquitously expressed (28Hinman M.N. Lou H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The HuR protein contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) (29Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). RRM1 and RRM2 have been shown to recognize AREs located within the mRNA, whereas it has been suggested that RRM3 recognizes the poly(A) tail of the mRNA transcript (29Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The hinge region of HuR, located between RRM2 and RRM3, contains a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence. Both a nuclear localization signal and nuclear export signal are contained in this region (30Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). HuR is mainly nuclear but has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to various stress stimuli such as UVB irradiation and H2O2 (31Zhang J. Bowden G.T. Mol. Carcinog. 2008; 47: 974-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Kuwano Y. Kim H.H. Abdelmohsen K. Pullmann Jr., R. Martindale J.L. Yang X. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4562-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, HuR can stabilize and/or increase the translational efficiency of its bound mRNA transcript (29Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a correlation between HuR localization and neoplastic transformation has been described. HuR has been shown to bind to and stabilize numerous transcripts whose overexpression contribute to tumorigenesis, such as TSP1, COX2, and ProTα (31Zhang J. Bowden G.T. Mol. Carcinog. 2008; 47: 974-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Mazan-Mamczarz K. Hagner P.R. Corl S. Srikantan S. Wood W.H. Becker K.G. Gorospe M. Keene J.D. Levenson A.S. Gartenhaus R.B.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1852-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The studies described here support the hypothesis that HuR plays a major role in the regulation of ODC mRNA decay in skin tumor development. The mouse keratinocyte cell model used in these studies is comprised of two cell lines: C5N cells, which have a wild-type keratinocyte morphology and contain no detectable mutations in the H-ras gene, which is mutated at a high frequency in NMSC; and A5 cells, which have a spindle carcinoma phenotype and were isolated from the tumor of a mouse that had been subjected to the classical two-stage protocol of initiation and promotion (35Zoumpourlis V. Solakidi S. Papathoma A. Papaevangeliou D. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we show that ODC enzyme activity is induced, and ODC mRNA is markedly stabilized in A5 cells when compared with C5N cells. Using both in vitro and intracellular assays, we show that HuR associates with the 3′-UTR of ODC in transformed cells, but not in normal keratinocytes, and causes the ODC transcript to be stabilized. We further demonstrate that the binding status of HuR to the ODC mRNA transcript correlates with HuR localization, because HuR is exclusively nuclear in C5N cells but is both nuclear and cytoplasmic in A5 cells. Thus, these studies show for the first time that ODC is post-transcriptionally regulated by the stabilizing RBP HuR in a mouse nonmelanoma skin cancer model. The C5N and A5 mouse keratinocytes (a generous gift from Dr. Allan Balmain, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. These cells have been described previously (35Zoumpourlis V. Solakidi S. Papathoma A. Papaevangeliou D. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Passages 5–20 were used in the experiments. Stock flasks were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. ODC enzyme activity was determined by radiometric assay measuring the amount of 14CO2 released from each reaction in which l-[1-14C]ornithine is enzymatically converted to 14CO2 by ornithine decarboxylase. Collection and analysis were carried out as described (36Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. Morgan D.M.L. Polyamine Protocols. Vol. 79. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 41-44Google Scholar). RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For Northern blot analysis 20 μg of RNA was loaded onto a 1.2% (v/v) agarose-formaldehyde gel and subsequently transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare). After transfer, the membrane was UV cross-linked using a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Northern analysis was conducted using 32P-labeled cDNA probes synthesized for ODC and cyclophilin A. The primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. The bands were quantitated using Syngene Software (Syngene, Frederick, MD), and the ODC mRNA data were normalized to that of cyclophilin A. The stability of the ODC mRNA was assessed by the addition of actinomycin D (5–10 μg), and RNA was extracted at 0, 4, and 8 h. ODC mRNA half-life was determined using curve fit analysis. Total RNA was isolated as described above and used in reverse transcription and PCR amplification. qRT-PCRs were performed by the Step One Plus real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using the same primers for ODC and cyclophilin A described above. Analysis was performed by using the Step One Plus real time PCR software (Applied Biosystems). The data were normalized to cyclophilin A. Western blotting was conducted as described previously (37Origanti S. Shantz L.M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4834-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To prepare cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, the cells were fractionated using the Pierce fractionation kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). To check the extracts for nuclear contamination, Western blot analysis was conducted on 20 μg of extract, and α/β-tubulin and histone H3 antibodies were used. The antibodies recognizing HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), GAPDH (BioDesign International, Saco, ME), histone H3, and α/β-tubulin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) were all used at a 1:1000 dilution. cDNA from C5N and A5 cells was used as a template for PCR amplification of the 5′-UTR, coding region, and 3′-UTR of ODC. The sense primers for each reaction contained the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence on the 5′ end and are listed in supplemental Table S1. The PCR templates were used to transcribe biotinylated RNAs by using T7 polymerase and biotin-labeled CTP (Invitrogen) as reported previously (22Zou T. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Rao J.N. Liu L. Marasa B.S. Zhang A.H. Xiao L. Pullmann R. Gorospe M. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19387-19394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To elucidate the binding site of HuR on the 3′-UTR of ODC, various fragment and deletion constructs were created using sense primers containing the T7 promoter sequence and antisense primers that created varying length fragments of the ODC 3′-UTR. GAPDH and c-Myc were utilized as negative and positive controls, respectively. All of the primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. The biotin-labeled RNA transcripts (15 μl) were incubated with 120 μg of cytoplasmic lysate for 30 min at room temperature. The RNA-protein complexes were then harvested by using paramagnetic streptavidin-conjugated Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and were analyzed by Western blotting using the HuR antibody described above. For immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous RNA-protein binding complexes, 2000 μg of cytoplasmic lysate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been precoated with 30 μg of either mouse IgG (Invitrogen) or HuR antibody as described (38Lal A. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Kawai T. Yang X. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3092-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The RNA IP material was analyzed by washing the beads with NT-2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and further incubated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, NT-2 buffer, and 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 55 °C. RNA was precipitated using phenol-chloroform extraction in the presence of glycoblue (Qiagen). RNA from the IP was then reverse transcribed to detect the presence of ODC mRNA. The primers used for the ODC coding region are listed in supplemental Table S1. A5 and C5N cells were seeded onto glass coverslips that had been precoated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were allowed to grow to 70% confluency and were then fixed in 50/50 acetone/methanol solution at −20 °C for 5 min. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 5% goat serum in PBS. HuR antibody was placed on the samples (diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA) for 2 h. The samples were then incubated in Cy-2 secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The coverslips were incubated with DAPI diluted to 1 μg/ml for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed and then mounted using Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). The slides were viewed through the Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope, and the pictures were taken using the Nikon ACT-1 Software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY). The images were processed using Windows Photo Gallery (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). A validated siRNA duplex corresponding to the coding region of HuR and a negative control duplex were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Thermoscientific, Lafayette, CO). siHuR contained the sequence 5′-GGUUGAAUCUGCAAAGCUU-3′. For RNAi experiments, C5N and A5 cells were allowed to grow to 70% confluency and transfected with the siRNA (final concentration, 100 nm) specific for the HuR coding region or a negative control according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mock transfected cells were treated with the transfecting agent DharmaFECT 1 (Thermoscientific) only. Knockdown efficiency was assessed 72 h post-transfection through qRT-PCR, Northern blot, or Western blot analysis. For Northern blot analysis and qRT-PCR, RNA was harvested using the methods described above. For Western blot analysis, protein was harvested in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) (Cell Signaling Technology). ODC enzyme activity was tested in mock, negative control, or siHuR-treated cells as described above. ODC mRNA stability in mock, negative control, or siHuR-treated cells was also assessed by treating each sample with 10 μg/ml of actinomycin D. RNA was harvested at 0, 4, and 8 h, and ODC half-life was determined as described above. The cells were treated as described above for RNA interference experiments. At 72 h post-transfection, the medium was aspirated, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution dissolved in PBS was added to each well (final concentration, 0.5 mg/ml) (Sigma). The plate was then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h. The solution was aspirated, and the cells were solubilized in 2 ml of Me2SO. Upon homogeneity, 100 μl of each sample was assayed in triplicate in a 96-well plate. The absorbance was read at a 570-nm wavelength using a SPECTRAmax PLUS384 plate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). Cell viability was calculated as a percentage of the optical density value of untreated cells. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. from three to nine samples. Autoradiography and immunoblotting were repeated up to three times. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. ODC enzyme activity assays revealed a 4-fold change in ODC enzyme activity between the two cell lines (Fig. 1A), with C5N keratinocytes displaying low ODC enzyme activity, whereas the A5 cells exhibited a significant induction of ODC enzyme activity. The up-regulation of ODC enzyme activity was not due to an increase in transcription because qRT-PCR revealed no significant difference in steady-state mRNA levels between the two cell lines (Fig. 1B). Using both Northern blot analysis with subsequent band quantitation and qRT-PCR, we determined that ODC mRNA half-life was 4 h in the C5N keratinocytes compared with 15 h in A5 cells (Fig. 1C). These data show that ODC mRNA is markedly less stable in the normal keratinocytes than in carcinoma cells and that the observed change in ODC stability alone could account for the difference in the ODC enzyme activity between the two cell lines. Previous results have shown that the intracellular polyamine pool can affect the localization of the stabilizing RBP HuR in IEC-6 cells (21Zou T. Liu L. Rao J.N. Marasa B.S. Chen J. Xiao L. Zhou H. Gorospe M. Wang J.Y. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Zou T. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Rao J.N. Liu L. Marasa B.S. Zhang A.H. Xiao L. Pullmann R. Gorospe M. Wang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19387-19394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). HuR has been shown to preferentially bind to ARE sequences that are located in the 3′-UTR of a target mRNA transcript (28Hinman M.N. Lou H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3168-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 39Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Upon examination of the mouse 3′-UTR for ODC, one classical AUUUA ARE was located (Fig. 2A). A biotinylated pulldown assay was conducted to determine whether HuR could bind to synthetic transcripts corresponding to the full-length ODC 3′-UTR or the ODC coding region. The data show that cytoplasmic extracts of C5N cells demonstrate no measurable binding of HuR to either the ODC 3′-UTR or coding region. Conversely, cytoplasmic A5 extracts exhibit strong HuR binding to the ODC 3′-UTR biotinylated probe (Fig. 2, B and C). The difference in binding between C5N and A5 cells was not due to a lack of HuR in the C5N cells, because whole cell lysates revealed that the relative level of HuR protein was similar between the two cell lines (Fig. 2D). Together, these data show that HuR is present in both cell lines but that only HuR present in the A5 cytoplasm is able to bind to the 3′-UTR of ODC. To determine the location of the HuR-binding site in the 3′-UTR of ODC, we created overlapping biotinylated probes of ∼150–200 bases in length that scanned the entire ODC 3′-UTR (Fig. 3A). A5 cytoplasmic lysates were used to perform these mapping experiments because we did not observe HuR binding from C5N lysates (Fig. 2C). The association of HuR protein with a synthetic ODC mRNA transcript was detected by Western blot analysis of the pulldown material (Fig. 3B). The ODC full-length 3′-UTR transcript associated with HuR. Interestingly, fragments 1 and 2 exhibited even stronger HuR binding than the full-length probe. Fragments 3 and 4 also displayed lower levels of HuR binding, whereas the most distal fragment, fragment 5, did not appear to associate with the HuR protein. The c-Myc full-length 3′-UTR positive control exhibited HuR binding, and the GAPDH negative control demonstrated no binding (40Liu L. Rao J.N. Zou T. Xiao L. Wang P.Y. Turner D.J. Gorospe M. Wang J.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4885-4898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data verify that HuR is able to bind to the more proximal region of the ODC 3′-UTR and suggest the presence of multiple binding sites. To confirm these results and to further narrow the region of HuR binding, a second mapping experiment was performed using additional deletion constructs of either the proximal or distal end of the ODC 3′-UTR. These deletion constructs ranged from 50 to 500 bases in length (Fig. 4A). The full-length ODC 3′-UTR, deletion 1, deletion 2, and deletion 4 constructs all exhibited HuR binding, whereas deletion constructs 3 and 5 demonstrated little to no HuR binding (Fig. 4B). Both sets of binding site data suggest that HuR binds to multiple sites on the 3′-UTR of ODC between bases 1851 and 2151 (Fig. 4C). The endogenous intracellular association of ODC mRNA and HuR was assessed through immunoprecipitation of HuR in an assay that allows the association between HuR and its target mRNAs in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes to be maintained. In agreement with the biotinylated pulldown data, little or no ODC mRNA was immunoprecipitated from the C5N keratinocyte cell line cytoplasmic lysate, but a strong ODC band was detected in the immunoprecipitated material from A5 cells, as measured by both conventional PCR and qRT-PCR (Fig. 5). In fact, the qRT-PCR revealed a 9-fold increase in ODC mRNA in the A5 pulldown material when compared with the C5N. GAPDH was present at very low levels in both lysates. This is in agreement with previously reported results, because GAPDH can act as a partial contaminant in IP materials (41Abdelmohsen K. Pullmann Jr., R. Lal A. Kim H.H. Galban S. Yang X. Blethrow J.D. Walker M. Shubert J. Gillespie D.A. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 543-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The positive control c-Myc mRNA associated strongly with HuR protein in A5 lysates (Fig. 5A) (40Liu L. Rao J.N. Zou T. Xiao L. Wang P.Y. Turner D.J. Gorospe M. Wang J.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4885-4898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results above show strong binding of HuR to ODC mRNA in transformed A5 cells, but little or no association in C5N keratinocytes, despite having similar levels of HuR protein as seen in the whole cell lysates of each cell line (Fig. 2D). To address the issue of preferential binding of HuR to the A5 ODC 3′-UTR, the ODC 3′-UTR was sequenced in both cell lines. An alignment of the two sequences revealed a 100% sequence identity (data not shown). Given that the ODC 3′-UTR was not mutated in the A5 cells, another possible explanation is that the two cell lines display different cellular localizations of the HuR protein. HuR has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in response to various stimuli or intrinsic cellular conditions. Additionally, cytoplasmic HuR in human tumors correlates with an increased tumor grade and a decreased survival rate (42Heinonen M. Bono P. Narko K. Chang S.H. Lundin J. Joensuu H. Furneaux H. Hla T. Haglund C. Ristimäki A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2157-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 43Blaxall B.C. Dwyer-Nield L.D. Bauer A.K. Bohlmeyer T.J. Malkinson A.M. Port J.D. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on this, we decided to investigate the cellular localization of the HuR protein in C5N and A5 cells. The immunofluorescence results show that HuR is almost exclusively nuclear in C5N cells, whereas in A5 cells HuR is both nuclear and cytoplasmic (Fig. 6). These data affirm our previous findings in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, because both the biotinylated pulldown assay and ribonucleoprotein complex assay use cytoplasmic extract. This difference in localization likely accounts for the inability of HuR to bind to ODC mRNA in C5N cytoplasmic extracts. In fact, when C5N nuclear extracts were used to investigate HuR binding to the ODC mRNA transcript, we show that HuR is able to bind to the ODC 3′-UTR (Fig. 7A). The C5N nuclear extract also displayed lower level binding to the 5′-UTR and coding region of the ODC mRNA transcript (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7Nuclear extracts from C5N keratinocytes display HuR binding to the ODC mRNA transcript.

https://openalex.org/W2057877014,"The extracellular protease plasmin cleaves mouse MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) at lysine 104, releasing a 50-amino acid C-terminal domain. The cleavage event increases the chemotactic activity of MCP1 and, by doing so, promotes the progression of excitotoxic injury in the central nervous system in pathological settings. The mechanism through which the cleavage event enhances MCP1-mediated chemoattraction is unknown; to investigate it, we use wild-type and mutant forms of recombinant MCP1. Full-length MCP1 (FL-MCP1) is secreted by cells as a dimer or multimer. We show that a mutant truncated at the C terminus, K104Stop-MCP1, does not dimerize, revealing that the C terminus mediates the interaction. MCP1 interacts with the monocyte/microglia receptor CCR2. The interaction is critical to the function of MCP1 because CCR2(-/-) microglia do not undergo chemotaxis in response to MCP1 stimulation. We show that stimulation of microglia with FL-MCP1 or K104Stop-MCP1 triggers CCR2 internalization, whereas a mutant form unable to be cleaved at lysine 104 (K104A-MCP1) is relatively ineffective in this assay, suggesting that the C-terminal region interferes with the MCP1-CCR2 interaction. Moreover, FL-MCP1 and K104Stop-MCP1 stimulation leads to activation of Rac1, a small GTPase involved in cell migration. Conversely, MCP1-stimulated microglial migration is blocked by the Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766, demonstrating the requirement for Rac1 effector pathways in this response. Taken together, we propose a model for MCP1 localization, activation, and function based on the initial presence and then removal of its C terminus, coupled with a requisite downstream signaling pathway from CCR2 stimulation to Rac1 activation."

Recent identification of a novel flow-induced mechanosignaling pathway involving VEGF in osteoblasts and the known VEGF regulation of actin reorganization in various cell types has led us to hypothesize that fluid shear stress-induced Vegf up-regulation underlies the actin cytoskeleton adaptation observed in osteoblasts during mechanotransduction. Our results show that MC3T3-E1 cells secrete significant VEGF in response to 5 h of pulsatile fluid shear stress (PFSS; 5 dynes/cm2 at 1 Hz), whereas expression of VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, or NRP1) is unaffected. These receptors, in particular VEGFR-2, participate in PFSS-induced VEGF release. Exposure to flow-conditioned medium or exogenous VEGF significantly induces stress fiber formation in osteoblasts that is comparable with PFSS-induced stress fiber formation, whereas VEGF knockdown abrogates this response to PFSS, thereby providing evidence that flow-induced VEGF release plays a role in actin polymerization. Using neutralizing antibodies against the receptors and VEGF isoforms, we found that soluble VEGFs, in particular VEGF164, play a crucial role in transient stress fiber formation during osteoblast mechanotransduction, most likely through VEGFR-2 and NRP1. Based on these data we conclude that flow-induced VEGF release from osteoblasts regulates osteoblast actin adaptation during mechanotransduction and that VEGF paracrine signaling may provide potent cross-talk among bone cells and endothelial cells that is essential for fracture healing, bone remodeling, and osteogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2026933728,"Replication of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA, a model for eukaryotic chromosomal replication, can be reconstituted in vitro using the viral helicase (large tumor antigen, or Tag) and purified human proteins. Tag interacts physically with two cellular proteins, replication protein A and DNA polymerase α-primase (pol-prim), constituting the viral primosome. Like the well characterized primosomes of phages T7 and T4, this trio of proteins coordinates parental DNA unwinding with primer synthesis to initiate the leading strand at the viral origin and each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand template. We recently determined the structure of a previously unrecognized pol-prim domain (p68N) that docks on Tag, identified the p68N surface that contacts Tag, and demonstrated its vital role in primosome function. Here, we identify the p68N-docking site on Tag by using structure-guided mutagenesis of the Tag helicase surface. A charge reverse substitution in Tag disrupted both p68N-binding and primosome activity but did not affect docking with other pol-prim subunits. Unexpectedly, the substitution also disrupted Tag ATPase and helicase activity, suggesting a potential link between p68N docking and ATPase activity. To assess this possibility, we examined the primosome activity of Tag with a single residue substitution in the Walker B motif. Although this substitution abolished ATPase and helicase activity as expected, it did not reduce pol-prim docking on Tag or primosome activity on single-stranded DNA, indicating that Tag ATPase is dispensable for primosome activity in vitro."

The membrane-integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic core, because it contains a complete electron-transporting apparatus from NADPH to molecular oxygen for superoxide production. Activation of gp91phox requires the cytosolic proteins p67phox, p47phox, and Rac (a small GTPase). p67phox, comprising 526 amino acids, moves upon cell stimulation to the membrane together with p47phox and there interacts with Rac; these processes are prerequisite for gp91phox activation. Here we show that a region of p67phox (amino acids 190–200) C-terminal to the Rac-binding domain is evolutionarily well conserved and participates in oxidase activation at a later stage in conjunction with an activation domain. Alanine substitution for Tyr-198, Leu-199, or Val-204 abrogates the ability of p67phox to support superoxide production by gp91phox-based oxidase as well as its related oxidases Nox1 and Nox3; the activation also involves other invariant residues such as Leu-193, Asp-197, and Gly-200. Intriguingly, replacement of Gln-192 by alanine or that of Tyr-198 by phenylalanine or tryptophan rather enhances superoxide production by gp91phox-based oxidase, suggesting a tuning role for these residues. Furthermore, the Y198A/V204A or L199A/V204A substitution leads to not only a complete loss of the activity of the reconstituted oxidase system but also a significant decrease in p67phox interaction with the gp91phox NADPH-binding domain, although these mutations affect neither the protein integrity nor the Rac binding activity. Thus the extended activation domain of p67phox (amino acids 190–210) containing the D(Y/F)LGK motif plays an essential role in oxidase activation probably by interacting with gp91phox.

The catalytic core of the phagocyte oxidase is gp91phox, a membrane-spanning protein that forms a stable heterodimer with p22phox as flavocytochrome b558. gp91phox harbors six transmembrane fragments, bearing two distinct hemes, in the N-terminal half, and the FAD- and NADPH-binding domains in the C-terminal cytosolic region. Thus gp91phox contains a complete electron-transporting apparatus from NADPH via FAD and two hemes to molecular oxygen for superoxide production.

Among them, gp91phox, renamed Nox2 as a member of the family, is close to Nox1 and Nox3, both of which are expressed in nonphagocytic cells. Activation of the phagocyte oxidase gp91phox/Nox2 requires the three proteins p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTPase Rac, all of which localize exclusively to the cytosol in resting cells. Indeed chronic granulomatous disease is caused by genetic deficiencies or mutations in p67phox, p47phox, or Rac2, in addition to those in gp91phox or p22phox (3Geiszt M. Leto T.L. J. Biol.

In addition to these modular domains, a region C-terminal to the TPR domain of p67phox has been shown to be essential for oxidase activation; analyses using deletion mutant proteins of p67phox by us (24Hata K.

Furthermore, Han et al. (25Han C.H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Based on these findings, this region (amino acids 199–210) has been designated an activation domain (25Han C.H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

In the present study, we show that a short region between the TPR and activation domains in p67phox (amino acids 190–200) is evolutionarily well conserved and plays a crucial role in activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The region of amino acids 190–210 appears to function by interacting with gp91phox, because both the Y198A/V204A and L199A/V204A substitutions abrogate not only oxidase activity but also p67phox binding to the C-terminal NADPH-binding domain of gp91phox. On the other hand, these mutations affect neither the protein integrity, as estimated by NMR analysis, nor the Rac binding activity. These findings indicate that p67phox binds to Rac via the TPR domain, and thus its C-terminal region interacts directly with the NADPH-binding domain of gp91phox, which may induce a conformational change leading to superoxide production. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the region of amino acids 190–210 also contributes to p67phox-mediated activation of the nonphagocytic oxidase Nox3 and that the corresponding region of Noxa1, a homologue of p67phox, participates in activation of Nox1, another nonphagocytic oxidase.

Miyano K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 379: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Yuzawa S. Miyano K. Honbou K. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. J.

All of the constructs were sequenced for confirmation of their identities. CHO cells endogenously expressing Rac1 were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) with the following plasmids: 0.5 μg of pEF-BOS-HA-p67phox or pEF-BOS-HA-Noxa1; 0.5 μg of pEF-BOS-FLAG-p47phox or pEF-BOS-FLAG-Noxo1; 1.0 μg of pcDNA3-gp91phox, pcDNA3-Nox1, or pcDNA3-Nox3; and 1.0 μg of pEF-BOS-p22phox. In the case of Nox1 activation by p67phox and Noxo1, the cells were also transfected with 0.5 μg of pEF-BOS-Myc-Rac1 (Q61L) or pEF-BOS vector. The transfected cells were cultured for 24 h and harvested by incubation with trypsin/EDTA for 1 min at 37 °C. After being washed with Hepes-buffered saline (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 17 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), the cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in the buffer and tested for estimation of superoxide production. The superoxide-producing activity was determined by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable chemiluminescence with an enhancer-containing luminol-based detection system (Diogenes; National Diagnostics), as described previously (22Maehara Y. Miyano K. Sumimoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 379: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Yuzawa S. Miyano K. Honbou K. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. J.

After the addition of the enhanced luminol-based substrate, the cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C and subsequently stimulated at the same temperature with or without 200 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Research Biochemicals International). The chemiluminescence was monitored 37 °C using a luminometer (Auto Lumat LB953; EG&G Berthold). For estimation of protein levels of HA-p67phox, FLAG-p47phox, Myc-Rac1, and p22phox, proteins in cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science), an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science), and anti-p22phox polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The blots were developed using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) for visualization of the antibodies. The membrane fraction of human neutrophils was prepared as described previously (13Kuribayashi F. Nunoi H.

Wild-type and mutant p67phox-(1–212) and Rac1 (Q61L) without a GST tag were prepared as follows: wild-type and mutant p67phox-(1–212) fused to GST and GST-Rac1 (Q61L) were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B and subsequently treated with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) in 100 mm KCl and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, which allowed GST-free proteins to be released. The proteins used in the present analysis were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The membranes (10 μg/ml) were mixed with wild-type or mutant p67phox-(1–212) at the indicated concentration, 100 nm GST-p47phox-(1–286), and 100 nm Rac1 (Q61L) in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 75 μm cytochrome c, 1.0 mm FAD, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 1.0 mm NaN3. After incubation with 100 μm SDS for 2 min at 25 °C, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 μm NADPH. The NADPH-dependent superoxide-producing activity was measured by determining the rate of superoxide dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome c reduction at 550–540 nm using a Hitachi 557 dual wavelength spectrophotometer (13Kuribayashi F.

The superoxide-producing activity was represented as mol of superoxide produced/s/mol of cytochrome b558 heme; the heme content was calculated from the reduced-minus-oxidized absorption at 558 nm (27Miyano K. Koga H. Minakami R. Sumimoto H. Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Taura M. Miyano K. Minakami R. Kamakura S. Takeya R. Sumimoto H. Biochem. J. 2009; 419: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For in vitro pull-down assays for Rac binding to p67phox, 10 μg of GST alone or GST-p67phox-(1–301) with or without the indicated substitution was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with 40 μg of Rac1 (Q61L) in 400 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.005% Triton X-100. A slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was subsequently added, followed by further incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing four times with the buffer above, the proteins were eluted from the beads with 20 mm glutathione in 200 mm NaCl and 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with an anti-Rac monoclonal antibody. The wild-type and mutant forms of p67phox-(1–212) were prepared by purification with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and subsequent cleavage with PreScission Protease. The proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 HR 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 100 mm KCl and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The purified proteins were subsequently concentrated using Amicon Ultra (Millipore). The wild-type and mutant forms of p67phox-(1–212) were dissolved at the concentration of 200 μm in 100 mm KCl and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The 1H NMR spectra of these proteins were recorded at 25 °C with an Avance 600 spectrometer equipped with a TXI CryoProbe (Bruker Biospin) with a spectral width of 8,389 Hz. The chemical shifts were referenced relative to the internal standard 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. The C-terminal NADPH-binding domain of gp91phox fused to GST (GST-gp91phox-C) was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. FLAG-tagged p67phox-(1–301) was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli using the expression vector pGEX-6P and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, followed by cleavage with PreScission Protease. For in vitro pull-down binding assays, 10 μg of GST-gp91phox-C or GST alone was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with 300 μg of FLAG-p67phox-(1–301) and Rac1 (Q61L) in 400 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. A slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was subsequently added, followed by further incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing four times with the buffer above, the proteins were eluted from the beads with 20 mm glutathione in 200 mm NaCl and 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The eluate was analyzed by immunoblot using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody for detection of FLAG-tagged p67phox. Although the region of amino acids 190–200, N-terminal to the activation domain, is well conserved among p67phox and its related proteins from various species (Fig. 1), the role of these residues has not been investigated. To test this, we expressed mutant p67phox proteins carrying an amino acid substitution in the region of residues 190–205 in CHO cells co-expressing gp91phox/Nox2 and p47phox as well as endogenous Rac; non-alanine residues were individually mutated to alanines, whereas Ala-191 and Ala-202 were converted to asparagine. As shown in Fig. 2A, a mutant protein carrying alanine substitution for Tyr-198 or Leu-199 failed to support superoxide production by gp91phox/Nox2, as did one with replacement of Val-204 by alanine; the V204A substitution leads to a defective activation of the phagocyte oxidase in a cell-free system, as originally shown by Han et al. (25Han C.H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The replacement of the invariant residue Leu-193 or Asp-197 also led to a decrease in oxidase activity but to a lesser extent. Although alanine substitution for Gly-200 completely abrogated superoxide production by gp91phox/Nox2-based oxidase, the amount of the mutant protein was significantly reduced (Fig. 2A), indicating that the mutation results in an unstable protein. A mutant protein with alanine substitution for the invariant lysine (Lys-201) was half as active as the wild-type protein, which is consistent with the previous observation by Han et al. (25Han C.H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) using the mutant protein in a cell-free activation system for the phagocyte oxidase. In addition, alanine substitution for Val-205, an incompletely but well conserved residue, led to a significant loss of superoxide production in the whole cell system for gp91phox/Nox2, which also agrees with the previous finding using the cell-free system (25Han C.H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus amino acid residues that are evolutionarily well conserved play a crucial role in gp91phox/Nox2 activation. We further investigated the role for Tyr-198, Leu-199, or Val-204, alanine substitution for which results in an almost complete loss of the activity of gp91phox/Nox2-based oxidase, using mutant proteins with replacement by a non-alanine residue. Tyr-198, an invariant residue in p67phox (Fig. 1), is replaced by phenylalanine in Noxa1. Because Noxa1 efficiently activates the nonphagocytic oxidase Nox1 but not gp91phox/Nox2 (30Bánfi B.

Unexpectedly, however, the Y198F substitution enhanced superoxide production by gp91phox/Nox2 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, th"

In this study, we utilize amide hydrogen exchange measurements to probe the organization of the peptide in its fibrillar form. We determined the extent of hydrogen exchange first by tandem proteolysis, liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry (HXMS) and then by exchange-quenched NMR.

Abundant expression of these enzymes is associated with poor prognosis. Thus, protease inhibitors that repress cell surface proteases may be applicable to cancer therapy. Because soybean Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor has been found to induce apoptotic death of human leukemia Jurkat cells, anti-leukemia activity of Bungarus multicinctus protease inhibitor-like protein-1 (PILP-1) is thus examined. PILP-1 induced apoptosis of human leukemia U937 cells, characteristic of loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, degradation of procaspase-8, and production of t-Bid. FADD down-regulation neither restored viability of PILP-1-treated cells nor attenuated production of active caspase-8 and t-Bid in PILP-1-treated cells, suggesting that the death receptor-mediated pathway was not involved in the cytotoxicity of PILP-1. It was found that PILP-1-evoked p38 MAPK activation and ERK inactivation led to PILP-1-induced cell death and down-regulation of ADAM17. Knockdown of ADAM17 by siRNA induced death of U937 cells and inactivation of Lyn and Akt. Immunoprecipitation suggested that ADAM17 and Lyn form complexes. Overexpression of ADAM17, LynY507F (gain of function), and constitutively active Akt suppressed the cytotoxic effects of PILP-1. PILP-1-elicited inactivation of Lyn and Akt was abrogated in cells with overexpressed ADAM17 or LynY507F. Taken together, our data indicate that ADAM17-mediated activation of Lyn/Akt maintains the viability of U937 cells and that suppression of the pathway is responsible for PILP-1-induced apoptosis.

Protease inhibitors play a critical role in the regulation of several biological processes such as blood coagulation, complement fixation, fibrinolysis, fertilization, and embryogenesis (1Bode W. Huber R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of proteinases leads to many pathophysiological conditions that include cancer, atherosclerosis, and inflammation. In particular, cell surface proteases, including meprin, matrix metalloproteinase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, and seprase, have been demonstrated to play an important role in facilitating cell invasion into extracellular matrix and may contribute significantly to extracellular matrix degradation by metastatic cancer cells (2O'Brien P. O'Connor B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 1130-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Abundant expression of these enzymes is associated with poor prognosis. Thus, protease inhibitors that repress cell surface proteases may be applicable to cancer therapy. Protease inhibitors are grouped into a number of families, including the Kunitz, Kazal, Serpin, and mucous families (3Chand H.S. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 94: 1122-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Several Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, including bikunin, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-2, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2, are found to suppress tumor invasion and metastasis (4Kobayashi H.

It was suggested that bikunin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 exerted their biology activities through a cell surface receptor-mediated process (3Chand H.S. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 94: 1122-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Hirashima Y. Terao T. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 elicits pro-apoptotic signaling pathway in the human fibrosarcoma cell line (8Kempaiah P. Kisiel W. Apoptosis. 2008; 13: 702-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Snake venoms are complex mixtures of pharmacologically active polypeptide toxins that are believed to have evolved to alter functionally the physiological activities along with predator-prey interaction (9Kordis D. Gubensek F. Gene. 2000; 261: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Zupunski V. Kordis D. Gubensek F.

In addition to enzymes and toxins, snake venom also contains serine protease inhibitors. Several Kunitz/bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitors from the venom of Viperidae and Elapidae snakes have been isolated and sequenced (12Ritonja A. Meloun B. Gubensek F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Shafqat J. Beg O.U. Yin S.J. Zaidi Z.H. Jörnvall H. Eur. J.

These snake venom Kunitz-type protease inhibitors have been demonstrated to specifically inhibit the proteolytic activity of trypsin or chymotrypsin. Nevertheless, their physiological roles in the regulatory mechanisms that influence the proteases in coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation have been rarely considered. Three protease inhibitor-like protein genes have been cloned from Bungarus multicinctus genome in our laboratory (16Chang L.S. Wang J.J. Cheng Y.C. Chou W.M. Toxicon. 2008; 51: 1490-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The deduced protein sequences of protease inhibitor-like proteins are highly homologous with those of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors. However, their biological activities remain elusive. Because soybean Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor has been found to induce apoptotic death of human leukemia Jurkat cells (17Troncoso M.F. Biron V.A. Longhi S.A. Retegui L.A. Wolfenstein-Todel C. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2007; 7: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), anti-leukemia activity of B. multicinctus protease inhibitor-like proteins is thus examined. In this study, human leukemia U937 cells were treated with B. multicinctus protease inhibitor like protein-1 (PILP-1). It was found that PILP-1-induced down-regulation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) led to inactivation of Lyn/Akt pathways. The signaling pathways further triggered apoptosis of U937 cells through the mitochondrion-mediated death pathway. Collectively, our data elucidate a novel ADAM17/Lyn/Akt signaling pathway in maintaining the viability of leukemia cells and suggest a strategy in improving leukemia therapy through suppression of ADAM17 protein expression. B. multicinctus PILP-1 was prepared according to our established procedure (16Chang L.S. Wang J.J. Cheng Y.C. Chou W.M. Toxicon. 2008; 51: 1490-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).

After initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, PCR amplification was performed using GoTaq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega) followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 60 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. After a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min, PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide transillumination under UV light. Primer sequences were as follows: TNFR2 (forward), 5′-ACATCAGACGTGGTGTGCAA-3′, and TNFR2 (reverse), 5′-CCAACTGGAAGAGCGAAGTC-3′; ADAM17 (forward), 5′-CAGCACAGCTGCCAAGTCATT-3′ and ADAM17 (reverse), 5′-CCAGCATCTGCTAAGTCACTTCC-3′. The PCR yielded PCR products of 323 and 235 bp for TNFR2 and ADAM17, respectively. Each reverse-transcribed mRNA product was internally controlled by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) PCR using primers 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCA-3′ (reverse), yielding a 512-bp PCR product. The TNFR2 and ADAM17 reverse transcriptase-PCR products were subsequently confirmed by direct sequencing. DNA segment containing nucleotides −938 to +235 of the human ADAM17 gene was amplified by PCR from human genomic DNA. The PCR-amplified genomic DNA was subcloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic (Promega) between KpnI and XhoI sites. The nucleotide sequences of constructs were identified by DNA sequencing. The resulting pGL-ADAM17 was used for promoter activity assay, and luciferase assay was performed with the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The pCMV-MEK1 (expressed the constitutively active MEK1) and constitutively activated, myristoylated Akt vector were generous gifts from Dr. W. C. Hung (National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan). Human ADAM17 expression plasmid, pME18S-ADAM17, was kindly provided by Dr. E. Nishi (Kyoto University, Japan), and pMX-IRES-GFP-Lyn expression vector was obtained from Dr. N. J. Donato (University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center). LynY507F (gain of function mutant) cDNA was prepared from pMX-IRES-GFP-Lyn expression vector using the PCR method and subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector. The plasmids were transfected into U937 cells using the pipette-type electroporator (MicroPorator-MP100, Digital Bio Technology Co., Korea). After treatment with or without 10 μm PILP-1 for 24 h, U937 cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS. The cells were then incubated with lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm PMSF, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na2VO4) in ice for 10 min. After centrifugation step at 15,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was mixed with protein G Plus/protein A-agarose suspension (Calbiochem) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C (preclearing). After removal of agarose, the cell lysate was incubated with antibodies (anti-ADAM17 or anti-Lyn) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating plate. Then protein G Plus/protein A-agarose suspension (Calbiochem) was added to each sample. Following an additional 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted by SDS-gel loading buffer for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. ADAM17 siRNA (catalogue number sc-36604) and negative control siRNA (catalogue number sc-37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. For the transfection procedure, cells were grown to 60% confluence, and 100 nm siRNA were transfected using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following specific treatment, cytosolic and pellet (mitochondrial) fractions were generated using a digitonin-based subcellular fractionation technique (18Liu W.H. Chang L.S. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c and proteins of the Bcl-2 family were detected by Western blot analysis. After treatment with PILP-1 for 24 h, the culture media of U937 cells were collected and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the clarified supernatants were collected. ELISA for soluble TNFR2 (sTNFR2) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (R & D Systems, Inc.). Developed assay plates were read at wavelength 450 nm using a plate reader, and the results were calculated using a standard curve generated each time an assay was performed. After specific treatment, nonspecific antibody-binding sites were blocked by incubation with PBS containing 0.01% human IgG. One fluorescent parameter flow cytometry was performed by staining cells with monoclonal anti-human ADAM17-fluorescein according to the manufacturer's protocol (R & D Systems). The stained cells were analyzed by a Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. For detection of ADAM10 and ADAM9 protein expression on the cell surface, cells were incubated with anti-ADAM9 (AP7437a) (Abgent, San Diego) and anti-ADAM10 (MAB1427) (R & D Systems) antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Anaspec, Fremont, CA) and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. ADAM17 activity was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol (Calbiochem). Its fluorescence-related enzymatic cleavage was monitored at 320 nm excitation and 405 nm emission wavelength using a microplate fluorescence reader. All data are presented as means ± S.D. Significant differences among the groups were determined using the unpaired Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 was taken as an indication of statistical significance. All the figures shown in this study were obtained from at least three independent experiments with similar results. Cell viability assay, annexin V/propidium iodide staining, DNA content analysis, measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 and -9 activity assay, separation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and Western blot analysis were performed in essentially the same manner as described previously (18Liu W.H. Chang L.S. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Results of Western blots were quantified by a scanning densitometer. All bands were normalized to β-actin expression, and fold changes in protein expression were determined on the basis of β-actin loading control. Upon exposure to PILP-1, U937 cells showed a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability (supplemental Fig. 1A). PILP-1 treatment caused an increase in annexin V staining and induced an increased accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase (supplemental Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, degradation of procaspase-3, procaspase-8, and PARP (caspase-3 substrate) was noted in PILP-1-treated cells (supplemental Fig. 1D). Pretreatment with caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-fmk) and caspases-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-fmk) restored significantly the viability of PILP-1-treated cells (supplemental Fig. 1E). These data indicated that PILP-1 induced apoptotic death of U937 cells. Increasing evidence suggests that altered mitochondrial function is linked to apoptosis, and a decreasing mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (19Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in supplemental Fig. 2A, the increasing population of U937 cells exhibited the loss of ΔΨm after PILP-1 treatment. As seen in supplemental Fig. 2B, a time-dependent release of cytochrome c into cytosol was detected relative to gradual decrease in mitochondrial cytochrome c. Moreover, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and production of t-Bid were notably observed after PILP-1 treatment for 24 h. In the mitochondrial pathway, caspase-8 converts the Bid from the inactive form (22 kDa) to the active form (15 kDa), which is called truncated Bid (tBid). tBid associates with the mitochondria outer membrane, disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and releases cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Apoptotic signals converge on mitochondria to trigger the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, causing caspase-9 and -3 activation and cell death (20Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, procaspase-9 degradation was noted with PILP-1-treated cells. Moreover, PILP-1 treatment induced an increase in activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in U937 cells (supplemental Fig. 2C). Pretreatment with caspase-8 inhibitor abolished the production of active caspase-3 in PILP-1-treated cells, whereas caspase-3 inhibitor was unable to block PILP-1-elicited procaspase-8 degradation (supplemental Fig. 2D). It suggested that caspase-8 was located on the upstream position for procaspase-3 degradation. Moreover, Z-IETD-fmk (caspase-8 inhibitor) abolished PILP-1-induced loss of ΔΨm (supplemental Fig. 2A). Taken together, the data indicate that PILP-1-induced apoptosis of U937 cells was mediated via the caspase-8/mitochondrial pathway. Because MAPKs are common components of the apoptotic program (21Proskuryakov S.Y. Konoplyannikov A.G. Gabai V.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of MAPKs was examined in PILP-1-treated U937 cells. Fig. 1A shows that the level of phospho-p38 MAPK was notably increased after 8 h of PILP-1 treatment, whereas that of phospho-ERK was reduced after PILP-1 treatment. In contrast, JNK was not phosphorylated in PILP-1-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, the viability of PILP-1-treated cells was restored by pretreatment with SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor). Moreover, SB202190 pretreatment abrogated PILP-1-elicited procaspase-8 degradation (Fig. 1B) and mitochondrial depolarization (supplemental Fig. 2A). The data reflect that p38 MAPK activation elicited caspase-8/mitochondrial mediated death pathway in PILP-1-treated U937 cells. Fig. 1C shows that PILP-1 was unable to induce procaspase-8 degradation, p38 MAPK activation, and ERK inactivation in cells transfected with constitutively active MEK1. Moreover, transfection of constitutively active MEK1 restored the viability of PILP-1-treated cells (Fig. 1D). These suggested that ERK inactivation was associated with cytotoxicity of PILP-1. Death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family such as Fas and tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1 (TNFR1) are the best understood death pathways that recruit FADD and procaspase-8 to the receptor (22Thorburn A. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Recruitment of procaspase-8 through FADD leads to its auto-cleavage and activation, and in turn it activates effector caspases such as caspase-3 or initial apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (23Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). Because up-regulation of death receptors evokes caspase-8 activation, protein expression of TNFR1, TNFR2, Fas, and FasL in PILP-1-treated cells was thus examined. Fig. 2A shows that, unlike that of Fas, FasL, and TNFR1, protein expression of TNFR2 increased markedly in PILP-1-treated cells. Nevertheless, transcription of TNFR2 mRNA did not significantly change in PILP-1-treated cells as revealed by reverse transcription-PCR amplification (Fig. 2B). ELISA revealed that PILP-1 treatment led to a reduction in detectable soluble TNFR2 (sTNFR2) concentration in culture medium of U937 cells (Fig. 2C). Given that ectodomain shedding of TNFR2 resulted in the production of sTNFR2, our data suggested that PILP-1-induced up-regulation of TNFR2 arose from reduction in TNFR2 shedding. Knockdown of FADD did not significantly affect PILP-1-elicited procaspase-8 degradation and rescue viability of PILP-1-treated cells (Fig. 2D), reflecting that the death receptor-mediated pathway was not involved in PILP-1-induced cell death. Given that ADAM17 is involved in the release of the ectodomain of TNFR2 (24Solomon K.A. Pesti N. Wu G. Newton R.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4105-4108PubMed Google Scholar), protein expression of ADAM17 in PILP-1-treated cells was examined. Fig. 3A shows that protein expression of pro-ADAM17 and ADAM17 in U937 cells was reduced in response to PILP-1 treatment. ADAM17 has been shown to be synthesized as a zymogen, which is constitutively processed to cell membrane after removal of the prodomain of pro-ADAM17. The increase in the surface expression of ADAM17 up-regulated sheddase activity of ADAM17 (25Santiago-Josefat B. Esselens C. Bech-Serra J.J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8325-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analyses revealed that PILP-1 treatment elicited a decrease in the amount of detectable ADAM17 on the cell surface. Taken together, these results suggested that PILP-1-induced decrease in TNFR2 shedding was mediated through down-regulation of ADAM17. Transcriptional level of ADAM17 mRNA of PILP-1-treated cells was notably lower than that of control untreated cells as evidenced by RT-PCR assay (Fig. 3B). Promoter assay revealed that PILP-1 attenuated the luciferase activity of the ADAM17 promoter in U937 cells (Fig. 3C). SB202190 pretreatment and overexpression of the constitutively active MEK1 abrogated PILP-1-evoked decease in ADAM17 mRNA transcription, reduction in luciferase activity of the ADAM17 promoter, and down-regulation of ADAM17 (Fig. 3, B–E). Consistently, PILP-1-elicited up-regulation of TNFR2 was restored by SB202190 and transfection of constitutively active MEK1 (Fig. 3, D and E). Moreover, SB202190 and overexpression of constitutively active MEK1 abrogated PILP-1-evoked decrease in ADAM17 activity and TNFR2 shedding (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these results suggested that PILP-1-elicited ADAM17 down-regulation was mediated through p38 MAPK activation and ERK inactivation. Given that down-regulation of ADAM17 protein expression induced apoptosis of HeLa cells (26Yan Y. Zhang J. Guo J.L. Huang W. Yang Y.Z. Cell Biol. Int. 2009; 33: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the causal relationship between ADAM17 down-regulation and cytotoxicity of PILP-1 was investigated. Fig. 4A shows that knockdown of ADAM17 by siRNA reduced viability of U937 cells. Moreover, down-regulation of ADAM17 by siRNA elicited degradation of procaspase-3, -8, and -9 in U937 cells (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, overexpression of ADAM17 attenuated PILP-1-induced cell death (Fig. 4C) and suppressed PILP-1-induced degradation of procaspase-3, -8, and -9 (Fig. 4D). These reflected that PILP-1-induced cell death was associated with down-regulation of ADAM17. ADAM17 is demonstrated to be a primary sheddase for multiple EGFR pro-ligands. Activation of EGFR by its ligand, which subsequently activates downstream PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, is important for regulating cell proliferation and cell survival (27Lal A. Glazer C.A. Martinson H.M. Friedman H.S. Archer G.E. Sampson J.H. Riggins G.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3335-3339PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows that PILP-1 inactivated Akt in U937 cells. Knockdown of ADAM17 by siRNA led to a reduction in the level of phospho-Akt (Fig. 5B). The finding that overexpression of ADAM17 abolished PILP-1-induced Akt inactivation (Fig. 5C) again supported a link between ADAM17 protein expression and Akt phosphorylation. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt (CA-AKT) restored the viability of PILP-1-treated cells (Fig. 5D). PILP-1 down-regulated ADAM17 in constitutively activated, myristoylated Akt-transfected cells, but degradation of procaspases was not observed after treatment with PILP-1 (Fig. 5E). This indicated that Akt inactivation evoked activation of caspases. Moreover, overexpression of constitutively active Akt did not alter PILP-1-evoked p38 MAPK activation and ERK inactivation (Fig. 5E), whereas SB202190 pretreatment or overexpression of constitutively active MEK1 abrogated PILP-1-induced Akt inactivation (Fig. 5F). These reflected that ADAM17 down-regulation was located at an upstream position for Akt inactivation in PILP-1-treated cells. In primary leukemic blast cells for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, the Lyn kinase is found to be constitutively activated (28Roginskaya V. Zuo S. Caudell E. Nambudiri G. Kraker A.J. Corey S.J. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Dos Santos C. Demur C. Bardet V. Prade-Houdellier N. Payrastre B. Récher C. Blood. 2008; 111: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Lyn is one member of the Src kinase family and has been reported to be upstream of Akt and ERK1/2 in intracellular cascades of acute myeloid leukemia (29Dos Santos C. Demur C. Bardet V. Prade-Houdellier N. Payrastre B. Récher C. Blood. 2008; 111: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Zhu Q.S. Xia L. Mills G.B. Lowell C.A. Touw I.P. Corey S.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 1847-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, Kang et al. (31Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) found that interaction between Src and ADAM12 played a role in activating Src tyrosine kinase. The commercially available antibody against the phosphorylated Src Tyr-416 residue recognizes the highly conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site (EDNEpYTAR) in other members of the Src kinase family. Thus, the corresponding tyrosine site at position 396 (the positive regulatory phosphorylation site) of Lyn is recognized by the anti-phospho-Src Tyr-416 antibody. Moreover, Western blot for phosphorylated LynY507 (the negative regulatory phosphorylation site) was also conducted. Fig. 6, A and B, shows that PILP-1 treatment or down-regulation of ADAM17 led to a decrease in the level of pY396-Lyn accompanied with an increase in the level of pY507-Lyn. Overexpression of ADAM17 suppressed PILP-1-evoked changes in the levels of pY396-Lyn and pY507-Lyn (Fig. 6B). These reflected that ADAM17 was associated with activation of Lyn in U937 cells. Inhibition of Lyn activity by PP2 caused a reduction in approximately 50% viability of U937 cells (Fig. 6C). PP2 treatment did not significantly affect PILP-1-induced p38 MAPK activation, ERK inactivation, and down-regulation of ADAM17 (Fig. 6D). Nevertheless, PP2 treatment induced degradation of procaspase-8 and a decrease in the level of phospho-Akt regardless of PILP-1 treatment. Fig. 6, C and E, shows that transfection of pcDNA3-LynY507F restored viability of PILP-1-treated cells and suppressed PILP-1-induced Akt inactivation and procaspase-8 degradation. PILP-1-induced ERK inactivation, p38 MAPK activation, and ADAM17 down-regulation were still noted with pcDNA3-LynY507F-transfected cells. Taken together, these results revealed that ADAM17 down-regulation led to inactivation of the Lyn/Akt pathway in U937 cells. Previous studies found that the EGFR inhibitor (Gefitinib)-induced apoptosis of U937 cells through the Akt pathway (32Moon D.O. Kim M.O. Lee J.D. Choi Y.H. Lee M.K. Kim G.Y. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2007; 28: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Gefitinib treatment reduced the levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK but did not alter phosphorylation of Lyn and p38 MAPK and ADAM17 protein expression (Fig. 6G). It reflected that ADAM17-mediated Lyn/Akt activation was not related to the EGFR pathway. To examine if endogenous ADAM17 binds to Lyn, cell lysates of control untreated cells and PILP-1-treated cells were incubated with anti-ADAM17 or anti-Lyn antibodies, respectively. The protein complexes captured by antibodies were subjected to Western blot analyses. Fig. 6F shows that Lyn was co-immunoprecipitated with ADAM17, suggesting that ADAM17 and Lyn formed protein complexes. Meanwhile, the protein complexes immunoprecipitated by either anti-ADAM17 or anti-Lyn antibodies revealed a reduction in pY396-Lyn and an increase in pY507-Lyn after PILP-1 treatment. The supplemental Fig. 3A shows that PILP-1 treatment induced ADAM17 down-regulation and procaspase-8 degradation in chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Knockdown of ADAM17 by siRNA also elicited a decrease in viability of K562 cells (supplemental Fig. 3B). Moreover, p38 MAPK activation, ERK inactivation, Akt inactivation, and Lyn inactivation were also noted with PILP-1-treated K562 cells (supplemental Fig. 3A). Obviously, PILP-1-induced death of K562 cells and U937 cells was likely mediated through the same pathways. In sharp contrast, PILP-1 did not induce significant changes in protein expression of ADAM17 and the levels of phospho-ERK, phospho-p38 MAPK, pY396-Lyn, and phospho-Akt in PBMC cells (supplemental Fig. 4A). Moreover, marginal reduction in viability of PBMCs was noted after PILP-1 treatment (supplemental Fig. 4B). These data indicated that PILP-1 showed selective cytotoxicity toward U937 and K562 cells. Given that ADAM17, ADAM9, and ADAM10 share common membrane substrates (33Mochizuki S. Okada Y. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), the effect of PILP-1 on protein expression of ADAM9 and ADAM10 was examined. As shown in supplemental Fig. 5A, protein expression of mature ADAM9 and ADAM10 did not significantly change in PILP-1-treated cells. Flow cytometry analyses also revealed that PILP-1 treatment did not significantly alter the amount of detectable ADAM9 and ADAM10 on the cell surface (supplemental Fig. 5B). To examine if endogenous ADAM9 or ADAM10 binds to Lyn, cell lysates of control untreated cells and PILP-1-treated cells were incubated with anti-Lyn antibodies. The protein complexes captured by antibodies were subjected to Western blot analysis. It was found that Lyn could not form protein complexes with ADAM9 or ADAM10 (supplemental Fig. 5C). ADAM is a gene family of multidomain membrane-anchored proteins, including more than 30 members in various animal species, and has been implicated in pathophysiological conditions (33Mochizuki S. Okada Y. Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 34Edwards D.R. Handsley M.M. Pennington C.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 258-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). ADAM17 is a member of the ADAM family and originally described as being responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-anchoring precursor form of TNF-α to generate a soluble form of TNF-α (35Arribas J. Ruiz-Paz S. Hooper N.M. Lendeckel U. The ADAM Family of Proteases. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005: 171-197Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that ADAM17 is also involved in the shedding of other biologically active proteins, including heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor β, TNFR1, TNFR2, EGFR, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, L-selectin, interleukin receptors, Notch, and prion proteins (36Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 37Alfa Cissé M. Sunyach C. Slack B.E. Fisher A. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4083-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ADAM17 has been shown to be synthesized as a zymogen, which is constitutively processed in the secretory pathway. An increase in the surface expression of ADAM17 up-regulated sheddase activity of ADAM17 (25Santiago-Josefat B. Esselens C. Bech-Serra J.J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8325-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to protein expression, generation of mature ADAM17 from its proform is proved to be related to its sheddase activity (37Alfa Cissé M. Sunyach C. Slack B.E. Fisher A. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4083-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 38Soond S.M. Everson B. Riches D.W. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Several reports have focused on the importance of ADAM17 up-regulation in tumor malignancy. In colon carcinoma, the up-regulated expression of ADAM17 induced the activation of EGFR through the shedding of EGFR ligands (39Blanchot-Jossic F. Jarry A. Masson D. Bach-Ngohou K. Paineau J. Denis M.G. Laboisse C.L. Mosnier J.F. J. Pathol. 2005; 207: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Tanaka et al. (40Tanaka Y. Miyamoto S. Suzuki S.O. Oki E. Yagi H. Sonoda K. Yamazaki A. Mizushima H. Maehara Y. Mekada E. Nakano H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 4783-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) demonstrated an increase in the expression of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor in advanced ovarian cancer and also found that it correlated significantly with the ADAM17 expression in ovarian cancer. Aberrant expression of ADAM17 has also been reported in breast cancer (41Fabre-Lafay S. Garrido-Urbani S. Reymond N. Gonçalves A. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19543-19550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), prostate cancer (42Karan D. Lin F.C. Bryan M. Ringel J. Moniaux N. Lin M.F. Batra S.K. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 23: 1365-1371PubMed Google Scholar), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (43Ringel J. Jesnowski R. Moniaux N. Lüttges J. Ringel J. Choudhury A. Batra S.K. Klöppel G. Löhr M. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9045-9053Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (44Takamune Y. Ikebe T. Nagano O. Shinohara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, blocking of ADAM17 expression or development of specific ADAM17 inhibitors might have potential for cancer therapy. Although specific ADAM17 inhibitors have been reported previously (45Cárdenas A. Moro M.A. Leza J.C. O'Shea E. Dávalos A. Castillo J. Lorenzo P. Lizasoain I. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wang X. Feuerstein G.Z. Xu L. Wang H. Schumacher W.A. Ogletree M.L. Taub R. Duan J.J. Decicco C.P. Liu R.Q. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 890-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), ADAM17-targeted drugs also lead to the inhibition of several nontarget ADAMs or metalloproteinases (47Rao B.G. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 295-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, suppression of ADAM17 protein expression may become specific modalities for cancer therapy. Our data show that PILP-1-induced death of leukemia cells is mediated through down-regulation of ADAM17 and subsequent inactivation of Lyn and Akt. Lyn has been reported to be the major Src kinase in acute myeloid leukemia, and its constitutive activation is associated with proliferation of leukemia cells (28Roginskaya V. Zuo S. Caudell E. Nambudiri G. Kraker A.J. Corey S.J. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Dos Santos C. Demur C. Bardet V. Prade-Houdellier N. Payrastre B. Récher C. Blood. 2008; 111: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Src family contains a unique N-terminal region, an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, an SH3 domain, a catalytic (tyrosine kinase) domain, and a short C-terminal tail. The SH3 domain is important for inter- as well as intramolecular interactions that regulate Src catalytic activity, cellular location, and recruitment of protein substrates (31Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Noticeably, the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM17 contains an SH3-binding site, which is suggested to potentially activate SH3 domain-containing signaling molecules such as Src and Grb (36Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Consistent with the finding that the interaction between ADAM12 and Src elicits activation of Src, our data reveal that ADAM17 is probably involved in Lyn phosphorylation through a similar mechanism. Noticeably, as compared with PBMC cells, leukemia cells, including U937 cells and K562 cells, are susceptible to being death induced by PILP-1. Thus, down-regulation of ADAM17 by PILP-1 may be an adaptable strategy in improving leukemia therapy. Conclusively, PILP-1 treatment suppresses ADAM17 expression through p38 MAPK activation and ERK inactivation-mediated pathways. Down-regulation of ADAM17 leads to inactivation of Lyn/Akt pathways and consequently evokes the caspase-8/mitochondria-mediated death pathway in U937 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2030784619,"Scorpion β-toxin 4 from Centruroides suffusus suffusus (Css4) enhances the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels through a voltage sensor trapping mechanism by binding the activated state of the voltage sensor in domain II and stabilizing it in its activated conformation. Here we describe the antagonist and partial agonist properties of a mutant derivative of this toxin. Substitution of seven different amino acid residues for Glu(15) in Css4 yielded toxin derivatives with both increased and decreased affinities for binding to neurotoxin receptor site 4 on sodium channels. Css4(E15R) is unique among this set of mutants in that it retained nearly normal binding affinity but lost its functional activity for modification of sodium channel gating in our standard electrophysiological assay for voltage sensor trapping. More detailed analysis of the functional effects of Css4(E15R) revealed weak voltage sensor trapping activity, which was very rapidly reversed upon repolarization and therefore was not observed in our standard assay of toxin effects. This partial agonist activity of Css4(E15R) is observed clearly in voltage sensor trapping assays with brief (5 ms) repolarization between the conditioning prepulse and the test pulse. The effects of Css4(E15R) are fit well by a three-step model of toxin action involving concentration-dependent toxin binding to its receptor site followed by depolarization-dependent activation of the voltage sensor and subsequent voltage sensor trapping. Because it is a partial agonist with much reduced efficacy for voltage sensor trapping, Css4(E15R) can antagonize the effects of wild-type Css4 on sodium channel activation and can prevent paralysis by Css4 when injected into mice. Our results define the first partial agonist and antagonist activities for scorpion toxins and open new avenues of research toward better understanding of the structure-function relationships for toxin action on sodium channel voltage sensors and toward potential toxin-based therapeutics to prevent lethality from scorpion envenomation."
https://openalex.org/W2000704978,"Caspase-6 (Casp6) is activated early in Alzheimer disease and involved in axonal degeneration, but the regulation of Casp6 activity has not been explored. Several alternatively spliced forms of caspases act as inhibitors of caspase activation. The CASP6 gene generates an alternatively spliced transcript known as CASP6β in addition to the CASP6α that encodes pro-Casp6a. Here, we show that the CASP6β transcript and the pro-Casp6b protein are present in many cell lines, in primary human neurons, and in human brains. Unlike most other alternatively spliced caspase transcripts, pro-Casp6b contains a catalytic site. However, purified pro-Casp6b did not have caspase activity, nor did it inhibit already activated Casp6a. Pro-Casp6b prevented the proteolytic activation of pro-Casp6a in vitro and in cells. Pro-Casp6b interacts directly with pro-Casp6a. This work shows that pro-Casp6b is an inhibitor of pro-Casp6a activation. These results imply that pro-Casp6b could negatively regulate pro-Casp6a activation in neurons and prevent Casp6a-mediated axonal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2075193479,"Homeostatic regulation of NF-κB requires the continuous synthesis of IκBα and its rapid degradation by the proteasome through a ubiquitin-independent pathway. We previously showed that the ubiquitin-independent degradation signal of unbound IκBα was located in the C-terminal PEST region, and we have now identified a single tyrosine, Tyr-289, and determined that the hydrophobic character of the tyrosine is important for the rapid turnover of IκBα. The sequence composition of the PEST peptide surrounding this Tyr-289 imposes a distinct polyproline II conformation. Enhancing the polyproline II helix formation correlates with slower degradation rates of unbound IκBα. We have further identified a degradation signal located within the 5th ankyrin repeat that is functional once the C terminus is removed. Both the C-terminal and 5th ankyrin repeat degradation signals have inherent flexibility and specific hydrophobic residue(s), which together constitute the ubiquitin-independent degradation signal for IκBα."
https://openalex.org/W2045705582,"Matriptase is a type II transmembrane serine protease comprising 855 amino acid residues. The extracellular region of matriptase comprises a noncatalytic stem domain (containing two tandem repeats of complement proteases C1r/C1s-urchin embryonic growth factor-bone morphogenetic protein (CUB) domain) and a catalytic serine protease domain. The stem domain of matriptase contains site(s) for facilitating the interaction of this protease with the endogenous inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type-1 (HAI-1). The present study aimed to identify these site(s). Analyses using a secreted variant of recombinant matriptase comprising the entire extracellular domain (MAT), its truncated variants, and a recombinant HAI-1 variant with an entire extracellular domain (HAI-1-58K) revealed that the second CUB domain (CUB domain II, Cys(340)-Pro(452)) likely contains the site(s) of interest. We also found that MAT undergoes cleavage between Lys(379) and Val(380) within CUB domain II and that the C-terminal residues after Val(380) are responsible for facilitating the interaction with HAI-1-58K. A synthetic peptide corresponding to Val(380)-Asp(390) markedly increased the matriptase-inhibiting activity of HAI-1-58K, whereas the peptides corresponding to Val(380)-Val(389) and Phe(382)-Asp(390) had no effect. HAI-1-58K precipitated with immobilized streptavidin resins to which a synthetic peptide Val(380)-Pro(392) with a biotinylated lysine residue at its C terminus was bound, suggesting direct interaction between CUB domain II and HAI-1. These results led to the identification of the matriptase CUB domain II, which facilitates the primary inhibitory interaction between this protease and HAI-1."

These modifications require sequential steps; a Ubl (ubiquitin-like modifier) is first activated by an activation enzyme (E1), which catalyzes adenylation of the C-terminal –COOH group of Ubl, and then forms a thioester bond between the –SH group of the active site Cys and the C-terminal –COOH group. Ubl is then transferred to a conjugation enzyme, E2, and forms a thioester bond with the –SH group of the active site Cys residue of the E2. Ubl is then transferred to target proteins.

Although SUMO adenylation does not appear to require large-scale conformational changes, formation of the SUMO∼E1 thioester requires that the domain containing the catalytic Cys residue (Cys domain) rotates ∼140° accompanied by unfolding of an α-helix and formation of a short β-sheet. Upon formation of the SUMO∼E1 thioester, the Cys domain rotates to its original position to interact with E2 to transfer SUMO to E2 (8Huang D.T. Hunt H.W. Zhuang M. Ohi M.D. Holton J.M.

It remains unclear whether these conformational transitions in E1 are triggered by the formation of intermediates or whether they occur continuously. The E2 inhibitory effect has been described for the formation of E1 catalyzed E2∼ubiquitin and E2∼NEDD8 thioester formation, where high E2 concentrations inhibited formation of the thioester conjugates (11Siepmann T.J.

Such inhibitory effects reflect the ordered nature of the steps in Ubl modifications. The structural mechanism of the inhibitory effect is unclear and was suggested to be due to two E2-binding sites on E1, one inhibitory and one productive as found in well characterized enzymes catalyzing small molecular reactions. In this study, we investigated the E2 inhibitory effect in SUMO modification. Similar to the ubiquitin and NEDD8 E2s, we found that the SUMO E2 confers an inhibitory effect on its E1. NMR chemical shift perturbation showed that the E2 can bind to both the movable UFD and Cys domains of free E1, in the absence of the E1∼SUMO thioester formation, suggesting that the UFD undergoes large-scale domain movements in free E1. ATP:PPi exchange experiments further revealed that the E1-E2 interaction inhibited E1-catalyzed SUMO adenylation. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis in combination with biochemical assays showed that the same E1-E2 interfaces are responsible for both the inhibitory effect and formation of the E2∼SUMO thioester. Because E2 binds to both domains of E1 that undergo large-scale domain movements, and thus would stabilize the conformation of E1, this study indicates that conformational flexibility of E1 is required for SUMO adenylation. Site-directed mutagenesis of Ubc9 was carried out using QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene), using primers designed for each mutation. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of recombinant proteins were carried out as described previously (9Wang J. Hu W. Cai S. Lee B. Song J. Chen Y. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Wang J. Lee B. Cai S. Fukui L. Hu W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20340-20348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Full-length SUMO E1 (∼110 kDa) was expressed in lysogeny broth medium. Ubc9 was expressed in M9 medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. The M9 medium was also dissolved in 100% D2O to eliminate aliphatic protons that could broaden the resonances of amide protons, which were observed in 1H-15N TROSY, free and in complex with the deuterated SUMO E1. NMR experiments were carried out at 30 °C in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. All NMR experiments were performed on a Brucker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with cryo-probe, pulse shaping, and pulsed field gradient capabilities. All conjugation assays were conducted in a mixture containing ATP and its regeneration system (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 units/ml creatine kinase, and 0.6 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times prior to addition of SDS gel loading buffer (with or without reducing reagent dithiothreitol) to stop the reaction. Samples were then resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and polypeptide bands were visualized by SimpleBlue staining (Invitrogen). For Ubc9∼SUMO thioester complex formation, SUMO (20 μm) and E1 (0.5 μm) were incubated with serial concentrations of Ubc9 (2.5–20 μm), and aliquots were taken after 5, 10, and 20 min and mixed with nonreducing SDS gel loading solution for electrophoresis and further analysis. For assays of RanGAP1∼SUMO isopeptide complex formation, SUMO (15 μm) and RanGAP1 (15 μm) were incubated in the presence of E1 (0.1 μm) and serial concentrations of Ubc9 (1–12 μm). Aliquots were withdrawn at 5, 10, and 20 min after initiation of the reaction for SDS-PAGE analysis. Radioactive isotope-based PPi:ATP exchange assay was adopted from Burch and Haas (14Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, SUMO (10 μm) was incubated (37 °C for 20 min) with E1 enzyme (0.2 μm) in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm [32P]PPi (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was then quenched by addition of 5% (w/v) TCA (0.5 ml) containing 4 mm carrier PPi. The isotope exchange reactions were carried out in the presence of various Ubc9 mutants at varying concentrations (0.25–8 μm). The 32P-incorporated ATP was absorbed to a 10% (w/v) slurry of activated charcoal (0.3 ml; Sigma) in 2% TCA, and the charcoal was rinsed three times with 2% TCA (1 ml) prior to Cerenkov counting. For data analysis, the production of radioactive ATP (percentage of CPM over total radioactive input) by the reaction without Ubc9 was used as reference, and relative activity was calculated for all other assays. For the E1-E2 binding assay, wild-type or mutant E1 (11.3 μg, 0.1 nmol) was mixed with Ubc9 (20 μg, 1 nmol) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, and the mixture was rocked end-to-end for 1.5 h at room temperature. After being mixed with native gel loading buffer, samples were resolved on nondenaturing 6% Tris-glycine PAGE gel (Invitrogen), and proteins were visualized by SimpleBlue staining. The E2 enzymes of NEDD8 and ubiquitin display classical substrate inhibitory effects on their cognate E1 enzymes: increasing concentrations of the E2s inhibit formation of E2∼Ubl thioesters, in which E2 and Ubl are both the substrates of E1 (11Siepmann T.J. Bohnsack R.N. Tokgöz Z. Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9448-9457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Wee K.E. Lai Z. Auger K.R. Ma J. Horiuchi K.Y. Dowling R.L. Dougherty C.S. Corman J.I. Wynn R. Copeland R.A. J. Protein Chem. 2000; 19: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This effect is thought to be the result of E2 binding to free E1; however, the mechanism for such inhibition has been unclear. We first examined whether the SUMO E2 (also known as Ubc9) confers a similar substrate inhibitory effect for formation of the Ubc9∼SUMO thioester conjugate. Increasing concentrations of E2 lead to the formation of less E2∼SUMO thioester conjugate (Fig. 1A, top panel, and B). This effect was observed under various reaction times and concentrations of the E1 and E2 enzymes. Thus, the E2 inhibitory effect appears to be a conserved property of ubiquitin-like modifications, reflecting the ordered steps of these modifications. Next, we examined whether the E2 inhibitory effect is limited to formation of the E2∼SUMO thioester, which is “half” of the SUMO modification process, or extends to the overall conjugation reactions. To this end, SUMOylation of RanGAP1 and Sp100 was examined. Although Sp100 SUMOylation is stimulated by the E3 ligase RanBP2, RanGAP1 can be SUMOylated efficiently in the absence of an E3, such that any potential effect of E3 can be eliminated. RanGAP1 modification by SUMO was carried out in the presence of E1 and at increasing concentrations of Ubc9 (Fig. 1, C and D). Again, higher concentrations of the E2 inhibited formation of SUMOylated RanGAP1. Similarly, the E2 inhibitory effect was also observed in Sp100 conjugation in the presence of E3 (data not shown). The concentrations of Ubc9 when the maximal RanGAP1∼ SUMO conjugates was formed were ∼5-fold less than that when the maximal Ubc9∼SUMO thioesters were achieved. This is likely due to the 5-fold lower E1 concentration (0.1 μm) used in the overall conjugation assays than that used in Ubc9∼SUMO thioester formation assays (0.5 μm), where higher Ubc9 concentrations were used for detection of Ubc9 and Ubc9∼SUMO thioester. Taken together, these data suggest that the E2 inhibitory effect is directly linked to the E1 concentration used in the reactions. In addition, the inhibitory effect of E2 is not limited to the formation of E2∼SUMO thioester but has extended impact on the overall conjugation reactions. To probe how E2 and E1 interact in the absence of thioester-bonded SUMO, we examined E1-E2 interactions using NMR chemical shift perturbation. 2H/13C/15N-enriched Ubc9 and E1 were used to form a complex (Fig. 2). Fig. 2A shows the superimposed 1H-15N TROSY spectra of Ubc9, free and in complex with the full-length E1. Extensive chemical shift perturbation in Ubc9 occurred upon complex formation with E1. However, the resonances of some residues disappeared upon complex formation (line broadening effect), whereas those of other residues showed significant chemical shift changes. Such chemical shift perturbation is consistent with the affinity between E1 and E2 being ∼100 nm (9Wang J. Hu W. Cai S. Lee B. Song J. Chen Y. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Those residues for which resonances disappeared or shifted significantly (indicated in magenta in the three-dimensional structure of Ubc9; Fig. 2B) occurred within the regions of residues 2–18, 26–44, 64–71, 83–86, 91, 109, and 129–134. Although the surfaces of a protein identified by chemical shift perturbation extend beyond the direct contacting surface, the surface that showed chemical shift perturbation revealed that the E1-E2 interaction in SUMOylation is completely analogous to the E1-E2 interaction in NEDD8 modifications (8Huang D.T.

Schulman B.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); the chemical shift perturbation on Ubc9 indicates that it forms interactions with UFD and the adenylation and the Cys domains of the SUMO E1, as found in the ternary complex of the NEDD8 E2 in complex with the E1∼NEDD8 thioester (8Huang D.T.

Biol. 2004; 11: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the E2 can directly bind to all three sites of the free E1 simultaneously, without conjugation of SUMO to E1. Thus, the UFD should be able to rotate between the “open” and “closed” conformation in the absence of SUMO∼E1 thioester formation, because if the UFD stays in the “closed” conformation in the absence of SUMO∼E1 thioester formation, the E2 would not be able to bind to the Cys domain, and chemical shift perturbation of residues 129–134 of Ubc9, which interact with the Cys domain (9Wang J. Hu W. Cai S. Lee B. Song J. Chen Y. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), would not have been observed. To determine how the different interfaces between E2 and E1 contribute to the productive and inhibitory effects of E2, we analyzed E2 enzymes with mutations that selectively disrupt the interfaces with UFD or the Cys domain. Because E2 has overlapping surfaces for noncovalent binding of SUMO and the UFD of E1, we designed specific mutations that disrupt only the E2-E1 interaction but not the E2 and SUMO interaction, based on the structure of the noncovalent complex between Ubc9 and SUMO (16Liu Q. Jin C. Liao X. Shen Z. Chen D.J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16979-16987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Capili A.D. Lima C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 608-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two Ubc9 mutants Ser-2 and Gly-3 to Asp (S2D/G3D) and Leu-6 and Ser-7 to Asp (L6D/S7D) disrupted the interaction with E1 (Fig. 3A). However, their structural integrities and affinities for SUMO-1 or RanGAP1 were the same as for wild-type Ubc9, as revealed by NMR spectra and NMR chemical shift perturbation (data not shown). These mutations are located at the surface next to the SUMO-binding site but are >30Å from the RanGAP1 binding surface (18Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these mutant proteins were less efficient at forming E2∼SUMO thioester conjugates at low Ubc9 concentrations (Fig. 1, A and B) and were less active than wild-type Ubc9 in the overall conjugation reactions (Fig. 1, C and D). However, unlike wild-type E2, the E1-binding deficient Ubc9 mutants S2D/G3D and L6D/S7D were not inhibitory toward formation of thioester with SUMO, or toward overall conjugation of SUMO to RanGAP1, as the amount of conjugated product increased as the E2 concentration increased (Fig. 1). Thus, at high Ubc9 concentrations, these mutants appear to be more active than wild-type E2. The lack of inhibitory effects of these mutants ruled out the possibility that the inhibitory effect of Ubc9 in the overall conjugation reactions is due to competition of free Ubc9 with SUMO-loaded Ubc9 for binding RanGAP1 because the Ubc9 S2D/G3D and L6D/S7D mutants have similar affinity for RanGAP1 as wild-type Ubc9. In addition to the mutants that disrupted Ubc9 binding to the UFD domain of E1, we also tested Ubc9 mutants that had been previously shown to disrupt the interaction between Ubc9 and the Cys domain during productive transfer of SUMO from E1 to E2 (9Wang J. Hu W. Cai S. Lee B. Song J. Chen Y. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because Ubc9 residues Ala-131 and Tyr-134 are important for the interaction with the Cys domain of E1, we mutated these residues. The A131D and Y134A mutants had greatly reduced ability to bind E1 (Fig. 3A), as well as reduced activity in forming E2∼SUMO thioester conjugates and conjugates of RanGAP1 at low concentrations of the E2 (Fig. 1). Similar results were observed using Sp100 as a substrate (data not shown). However, neither mutant displayed the inhibitory effect, and as concentration of the mutants increased, they formed monotonically increasing amounts of SUMO∼E2 thioester and SUMO∼RanGAP1 conjugate (Fig. 1), suggesting that the productive interaction between Ubc9 and the Cys domain of E1 is also responsible for the inhibitory effects of the E2. To investigate how E2 confers the substrate inhibitory effect, we used radioactivity-based pyrophosphate group (PPi) exchange (19Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to investigate whether binding of Ubc9 to E1 inhibited the first step of E1-catalyzed reactions – SUMO adenylation. When 32P-labeled (“hot”) PPi is mixed with unlabeled (“cold”) ATP in the presence of E1 and SUMO, ATP gradually becomes radioactive, whereas PPi gradually loses radioactivity because of the reversibility of the SUMO adenylation reaction. To prevent SUMO from transferring to the E2, we mutated the active site Cys-93 to Ala (C93A). Small amounts of C93A mutants formed isopeptides with SUMO at Lys-101, which is the closest Lys to Cys-93; therefore, we also generated and incorporated a K101R mutation. In addition, the four previously described mutations with reduced ability to bind E1 (i.e. S2D/G3D, L6D/S7D, A131D, and Y134A) also were incorporated into the Cys-93/Lys-101 mutant. All mutant proteins maintained their structural integrity, as shown by NMR spectra (data not shown). The design of these thioester-deficient E2 variants was necessary to examine the specific effects on adenylation, because transthiolation between E1 and E2 is reversible (20Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, high concentrations of wild-type Ubc9, which binds E1 with higher affinity than the mutants, could shift the equilibrium to E1∼SUMO thioester, thereby inhibiting SUMO adenylation. The C93A/K101R mutant inhibited E1 catalyzed SUMO adenylation, and the inhibitory effect increased as Ubc9 concentration increased (Fig. 3, B and C). However, none of the four mutants with reduced affinity for E1 were inhibitory to ATP:PPi exchange in comparison, indicating that the noncovalent interaction between E1 and E2 inhibits E1-catalyzed SUMO adenylation. The inhibitory effect of wild-type Ubc9 was less pronounced on SUMO adenylation (Fig. 3) than on the overall conjugation reactions, likely due to the added effect from reversal of transthiolation between E1 and E2 (20Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using NMR chemical shift perturbation data, we have shown that in the absence of SUMO thioester conjugation to E1, E2 not only binds to the UFD but also simultaneously binds to the Cys domain of SUMO E1 (Fig. 2). In the previously determined x-ray structures of the NEDD8 and SUMO E1s (6Lois L.M. Lima C.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Walden H. Podgorski M.S.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1427-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), the UFD is oriented in a closed conformation that prevents binding of E2 to the Cys domain. However, the crystal structure of the NEDD8 E1 in a ternary complex with thioester-conjugated SUMO and E2 showed that the UFD domain rotated 120 °, leading to an open conformation that allows simultaneous interactions of E2 with both the UFD and the Cys domain (8Huang D.T. Hunt H.W. Zhuang M. Ohi M.D. Holton J.M. Schulman B.A. Nature. 2007; 445: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The importance of the UFD and Cys domains of the ubiquitin and SUMO E1s in recruiting their cognate E2 for transferring their cognate Ubl from E1 to E2 was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme kinetic analysis (9Wang J. Hu W. Cai S. Lee B. Song J. Chen Y. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 228-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Huang D.T. Zhuang M. Ayrault O. Schulman B.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was not clear whether rotation of UFD to the open conformation is triggered by E1∼Ubl thioester conjugation. Results described here suggest that the UFD undergoes domain movement between the open and closed states (Fig. 4) in free E1. Consistent with this, the x-ray structure of yeast ubiquitin E1, without ubiquitin conjugation, showed that UFD is crystallized in the open conformation (22Lee I. Schindelin H. Cell. 2008; 134: 268-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We have also shown that binding of E2 to the free E1 leads to inhibition of SUMO adenylation. E2 does not bind in the vicinity of the adenylation active site of E1 and therefore should not alter adenylation in a direct way (8Huang D.T. Hunt H.W. Zhuang M. Ohi M.D. Holton J.M. Schulman B.A. Nature. 2007; 445: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, E2 binds to both of the E1 domains that undergo large-scale conformational changes. Thus, the E1-E2 interaction should stabilize both domains in the open conformations and restrict their conformational changes (Fig. 4). It is unlikely, however, that restriction of the conformational flexibility of the Cys domain is responsible for inhibition of SUMO adenylation because the crystal structure of E1 in complex with SUMO, ATP, and Mg2+ is very similar to that of E1 in complex with a SUMO andenylate mimic (5Olsen S.K. Capili A.D. Lu X. Tan D.S. Lima C.D. Nature. 2010; 463: 906-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of the catalytic Cys to Ala in the ubiquitin and SUMO E1 does not affect ATP:PPi exchange (19Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that restricting the movements of UFD is responsible for inhibition of SUMO adenylation. We have recently found that the crossover loop linking the UFD to the rest of E1 is important for the adenylation activity of E1 (Fig. 4). 5J. Wang, S. Cai, and Y. Chen, submitted for publication. Thus, restricted conformational flexibility of UFD likely restricted the flexibility of the crossover loop necessary for optimal SUMO adenylation activity. We have shown here that the same interfaces between E1 and E2 are responsible for both the productive transfer of SUMO from E1 to E2 and the inhibitory effect of E2 on E1 activity. These studies suggest that the E2 inhibitory mechanism is due to alteration of the conformational flexibility of E1 required for adenylation. A similar mechanism is likely responsible for the inhibitory effect displayed by the E2s of ubiquitin, NEDD8, and possibly other Ubls. This study underscores the importance of using a wide range of enzyme concentrations when characterizing the activities of ubiquitin-like modifications. As shown in Fig. 1, at low E2 concentrations, before the onset of the inhibitory effect, the E2 mutants that had significantly reduced affinities for E1 also were less efficient at forming the E2∼SUMO thioester and at overall SUMO conjugation. However, at higher concentrations of E2, greater than those that caused E1 inhibition with wild-type E2, these mutants had higher apparent activities, which can be misleading. Ubiquitin-like modifications require multiple protein factors and steps. This study highlights the highly ordered steps of such processes, and a conformational flexibility-dependent mechanism for regulating the ordered nature of such processes."

Surprisingly, incorporation of T:T or C:T mismatches catalyzed by either H932Y or H932A mutants was followed by slow pyrophosphate release (or fast pyrophosphate rebinding). Also, H932Y readily catalyzed incorporation of multiple mismatches, which may have a profound physiological impact over time.

Mutations in DNA polymerase γ (pol γ) 2The abbreviations used are: polpolymerasePEOopthalmoplegiadddideoxy. have been linked to several mitochondrial disorders that include progressive external opthalmoplegia (PEO), Alpers syndrome, parkinsonism, male infertility, and SANDO (sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and opthalmoparesis) among others (1Roitberg A.E. Okur A. Simmerling C. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111: 2415-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The majority of the mutations in pol γ are associated with PEO, a mitochondrial disorder associated with accumulation of mitochondrial DNA deletions and mutations. The main clinical manifestation of PEO is progressive weakness of the external eye muscles and is often accompanied by dysphagia and variable weakness of the limb and neck muscles. Neurological symptoms could include depression or avoidant personality (2Suomalainen A. Majander A. Wallin M. Setälä K. Kontula K. Leinonen H. Salmi T. Paetau A. Haltia M. Valanne L. Lonnqvist J. Peltonen L. Somer H. Neurology. 1997; 48: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Greater than 60 pathogenic mutations in the pol γA gene are associated with PEO, including about 14 dominant mutations, 36 recessive mutations, and other mutations of sporadic or unknown origin (1Roitberg A.E. Okur A. Simmerling C. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111: 2415-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). polymerase opthalmoplegia dideoxy. Recently the crystal structure of the human pol γ was solved by Lee et al. (3Lee Y.S. Kennedy W.D. Yin Y.W. Cell. 2009; 139: 312-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and has provided an insight into understanding how processivity is achieved by the holoenzyme. The structure provides a framework to examine the physiological basis of heritable mutations in pol γ. Pol γ is a heterotrimer in which one molecule of the catalytic subunit (pol γA) binds to a dimeric pol γB. Similar to most DNA polymerases, the structure of pol γA resembles a human right hand with “palm,” “fingers,” and “thumb” domains (4Steitz T.A. Smerdon S. Jäger J. Wang J. Kohlstaedt L.A. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Rice P.A. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The palm domain is responsible for the catalysis of the phosphoryl transfer reaction, and the fingers domain is proposed to be involved in binding of the templating base and the incoming nucleotide and governs the fidelity of the DNA polymerase. The structures of the fingers domain differ between enzymes from different families, but a functionally conserved α-helix that binds the incoming nucleotide is located at a similar position within the fingers domain of different DNA polymerases. The thumb domain is mainly involved in the binding and translocation of the duplex DNA, playing an important role in replication processivity. Initial kinetic analysis using pre-steady state methods demonstrated that the catalytic subunit of the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol γ) alone was insufficient for processive replication of the mitochondrial genome, with a relative weak binding affinity for DNA (∼39 nm) and a kpol of 8.7s−1 (6Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The presence of the accessory subunit increased the affinity for the DNA as well as the polymerization rate (Kd, DNA∼10 nm, kpol∼45 s−1) without affecting the dissociation rate of the primer-template from the holoenzyme (6Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The increase in kpol is the largest determinant of the increase in processivity defined as kpol/koff. The crystal structure of the ternary complex of pol γ (with the DNA and nucleotide) is not yet known. Pol γ belongs to the Family A DNA polymerases represented by the extensively studied T7 DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The available structures of pol A family DNA polymerases revealed a large conformational change of the enzyme after nucleotide binding (7Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 8Doublié S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R31-R35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The open to closed conformational change suggests an induced-fit mechanism for nucleotide selectivity analogous to that seen for other members of the pol A family (9Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 10Kellinger M.W. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7734-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The high resolution crystal structures of the T7 DNA polymerase in a ternary complex with DNA and ddNTP as well as that of E. coli DNA polymerase I provide valuable insight to the probable functions of the pol γ active site residues. The four autosomal dominant PEO mutations, G923D, R943H, Y955C, and A957S in the active site of pol γA have been partially characterized using steady state kinetic measurements in an attempt to understand their role in enzyme catalysis (11Graziewicz M.A. Longley M.J. Bienstock R.J. Zeviani M. Copeland W.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The homologous residues in the T7 DNA polymerase are a part of the O helix forming the nucleotide binding pocket within the finger domain, as illustrated in Fig. 1, which is derived from the T7 DNA polymerase structure but labeled with pol γ residue numbers. All of the non-bridging phosphate oxygen atoms interact either with a metal ion or with one or more of the conserved residues of the O-helix. Two oxygen atoms of the γ phosphate are contacted by Arg-943, Tyr-951 (helix O) and His-932 (helix N), both, contact the β phosphate, and Lys-947 contacts the α-phosphate. The mutation of His-932 to a tyrosine is associated with autosomal recessive form of PEO and SANDO (sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and opthalmoparesis). The H932Y mutation is found as a compound with T251I/P587L and with G1051R (12Di Fonzo A. Bordoni A. Crimi M. Sara G. Del Bo R. Bresolin N. Comi G.P. Hum.

Neurology. 2004; 62: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A preliminary pre-steady state kinetic study of nucleotide incorporation on H932Y mutation of human pol γ has quantified the effect of the mutation of the kinetics of correct nucleotide incorporation (14Stumpf J.D. Bailey C.M. Spell D. Stillwagon M. Anderson K.S. Copeland W.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but the role of His-932 in nucleotide selectivity has not been determined. Here we have evaluated the mechanistic role of the His-932 residue in the polymerase active site by systematically investigating H932Y and H932A mutations. In this study incorporation of the nucleotide (correct as well as mismatch) and dideoxynucleotide was examined by chemical quench assays, and the data were analyzed globally to obtain the pathway for the mutants. Our results present a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the role of the His-932 residue in the catalysis of pol γ. The C-terminal His-tagged pol γB lacking the first 25 amino acids from the N terminus (the mitochondrial localization sequence) was cloned into pET43.1a vector and transformed in E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) from Novagen. A transformant selected from a single colony was used to inoculate a LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). This starter culture was grown overnight at 37 °C and was subsequently used to inoculate a larger 1-liter LB medium. The expression of pol γB was induced with isopropyl 1 thio-β-d-galactopyranoside with a final concentration of 1 mm when the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. After 6 h of induction at 25 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 rpm in a Beckman JLA8.1 rotor at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in pH 8 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The suspension was sonicated on an ice bath after incubation with lysozyme (0.3 mg/ml) for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min, retaining the supernatant, and polyethyleneimine (PEI) was added to achieve a final concentration of 0.1% PEI and centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman 45Ti. Pol γB was purified further by loading the supernatant onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) followed by S200 Superdex gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (15Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The purified fractions were pooled and dialyzed against a final storage buffer containing 50% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm EDTA. The dialyzed protein was then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by A280 using an extinction coefficient of 71,940 m−1cm−1 (16Yakubovskaya E. Chen Z. Carrodeguas J.A. Kisker C. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 374-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) To observe misincorporation of an incorrect nucleotide by pol γ, it is necessary to use enzyme that is exonuclease-deficient and lacks proofreading activity (17Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 18Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), so all experiments were performed with an exonuclease deficient mutant (D198A, E200A). The primary clone for the WT exonuclease-deficient C terminus His-tagged pol γA was maintained in pUC 19.1 and lacked the first 66 amino acids from the N terminus (including the mitochondrial localization sequence and the poly-glutamine tract). The mutations H932Y and H932A were made on the exonuclease-deficient wt pol γA (del 66) in pUC19.1 by site-directed mutagenesis. All the pol γA clones were transferred to a shuttle vector pBacPak9 (Clontech) by restriction digestion of the pUC 19.1 vector and subsequent ligation to pBacPak9. The pol γA clones in pBAcPak9 were then transferred into the baculovirus genome by recombination between the shuttle vector and the BacPak6 viral DNA (Clontech). Recombinant high viral titers were optimized for protein expression and used to infect SF9 cells at a multiplicity of infection greater than 10. Cells were harvested at 72 h post-infection at 1500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further use. The cell pellet was resuspended by stirring for 1 h in 6 volumes (mass to volume) of the lysis buffer composed of 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgAc·4H2O, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture from A. G. Scientific Inc. All steps were carried out in 4 °C unless otherwise specified. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. The salt concentration of the supernatant was increased to 500 mm KCl by slowly adding 3 m KCl buffer (3 m KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 5% glycerol). The supernatant was then stirred for 20 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 31,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman 45-Ti rotor to remove the debris. The clear supernatant was removed and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) followed by a Source S ion exchange column as described previously (3Lee Y.S. Kennedy W.D. Yin Y.W. Cell. 2009; 139: 312-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Yakubovskaya E. Chen Z. Carrodeguas J.A. Kisker C. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 374-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The Source S fractions containing pol γA were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into 50% glycerol buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm EDTA). The dialysate was divided into aliquots, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in −80 °C until further use. The protein concentration was determined by A280 using an extinction coefficient of 243,790 m−1 cm−1 (16Yakubovskaya E. Chen Z. Carrodeguas J.A. Kisker C. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 374-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The yield of the protein was typically ∼1–1.5 mg from 1 liter of culture. All experiments were performed with a reconstituted enzyme formed with a 5:1 molar excess of pol γB over pol γA. All references to pol γ are to the reconstituted holoenzyme. DNA oligomers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. and purified using 15% polyacrylamide/7 m urea denaturing gel electrophoresis. A 25-mer primer (5′-GCC TCG CAG CCG TCC AAC CAA CTC A-3′) and a 45-mer template (5′-GGA CGG CAT TGG ATC GAG GTT GAG TTG GTT GGA CGG CTG CGA GGC-3′) were adopted from previous studies to allow comparison between all the studies (6Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Lee Y.S. Lee S. Demeler B. Molineux I.J. Johnson K.A. Yin Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1490-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The dTMP-terminated primer was used for single nucleotide incorporation experiments, and it was 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Heating at 95 °C for 5 min terminated the labeling reaction, and excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed using a Biospin 6 column (Bio-Rad). The primer and template were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio, heated at 95 °C for 2 min, and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature to form the duplex as shown in Fig. 4. Single nucleotide incorporation assays were performed with a RQF-3 rapid quench-flow apparatus (KinTeK Corp.) at 37 °C in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2. For studying the incorporation of dATP and ddATP, one sample loop was loaded with an enzyme-DNA complex (formed with 300–350 nm enzyme, 1.2–1.4 μm small subunit, and 150–200 nm 5′-32P-labeled 25-mer/45-mer DNA duplex) in the reaction buffer without MgCl2. Another loop was loaded with nucleotide in the reaction buffer with 25 mm MgCl2. The reactions were started by rapidly mixing the two reactants (1:1) and then were quenched by mixing with 0.5 m EDTA (final concentration) after various time intervals. For the misincorporation experiments, preformed enzyme-DNA complex (200–300 nm enzyme, 0.8–1.2 μm small subunit, and 150 nm 5′-32P-labeled 25-mer/45-mer DNA duplex) in the reaction buffer without MgCl2 was used. For longer timescale misincorporation experiments (varying from 20 min to 1.5 h), manual hand mixing and quenching was done instead of using the rapid quench flow apparatus. In all assays a maximum of 5 mm dNTP (final concentration after mixing) was not exceeded to avoid complications due to nonspecific inhibition (17Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 20Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The products from the assays described above were resolved on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide-sequencing gel, and then the dried gel was exposed to a phosphor screen. The screen was scanned using a Storm 860 scanner (GE Healthcare), and the amount of product formation at each time point was analyzed using the ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The concentration of the product was calculated from the concentration of the starting isotope labeled DNA primer times the fraction of the materials in the product band. All of the data presented in this paper have been fit globally using the KinTek Explorer program (KinTek Corp.) based upon numerical integration of rate equations for the complete model. In fitting data to Schemes 1 or 2, we also included previously estimated rates for DNA binding and dissociation in constructing a comprehensive model. Concentrations of active enzyme were adjusted slightly (±10%) in deriving the best fit. In addition to S.E. values, we have also presented upper and lower limits for each of our fitted parameters in the tables. These limits are derived based upon a threshold in the confidence contours equal to 10% increase in χ2, as described (21Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This method of estimating errors is more robust than traditional S.E. analysis, which tends to underestimate errors and often fails to reveal parameters in the model that are under-constrained by the data. In fitting data to Scheme 1 or Scheme 2, the equilibrium constant for the initial complex formation was estimated by assuming diffusion-limited nucleotide binding (k1 = 100 μm−1 s−1) and allowing the dissociation rate to vary during fitting to afford calculation of the equilibrium constant (K1 = k1/k−1). In some cases, during global fitting of data within a concentration series, a small background correction (less than 10% of the signal) was applied to individual traces based upon optimal fitting the data to the model. Kinetic parameters kcat and kcat/Km were derived for Scheme 1 by the simple relationship kcat = kpol and Km = Kd,app. However, for the data fit to Scheme 2, the bulk parameters were calculated from the complete solution for the three-step model.kcat =k2k3k2+k−2+k3(Eq. 1) Km=k2k3+k−1(k−2+k3)k1(k2+k−2+k3)(Eq. 2) kcat/Km=k1k2k3k2k3+k−1(k−2+k3)(Eq. 3) The kinetics of correct nucleotide incorporation were measured by rapid quench-flow methods. An enzyme-DNA complex was rapidly mixed with a solution containing the correct incoming nucleotide (dATP) at various concentrations. The experiments were performed under single turnover conditions in that the enzyme concentration exceeded the concentration of DNA. The nucleotide concentration dependence of the rate of polymerization provided estimates of an apparent nucleotide dissociation constant (Kd,app) and a maximum rate of nucleotide incorporation (kpol) according to Scheme 1 as described previously (17Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 22Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A and B, show the time courses of the product (26-mer) formation at several nucleotide concentrations observed for the WT and the H932Y mutant, respectively. The data defining nucleotide incorporation were fit globally to the mechanism shown in Scheme 1 to obtain the maximum nucleotide incorporation rate (kpol) and the apparent nucleotide dissociation constant, Kd,app (EDn refers to the enzyme-DNA complex where the primer is n residues in length).EDn+dNTP⇌Kd,app⁡EDndNTPEDndNTP⇌kpol⁡EDn+1PPi⟶fast⁡EDn+1+PPiSCHEME 1 According to this simplified model, the polymerization rate is presumed to be governed by a single rate-limiting step (kpol), and the ground state binding occurs as a rapid equilibrium. After the incorporation of a correct nucleotide, pyrophosphate release and translocation appear to be fast (17Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 22Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar); therefore, the measured ratio of kpol/Kd,app defines kcat/Km, the specificity constant governing incorporation during processive polymerization. It should be noted that the apparent dissociation constant (Kd,app) cannot be interpreted as a simple substrate dissociation constant when binding occurs in multiple steps; rather, Kd,app more accurately reflects a Michaelis constant reflecting the relative rates of substrate binding and incorporation rather than the ground state nucleotide binding (9Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 10Kellinger M.W. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7734-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Regardless, kpol/Kd,app provides an accurate measurement of kcat/Km governing sequential nucleotide incorporation during processive synthesis. Kinetic parameters for the WT enzyme determined from the global fitting were in agreement with previously published data (6Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A.

Interestingly, the H932Y mutant showed a maximum rate of polymerization similar to that of the WT enzyme, but kcat/Km was severely affected, (∼150-fold) as summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Effect of H932Y/A mutations on the specificity constant for incorporation of dATP and ddATPEnzyme/nucleotidekpolKd,appkpol/Kd,appDiscriminations−1μmμm−1 s−1WT dATP30 ± 20.7 ± 0.1443 ± 910(29–33)(0.62–0.84) ddATP1.8 ± 0.20.42 ± 0.064.3 ± 0.8(1.6–2)(0.36–0.48)H932Y dATP28.6 ± 2.9103 ± 150.3 ± 0.0515(27–30)(97–110) ddATP1 ± 0.1461 ± 100.02 ± 0.003(0.87–1.3)(52–82)H932A dATP23 ± 2.839 ± 6.40.6 ± 0.130(23–27)(39–49) ddATP0.7 ± 0.0438 ± 2.60.02 ± 0.002(0.67–0.75)(35–42) Open table in a new tab The incorporation of ddATP (the active metabolic product of the anti-HIV nucleoside analog didanosine, didexoyinosine) was measured by rapid quench flow methods similar to the measurements done for the incorporation of dATP. Fig. 2, C and D, show the time courses of the product formation observed for the WT and the H932Y mutation respectively with ddATP. The data defining nucleotide incorporation kinetics were then fit globally to the mechanism shown in Scheme 1 to obtain the maximum incorporation rate and the apparent dissociation constant, Kd,app (summarized in Table 1). It is important to note that for the WT enzyme, the lower concentration data do not reach the same end point because the nucleotide concentration was less than the enzyme concentration; this is taken into account during global fitting based upon numerical integration of the rate equations (23Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The maximum rates of incorporation of ddATP by the mutants were close to the WT, but the kpol/Kd,app was reduced by >200-fold. The discrimination, defined as the ratio of kcat/Km for the correct nucleotide relative to that of the analog, was not significantly affected by mutating the H932. The decrease in kcat/Km for ddATP is mostly offset by a similar decrease in kcat/Km for dATP incorporation. Misincorporation experiments were performed to investigate the discrimination against mismatches exhibited by the H932Y mutant as compared with that of wild-type enzyme. We examined the misincorporation of TTP, dCTP, and dGTP opposite the template TMP. In each experiment the time course of the product formation (26-mer or greater) was quantified. In some cases multiple nucleotides were incorporated onto the primer strand such that products of up to 35 nucleotides long were observed; therefore, all of the extended primers were included in the total concentration of product, which was then plotted versus time. Misincorporation parameters for WT human pol γ have been published previously (18Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and were used as a reference for our experiments but were repeated and reanalyzed with our updated global fitting methods. The kinetics of formation of a T:T mismatch and C:T mismatch by wild-type pol γ are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively (G:T mismatch results are summarized in TABLE 2, TABLE 3). Each of these sets of data were globally fit to Scheme 1. The results are consistent with those previously reported and show that incorrect nucleotides have decreased rates of nucleotide binding and incorporation.TABLE 3Effect of H932Y/A mutations on discrimination against mismatchesEnzyme/nucleotidekcatKmkcat/KmDiscriminations−1μmμm−1 s−1WT TTP0.01 ± 0.00481.8 ± 10.90.0001 ± 0.00005430,000 dCTP0.06 ± 0.0181030 ± 1930.00006 ± 0.00002717,000 dGTP6.6 ± 7.41300 ± 16000.005 ± 0.0088,600H932Y TTP0.0004 ± 0.0005154 ± 600.000002 ± 0.000003150,000 dCTP0.0003 ± 0.002750 ± 38750.0000004 ± 0.000003750,000 dGTP1.2 ± 0.424000 ± 96000.00005 ± 0.000036,000H932A TTP0.0003 ± 0.0004260 ± 1500.000001 ± 0.000002600,000 dCTP0.0005 ± 0.0011450 ± 13300.0000003 ± 0.00000072,000,000 dGTP0.27 ± 0.065150 ± 15000.00005 ± 0.0000212,000 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Effect of H932Y/A mutations on kinetic parameters governing discriminationEnzyme/nucleotide1/K1k2k−2k3μms−1s−1s−1WT TTP81.8 ± 10.90.01 ± 0.004(0)Fast(40–90)(0.006–0.01) dCTP1,030 ± 1930.06 ± 0.018(0)Fast(810–1,300)(0.05–0.08) dGTP1,300 ± 1,6006.6 ± 7.4(0)Fast(836–4,100)(4.5–20)H932Y TTP1,630 ± 3100.1 ± 0.020.01 ± 0.0030.0004 ± 0.0005(1,300–1,920)(0.08–0.1)(0.01–0.014)( 0.0003–0.0006) dCTP22,200 ± 3,4200.02 ± 0.0050.0004 ± 0.0030.0003 ± 0.002(17,800–6.7 × 1011)(0.015–8.3 × 105)(0.0002–0.002)(2.8 × 10−8-0.001) dGTP24,000 ± 9,6001.2 ± 0.4(0)Fast(18,300–1.5 × 105)(1–7)H932A TTP9,400 ± 2,7000.47 ± 0.150.013 ± 0.00560.0003 ± 0.0004(6,600–26,500)(0.39–1.86)(0.01–0.02)(2 × 10−5-0.0007) dCTP40,900 ± 9,4700.038 ± 0.0120.0009 ± 0.00060.0005 ± 0.001(26,000–1.9 × 105)aNo upper limit was found up to the value reported.(0.02–0.18)(0.0005–0.0017)(0.0002–0.0008) dGTP5,150 ± 1,5000.27 ± 0.06(0)Fast(4,100–10,000)(0.23–0.45)a No upper limit was found up to the value reported. Open table in a new tab Analysis of the misincorporation catalyzed by H932Y showed some unexpected results. First, it was noted that misincorporation of TTP onto a template T was followed by additional misincorporation events (Fig. 4). According to the sequence of the template, the enzyme formed two sequential T:G mismatches, a correct T:A base pair and then a T:G and T:C mismatch. The sum of all products formed was used to quantify the kinetics of incorporation of the first T:T mismatch as shown in Fig. 3C. The kinetics of formation of the C:T mismatch are shown in Fig. 3D. The data in Fig. 3C were initially fit to the model shown in Scheme 1, but it was immediately clear that the minimal model could not account for the trend observed in the data (Fig. 3C, dashed l"

We compared the transcriptional profiles of immature and mature mouse Langerhans cells using the suppressive, subtractive hybridization method and identified a novel gene of unknown function, termed herein transmembrane protein 123 (Tmem123), of which mRNA expression was enhanced in mature but not in immature Langerhans cells. Its expression was also enhanced in other mature DCs such as bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and splenic DCs. Interestingly, CD40 expression was up-regulated on mature BMDCs cultured with colchicine concurrently with the enhanced expression of Tmem123 compared with that of fresh BMDCs. Furthermore, the expression of CD40 was enhanced on Tmem123-transfected DC2.4 cells, a mouse BMDC-derived cell line, compared with that on mock-transfected DC2.4 cells. This enhancement of CD40 expression did not occur after deletion of lysosome/endosome targeting YXXφ motifs (where X is any amino acid and φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) in the Tmem123 cytoplasmic tail. By stimulation with anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody, these transfectants secreted an increased amount of IL-12/23 p40 compared with mock-transfected DC2.4 cells. Thus, our study demonstrates that Tmem123 may be used as a new maturation marker in DCs and that this molecule may be closely associated with the cell surface expression of CD40.

DC maturation is associated with reduced phagocytic capacities, enhanced production of cytokines and chemokines, and the capacity to migrate from non-lymphoid to lymphoid tissues (1Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12240) Google Scholar). Langerhans cells (LCs) are immature DCs localized in the epidermis. When inflammation occurs in the skin, LCs are exposed to various environmental and endogenous stimuli such as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin (IL)-1 and undergo a series of maturation processes including down-regulation of E-cadherin and Langerin expression, up-regulation of costimulatory molecules, and expression of CC chemokine receptor 7 (2Salgado C.G.

All of these processes are important for LCs to function as antigen-presenting cells; E-cadherin ligation keeps LCs in an immature state (3Riedl E. Stöckl J. Majdic O. Scheinecker C. Knapp W.

We succeeded in preparing highly purified LCs, which enabled us to carry out transcriptional profiling of immature and mature LCs. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-select complementary DNA (cDNA) subtraction method (called suppressive, subtractive hybridization (SSH)), we identified several genes regulated by maturation of LCs. Although the functions of some of the identified genes are not clear, we specifically focused on mouse transmembrane protein 123 (Tmem123), whose expression was up-regulated during maturation not only in LCs but also in other DCs. The possible role of Tmem123 in cell surface expression of CD40 was also investigated. BALB/c female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. (Yokohama, Japan) and were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of Tokyo Animal Facilities until use at the age of 8–12 weeks. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Research Committee of the University of Tokyo. Mouse recombinant GM-CSF and recombinant IL-4 were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; serotype 0111:B4) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Colchicine was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). For flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and immunostaining, the following antibodies were used: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb), FITC-conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD80 mAb, FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD86 mAb, FITC-conjugated mouse anti-mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (I-Ad) mAb, FITC-conjugated mouse anti-mouse CD11c mAb, FITC-conjugated mouse IgG isotype control, FITC-conjugated hamster IgG isotype control, FITC-conjugated hamster IgM isotype control, FITC-conjugated rat IgG isotype control (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Ab; Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), rabbit anti-hemagglutinin (HA) tag polyclonal Ab (pAb; Clontech), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-HA tag pAb, Living ColorsTM A.v. mAb (JL-8; Clontech), and rabbit γ-globulin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). To detect Tmem123 protein expression, we used a custom-made rabbit anti-mouse Tmem123 pAb (anti-Tmem123 pAb) generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to an 18-amino acid sequence (SRRGIRYRSIDEHDAIIC) of the C terminus of Tmem123 (Shima Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). Rat anti-mouse CD40 mAb (no azide/low endotoxin, clone 3/23) used to stimulate DCs to produce IL-12 p40 and rat IgG isotype control were purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. LCs were isolated and purified from mouse skin using anti-mouse I-Ad mAb using a previously described panning method, and the purity of I-Ad+ LCs was consistently over 95% (2Salgado C.G. Nakamura K.

BMDCs were obtained by culturing mouse bone marrow cells in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, and 10 ng/ml IL-4 for 6 days. After culture, CD11c+ cells were separated by positive selection using microbead-conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD11c mAb and a magnetic cell separator according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Belgisch Gladbach, Germany). The purity of fresh CD11c+ BMDCs was consistently over 80% (data not shown). For splenic DCs (SpDCs), CD11c+ cells were separated by positive selection from a mouse spleen cell suspension as described above. The purity of fresh CD11c+ SpDCs was consistently over 80%. HeLa cells, WEHI164 cells, B16-F0 cells, EL4 cells, and COS-1 cells were purchased from the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation (Osaka, Japan). DC2.4 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Rock (Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School). A20 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Fujimoto (Department of Dermatology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Ishikawa, Japan). LCs, BMDCs, SpDCs, and DC2.4 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium containing 10% FCS. B16-F0, WEHI164, and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. The following reagents were added to the medium: 0.1% sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acid, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Fresh LCs and LCs cultured in GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 24 h were collected, and cDNA subtraction and library screening were entrusted to Clontech. Briefly, two cDNA pools were synthesized from poly(A)+ RNAs isolated from fresh and cultured LCs. These two cDNA pools were digested with RsaI before cDNA subtraction, and the cDNA of cultured LCs was subtracted using the cDNA of fresh LCs with a PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech). The remaining cDNAs were randomly subcloned into a pAtlas vector (Clontech). One hundred and thirteen clones were sequenced from each cDNA pool, and their sequences were compared with those in the GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ database. Cells and tissues were collected, and messenger RNA (mRNA) was extracted using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Complementary DNA was synthesized using the SuperscriptTM III First-Strand Synthesis System for PCR (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). For mouse Tmem123 tissue distribution studies, Rapid-Scan mouse cDNA panels (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) and cDNA extracted from axial and popliteal lymph nodes was used. The PCR was performed with a LightCycler® system (Roche Diagnostics) in 20-μl reaction volumes using 1× FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics) in the presence of a 500 nm concentration of forward and reverse primers. For detection of Tmem123, the following primer pair was used: forward, 5′-CAA TGC AAG TGC TTC TCC AA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGT TCG TCA ATG CTT CGG TA-3′ (Sigma-Genosys). The primer pair resulted in PCR products of 249 base pairs (bp) for Tmem123. pEGFP-C1-Tmem123, GAPDH Primer and Probe set for LightCycler (Nihon Gene Research Laboratories, Miyagi, Japan), and pcDNA3.1 containing mouse GAPDH cDNA were used for calibrating cDNA. The reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 3 s, 65 °C for 3 s, and 72 °C for 12 s). The temperature ramp was set at 20 °C/s. The data were analyzed using LightCycler Software (Roche Diagnostics). Mice were sensitized with 50 μl of 0.5% 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetone and olive oil (4:1) on shaved abdominal skin for 2 consecutive days. Five days later, CHS was elicited by applying 20 μl of 0.25% 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene on the right ear. As a negative control, the left ear was treated with acetone/olive oil alone. Complementary DNA was extracted from each ear 24 h after the elicitation, and PCR for Tmem123 was performed as described below. Complemantary DNA from bulk spleen cells was amplified with PCR (94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) with primers for Tmem123: forward, 5′-ATG AAT TCT ATG GCG CTG TGT GCG CGG GCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCG AAT TCT TAA ATG ATG GCG TCG TGT TCG-3′ (Sigma-Genosys). The PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) or the EcoRI-BglII site of pCMV-HA (Clontech), and the sequence was verified.

Dead cells were excluded from all analyses. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gel (4–12%) and MES running buffer (Invitrogen). Resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blotted with the indicated Ab, and visualized using SuperSignal Chemoluminescent Substrate (Pierce) in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase-detecting Ab. Cells were cultured on chamber slides and fixed with acetone at 4 °C for 5 min followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and blocking with 10% goat serum, PBS at room temperature for 20 min. In some experiments, cytospin slides were prepared as follows. The cell suspension was spun on a microscope slide using a cytocentrifuge (Shandon Elliot Cytospin, Shandon Elliot, Pittsburgh, PA), fixed with acetone at 4 °C for 5 min followed by washing with PBS twice, and blocking with 10% goat serum, PBS at room temperature for 20 min. These cell samples were incubated overnight with 0.1 μg/ml anti-Tmem123 pAb at 4 °C and stained with a VECTASTAIN ABC kit (rabbit IgG; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) with diaminobenzidine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). DC2.4 cells were treated as indicated and cultured with anti-CD40 mAb (20 μg/ml) or rat IgG isotype control (20 mg/ml) for 48 h, and IL-12/23 p40 protein levels in culture supernatants were quantified with mouse IL-12/23 p40 immunoassay kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was tested in duplicate. A paired two-tailed Student's t test was used to analyze the results, and a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. GM-CSF enhances maturation of mouse LCs and up-regulates CD80, CD86, and CD40 expression (2Salgado C.G. Nakamura K. Sugaya M. Tada Y. Asahina A. Fukuda S. Koyama Y. Irie S. Tamaki K. J. Invest.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 5113-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To detect novel genes associated with the maturation of LCs, we performed a PCR-select cDNA subtraction analysis using cDNA extracted from fresh LCs and LCs cultured with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. The following criteria were used to select the target genes. 1) The gene was a mouse gene. 2) The function of the genes in the context of DCs had not yet been reported. 3) The length of the cloned cDNA fragment was more than 100 bp, and its sequence showed more than 95% identity to the sequence of the actual gene registered in the NCBI database. 4) More than three cDNA clones were detected in the subtraction analysis. The most frequently detected DNA in 226 cDNA clones was Langerin (14 clones), which was already known to be down-regulated during LC maturation. According to the selection criteria, seven genes of a total of 226 clones were picked up as target genes (Table 1). The frequency of the clone detected for each gene seemed to correlate well with the transcription credibility during LC maturation. Among the seven target genes, we picked Tmem123 for further analysis.TABLE 1Target genes selected from result of PCR-select cDNA subtraction analysis using fresh LCs and LCs cultured with GM-CSF for 24 hGenBank accession no.Gene nameCloneUp-regulated genes X8256445 S pre-rRNA4 BC010292Transmembrane protein 1233 NP032564Myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C3 X66850Microsatellite DNA3Down-regulated genes AC093445C57BL/6J chromosome 1 clone rp23-267j186 AK017346Checkpoint suppressor 14 BC004092Influenza virus NS1A-binding protein3 Open table in a new tab Tmem123 mRNA is 2864 bp of mRNA with a poly(A) tail containing 588 bp of open reading frame (ORF) encoding 195 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass of Tmem123 is ∼21 kDa, and the ORF encodes a type I membrane protein with one extracellular domain (127 amino acids), two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (23 amino acids each), and a cytoplasmic tail. In addition, there is a lysosome/endosome targeting motif, YXXφ (where X is any amino acid and φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid), in the cytoplasmic tail of Tmem123 (Fig. 1, doubly underlined). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed to assess expression levels of Tmem123 mRNA in different cell types and tissues. Fresh BMDCs expressed Tmem123 mRNA, whereas both fresh LCs and fresh SpDCs did not (Fig. 2A). Tmem123 mRNA expression was up-regulated after 24 h of culture in LCs, SpDCs, and BMDCs, and it was further up-regulated with GM-CSF-induced maturation. B16-F0 cells (a melanoma cell line) and WEHI164 cells (a fibrosarcoma cell line) did not express Tmem123 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B depicts the expression pattern of Tmem123 mRNA in various tissues. The strongest signal for Tmem123 mRNA was detected in lymph nodes, and a relatively lower level of Tmem123 expression was found in spleen but not in thymus or skin. Tmem123 mRNA expression was also detected in heart, testis, adrenal gland, and uterus. These findings indicated that the expression of mouse Tmem123 was not necessarily restricted to lymphoid organ but that it was most highly expressed in lymph nodes where mature DCs accumulated. Because Tmem123 mRNA was not detected in the skin, we examined whether Tmem123 mRNA is expressed in mouse ear skin after eliciting CHS where maturation of skin DCs is induced (12Nuriya S. Yagita H. Okumura K. Azuma M. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Toebak M.J. Gibbs S. Bruynzeel D.P. Scheper R.J. Rustemeyer T. Contact Dermatitis. 2009; 60: 2-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA was extracted from mouse ear skin 24 h after the elicitation at the time point when mature LCs are still found in the skin (14Mizumoto N. Gao J. Matsushima H. Ogawa Y. Tanaka H. Takashima A. Blood. 2005; 106: 3082-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Stoitzner P. Holzmann S. McLellan A.D. Ivarsson L. Stössel H. Kapp M. Kämmerer U. Douillard P. Kämpgen E. Koch F. Saeland S. Romani N. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 266-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As expected, Tmem123 mRNA was detected in the ear skin after CHS elicitation but not in the control ear skin (Fig. 2C). To study the pattern of Tmem123 protein expression in DCs, we used a custom-made anti-Tmem123 pAb generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of Tmem123 (Fig. 1, singly underlined). An expression vector containing the ORF of Tmem123 (pEGFP-C1-Tmem123) or mock vector (pEGFP-C1) was introduced into COS-1 cells. Flow cytometry showed that more than 60% of COS-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1-Tmem123 (Fig. 3A), and an immunoblot of cell lysate from these transfectants revealed that anti-Tmem123 pAb recognized an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Tmem123 of ∼48 kDa in accordance with the molecular mass predicted from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 3B). With immunohistochemistry, anti-Tmem123 pAb recognized Tmem123 protein expressed in pEGFP-C1-Tmem123-transfected HeLa cells, whereas anti-Tmem123 pAb did not stain mock-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that anti-Tmem123 pAb recognized Tmem123 protein with immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. We next studied the regulation of Tmem123 protein in DCs. As shown in Fig. 4A, LCs cultured with or without GM-CSF for 48 h expressed a markedly increased level of Tmem123 protein compared with fresh LCs. Tmem123 protein expression was also up-regulated in BMDCs upon GM-CSF-induced maturation, and LPS further up-regulated its expression (Fig. 4B). Anti-Tmem123 pAb did not recognize cell surface expression of Tmem123, but it recognized the intracellular portion of Tmem123 after cell permeabilization as analyzed by flow cytometry (data not shown). Tmem123 protein expression was up-regulated in LPS-stimulated BMDCs compared with fresh BMDCs (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, Tmem123 expression correlated well with the cell surface expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, and CD40; Fig. 4C). Recently, colchicine has been reported to induce maturation in BMDCs (14Mizumoto N. Gao J. Matsushima H. Ogawa Y. Tanaka H. Takashima A. Blood. 2005; 106: 3082-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A double staining for Tmem123 and cell surface CD40 or CD80 was performed in BMDCs cultured with or without colchicine (0.001–1 μg/ml). As the colchicine concentration increased, the ratio of both Tmem123+/CD40+ and Tmem123+/CD80+ BMDC population increased. Interestingly, with a concentration of more than 0.1 μg/ml colchicine, virtually all CD40+ BMDCs co-expressed Tmem123, whereas two-thirds of CD80+ BMDCs co-expressed Tmem123 (Fig. 5). Thus, these results indicate that Tmem123 was closely associated with CD40 but not CD80. To further investigate the relation between Tmem123 and CD40 expression, we transfected mouse a BMDC cell line, DC2.4 cells (16Shen Z. Reznikoff G. Dranoff G. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with either pCMV-HA or pCMV-HA-Tmem123 by electroporation. The HA-Tmem123 protein expression (∼22 kDa) in pCMV-HA-Tmem123-transfected DC2.4 cells was confirmed by immunoblot either with anti-HA pAb or with anti-Tmem123 pAb (Fig. 6, A and B). DC2.4 cells expressed a weak level of Tmem123 protein (∼21 kDa), and this expression was increased after stimulation with 0.05 μg/ml colchicine (Fig. 6B) as expected. A mouse T cell line, EL4 cells, and a mouse B cell line, A20 cells, did not express Tmem123 (Fig. 6B). The ratio of CD40+ DC2.4 cells was significantly higher when the cells were transfected with pCMV-HA-Tmem123 compared with those transfected with pCMV-HA (69.9 ± 7.7 versus 42.3 ± 6.7%, n = 3, p < 0.001), whereas the expression levels of CD80 and CD86 did not differ (Fig. 7A). The expression level of CD40 was also higher in pCMV-HA-Tmem123 transfectants compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 7B).FIGURE 7Transfection with Tmem123 cDNA up-regulated cell surface expression of CD40 on DC2.4 cells. DC2.4 cells were transfected with pCMV-HA or pCMV-HA-Tmem123 and stained with anti-CD80 mAb, anti-CD86 mAb, and anti-CD40 mAb. These cells were permeabilized and stained with anti-Tmem123 pAb followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG Ab and analyzed by flow cytometry. A, the ratio of CD80-, CD86-, and CD40-positive cells in the HA-Tmem123- or HA-positive cells is shown. The ratio of CD40-positive cells was significantly higher in the HA-Tmem123-positive transfectants compared with HA-positive transfectants (69.9 ± 7.7 versus 42.3 ± 6.7%, n = 3, p < 0.001), although the expression levels of CD80 and CD86 did not differ. Results are mean ± S.D. (n = 3). B, the level of cell surface expression of CD40 on DC2.4 cells transfected with pCMV-HA (left panel) and pCMV-HA-Tmem123 (right panel) is shown.

C, the cell surface expression of CD40 was higher in pCMV-HA-Tmem123-transfected cells than that in mock-transfected cells. There was no difference in cell surface CD40 expression between ΔY176Y177Y184-transfected cells and mock-transfected cells. A representative of three independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then investigated the role of YXXφ motifs of Tmem123 for CD40 up-regulation. To this end, we deleted tyrosines 176, 177, and 184 from Tmem123 (ΔY176Y177Y184; Fig. 1). The protein expression in ΔY176Y177Y184-transfected DC2.4 cells was confirmed by immunoblot (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7D, the cell surface expression level of CD40 in ΔY176Y177Y184-transfected cells was the same as that in mock-transfected cells. Thus, the YXXφ motif of Tmem123 was required for cell surface expression of CD40. Finally, we investigated the effect of pCMV-HA-Tmem123 transfection on IL-12/23 p40 production. Because anti-CD40 mAb up-regulated IL-12/23 p40 secretion from DCs (11Tada Y. Asahina A. Nakamura K. Tomura M. Fujiwara H. Tamaki K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5113-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we transfected DC2.4 cells with either pCMV-HA-Tmem123 or pCMV-HA and stimulated these cells for 48 h with anti-CD40 mAb (20 μg/ml). Then, we quantified IL-12/23 p40 secreted from these cells in the culture supernatant. As shown in Fig. 8, DC2.4 cells transfected with pCMV-HA did not produce a detectable amount of IL-12/23 p40 (<5 pg/ml), whereas DC2.4 cells transfected with Tmem123 expression vector secreted a significant amount of IL-12/23 p40 when stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb (48.8 ± 7.6 pg/ml, n = 3, p < 0.05). We analyzed transcriptomes of immature and mature LCs by SSH and cloned and characterized a novel gene, Tmem123. We found that Tmem12"
https://openalex.org/W2014244586,"Transcription factor LSF is essential for cell cycle progression, being required for activating expression of the thymidylate synthase (<i>Tyms</i>) gene at the G1/S transition. We previously established that phosphorylation of LSF in early G1 at Ser-291 and Ser-309 inhibits its transcriptional activity and that dephosphorylation later in G1 is required for its reactivation. Here we reveal the role of prolyl <i>cis-trans</i> isomerase Pin1 in activating LSF, by facilitating dephosphorylation at both Ser-291 and Ser-309. We demonstrate that Pin1 binds LSF both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays, we identify three SP/TP motifs in LSF (at residues Ser-291, Ser-309, and Thr-329) that are required and sufficient for association with Pin1. Co-expression of Pin1 enhances LSF transactivation potential in reporter assays. The Pin1-dependent enhancement of LSF activity requires residue Thr-329 in LSF, requires both the WW and PPiase domains of Pin1, and correlates with hypophosphorylation of LSF at Ser-291 and Ser-309. These findings support a model in which the binding of Pin1 at the Thr-329—Pro-330 motif in LSF permits isomerization by Pin1 of the peptide bonds at the nearby phosphorylated SP motifs (Ser-291 and Ser-309) to the <i>trans</i> configuration, thereby facilitating their dephosphorylation."

Phosphorylation is a widespread phenomenon among eukaryotic proteins.

In the present work, we provide evidence for the first time that O-phosphohydroxyproline (Hyp(P)) is a proteinogenic amino acid. To detect Hyp(P) in proteins we generated a Hyp(P)-specific polyclonal antibody.

A wide range of biological processes are controlled by reversible protein phosphorylation, and conservative estimates indicate reversible phosphorylation targets of up to one-third of cellular proteins (1Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). To understand protein regulation through phosphorylation it is essential to find and characterize all sites and types of phosphorylation on proteins and to identify the kinases involved. Besides the three genetically encoded hydroxyamino acids serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), and tyrosine (Tyr), there are two other hydroxyamino acids, hydroxyproline (Hyp) 2The abbreviations used are: HyphydroxyprolineHyp(P)phosphohydroxyprolineHylhydroxylysineHyl(P)phosphohydroxylysineFmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylMS/MStandem mass spectrometrysHspsmall heat shock protein. and hydroxylysine (Hyl). They are not encoded in the genome, although they can be identified in mature proteins. They are generated by enzymatic hydroxylation of proline (Pro) and lysine (Lys) residues (2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). All genetically encoded hydroxyamino acids in polypeptide chains, such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine have been shown that they can undergo post-translational phosphorylation (3Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 4Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of Hyl has been described in collagens (5Urushizaki Y. Seifter S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 3091-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) phosphohydroxyproline (Hyp(P)) has not been identified in native proteins. hydroxyproline phosphohydroxyproline hydroxylysine phosphohydroxylysine N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl tandem mass spectrometry small heat shock protein. In addition to the O-phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group, O-glycosylation is another important modification. There is a growing speculation that phosphorylation and glycosylation share a reciprocal relationship. Both Hyp and Hyl are known to undergo glycosylation in a few proteins. In collagens up to 70% of Hyl residues are modified with galactose and glycosyl-galactose (6Kresina T.F. Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3089-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hyl was also found to be phosphorylated in collagens (5Urushizaki Y. Seifter S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 3091-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In extensins (hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins) of the cell wall in plants, ∼50% of protein mass is glycosylated at Hyp residues by mono-, di-, tri-(1→2)-β-linked arabinoses (7Knox J.P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Kieliszewski M.J. Lamport D.T. Plant J. 1994; 5: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 9Roberts K. Grief C. Hills G.J. Shaw P.J. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1985; 2: 105-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytoplasmic F box-binding protein SKP1 in Dictyostelium contains a pentasaccharide linked to Hyp (10Teng-umnuay P. Morris H.R. Dell A. Panico M. Paxton T. West C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18242-18249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that subsequent modification of Hyp is widespread and that, in analogy to all other hydroxyamino acids, phosphorylation of Hyp should be possible in native proteins. Hydroxylation of Pro is the precondition for subsequent phosphorylation and has been studied extensively in collagens (2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). The hydroxyl groups are introduced by sequence specific prolyl-3- or prolyl-4-hydroxylases. Prolyl-3-hydroxylase modifies Pro residues located C-terminally of glycine (Gly-Pro motif). Although Pro located at the N-terminal side of Gly (Pro-Gly motif) is hydroxylated by prolyl-4-hydroxylase, both hydroxylases introduce the hydroxyl group in trans configuration. In collagens >90% of Hyp is in trans-4 configuration. It seems to be the most common Hyp isomer whereas only up to 2% are trans-3-Hyp (2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). The alternative cis configuration of Hyp was not described in native proteins so far. Although Hyp was found in a multiplicity of other proteins, the corresponding hydroxylases are mostly unknown. Several experiments have shown that enzymatic phosphorylation of Hyp residues in synthetic peptides by a Ser-specific kinase is possible, although the kinetics of Hyp phosphorylation were very low compared with those of Ser and Thr (11Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6987-6990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pearson R.B. Floyd D.M. Hunt J.T. Lee V.G. Kemp B.E. Arch. Biochem.

The configuration of Hyp played a crucial role in these experiments. Enzymatic phosphorylation of trans-4-Hyp appeared to be possible, but not the phosphorylation of cis-4-Hyp (12Pearson R.B. Floyd D.M. Hunt J.T. Lee V.G. Kemp B.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All of these findings implicate that Hyp(P) is a proteinogenic amino acid. Here, we present the phosphorylation of Hyp in proteins by a specific polyclonal antibody. Furthermore we identified for the first time the sequence position of Hyp(P) by mass spectrometry in α-crystallin A. Because the isomeric configuration of the Hyp residue remained unclear for the majority of Hyp-containing proteins, we outline the mass spectrometrical characterization of peptides containing various Hyp(P) isomers. Thus, it was interesting to know whether MS/MS fragmentation was able to characterize the configuration of Hyp(P) in post-translationally modified proteins and to find parameters that would allow for the identification of Hyp(P) in unknown proteins. This would permit to distinguish between Hyp(P) and other phosphoamino acids. Amino acid derivatives were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and polystyrene AM RAM resin was obtained from Rapp Polymere (Tübingen, Germany). Peptide synthesis was performed with reagents and solvents from Applied Biosystems. All reagents and solvents for phosphorylation were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck and were of the highest available purity. Total protein was prepared from aorta, heart, and eye tissue of a female adult rat in consideration of the conservation of O-phosphoesters. O-Phosphates are acid-stable and more or less unstable in alkali for example, whereas N-phosphates are acid-labile (14Martensen T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to prevent the phosphoamino acid residues from dephosphorylation by unsuitable chemical conditions or by phosphatases because in most cases only a small percentage of the potential phosphoprotein is phosphorylated at a specific point in time (15Kalume D.E. Molina H. Pandey A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The rat was maintained in the animal facility of the Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf, Germany. The tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized. Homogenization was performed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0,25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT. After centrifugation at 28,000 × g, soluble proteins of the supernatant were precipitated in ice-cold acetone/trifluoroacetic acid (9:1 v/v). Advanced protein purification was performed by SDS-PAGE. Electrospray experiments were performed with an electrospray ionization-QqTOF hybrid mass spectrometer (QSTAR XL; Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nanoflow electrospray source. In preliminary steps, protein bands were excised from SDS gels and digested in situ with modified trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Resulting peptides were desalted and concentrated by reversed phase C18 ZipTips (Millipore). To reduce complexity of the samples, elution was performed gradually in 10% MeOH steps. Fmoc derivatives of cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline and trans-3-hydroxy-l-proline were synthesized according to the protocol of Paquet (16Paquet A. Can. J. Chem. 1982; 60: 976-980Crossref Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized on a 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using standard Fmoc chemistry. When Fmoc-hydroxy-l-proline derivatives with an unprotected hydroxyl group were introduced activation was employed by N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole. After cleavage and deprotection, the peptides were purified by reversed phase HPLC and lyophilized. Peptide identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The side chain-unprotected peptide resins were phosphitilated by dibenzyl-N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite/tetrazole yielding phosphopeptides after oxidation by tert-butylhydroperoxide followed by trifluoroacetic acid cleavage/deprotection (17Hoffmann R. Hoffmann T. Tholey A. Schulte A.C. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The resulting phosphopeptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The generation of mono- or polyclonal antibodies against Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P) is described by several authors (18Quadroni M. James P. Exs. 2000; 88: 199-213PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Hyp(P) were not available so far. Therefore, a Hyp(P)-specific polyclonal antibody was generated. We used a short synthetic sequence of collagen, including five Hyp(P) residues instead of Hyp for immunization. The sequence of the peptide was Gly-Pro-Hyp(P)-Gly-Pro-Hyp(P)-Gly-Pro-Hyp(P)-Gly-Pro-Hyp(P)-Gly-Pro-Hyp(P). After coupling the peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin it was used for immunization of a rabbit. Polyclonal antiserum was obtained from SEQLAB (Göttingen, Germany). Polyclonal antibodies were separated and enriched from the serum by protein A-Sepharose. The resulting specificity of the antibodies we obtained meets the requirements for Western blot analysis. No further affinity purification using synthetic phosphopeptides was done. To detect Hyp(P)-containing proteins, we generated a Hyp(P)-specific antibody. The specificity of the generated polyclonal antibody was tested by ELISA and dot blot analysis. The polyclonal antibody showed high specificity for Hyp(P) in all tests independently from the surrounding peptide sequence and without cross-reactivity to different phosphoamino acids such as Ser(P), Thr(P) or Tyr(P) (Fig. 1). Although unlikely, there is a small possibility that the polyclonal antibody could recognize sulfated Hyp. Sulfation can be a post-translational modification of proteins, but to our knowledge the only target amino acid is tyrosine. Sulfation of Hyp has not yet been demonstrated. Total protein from aorta, heart, and eye tissue of rat was prepared. Each of the three protein samples was separated by SDS-PAGE and assayed immunologically by Western blot analysis. The Hyp(P)-specific antibody recognized Hyp(P) in a few protein bands (Fig. 2). To verify these results and to confirm the specificity of the antibody, two aliquots of the protein preparations were pretreated with various phosphatases prior to SDS-PAGE. Pretreatment with the serine-/threonine phosphatase calcineurin did not alter the recognition pattern of proteins by the Hyp(P)-specific antibody compared with untreated proteins. In contrast, the Hyp(P)-specific antibody did not recognize any protein when the protein samples were pretreated with alkaline phosphatase which unspecifically dephosphorylates any known phosphoester, including Hyp(P) (Fig. 2). The Western blot showed specific recognition of Hyp(P) in different tissues: in three protein bands from heart tissue and four protein bands from eye tissue (Fig. 2). These seven proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. They all were identified as members of the protein family of crystallins (Table 1).TABLE 1Proteins recognized by Hyp(P)-specific antibody in Western blotProtein bandHeartEyeIβ-Crystallin B2β-Crystallin B2IIβ-Crystallin A4β-Crystallin A4IIIα-Crystallin Bα-Crystallin BIVα-Crystallin A Open table in a new tab To confirm the results of Western blot analysis and to identify Hyp(P) in the amino acid sequence of the detected proteins, MS analysis was performed. Hydroxylation or phosphorylation resulted in a mass increase of 16 Da and 80 Da, respectively. The mass spectrum of α-crystallin A indicated a signal of a doubly charged ion with [M+2H]2+ 504.33 m/z that was accompanied by signals with [M+2H]2+ 512.33 m/z and [M+2H]2+ 552.32 m/z (Fig. 3). These characteristic mass differences of 8 m/z and 40 m/z for doubly charged ions (16 Da and 80 Da for singly charged ions) gave a strong indication for peptide hydroxylation and phosphorylation. MS/MS analysis of the doubly charged ion with [M+2H]2+ 504.33 m/z identified the peptide sequence ALGPFYPSR corresponding to amino acid residues 13–21 of rat α-crystallin A (Fig. 4A). Despite the different masses of precursor ions with [M+2H]2+ 512.33 m/z and with [M+2H]2+ 552.32 m/z the corresponding peptides had the same sequence but each with another modification. The ion with [M+2H]2+ 512.33 m/z contained Hyp instead of Pro, resulting in the sequence ALG(Hyp)FYPSR (Fig. 4B), whereas the ion with [M+2H]2+ 552.32 m/z contained Hyp(P) at this position, resulting in the sequence ALG(Hyp(P))FYPSR (Fig. 4C). MS/MS spectra of the three peptides showed the entire y series of fragment ions. The completeness of y series facilitated the comparison of peptide sequences. Fragment ions y1 to y5 were identical in all three peptides. Post-translational modification of Pro was indicated by mass differences between fragment ions y5 and y6. In case of Pro, the mass difference between y5 and y6 was 97 Da. Mass differences of 113 Da and 193 Da between y5 and y6 corresponded to the modified forms of Pro, meaning Hyp and Hyp(P), respectively. All of the following fragment ions were transposed to the corresponding higher m/z values. Thus, α-crystallin A from eye tissue contained three subpopulations with different structural states at amino acid position 16 (Table 2). The amino acid Pro appears in nonmodified state as well as the modified forms Hyp and Hyp(P). Comparison of the signal intensities of the three peptides in the overview mass spectra (Fig. 3) shows that the unmodified (m/z 504.33) and the hydroxylated peptide (m/z 512.33) exist in more or less equal amounts. The phosphohydroxylated peptide (m/z 552.32) is about 80% of the signal intensities of proline and hydroxyproline and thus constitutes a significant proportion of the total protein. Both modifications of Pro16 were also observed in α-crystallin A from heart tissue. In all other protein bands recognized by the polyclonal antibody no further Hyp(P) could be verified by MS so far.TABLE 2Sequence of rat α-crystallin A chain (Swiss-Prot accession number P02490)MDVTIQHPWFKRALGPFYPSRLFDQFFGEGLFEYDLLPFLSSTISPYYRQSLFRTVLDSGISEVRSDRDKFVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVKVLEDFVEIHGKHNERQDDHGYISREFHRRYRLPSNVDQSALSCSLSADGMLTFSGPKVQSGLDAGHSERAIPVSREEKPSSAPSS Open table in a new tab Hydroxylation of Pro is a frequently observed post-translational modification in various proteins (2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). Well investigated is hydroxylation of Pro in collagen, the most abundant protein in vertebrates (2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the oxidation is catalyzed by a position-specific prolyl-3- or prolyl-4-hydroxylase. The hydroxyl groups are introduced in trans position by these enzymes (2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). Whether hydroxyl groups can also be introduced in cis position by hydroxylases is unknown. To determine whether the detected Hyp(P) in α-crystallin A was in cis or trans conformation and which position at the proline ring was modified (Fig. 5), three sets of three peptides were synthesized for mass spectrometric comparison (Table 3). Three peptides were corresponding to the short α-crystallin A sequence of the Hyp(P)-containing peptide. Three other peptides had the same sequence but were elongated by an additional arginine at the N terminus corresponding to a miscleavage of native α-crystallin A sequence by trypsin. The last three peptides corresponded to a completely different sequence. In each set one peptide contained trans-4-Hyp(P), another one trans-3-Hyp(P), and the last one cis-4-Hyp(P). We characterized the fragmentation behavior of the three Hyp(P) isomers in the different synthetic peptides to find parameters that would allow the identification of Hyp(P) configuration in native proteins. Furthermore, it was of interest to study the fragmentation behavior of Hyp(P) compared to the well known fragmentation behavior of Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P).TABLE 3Synthetic peptides for mass spectrometric characterization of Hyp(P) isomers[M+H]+α-Crystallin A peptides 1103.48ALG(trans-4-Hyp(P))FYPSR 1103.48ALG(trans-3-Hyp(P))FYPSR 1103.48ALG(cis-4-Hyp(P))FYPSR[M+H]+α-Crystallin A peptides (elongated) 1259.59RALG(trans-4-Hyp(P))FYPSR 1259.59RALG(trans-3-Hyp(P))FYPSR 1259.59RALG(cis-4-Hyp(P))FYPSR[M+H]+Tau peptides 1871.06KKVAVVR(trans-4-Hyp(P))LPQVQSVR 1871.06KKVAVVR(trans-3-Hyp(P))LPQVQSVR 1871.06KKVAVVR(cis-4-Hyp(P))LPQVQSVR Open table in a new tab In general, aliphatic phosphoesters such as Ser(P) and Thr(P) eliminate HPO3 and H3PO4 during MS/MS fragmentation. In contrast, the aromatic phosphoester Tyr(P) shows only the loss of HPO3. These rules are commonly used to distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic phosphoamino acids. Despite the ring structure of Hyp(P), in our measurements of Hyp(P)-containing peptides a fragmentation behavior was observed similar to the aliphatic phosphoesters Ser(P) and Thr(P). All Hyp(P)-containing peptides showed both fragment ions: [M+H-HPO3]+ with a Δ of 80 Da and [M+H-H3PO4]+ with a Δ of 98 Da (Fig. 6). MS/MS fragmentation of the single amino acid Hyp(P) showed a fragmentation pattern similar to that of Hyp(P)-containing peptides: both fragment ions [M+H-HPO3]+ and [M+H-H3PO4]+ were observed. In negative mode, the MS/MS spectra of Hyp(P) showed signals of [PO3]− with 79 Da and [H3PO4]− with 97 Da. Thus, the fragmentation behavior of the single amino acid Hyp(P) was again more similar to the fragmentation behavior of the single amino acids Ser(P) and Thr(P) than to that of single Tyr(P). For this reason, a clear distinction between Hyp(P) and other phosphoamino acids based on the fragmentation behavior seems not to be possible. Synthetic peptides derived from the α-crystallin A sequence displayed an inconsistent fragmentation pattern. The peptides with trans-4-Hyp(P) and cis-4-Hyp(P) showed a loss of HPO3 as a major process. In contrast, the peptide with trans-3-Hyp(P) showed a loss of H3PO4 as a major process (Fig. 6, A–C). Elongation of the peptide sequence by an additional arginine at the N terminus completely changed the fragmentation pattern. All three peptides showed a loss of HPO3 as major process independent of their isomeric status of Hyp(P). Loss of H3PO4 was diminished in all three peptides (Fig. 6, D–F). In the Tau peptides a loss of H3PO4 was the major process in all three peptides regardless of the isomeric status of Hyp(P) (Fig. 6, G–I). This means that neither the position at the proline ring nor the stereoisomerism of the phosphate group showed a clear influence on the fragmentation behavior of peptides. In fact, the sequence of the examined peptides was the dominant factor in all cases. Thus, in case of Hyp(P) in native α-cystallin A we could not determine neither the position of the phosphate group on the proline ring nor the conformation. In summary, we identified for the first time Hyp(P) in a protein. So far, the identification of Hyp(P) in a protein by MS was hindered by the fact that Hyp, Leu, and isoleucine show the same mass differences in MS/MS analysis. Detection with a Hyp(P)-specific antibody enabled us to focus our search on α-crystallin A. Here, we could identify the sequence position of Hyp(P). Nevertheless, it was not possible to determine the isomeric status of Hyp(P) by comparative MS/MS measurement. For this purpose 31P NMR spectroscopy is still necessary. For the first time the presence and sequence position of hydroxylated and phosphorylated forms of the common amino acid Pro were identified in the native protein α-crystallin A in eye and heart tissue of the rat. In addition, in some other members of the crystallin family preliminary evidence for the presence of Hyp(P) was found. This was achieved initially by generation of a Hyp(P)-specific polyclonal antibody. Antibodies against Ser(P) and Thr(P) are generally not specific enough to detect a phosphorylated Ser or Thr side chain because this epitope is too small. No antibody is known that can recognize Ser(P) or Thr(P) in a sequence-independent manner. In contrast, antibodies against Tyr(P) are specific enough to detect one phosphorylated Tyr side chain independently from the amino acid sequence (18Quadroni M. James P. Exs. 2000; 88: 199-213PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Similar to Tyr(P), the amino acid side chain of Hyp(P) is sufficiently characteristic to gain amino acid residue-specific antibodies within the polyclonal mixture to detect Hyp(P) epitopes independently of the surrounding amino acid sequence. With the identification of Hyp and Hyp(P) in α-crystallin A, new questions emerge. The enzyme that oxidizes Pro16 to Hyp is still unknown. A comparison with vertebrate collagen sequences suggests a modification of Pro16 by prolyl-3-hydroxylase because Pro is located C-terminally of Gly. In consequence, the observed Hyp ought to be trans-3-Hyp. Although the isomer trans-4-Hyp was described at the C-terminal side of Gly in annelid collagen (20Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), it is questionable that Pro16 in α-crystallin A is hydroxylated by prolyl-3-hydroxylase or prolyl-4-hydroxylase because crystallins are intracellular proteins (21Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The activity of both mentioned hydroxylases is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum where they are required for collagen biosynthesis (2Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-398PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from collagen a number of other secreted proteins are hydroxylated on prolyl residues in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Adams E. Frank L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 1005-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). So far, only hypoxia-inducible factor is known as intracellular protein modified on two prolyl residues by hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases (23Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J.

Lee F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9630-9635Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Here, both hydroxylated prolyl residues are located on the C-terminal side of alanine. In Fasciola hepatica, a trematode, secreted cathepsin L-like proteinases contain trans-3-Hyp residues in different sequences: (i) Val-Hyp-Asp, (ii) Val-Hyp-Glu, and (iii) Tyr-Hyp-Tyr (26Wijffels G.L. Panaccio M. Salvatore L. Wilson L. Walker I.D. Spithill T.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another yet unknown hydroxylase could be involved in hydroxylation of Pro16 in α-crystallin A. The mechanism of phosphorylation of Hyp is also completely unknown. A specific kinase was not described so far. There are also no reports describing an unspecific phosphorylation of Hyp by a kinase that is specific for a different hydroxyamino acid. Alternatively, an enzyme-free phosphorylation of Hyp by inositol pyrophosphate is imaginable. Until now, only the phosphate transfer to Ser by inositol pyrophosphate was proven (27Saiardi A. Bhandari R. Resnick A.C. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 2004; 306: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, this way of phosphorylation could be possible for other hydroxyamino acids, too. Among the ubiquitous crystallins, there are three groups of proteins: α-crystallins, β-crystallins, and γ-crystallins. α-Crystallins (αA and αB) share 55% sequence similarity and immunoreactivity. The βA polypeptides are 63% homologous, and the basic, βB, are 56% homologous. The γ-crystallins are 70–80% homologous. The β- and γ-crystallins have a common evolutionary origin and share sequence and structural similarities and immunogenicity. Thus, on sequence and structural affinities alone, there are only two groups of proteins, the α-crystallins and the β/γ-crystallins that characterize the mammalian lens (21Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). α-Crystallins account for up to 50% of the total soluble protein of the ocular lens. There are two α-crystallins. α-Crystallin A is 173 amino acids long, and α-crystallin B is 175 amino acids long. αA is slightly more acidic than αB. These two proteins exist in a ratio of three (αA) to one (αB) in the lens (21Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In rodents, an additional protein, αAins-crystallin is encoded in the αA-crystallin gene through alternative splicing of the “insert” (ins) exon that codes for 23 amino acids. These 23 amino acids are introduced into the α-crystallin A polypeptide between amino acids 63 and 64. The αAins-crystallin is therefore 196 amino acids long (21Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity of α-crystallins to small heat shock proteins has led to the establishment of the α-crystallin family of small heat shock proteins (sHsps), which share the α-crystallin domain (28Boelens W.C. Van Boekel M.A. De Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1388: 513-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Krief S. Faivre J.F. Robert P. Le Douarin B. Brument-Larignon N. Lefrere I.

The α-crystallin domain is the primary sequence of the protein in the C-terminal half of the sHsps (31Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 32Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The α-crystallin aggregate in lens (containing both αA and αB at a 3:1 ratio) is highly heterogeneous (300–1000 kDa). Each α-crystallin polypeptide has a molecular mass of about 20 kDa; 15–50 subunits thus make the α-crystallin aggregates. Both α-crystallins undergo post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, aspartate racemization, deamidation, glycation, and truncation) (33Spector A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 130-146PubMed Google Scholar, 34Groenen P.J. Merck K.B. De Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 35Sax C.M.

Chem. 2003; 376: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A number of models have been proposed for the structure of the aggregate that contains αA- and αB-crystallins, but these proteins remain to be crystallized (37Abgar S. Backmann J. Aerts T. Vanhoudt J. Clauwaert J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5916-5925PubMed Google Scholar, 38Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). One sHsp member that has been crystallized, the bacterial 16.5-kDa protein, reveals a highly symmetrical aggregate, composed of one homogeneous population of structures (39Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 40Koteiche H.A. McHaourab H.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggests that heterogeneity in the α-crystallin aggregates results predominantly from the N-terminal domain sequences. The functional role of Hyp(P) in α-crystallin A and other proteins remains elusive. At least the function of α-crystallin A is known, and phosphorylation plays an important role in the process (38Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 41Augusteyn R.C. Murnane L. Nicola A. Stevens A. Clin. Exp.

Chem. 2004; 279: 28675-28680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). α-Crystallins A and B belong to the sHsps and are involved especially in eye lens tissue in the prevention of misfolding and aggregation of other proteins (43De Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A. Voorter C.E. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar, 44MacRae T.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 899-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 45Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nohara D. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thereby they act as chaperones and protect the cytoskeleton (46Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat.

Eye. 1999; 13: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Possibly, the observed hydroxylation and consecutive phosphorylation of Pro16 in α-crystallin A are involved in these processes, too. The occurrence of Hyp(P) in eye as well as in heart tissue suggests that the phosphorylation of Hyp is not tissue-specific. It would be desirable to know more Hyp(P)-containing proteins and more sequence positions of Hyp(P). This would facilitate the search for Hyp-specific kinases and the elucidation of Hyp(P) function. Only one hint of Hyp(P) in a native protein was reported before, in natSil-2, a silica-forming phosphoprotein in diatoms (48Poulsen N. Sumper M. Kroger N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, the discovery of Hyp(P) in mammalian tissue of eye and heart as well as in diatoms points to a widespread occurrence of Hyp(P). Protein phosphorylation is mostly reported for Ser, Thr, and Tyr. Consecutive phosphorylation of post-translationally generated Hyp and also Hyl is so far not in the spotlight. Maybe Hyp(P) and Hyl(P) are more frequent than generally expected."
