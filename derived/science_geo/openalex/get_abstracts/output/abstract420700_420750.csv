https://openalex.org/W1997514729,"Reduced-representation genome sequencing represents a new source of data for systematics, and its potential utility in interspecific phylogeny reconstruction has not yet been explored. One approach that seems especially promising is the use of inexpensive short-read technologies (e.g., Illumina, SOLiD) to sequence restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) – the regions of the genome that flank the recognition sites of restriction enzymes. In this study, we simulated the collection of RAD sequences from sequenced genomes of different taxa (Drosophila, mammals, and yeasts) and developed a proof-of-concept workflow to test whether informative data could be extracted and used to accurately reconstruct “known” phylogenies of species within each group. The workflow consists of three basic steps: first, sequences are clustered by similarity to estimate orthology; second, clusters are filtered by taxonomic coverage; and third, they are aligned and concatenated for “total evidence” phylogenetic analysis. We evaluated the performance of clustering and filtering parameters by comparing the resulting topologies with well-supported reference trees and we were able to identify conditions under which the reference tree was inferred with high support. For Drosophila, whole genome alignments allowed us to directly evaluate which parameters most consistently recovered orthologous sequences. For the parameter ranges explored, we recovered the best results at the low ends of sequence similarity and taxonomic representation of loci; these generated the largest supermatrices with the highest proportion of missing data. Applications of the method to mammals and yeasts were less successful, which we suggest may be due partly to their much deeper evolutionary divergence times compared to Drosophila (crown ages of approximately 100 and 300 versus 60 Mya, respectively). RAD sequences thus appear to hold promise for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships in younger clades in which sufficient numbers of orthologous restriction sites are retained across species."

We have developed and characterized string-shaped electrodes made from conductive polymer with silk fiber bundles (thread), which offer a new biocompatible stress free interface with living tissue in both wet and dry conditions.An electroconductive polyelectrolyte, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) was electrochemically combined with silk thread made from natural Bombyx mori. The polymer composite 280 µm thread exhibited a conductivity of 0.00117 S/cm (which corresponds to a DC resistance of 2.62 Mohm/cm). The addition of glycerol to the PEDOT-PSS silk thread improved the conductivity to 0.102 S/cm (20.6 kohm/cm). The wettability of PEDOT-PSS was controlled with glycerol, which improved its durability in water and washing cycles. The glycerol treated PEDOT-PSS silk thread showed a tensile strength of 1000 cN in both wet and dry states. Without using any electrolytes, pastes or solutions, the thread directly collects electrical signals from living tissue and transmits them through metal cables. ECG, EEG, and sensory evoked potential (SEP) signals were recorded from experimental animals by using this thread placed on the skin. PEDOT-PSS silk glycerol composite thread offers a new class of biocompatible electrodes in the field of biomedical and health promotion that does not induce stress in the subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1963828514,"The basement membrane between the epidermis and the dermis is indispensable for normal skin functions. It connects, and functionally separates, the epidermis and the dermis. To understand the suprastructural and functional basis of these connections, heterotypic supramolecular aggregates were isolated from the dermal-epidermal junction zone of human skin. Individual suprastructures were separated and purified by immunomagnetic beads, each recognizing a specific, molecular component of the aggregates. The molecular compositions of the suprastructures were determined by immunogold electron microscopy and immunoblotting. A composite of two networks was obtained from fibril-free suspensions by immunobeads recognizing either laminin 332 or collagen IV. After removal of perlecan-containing suprastructures or after enzyme digestion of heparan sulfate chains, a distinct network with a diffuse electron-optical appearance was isolated with magnetic beads coated with antibodies to collagen IV. The second network was more finely grained and comprised laminin 332 and laminins with α5-chains. The core protein of perlecan was an exclusive component of this network whereas its heparan sulfate chains were integrated into the collagen IV-containing network. Nidogens 1 and 2 occurred in both networks but did not form strong molecular cross-bridges. Their incorporation into one network appeared to be masked after their incorporation into the other one. We conclude that the epidermal basement membrane is a composite of two structurally independent networks that are tightly connected in a spot-welding-like manner by perlecan-containing aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1998622405,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by the kinase activity of the BCR-Abl fusion protein. The Abl inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are currently used to treat CML, but resistance to these inhibitors is a significant clinical problem. The kinase inhibitor bosutinib has shown efficacy in clinical trials for imatinib-resistant CML, but its binding mode is unknown. We present the 2.4 Å structure of bosutinib bound to the kinase domain of Abl, which explains the inhibitor's activity against several imatinib-resistant mutants, and reveals that similar inhibitors that lack a nitrile moiety could be effective against the common T315I mutant. We also report that two distinct chemical compounds are currently being sold under the name ""bosutinib"", and report spectroscopic and structural characterizations of both. We show that the fluorescence properties of these compounds allow inhibitor binding to be measured quantitatively, and that the infrared absorption of the nitrile group reveals a different electrostatic environment in the conserved ATP-binding sites of Abl and Src kinases. Exploiting such differences could lead to inhibitors with improved selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2005918147,"Human synovial joints display a characteristic anatomic distribution of arthritis, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the metacarpophalangeal and proximal finger joints, but rarely the distal finger joints, whereas osteoarthritis occurs in the distal and proximal finger joints. Pelvospondylitis has a selective localization to the spine and sacroiliac joints. Is this tropism due to differences between the cartilages at the molecular level? To substantiate this concept the present study provides a background detailed compositional analysis by relative quantification of extracellular matrix proteins in articular cartilages, meniscus, intervertebral disc, rib, and tracheal cartilages on samples from 5-6 different individuals using an optimized approach for proteomics. Tissue extraction followed by trypsin digestion and two-dimensional LC separations coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, relative quantification with isobaric labeling, iTRAQ(TM), was used to compare the relative abundance of about 150 proteins. There were clear differences in protein patterns between different kinds of cartilages. Matrilin-1 and epiphycan were specific for rib and trachea, whereas asporin was particularly abundant in the meniscus. Interestingly, lubricin was prominent in the intervertebral disc, especially in the nucleus pulposus. Fibromodulin and lumican showed distributions that were mirror images of one other. Analyses of the insoluble residues from guanidine extraction revealed that a fraction of several proteins remained unextracted, e.g. asporin, CILP, and COMP, indicating cross-linking. Distinct differences in protein patterns may relate to different tissue mechanical properties, and to the intriguing tropism in different patterns of joint pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1975730572,"Sakuranetin, the major flavonoid phytoalexin in rice, is induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, CuCl2 treatment, jasmonic acid treatment, and infection by phytopathogens. It was recently demonstrated that sakuranetin has anti-inflammatory activity, anti-mutagenic activity, anti-pathogenic activities against Helicobacter pylori, Leishmania, and Trypanosoma and contributes to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis in animals. Thus, sakuranetin is a useful compound as a plant antibiotic and a potential pharmaceutical agent. Sakuranetin is biosynthesized from naringenin by naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT). In previous research, rice NOMT (OsNOMT) was purified to apparent homogeneity from UV-treated wild-type rice leaves, but the purified protein, named OsCOMT1, exhibited caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity and not NOMT activity. In this study, we found that OsCOMT1 does not contribute to sakuranetin production in rice in vivo, and we purified OsNOMT using the oscomt1 mutant. A crude protein preparation from UV-treated oscomt1 leaves was subjected to three sequential purification steps, resulting in a 400-fold purification from the crude enzyme preparation. Using SDS-PAGE, the purest enzyme preparation showed a minor band at an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. Two O-methyltransferase-like proteins, encoded by Os04g0175900 and Os12g0240900, were identified from the 40-kDa band by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. Recombinant Os12g0240900 protein showed NOMT activity, but the recombinant Os04g0175900 protein did not. Os12g0240900 expression was induced by jasmonic acid treatment in rice leaves prior to sakuranetin accumulation, and the Os12g0240900 protein showed reasonable kinetic properties to OsNOMT. On the basis of these results, we conclude that Os12g0240900 encodes an OsNOMT.

When plants are attacked by pathogenic microorganisms, they respond with a variety of defense reactions, including the production of secondary metabolites called phytoalexins (1VanEtten H.D.

Among them, sakuranetin is considered to be one of the most biologically important phytoalexins in terms of its high antimicrobial activity and high accumulation in rice leaves infected by Magnaporthe oryzae, one of the major photopathogenic fungi (11Kodama O. Miyakawa J. Akatsuka T. Kiyosawa S. Sakuranetin. A flavanone phytoalexin from ultraviolet-irradiated rice leaves.Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 3807-3809Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently reported that sakuranetin has anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, which is involved in arachidonic acid metabolism in animal cells (12Zhang X.

Food Sci. 2003; 68: 52-56Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), anti-Helicobacter pylori activity by inhibiting β-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (14Zhang L. Kong Y. Wu D. Zhang H. Wu J.

Reimão J.Q. Tempone A.G. Sartorelli P. Cunha R.L. Romoff P. Ferreira M.J. Fávero O.A. Lago J.H. In vitro antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activities of flavanones from Baccharis retusa DC.

Thus, sakuranetin is a useful compound as a plant antibiotic and a potential pharmaceutical agent. Sakuranetin is biosynthesized from naringenin by S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) 3The abbreviations used are: AdoMetS-adenosyl-l-methionineNOMTnaringenin 7-O-methyltransferaseCOMTcaffeic acid O-methyltransferaseOMTO-methyltransferaseJAjasmonic acidRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsqRTquantitative RTRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. -dependent naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT) (Fig. 1) (17Rakwal R.

Commun. 1996; 222: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Naringenin is the first flavonoid transformed from naringenin chalcone by chalcone isomerase and is also a key biosynthetic intermediate to an isoflavone and a variety of flavones. Therefore, NOMT plays a key role in sakuranetin biosynthesis at a branching point from a common flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. S-adenosyl-l-methionine naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase caffeic acid O-methyltransferase O-methyltransferase jasmonic acid rapid amplification of cDNA ends quantitative RT ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Sakuranetin was first identified from the cortex of the bark of a cherry tree (Prunus spp.) as an aglycone of sakuranin (18Asahina Y.

Pharm. 1908; 246: 259-272Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and then found in rice and several other plant species, including Artemisia campestris, Prunus spp., Baccharis spp., Betula spp., and Juglans spp. (19Harborne J.B. Baxter H. Moss G.P. 2nd Ed. Phytochemical Dictionary: A Handbook of Bioactive Compounds from Plants. Taylor & Francis, London1999: 976Google Scholar). However, NOMT has not been identified from such plant species. Although an O-methyltransferase (OMT) from barley (F1-OMT) that mainly methylates apigenin to form genkwanin has weak NOMT activity, sakuranetin has not been identified in barley (20Christensen A.B. Gregersen P.L. Olsen C.E. Collinge D.B. A flavonoid 7-O-methyltransferase is expressed in barley leaves in response to pathogen attack.Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It was also reported that another OMT isolated from Streptomyces avermitilis (SaOMT-2) is able to catalyze the NOMT reaction, but SaOMT-2 has broad substrate specificity against isoflavones, flavones, and a flavanone, and its biological function remains unknown (21Kim B.G. Jung B.R. Lee Y. Hur H.G. Lim Y. Ahn J.H. Regiospecific flavonoid 7-O-methylation with Streptomyces avermitilis O-methyltransferase expressed in Escherichia coli.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2006; 54: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although sakuranetin is not found in healthy rice leaves, its biosynthesis is rapidly induced by both biotic and abiotic stresses, such as infection with phytopathogens such as M. oryzae, Xanthomonas oryzae, and Ditylenchus angustus, infestation with Sogatella furcifera, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and treatment with CuCl2 or jasmonic acid (JA) (11Kodama O.

Zool. 2011; 47: 27-34Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previously, it was reported that NOMT was purified to apparent homogeneity (∼985-fold) from crude extracts of UV-treated wild-type rice leaves (22Rakwal R. Agrawal G.K. Yonekura M. Kodama O. Naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the flavanone phytoalexin sakuranetin from rice (Oryza sativa L.).Plant Sci. 2000; 155: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid sequence of the purified protein was highly homologous to that of a caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) from maize. In fact, the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli showed COMT but not NOMT activity (26Lin F. Yamano G. Hasegawa M. Anzai H. Kawasaki S. Kodama O. Cloning and functional analysis of caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase from rice (Oryza sativa).J. Pestic. Sci. 2006; 31: 47-53Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and this enzyme was named OsCOMT1. These results suggest at least two possibilities as follows: one is that OsCOMT1 is a major component and the rice NOMT (OsNOMT) is a minor one in the purified fraction. If this is the case, isolation of OsNOMT might be quite difficult because of the masking effect by OsCOMT1. Another is that OsCOMT1 is involved in NOMT enzymatic activity in rice in vivo but that a post-translational modification and/or the presence of an interacting factor is needed to show NOMT activity. In the former case, if UV-irradiated leaves of the OsCOMT1 tDNA insertion mutant oscomt1 are used as plant material, OsNOMT is expected to be purified quite efficiently without masking by OsCOMT1. In the latter case, NOMT activity will not be induced in oscomt1 mutant leaves even after elicitation. In this study, we first confirmed that NOMT activity is induced by elicitor treatment in the oscomt1 mutant leaves. We then purified and identified OsNOMT from UV-irradiated leaves of the oscomt1 mutant. Kinetic analysis of recombinant OsNOMT and expression analysis of the OsNOMT gene in rice plants were also performed. This is the first report on the cloning and characterization of OsNOMT as a sakuranetin synthase in rice. Racemic naringenin, luteolin, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid were purchased from Kanto Chemical, Co., Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Racemic daidzein, biochanin A, and sinapic acid were purchased from Sigma. Apigenin, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Racemic liquiritigenin was purchased from Funakoshi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All chemicals used in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization two-stage time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) analyses were of analytical grade. In addition, 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, sodium bicarbonate, and ammonium bicarbonate were purchased from Sigma. The oscomt1 mutant (PFG-2B-50240, Oryza sativa L. cv. Dongjin) was searched for in the Rice Functional Genomic Express Database as a tDNA insertion mutant of Os08g0157500 (TIGR ID, LOC_Os08g06100) and purchased from Postech Biotech Center. Because the seeds of the oscomt1 mutant we obtained were from the F1 generation, the F1 generation plants were analyzed by genomic PCR using specific primers for OsCOMT1 and tDNA to separate oscomt1 homozygotes, heterozygotes, and wild-type rice plants, and the F2 generation seeds were obtained from the respective plants. We used these F2 generation seeds of homozygotes and wild type as “oscomt1” and “wild type” in the experiments on the characterization of the oscomt1 mutant and purification of OsNOMT. Primers used for genomic PCR are described in Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1. Wild-type rice (O. sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) plants were used for 5′- and 3′-RACE of OsNOMT mRNA and for analysis of the effects of JA treatment or inoculation of M. oryzae spores on the expression of OsNOMT and quantification of accumulated sakuranetin. To grow rice plants, seeds were sterilized with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution (Kanto Chemical) for 30 min and then washed with sterilized water. Surface-sterilized seeds were incubated on 0.7% agar gel containing 0.1% of the liquid fertilizer Hanakoujou (Sumika-Takeda Garden Products, Tokyo, Japan) for 10 days at 28 °C in the light. Germinated seeds were then transplanted into a mixture of vermiculite and artificial compost, Bonsol (Sumitomo Chemical, Tokyo, Japan), to grow in a greenhouse (12 h of light at 28 °C/12 h of dark at 25 °C). Three-month-old plants were used for subsequent experiments. For UV irradiation, excised rice leaves were floated on distilled water and incubated for 20 min at 20 cm under a UV lamp in a biological safety cabinet. Then the irradiated leaves were incubated at 28 °C under continuous white light conditions. For JA or CuCl2 treatment, a leaf disk (6 mm in diameter) from the uppermost leaf blades of rice plants was floated on 100 μl of an assay solution (500 μm of JA or CuCl2) in each well of 96-well plastic plates. RT-PCR and qRT-PCR were used to determine the level of gene expression. Total RNA extracted from plant tissue using Sepasol-RNA I Super (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was used to synthesize cDNA by RT reaction using a Quantitect RT kit (Qiagen K.K., Tokyo, Japan). With the cDNA, RT-PCR and qRT-PCR were performed to determine the level of gene expression. For qRT-PCR, SYBR Green technology on an ABI PRISM 7300 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) was used. Raw data from qRT-PCR were analyzed using the standard curve method, and the results were expressed as relative mRNA values normalized to the expression level of ubiquitin (OsUBQ). Primers used for expression analysis are described in supplemental Table S1. Plant tissue (40–200 mg fresh weight per sample) was homogenized by Multi Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan) and suspended in 2 ml of phytoalexin extraction solvent (ethanol/water/acetonitrile/acetic acid, 79:13.9:7:0.1, v/v). The sample was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected to a vial and subjected to determination of phytoalexins by liquid chromatography two-stage mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which was composed of API-3000 with an electrospray ion source (AB SCIEX) and an Agilent 1100 HPLC instrument (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a PEGASIL ODS SP100 column (150 mm long, 2.1 mm in diameter; Senshu Scientific, Tokyo, Japan). The analytical conditions were the same as the method described by Shimizu et al. (27Shimizu T. Jikumaru Y. Okada A. Okada K. Koga J. Umemura K. Minami E. Shibuya N. Hasegawa M. Kodama O. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Effects of a bile acid elicitor, cholic acid, on the biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins in suspension-cultured rice cells.Phytochemistry. 2008; 69: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Naringenin and sakuranetin levels were determined with combinations of the precursor and product ions of m/z 273/153 for naringenin and m/z 287/167 for sakuranetin in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The retention times of naringenin and sakuranetin were 2.5 and 3.3 min, respectively. All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Rice leaves were homogenized by using Polytron (Kinematica AG, Lucerne, Switzerland) with a 3-fold (v/w) volume of buffer A (0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), containing 10% (v/v) glycerol). The homogenate was filtered through four layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem), and the filtrate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, with the resulting supernatant used as a crude protein extract. The standard assay mixture consisted of enzyme preparation (∼500 ng of protein), 300 μm racemic naringenin or caffeic acid, 300 μm AdoMet, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (containing 5 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA) in a final volume of 50 μl. After an 18-h incubation at 28 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 5 μl of 1 m HCl. The resulting products were extracted three times with 60 μl of ethyl acetate, evaporated to dryness, and finally dissolved in 100 μl of the phytoalexin extraction solvent. The content of sakuranetin or ferulic acid was quantified using an API-3000 LC-MS/MS system. Ferulic acid levels were determined with combinations of m/z 195/177 in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. A crude protein extract (620 ml) from 200 g, fresh weight, of oscomt1 mutant rice plants 48 h after UV irradiation was applied to the sequential three-step purification described below. Well ground ammonium sulfate powder (108.7 g; Kanto Chemical) was added to the crude protein extract, and the mixture was gently agitated for 2 h. The mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected to a clean beaker; 77.5 g of ammonium sulfate powder was added, and the mixture was gently agitated for 2 h. After that, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and 40 ml of buffer A was added to the pellet. Next, 48 ml of the obtained protein solution was ultrafiltered (10-kDa cutoff) and finally resolved in 12 ml of buffer A, and the resultant solution was subjected to the subsequent purification. The protein solution (10 ml) was loaded to an AKTA fast protein LC (FPLC) system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a pre-equilibrated Hi PrepTM 16/10 DEAE FF column (GE Healthcare). Buffer A was used as a pre-equilibration buffer. The applied proteins were washed with 50 ml of buffer A at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. After that, a 50-min linear gradient (0–60% buffer B (buffer A containing 1 m KCl)) was applied as an elution step with a flow rate of 2 ml/min and then the column was washed with 100 ml of 100% buffer B. The eluate was collected in steps of 5 ml each, checked for NOMT enzymatic activity, and the active fractions were pooled. The pooled samples were mixed together, ultrafiltered (10-kDa cutoff), and finally resolved in 6 ml of buffer A, with the product used for subsequent purification. Affinity chromatography on adenosine-agarose was performed as described previously (22Rakwal R. Agrawal G.K. Yonekura M. Kodama O. Naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the flavanone phytoalexin sakuranetin from rice (Oryza sativa L.).Plant Sci. 2000; 155: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). First, 5′-AMP-agarose (5 ml; Sigma) was washed with distilled water and incubated with 800 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) in calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase buffer (pH 9.0) in a total volume of 10 ml. The gel was then dephosphorylated for 24 h at 37 °C by gentle agitation, transferred to an open column (15 mm inner diameter), and washed with 50 ml of distilled water and then with 50 ml of buffer B. Finally, the column was equilibrated with 100 ml of buffer A. The DEAE-purified protein solution (1 ml, ∼18.7 mg of protein) was directly applied onto the adenosine-agarose gel column. The column was washed first with 50 ml of buffer A and then with 50 ml of buffer B with gravity flow. Elution was done with 25 ml of 4 mm AdoMet in buffer B. Fractions (5 ml each) were collected, and the NOMT enzymatic activity of each fraction was checked. Active fractions were combined, ultrafiltered (10-kDa cutoff), and finally dissolved in 1.2 ml of buffer A. The resultant solution was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Protein bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were enzymatically digested in-gel as described previously (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins silver-stained polyacrylamide gels.Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar) using modified porcine trypsin (Promega). The resultant gel pieces were washed with 50% acetonitrile and vacuum dried, then rehydrated with trypsin solution (8–10 ng/μl 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.7)), and incubated for 8–10 h at 37 °C. For identification of components of the 40-kDa band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A) by peptide mass fingerprinting with MALDI-TOF/TOF, in-gel digested protein samples were analyzed using the Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics analyzer with TOF/TOFTM ion optics. Both MS and MS/MS data were acquired with a Nd:YAG laser with a 200 Hz repetition rate, and up to 4,000 shots were accumulated for each spectrum. The MS/MS mode was operated with 1 keV collision energy; air was used as the collision gas such that nominally single collision conditions were achieved. Both MS and MS/MS data were acquired using the instrument default calibration, without applying internal or external calibration. Sequence tag searches were performed with the program MASCOT. For identification of components of the 45- and 52-kDa bands in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A) by peptide mass fingerprinting with MALDI-TOF, trypsin-digested proteins were mixed with a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA and subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis (Ettan MALDI-ToF Pro, Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (29Fernandez J. Gharahdaghi F. Mische S.M. Routine identification of proteins from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels or polyvinyl difluoride membranes using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS).Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Spectra were collected from 350 shots per spectrum over an m/z range of 600–3000 and calibrated by a two-point internal calibration using trypsin auto-digestion peaks (m/z 842.5099 and 2211.1046). A peak list was generated using the Ettan MALDI-TOF Pro Evaluation Module (version 2.0.16). The threshold used for peak picking was as follows: 5,000 for minimum resolution of monoisotopic mass, 2.5 for signal-to-noise ratio. The search program MASCOT, developed by Matrix Science, was used for protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting. The following parameters were used for the database search: trypsin as the cleaving enzyme, a maximum of one missed cleavage, iodoacetamide (Cys) as a complete modification, oxidation (Met) as a partial modification, monoisotopic masses, and a mass tolerance of ± 0.1 Da. Peptide mass fingerprint acceptance criteria is probability scoring. Because expressed mRNA of Os12g0240900 had not been previously identified, we used estimated ORF information in the rice genomic sequence of the locus for RACE analysis. Extraction of total RNA from UV-irradiated wild-type rice leaves (cv. Nipponbare) was conducted using Sepasol-RNA I Super (Nakalai Tesque). and the mRNA was then purified using the Absolutely mRNATM purification kit (Agilent) from the total RNA. cDNA synthesis from the mRNA and the subsequent 5′- and 3′-RACE analyses were performed using the SMARTerTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). Primers used in 5′- and 3′-RACE analyses are described in supplemental Table S1. The 1,548-bp sequence of the obtained cDNA of Os12g0240900 was deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) under accession number AB692949. Full-length ORFs of Os04g0175900 and Os12g0240900 were amplified by RT-PCR using KOD-FX Neo (TOYOBO, Tokyo, Japan) with cDNA prepared from CuCl2-treated wild-type rice leaves (cv. Nipponbare) as templates. To construct a directional TOPO cloning transfer vector, the 5′-CACC-3′ sequence was incorporated into the PCR upstream primer at its 5′ ends. Then the PCR products were inserted into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the ligated products were transformed into TOP10 chemically competent E. coli. The ORFs of Os04g0175900 and Os12g0240900 inserted into pENTR/D-TOPO vector were fused into pDEST15 (Invitrogen) using LR Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen). Finally, we obtained expression vectors of N-terminal GST tag-fused OMTs, pDEST15-1759 and pDEST15-2409, respectively. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta II (DE3) (Novagen). These strains were pre-cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in LB medium containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and then cultured for 48 h at 20 °C in Overnight ExpressTM instant TB Medium (Novagen) containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). The cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in buffer A, and disrupted by mild sonication on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected and loaded to the AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) equipped with a pre-equilibrated GSTrap HP column (bed volume 5 ml) (GE Healthcare). Buffer A was used as the pre-equilibration buffer. Applied protein was washed with 25 ml of buffer A with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Next, 25 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm reduc"

Knowing the prevalence levels of these infections is vital to guide governments towards the implementation of successful and cost-effective disease control initiatives. Methodology/Principal Findings A cross-sectional study of 1,237 preschool children (0–5 year olds), 1,142 school-aged children (6–15 year olds) and 960 women (>15 year olds) was conducted to understand the distribution of malnutrition, anemia, malaria, schistosomiasis (intestinal and urinary) and geohelminths in a north-western province of Angola. We used a recent demographic surveillance system (DSS) database to select and recruit suitable households. Malnutrition was common among children (23.3% under-weight, 9.9% wasting and 32.2% stunting), and anemia was found to be a severe public health problem (i.e., >40%). Malaria prevalence was highest among preschool children reaching 20.2%. Micro-hematuria prevalence levels reached 10.0% of preschool children, 16.6% of school-aged children and 21.7% of mothers. Geohelminth infections were common, affecting 22.3% of preschool children, 31.6% of school-aged children and 28.0% of mothers. Conclusions Here we report prevalence levels of malaria, schistosomiasis and geohelminths; all endemic in this poorly described area where a DSS has been recently established. Furthermore we found evidence that the studied infections are associated with the observed levels of anemia and malnutrition, which can justify the implementation of integrated interventions for the control of these diseases and morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2130409747,"Altered expression of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS) at the surfaces of tumor cells plays a key role in malignant transformation and tumor metastasis. Previously we demonstrated that a Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-derived tumor cell line with high metastatic potential had a higher proportion of E-disaccharide units, GlcUA-GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate), in CS chains than low metastatic LLC cells and that such CS chains are involved in the metastatic process. The metastasis was markedly inhibited by the pre-administration of CS-E from squid cartilage rich in E units or by preincubation with a phage display antibody specific for CS-E. However, the molecular mechanism of the inhibition remains to be investigated. In this study the receptor molecule for CS chains containing E-disaccharides expressed on LLC cells was revealed to be receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily predominantly expressed in the lung. Interestingly, RAGE bound strongly to not only E-disaccharide, but also HS-expressing LLC cells. Furthermore, the colonization of the lungs by LLC cells was effectively inhibited by the blocking of CS or HS chains at the tumor cell surface with an anti-RAGE antibody through intravenous injections in a dose-dependent manner. These results provide the clear evidence that RAGE is at least one of the critical receptors for CS and HS chains expressed at the tumor cell surface and involved in experimental lung metastasis and that CS/HS and RAGE are potential molecular targets in the treatment of pulmonary metastasis.

The production of syndecans, a class of cell-surface-bound HS-PGs, is up-regulated in a range of malignancies, including pancreatic, gastric, and breast hepatocellular carcinomas and malignant mesotheliomas (8Beauvais D.M. Rapraeger A.C. Syndecans in tumor cell adhesion and signaling.Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2004; 2: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Syndecans bind to fibronectin and laminin and enhance the function of β1 integrins during cell spreading on a matrix (9Beauvais D.M. Burbach B.J. Rapraeger A.C.

The expression of versican is up-regulated in many tumors including lung cancer, as a macrophage activator that acts through Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) and its co-receptors TLR6 and CD14 (13Kim S.

Furthermore, recent studies revealed that the expression of E unit-containing structures recognized by an anti-CS-E phage display antibody was increased in ovarian and pancreatic cancers, resulting in alterations in tumor growth and tumor cell motility through regulation of the signaling of the vascular endothelial growth factor and the cleavage of CD44, respectively (14ten Dam G.B. van de Westerlo E.M.

In view of these observations, it was hypothesized that some specific receptor(s) that interacts with CS chains with E units expressed at the surface of tumor cells exists in the vascular endothelial cells of mouse lung. In this study we isolated the receptor for the metastasis of LLC and B16 melanoma cells mediated by CS chains with E-disaccharides from mouse lungs by affinity chromatography using a CS-E-immobilized column and identified it as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (18Sims G.P.

RAGE strongly bound not only to CS-E but also to HS in vitro and to cell surface CS chains containing E units and HS with presumably unique structural motifs expressed by LLC cells, suggesting that GAGs at the cell surface play crucial roles in the lung metastasis of LLC cells and that at least one of the potential receptors for such metastasis-mediating GAG chains is RAGE. The following sugars and enzymes were purchased from Seikagaku Corp.

The extracts from a mouse lung of postnatal week 7 were prepared using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Briefly, a mouse lung was homogenized with the buffer and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for the following experiments. The affinity chromatography based on the electrostatic and/or conformational interactions was carried out as described previously (24Bao X. Mikami T. Yamada S. Faissner A. Muramatsu T. Sugahara K.

Briefly, the GAG-immobilized columns were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40 (buffer A), and 0.15 m NaCl. An extract was loaded to the column, and the bound proteins were eluted stepwise with 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 m NaCl-containing buffer A. Fractions obtained by affinity chromatography were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver solution. Bands of interest were manually excised and digested in-gel with trypsin according to published procedures (25Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Góñez J. Heldin C.H.

Delayed extraction MALDI-TOF-MS was carried out using a Voyger DE-STR-H (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the reflection mode according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spectra were calibrated externally using a standard mixture. The resulting spectra were used to search for matching sequences in the NCBI data base with the MASCOT program (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). The interaction of RAGE with various types of GAGs was examined using a BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as reported (27Bao X. Nishimura S. Mikami T. Yamada S. Itoh N. Sugahara K.

Briefly, the binding reactions were carried out at 25 °C using streptavidin-derivatized sensor chips. Biotinylated GAGs (∼0.6 ng each) were immobilized on the surface of the streptavidin-derivatized sensor chip.

Kinetic parameters were evaluated with BIAevaluation software 4.1 (BIAcore AB) using a 1:1 binding model with mass transfer, and association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd) as well as dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) were determined. To assess the potential binding site on RAGE for GAGs, ELISA was performed using GAGs, RAGE-derived peptides, and biotinylated GAGs. Biotinylated GAGs (0.5 μg each) were immobilized on 96-well streptavidin-coated microtiter plates (Nunc) at room temperature. The wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and/or 3% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20 (PBS-T), RAGE-derived peptides, CKGAPKKPPQQLEWKLNTGRTEA (Cys-38–Ala-60) and GTFRCRATNRRGKEVKSNYRVRVY (Gly-94–Tyr-117) (0.25 μg each), chemically synthesized by Hokudo Co., Ltd (Sapporo, Japan), were added, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was carried out in PBS. Peptides bound through electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions were detected using antisera raised in rabbits against the peptides obtained from Hokudo Co. followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG/IgM. Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate, and the absorbance was measured at 415 nm. The reactivity of the commercial CS-E with the RAGE protein was evaluated by inhibition ELISA, where the RAGE-Fc chimera was preincubated with test CS-E oligo- and polysaccharides or Cys-38–Ala-60 and Gly-94–Tyr-117 peptides for 30 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was added to CS-E-immobilized microtiter plates. After the incubation, each well was washed with PBS-T and incubated with protein G-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) to detect the RAGE-Fc chimera. Cultured cells including LLC cells, LLC cells treated individually with chondroitinase ABC, or a mixture of heparinase-I and -III, L-cells, Gro2c cells, and Sog9 cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA and suspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. After 3 washes with TBS, the cells were incubated in TBS containing 0.1% BSA with the recombinant RAGE-Fc chimera or BSA as the control (1 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 20 min. The cells were washed with TBS three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488®-labeled Protein G (1 μg/ml). After three more washes with TBS, the cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence flow cytometry in a BD FACSCanto (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometric data were analyzed using Flowjo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). To investigate the involvement of RAGE in experimental tumor metastasis, the LLC cells and B16 melanoma cells were pretreated with either DMEM (control) or DMEM containing the anti-RAGE antibody (monoclonal rat IgG2, 1–80 μg/mouse) or GAGs (100 μg/mouse) 30 min before their injection into mice. IgG2 derived from rats was also used as a control. Each cell suspension (1∼4 × 105 cells/mouse) in a total volume of 200 μl was injected into a lateral tail vein of C57BL/6 mice as described (16Li F. ten Dam G.B. Murugan S. Yamada S. Hashiguchi T. Mizumoto S. Oguri K. Okayama M. van Kuppevelt T.H. Sugahara K. Involvement of highly sulfated chondroitin sulfate in the metastasis of the Lewis lung carcinoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34294-34304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Three weeks after the injection, the animals were sacrificed, and the number of visible tumor cell parietal nodules in the lung was counted by two observers in a blinded fashion. To isolate the CS-E-binding protein involved in the tumor metastasis, a CS-E-immobilized gel was prepared and mixed with a tissue extract prepared from adult mouse lungs. The mixture was rotated overnight and poured into an open column. After the column was washed with a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, the bound proteins were eluted stepwise with buffers containing 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 m NaCl, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and detected with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or by silver-staining (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Three significant protein bands (46, 52, 80 kDa) and one faint band at 30 kDa were detected in the fraction eluted from the CS-E column with 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 1A). In contrast, there were no detectable bands in the 0.5 m NaCl-eluted fractions obtained from a CS-A-immobilized column or a no GAG-immobilized control (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting specific interactions between these proteins and CS-E. These three bands were also found in the 0.5 m NaCl-eluted fraction from a heparin-coupled column (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that these proteins are heparin-binding proteins. Protein band c in Fig. 1A was excised from the gel and trypsinized, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting spectrum (Fig. 1B) was used to search for a matching protein(s) in the NCBI data base, with the Mascot program. The search yielded a top score of 87 for RAGE. The peptide sequences identified by MALDI-TOF-MS comprised amino acids 2–29, 30–43, 178–188, 215–226, and 216–226 (Fig. 1C), well consistent with the mass spectrometric data for trypsinate obtained from the authentic recombinant RAGE (supplemental Fig. S2, C and D). Interestingly, band b in Fig. 1A was also identified as RAGE (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Because mouse RAGE contains two potential N-glycosylation sites (28Srikrishna G. Huttunen H.J. Johansson L. Weigle B. Yamaguchi Y. Rauvala H. Freeze H.H. N-Glycans on the receptor for advanced glycation end products influence amphoterin binding and neurite outgrowth.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50019-50024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), bands b and c are most likely RAGE with and without N-linked glycosylation, respectively. The data obtained by mass spectrometry and the Mascot search were confirmed by Western blotting using specific antibodies against RAGE (Fig. 1D). Taken together, RAGE is a potential receptor in the lung for CS chains containing E-disaccharides and/or HS expressed at the surface of LLC cells as it also bound a heparin column. Consistent with our data, RAGE has been reported to be predominantly expressed in the mouse lung (30Buckley S.T. Ehrhardt C. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and the lung.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2010; 2010: 917108Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The results of the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction also demonstrated the specific expression of RAGE in mouse lung (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, we focused on the identification of RAGE in the present study. A protein band a (Fig. 1A) was also subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS and the data base search, which revealed the membrane-organizing extension spike protein, moesin (supplemental Fig. S4), a member of the ERM protein family including ezrin and radixin (31Frame M.C. Patel H. Serrels B. Lietha D. Eck M.J. The FERM domain. Organizing the structure and function of FAK.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 802-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Although the RAGE was specifically distributed in the lung of mouse, the moesin is ubiquitously expressed (32Lankes W.T. Furthmayr H. Moesin. A member of the protein 4.1-talin-ezrin family of proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 8297-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this study we focused on RAGE. Because, however, the possibility of the involvement of moesin cannot be excluded, an investigation of its correlation is now in progress. To verify the GAG-specific receptor function of RAGE, a quantitative kinetic analysis of the interaction of RAGE with immobilized GAG isoforms was carried out using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor, BIAcore. Biotinylated CS, HS, and heparin were individually immobilized on the streptavidin-coated sensor chip, and a recombinant soluble RAGE at varying concentrations was injected over the sensor surface to evaluate direct binding. Overlaid sensorgrams disclosed the strong binding of RAGE not only to HS/heparin but also to CS-E (Fig. 2), E-disaccharide units of which account for ∼67% of all the disaccharide units in the polysaccharides (33Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Microanalysis of glycosaminoglycan-derived oligosaccharides labeled with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide by high performance liquid chromatography.

In addition, CS-B (also known as dermatan sulfate) and CS-D, which contain predominantly iduronic acid-GalNAc(4S) (iA units) and C units/D units, respectively (33Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Microanalysis of glycosaminoglycan-derived oligosaccharides labeled with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide by high performance liquid chromatography.

Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate in the central nervous system.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), showed moderate binding yet weaker binding than CS-E. In contrast, CS-A and CS-C polysaccharides, which mainly consist of mono-sulfated A- and C-disaccharide units (33Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Microanalysis of glycosaminoglycan-derived oligosaccharides labeled with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide by high performance liquid chromatography. Application to disaccharide composition analysis and exosequencing of oligosaccharides.Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), respectively, showed no significant binding to RAGE (Fig. 2). These results suggest RAGE to share HS-like and CS-E-like structures as ligands and recognize the sulfation pattern of CS and that the interaction may also involve iduronic acid and/or D-disaccharide-containing structures arranged in an additive or alternative manner. Overlaid sensorgrams were further analyzed collectively by using “the 1:1 Langmuir binding model with mass transfer” of the BIAevaluation 4.1 software to calculate the kinetic parameters, which are summarized in Table 1. The evaluation of kinetic parameters revealed that CS-E interacted with RAGE with strong affinity (the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = 0.2 nm) (Table 1). The high affinity of CS-E with RAGE may b"
https://openalex.org/W2048103661,"The cyanobacterial circadian oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro; mixing three clock proteins (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC) with ATP results in an oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation with a periodicity of ∼24 h. The hexameric ATPase KaiC hydrolyzes ATP bound at subunit interfaces. KaiC also exhibits autokinase and autophosphatase activities, the latter of which is particularly noteworthy because KaiC is phylogenetically distinct from typical protein phosphatases. To examine this activity, we performed autodephosphorylation assays using 32P-labeled KaiC. The residual radioactive ATP bound to subunit interfaces was removed using a newly established method, which included the dissociation of KaiC hexamers into monomers and the reconstitution of KaiC hexamers with nonradioactive ATP. This approach ensured that only the signals derived from 32P-labeled KaiC were examined. We detected the transient formation of [32P]ATP preceding the accumulation of 32Pi. Together with kinetic analyses, our data demonstrate that KaiC undergoes dephosphorylation via a mechanism that differs from those of conventional protein phosphatases. A phosphate group at a phosphorylation site is first transferred to KaiC-bound ADP to form ATP as an intermediate, which can be regarded as a reversal of the autophosphorylation reaction. Subsequently, the ATP molecule is hydrolyzed to form Pi. We propose that the ATPase active site mediates not only ATP hydrolysis but also the bidirectional transfer of the phosphate between phosphorylation sites and the KaiC-bound nucleotide. On the basis of these findings, we can now dissect the dynamics of the KaiC phosphorylation cycle relative to ATPase activity.

On the basis of these findings, we can now dissect the dynamics of the KaiC phosphorylation cycle relative to ATPase activity. The circadian clock is an endogenous timing mechanism in living organisms that coordinates various biological activities with daily environmental changes. The circadian clock of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 is the sole example that can be reconstituted in vitro; the phosphorylation state of KaiC shows robust circadian rhythms by mixing KaiA, KaiB, KaiC, and ATP in a test tube (1.Nakajima M. Imai K. Ito H. Nishiwaki T. Murayama Y. Iwasaki H. Oyama T. Kondo T. Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro.Science. 2005; 308: 414-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic circadian clocks have long been understood as transcriptional-translational feedback loops in which clock gene products repress their own transcription (2.Lakin-Thomas P.L. Transcriptional feedback oscillators: maybe, maybe not ….J. Biol. Rhythms. 2006; 21: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recently, however, protein-based circadian oscillations have been found in human red blood cells (3.O'Neill J.S. Reddy A.B. Circadian clocks in human red blood cells.Nature. 2011; 469: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and in microalgae (4.O'Neill J.S. van Ooijen G. Dixon L.E. Troein C. Corellou F. Bouget F.Y. Reddy A.B. Millar A.J. Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote.Nature. 2011; 469: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), suggesting that protein-based circadian clocks exist ubiquitously in living organisms. Among the many experimental systems for studying circadian oscillations, the cyanobacterial in vitro system is the simplest one and is expected to be the best model to understand the principle underlying the protein-based oscillations. KaiC belongs to the P-loop NTPase superfamily, which includes both NTPases and kinases characterized by a strongly conserved nucleotide-binding motif, the P-loop (5.Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Evolution and classification of P-loop kinases and related proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 781-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). KaiC is a double-domain P-loop ATPase consisting of the N-terminal CI and C-terminal CII domains (6.Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Physical interactions among circadian clock proteins KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC in cyanobacteria.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). KaiC forms a double doughnut-like homohexamer with an ATP molecule at each subunit interface in the two rings (7.Pattanayek R. Wang J. Mori T. Xu Y. Johnson C.H. Egli M.

Kondo T. ATPase activity of KaiC determines the basic timing for circadian clock of cyanobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

KaiB functions as an attenuator of KaiC phosphorylation in the cyanobacterial circadian clock system.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2127-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The active sites for ATP hydrolysis reside at the subunit interfaces of CI and CII (9.Terauchi K. Kitayama Y. Nishiwaki T. Miwa K. Murayama Y. Oyama T. Kondo T.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13933-13938Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition to these activities, KaiC exhibits autophosphatase activity (15.Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. Cyanobacterial circadian clockwork: roles of KaiA, KaiB, and the kaiBC promoter in regulating KaiC.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), despite a lack of homology with the Ser/Thr and Tyr-specific protein phosphatases (16.Shi Y. Serine/threonine phosphatases: mechanism through structure.Cell. 2009; 139: 468-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 17.Tabernero L. Aricescu A.R. Jones E.Y. Szedlacsek S.E. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases: structure-function relationships.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism for KaiC autodephosphorylation has not yet been elucidated. To address this issue, we performed an autodephosphorylation assay using KaiC labeled with 32P. Prior to the assay, we removed the residual radioactive ATP bound to subunit interfaces using a newly established method, which included the dissociation of KaiC hexamers into monomers and the reconstitution of KaiC hexamers with nonradioactive ATP. This approach ensured that only the signals derived from 32P-labeled KaiC were examined. Surprisingly, we detected a transient elevation of [32P]ATP preceding the formation of 32Pi, suggesting that KaiC dephosphorylates itself through a novel sequential mechanism, i.e. KaiC generates ATP as a reaction intermediate, followed by its hydrolysis. The first step of the reaction is regarded as a reversal of autophosphorylation. On the basis of our observations, we demonstrate that the dephosphorylation of KaiC is catalyzed by the active site of ATPase through a completely different mechanism from those of typical Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatases. We used Escherichia coli BL21 cells as the host strain for expressing recombinant Kai proteins. Recombinant KaiA was expressed as described previously (6.Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Physical interactions among circadian clock proteins KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC in cyanobacteria.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and purified according to a previously reported method (14.Nishiwaki T.

Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method and bovine serum albumin as a standard. [γ-32P]ATP (NEG002Z; 370 MBq/ml, 222 TBq/mmol) and [α-32P]ATP (NEG003H; 370 MBq/ml, 111 TBq/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unless stated otherwise, the phosphorylation rhythm of KaiC was reconstituted and examined as reported previously (1.Nakajima M. Imai K. Ito H. Nishiwaki T. Murayama Y. Iwasaki H. Oyama T. Kondo T. Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro.Science. 2005; 308: 414-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3.5 μm KaiC was incubated at 30 °C in the presence of 1.2 μm KaiA, 3.5 μm KaiB, and 1 mm ATP in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken every 4 h and subjected to SDS-PAGE (gels with 11% T and 0.67% C) (18.Nishiwaki T. Satomi Y. Kitayama Y. Terauchi K. Kiyohara R. Takao T. Kondo T. A sequential program of dual phosphorylation of KaiC as a basis for circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4029-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were subjected to Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining using Quick CBB Plus (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and scanned using an ImageScanner III system (GE Healthcare). Densitometry of the gels was performed using ImageJ 1.41 software (National Institutes of Health). The levels of phosphorylated KaiC relative to those of total KaiC were plotted against time. 32P-Labeled KaiC hexamers were obtained using a previously described method with modifications (19.Ito H. Kageyama H. Mutsuda M. Nakajima M. Oyama T. Kondo T. Autonomous synchronization of the circadian KaiC phosphorylation rhythm.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). KaiC hexamers (5–10 mg/ml) were incubated on ice for 24 h in buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT) in the presence of 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP. The specific activity of ATP in the reaction mixture was 12 GBq/mmol. To remove [γ-32P]ATP bound to the subunit interfaces of KaiC hexamers, 32P-labeled KaiC hexamers were dissociated into monomers. The reaction mixture was passed twice through Micro Bio-Spin P-30 columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 mm ADP, and samples were incubated on ice for 24 h. KaiC monomer fractions were then obtained via gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 mm ADP. The autodephosphorylation reaction was initiated by replacing 0.1 mm ADP with 1 mm ATP using Micro Bio-Spin P-30 columns and incubating the resulting solution, which contained ∼1 mg/ml KaiC, at 30 °C. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were collected at predetermined time points, and reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue; Bio-Rad) supplemented with 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The resulting samples were subjected to either SDS-PAGE or thin-layer chromatography on PEI-cellulose F plates (Merck) using 0.75 m KH2PO4 as the mobile phase (20.Yegutkin G.G. Samburski S.S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 29441-29447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 32P-Derived signals were detected via autoradiography using BAS IP MS 2040E imaging plates (GE Healthcare) and a Typhoon 9400 image analyzer (GE Healthcare). Signals were quantified using the Toolbox module of ImageQuant TL 7.0 software (GE Healthcare). Background signals were subtracted using the local median method performed by the software. The standard curves used to calculate concentrations of 32P-labeled molecules from autoradiograms were obtained using serial dilutions of 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP solution (12 GBq/mmol). Radioactivity was detected at the positions corresponding to ATP and Pi markers as well as at the origin on the chromatogram (supplemental Fig. S1). We calculated the concentrations of the molecules that stayed at the thin-layer chromatography origin and of phosphorylated KaiC separated using SDS-PAGE and plotted the data against time. We concluded that the radioactivity at the origin was derived from 32P-labeled KaiC because the two traces almost completely overlapped (supplemental Fig. S2). Therefore, in this experiment, we analyzed all three 32P-labeled species on a single chromatogram. The kinetic analysis was performed using Global Kinetic Explorer 2.5 software (KinTek Corp.) (21.Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. Global Kinetic Explorer: a new computer program for dynamic simulation and fitting of kinetic data.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Errors for each parameter were estimated using the FitSpace Explorer module in the software (22.Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. FitSpace Explorer: an algorithm to evaluate multidimensional parameter space in fitting kinetic data.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) by calculating the lower and upper boundaries. The calculated boundaries reflect fits within minimum χ2 multiplied by 1.2. Nucleotides bound to either full-length or CII-truncated KaiC were analyzed by reconstituting KaiC hexamers from monomers in the presence of 1 mm [α-32P]ATP. The specific activity of ATP in the reaction mixture was 6.0 GBq/mmol. The resulting solution, which contained ∼1 mg/ml protein, was incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots were collected at predetermined time points and applied twice to Micro Bio-Spin P-30 columns to remove unbound nucleotides. The eluate was mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol to release KaiC-bound nucleotides from the proteins. Samples were spotted onto PEI-cellulose plates and subjected to thin-layer chromatography to separate ATP and ADP using KH2PO4 as the mobile phase. To monitor the autodephosphorylation of KaiC, we prepared 32P-labeled KaiC phosphorylated at Ser-431 and Thr-432. At 30 °C, KaiC is markedly phosphorylated in the presence of KaiA (11.Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. KaiA-stimulated KaiC phosphorylation in circadian timing loops in cyanobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and dephosphorylated in its absence (15.Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. Cyanobacterial circadian clockwork: roles of KaiA, KaiB, and the kaiBC promoter in regulating KaiC.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For autodephosphorylation assays, however, it is desirable to phosphorylate KaiC without KaiA because residual KaiA might interfere with autodephosphorylation. Ito et al. (19.Ito H. Kageyama H. Mutsuda M. Nakajima M. Oyama T. Kondo T. Autonomous synchronization of the circadian KaiC phosphorylation rhythm.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that the ratio of phosphorylated KaiC to total KaiC reached ∼0.7 after 30 h of incubation at 4 °C, suggesting that incubation at low temperature promotes autophosphorylation without KaiA. We incubated KaiC in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP on ice and monitored the incorporation of radioactive phosphate for 24 h. After 24 h of incubation, ∼30% of KaiC was newly phosphorylated based on Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1A, upper panel). KaiC-specific radioactive signals increased together with the increasing intensity of phosphorylated KaiC bands (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Based on the autoradiogram, ∼0.3 mol of phosphate was incorporated into 1 mol of KaiC monomers. The 32P-labeled KaiC hexamer obtained as described above contained residual [γ-32P]ATP at the subunit interface. Next, we eliminated KaiC-bound [γ-32P]ATP to ensure that only signals derived from 32P-labeled KaiC were examined during the autodephosphorylation assay. We expected that [γ-32P]ATP bound to the subunit interface would be released when 32P-labeled KaiC hexamers were dissociated into monomers. To date, the procedure for the monomerization of Synechococcus KaiC hexamers has not been established. Hayashi et al. (23.Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R. Uzumaki T. Miyake A. Shen J.R. Imada K. Furukawa Y. Yonekura K. Namba K. Ishiura M. ATP-induced hexameric ring structure of the cyanobacterial circadian clock protein KaiC.Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showed that Thermosynechococcus KaiC hexamers dissociated into monomers in the absence of ATP. Therefore, we removed ATP from the reaction mixture and incubated the resulting solution to prepare Synechococcus KaiC monomers. Because KaiC formed aggregates in the absence of ATP at temperatures higher than ∼10 °C, we incubated the reaction mixture on ice. We added 0.1 mm ADP to stabilize the KaiC monomers during the incubation period. After 24 h of incubation, the KaiC monomers were separated using gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1B). To verify that the KaiC monomers were functional, we used them to recreate the KaiC phosphorylation rhythm. The KaiC monomers were allowed to re-form hexamers by replacing 0.1 mm ADP with 1 mm ATP, and the resulting KaiC hexamers were incubated at 30 °C in the presence of KaiA and KaiB. It took <5 min for KaiC hexamers to form from monomers (supplemental Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. 1C, this approach did not affect the KaiC phosphorylation rhythm. As expected, the radioactive ATP that had been bound to KaiC was almost completely removed with this procedure (ATP-derived signals at time 0 in Fig. 2A). Autodephosphorylation was initiated by adding 1 mm nonradioactive ATP to 32P-labeled KaiC monomers and incubating the resulting 32P-labeled KaiC hexamers at 30 °C. At the indicated time points, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and subjected to analysis. Surprisingly, we observed a transient elevation in the ATP concentration prior to an increase in the Pi levels (Fig. 2A). The sum of the concentrations of these molecules was assumed to be constant throughout the reaction (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that KaiC autodephosphorylation occurs through a previously unknown two-step mechanism. First, KaiC forms ATP as an intermediate during autodephosphorylation using ADP as a phosphate acceptor. This reaction can be regarded as the reversal of the autophosphorylation reaction. Subsequently, [32P]ATP is hydrolyzed by KaiC ATPase to form 32Pi. We normalized the total concentration of these molecules to 1 and plotted the relative concentration of each molecule over time (Fig. 2B) The small standard deviations observed in four independent experiments indicate that the autodephosphorylation process was highly reproducible. Although the reversal of kinase reactions requires ADP as a phosphate acceptor, no reports have previously shown that KaiC binds ADP. To address this issue, we examined the time-dependent changes in the levels of adenine nucleotides bound to KaiC. We reconstituted KaiC hexamers from monomers in the presence of 1 mm [α-32P]ATP and incubated the samples at 30 °C. The number of adenine nucleotides bound to each KaiC protomer remained nearly constant at two (supplemental Fig. S4), indicating that the nucleotide-binding sites of both CI and CII were occupied. The ratio of ADP to the total bound nucleotides increased, reaching ∼0.7 after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 2C, closed circles). These results suggest that KaiC hexamers contain both ADP and ATP. We also examined the nucleotides bound to CII-truncated KaiC (Fig. 2C, open circles). In contrast to full-length KaiC, >95% of the nucleotides bound to CII-truncated KaiC were ATP. It is possible that the CII domain is responsible for ADP binding to KaiC. To test our hypothesis of the reaction mechanism, we modeled the autodephosphorylation process (see (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3) below) and fit our data to the rate equations derived from (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3). Autodephosphorylation is an intersubunit reaction that occurs at CII subunit interfaces. To simplify the model, we assumed that the hypothetical reaction unit consisted of two subunits facing each other; one contained a nucleotide-binding site, and the other contained a phosphorylation site. We defined KaiCa as the subunit containing the nucleotide-binding site, and KaiCb as the subunit containing the 32P-labeled phosphorylation site (Fig. 3). KaiC-bound ADP should be a product of the hydrolysis of bound ATP and should not be incorporated from the reaction mixture because the reaction mixture contained little ADP. We first modeled the hydrolysis of nonradioactive ATP bound to KaiCa, which provides the phosphate acceptor ADP. k1 is the rate constant of ATP hydrolysis, and k−1 is the overall rate constant of the opposing reaction, including the reversal of ATP hydrolysis, the release of products, and the incorporation of nonradioactive ATP (Equation 1).KaiCa⋅ATP⇄k1k−1KaiCa⋅ADP⋅Pi(Eq. 1) We modeled the transfer of phosphate from 32P-labeled KaiCb to ADP on KaiCa. We expected that the amount of both 32P-labeled KaiCb and KaiCa-bound ADP would affect the rate of this process (Equation 2).32P-KaiCb+KaiCa⋅ADP⇄k2k−2KaiCb+KaiCa⋅[32P]ATP(Eq. 2) [32P]ATP is hydrolyzed to form 32Pi (Equation 3). The forward and reverse rate constants of ATP hydrolysis are k3 and k−3, respectively. The reincorporation of [32P]ATP into the KaiC hexamer was not considered because residual [32P]ATP was removed prior to autodephosphorylation (Equation 3).KaiCa⋅[32P]ATP⇄k3k−3KaiCa⋅ADP⋅32Pi(Eq. 3) We performed analyses using Global Kinetic Explorer (21.Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. Global Kinetic Explorer: a new computer program for dynamic simulation and fitting of kinetic data.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), a program that allows for the numeric integration of rate equations and the fitting of experimental data based on nonlinear regression analysis. We set the initial values of 32P-labeled KaiCb and the sum of nonradioactive KaiCa-bound nucleotides to 1 and assumed that the initial values of [32P]ATP and 32Pi were 0 (Fig. 2B). We estimated that the ratio of KaiCa-bound ADP at time 0 was 0.10 by subtracting the amount of ADP bound to CII-truncated KaiC (Fig. 2C, open circles) from the amount bound to full-length KaiC (Fig. 2C, closed circles). We allowed k1 and k3 to float together, whereas k−1 and k−3 varied independently. The solid lines in Fig. 2B represent the best fit to the data of (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), the χ2 value of which is 76.4 with 91 degrees of freedom. The rate constants and associated errors for the parameters calculated using FitSpace Explorer (22.Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. FitSpace Explorer: an algorithm to evaluate multidimensional parameter space in fitting kinetic data.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) are shown in Table 1. The forward rate constants are well constrained by the experimental data. Reverse rate constants of k−1 and k−2 cannot be accurately resolved on the time scale of the experiment, and only the upper limits are defined.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for KaiC autodephosphorylationRate constantValueLower boundaRange of parameters is for fits within 20% increase in χ2 values.Upper boundaRange of parameters is for fits within 20% increase in χ2 values.h−1h−1h−1k+1 and k+3bParameters were constrained to the same value during the global fitting process.1.191.161.22k−1cOnly upper limits of these parameters were defined.0.258k+20.7930.7550.866k−2cOnly upper limits of these parameters were defined.0.217k−30.007380.005900.00935a Range of parameters is for fits within 20% increase in χ2 values.b Parameters were constrained to the same value during the global fitting process.c Only upper limits of these parameters were defined. Open table in a new tab We have shown that KaiC undergoes autodephosphorylation via a previously unknown mechanism that differs from the reactions catalyzed by standard Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatases (16.Shi Y. Serine/threonine phosphatases: mechanism through structure.Cell. 2009; 139: 468-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 17.Tabernero L. Aricescu A.R. Jones E.Y. Szedlacsek S.E. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases: structure-function relationships.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This mechanism includes generation of an ATP intermediate, followed by hydrolysis of this molecule (Fig. 3). The former step is regarded as the reversal of autophosphorylation. Previously, we (18.Nishiwaki T. Satomi Y. Kitayama Y. Terauchi K. Kiyohara R. Takao T. Kondo T. A sequential program of dual phosphorylation of KaiC as a basis for circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4029-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and another group (24.Rust M.J. Markson J.S. Lane W.S. Fisher D.S. O'Shea E.K. Ordered phosphorylation governs oscillation of a three-protein circadian clock.Science. 2007; 318: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) proposed that the phosphorylation cycle of KaiC was understood as the sequential transition among the four phosphorylation states derived from Ser-431 and Thr-432. This model was insufficient to explain the phosphorylation cycle because two independent autokinase and autophosphatase activities were assumed to exist in KaiC. In this study, we have demonstrated that both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of KaiC are mediated by a single phosphotransfer reaction catalyzed by the active site of ATP hydrolysis in CII. On the basis of our findings, we propose a revision of the previous model: the KaiC phosphorylation rhythm is sustained by a periodical shift in the equilibrium of the intersubunit phosphate transfer reaction between KaiC-bound nucleotides and phosphorylation sites (Equation 2 and Fig. 3). It is possible that the direction in which the intersubunit phosphate transfer reaction proceeds is determined by KaiA, which functions as an autokinase activator. The reaction favors ATP formation in the absence of KaiA at 30 °C. In the presence of KaiA, the reaction proceeds to phosphorylated KaiC formation (11.Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. KaiA-stimulated KaiC phosphorylation in circadian timing loops in cyanobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The local structure of the active site may be affected by the presence or absence of KaiA, which determines the direction of phosphate transfer. In agreement with this idea, Kim et al. (25.Kim Y.I. Dong G. Carruthers Jr., C.W. Golden S.S. LiWang A. The day/night switch in KaiC, a central oscillator component of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12825-12830Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) suggested that KaiA regulated the orientation of ATP bound at the active site through a structural change in a looped segment near the C terminus. KaiB inactivates KaiA by forming a ternary complex with KaiA and Ser-431-phosphorylated KaiC (18.Nishiwaki T. Satomi Y. Kitayama Y. Terauchi K. Kiyohara R. Takao T. Kondo T. A sequential program of dual phosphorylation of KaiC as a basis for circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4029-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which should result in a circadian change in the direction of phosphate transfer. We previously proposed that the phosphorylation cycle was coupled with the ATPase activity of KaiC (9.Terauchi K. Kitayama Y. Nishiwaki T. Miwa K. Murayama Y. Oyama T. Kondo T. ATPase activity of KaiC determines the basic timing for circadian clock of cyanobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16377-16381Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The precise relationship was not elucidated because the autodephosphorylation mechanism was not understood correctly. How, then, is the KaiC phosphorylation cycle regulated by the ATPase? The ATPase activity of CII has two critical roles: one is the degradation of the ATP intermediate of autodephosphorylation and the other is providing ADP, a substrate for the reversal of the autokinase reaction. We believe that ADP bound to the active site was not incorporated from the reaction mixture but was a product of the hydrolysis of bound ATP because the reaction mixture contained little ADP, if any. In agreement with this idea, Rust et al. (26.Rust M.J. Golden S.S. O'Shea E.K. Light-driven changes in energy metabolism directly entrain the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator.Science. 2011; 331: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) reported that increasing the ADP/ATP ratio in the reaction mixture did not affect autodephosphorylation. It is possible that ADP is not released immediately after ATP hydrolysis, which suggests that ADP release is the rate-limiting step in the CII ATPase reaction. The ATPase activity of CII should regulate the phosphorylation cycle as a partial reaction of autodephosphorylation, whereas the ATPase activity of CI may function as a pacemaker of circadian oscillation (9.Terauchi K. Kitayama Y. Nishiwaki T. Miwa K. Murayama Y. Oyama T. Kondo T. ATPase activity of KaiC determines the basic timing for circadian clock of cyanobacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16377-16381Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We anticipate that other as-yet unknown proteins that catalyze both forward and reverse kinase reactions exist to regulate reversible or cyclic physiological processes. One candidate is E. coli AceK, which exhibits kinase, phosphatase, and ATPase activities (27.Laporte D.C. Stueland C.S. Ikeda T.P. Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.Biochimie. 1989; 71: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although direct evidence has not yet been reported, the phosphatase activity of AceK has been postulated to result from a reversal of the kinase reaction (27.Laporte D.C. Stueland C.S. Ikeda T.P. Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.Biochimie. 1989; 71: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). AceK phosphorylates and dephosphorylates isocitrate dehydrogenase, reversibly controlling the flux of metabolites at branching points in metabolic pathways (27.Laporte D.C. Stueland C.S. Ikeda T.P. Isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.Biochimie. 1989; 71: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Tetsuya Mori (Vanderbilt University) and Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2156797025,"Background In spite of great advances in target-oriented Western medicine for treating myocardial infarction (MI), it is still a leading cause of death in a worldwide epidemic. In contrast to Western medicine, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) uses a holistic and synergistic approach to restore the balance of Yin-Yang of body energy so the body's normal function can be restored. Sini decoction (SND) is a well-known formula of TCM which has been used to treat MI for many years. However, its holistic activity evaluation and mechanistic understanding are still lacking due to its complex components. Methodology/Principal Findings A urinary metabonomic method based on nuclear magnetic resonance and ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was developed to characterize MI-related metabolic profiles and delineate the effect of SND on MI. With Elastic Net for classification and selection of biomarkers, nineteen potential biomarkers in rat urine were screened out, primarily related to myocardial energy metabolism, including the glycolysis, citrate cycle, amino acid metabolism, purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism. With the altered metabolism pathways as possible drug targets, we systematically analyze the therapeutic effect of SND, which demonstrated that SND administration could provide satisfactory effect on MI through partially regulating the perturbed myocardial energy metabolism. Conclusions/Significance Our results showed that metabonomic approach offers a useful tool to identify MI-related biomarkers and provides a new methodological cue for systematically dissecting the underlying efficacies and mechanisms of TCM in treating MI."
https://openalex.org/W2082383568,"Peroxisomes play a major role in human cellular lipid metabolism, including fatty acid β-oxidation. The most frequent peroxisomal disorder is X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which is caused by mutations in ABCD1. The biochemical hallmark of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) due to impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation. Although this suggests a role of ABCD1 in VLCFA import into peroxisomes, no direct experimental evidence is available to substantiate this. To unravel the mechanism of peroxisomal VLCFA transport, we use Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. Here we provide evidence that in this organism very long chain acyl-CoA esters are hydrolyzed by the Pxa1p-Pxa2p complex prior to the actual transport of their fatty acid moiety into the peroxisomes with the CoA presumably being released into the cytoplasm. The Pxa1p-Pxa2p complex functionally interacts with the acyl-CoA synthetases Faa2p and/or Fat1p on the inner surface of the peroxisomal membrane for subsequent re-esterification of the VLCFAs. Importantly, the Pxa1p-Pxa2p complex shares this molecular mechanism with HsABCD1 and HsABCD2."

Here we show that between-participant variance in thoughts unrelated to the task being performed (known as task unrelated thought, TUT) is associated with longer response times (RT) when target presentation occurs during periods when baseline Pupil Diameter (PD) is increased. As behavioral interference due to high baseline PD can reflect increased tonic activity in the norepinephrine system (NE), these results might implicate high tonic NE activity in the facilitation of TUTs. Based on these findings, it is hypothesised that high tonic mode NE leads to a generalised de-amplification of task relevant information that prioritses internally generated thought and insulates it from the potentially disruptive events taking place in the external environment."

https://openalex.org/W2085441678,"The summertime North Pacific subtropical gyre has widespread phytoplankton blooms between Hawaii and the subtropical front (∼30°N) that appear as chlorophyll (chl) increases in satellite ocean color data. Nitrogen-fixing diatom symbioses (diatom-diazotroph associations: DDAs) often increase 10(2)-10(3) fold in these blooms and contribute to elevated export flux. In 2008 and 2009, two cruises targeted satellite chlorophyll blooms to examine DDA species abundance, chlorophyll concentration, biogenic silica concentration, and hydrography. Generalized observations that DDA blooms occur when the mixed layer depth is < 70 m are supported, but there is no consistent relationship between mixed layer depth, bloom intensity, or composition; regional blooms between 22-34°N occur within a broader temperature range (21-26°C) than previously reported. In both years, the Hemiaulus-Richelia and Rhizosolenia-Richelia DDAs increased 10(2)-10(3) over background concentrations within satellite-defined bloom features. The two years share a common trend of Hemiaulus dominance of the DDAs and substantial increases in the >10 µm chl a fraction (∼40-90+% of total chl a). Integrated diatom abundance varied 10-fold over <10 km. Biogenic silica concentration tracked diatom abundance, was dominated by the >10 µm size fraction, and increased up to 5-fold in the blooms. The two years differed in the magnitude of the surface chl a increase (2009>2008), the abundance of pennate diatoms within the bloom (2009>2008), and the substantially greater mixed layer depth in 2009.

https://openalex.org/W2111204365,"F(o)F(1)-ATP synthase (F(o)F(1)) synthesizes ATP in mitochondria coupled with proton flow driven by the proton motive force (pmf) across membranes. It has been known that isolated IF1, an evolutionarily well conserved mitochondrial protein, can inhibit the ATP hydrolysis activity of F(o)F(1). Here, we generated HeLa cells with permanent IF1 knockdown (IF1-KD cells) and compared their energy metabolism with control cells. Under optimum growth conditions, IF1-KD cells have lower cellular ATP levels and generate a higher pmf and more reactive oxygen species. Nonetheless, IF1-KD cells and control cells show the same rates of cell growth, glucose consumption, and mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Furthermore, contrary to previous reports, the morphology of mitochondria in IF1-KD cells appears to be normal. When cells encounter sudden dissipation of pmf, the cytoplasmic ATP level in IF1-KD cells drops immediately (~1 min), whereas it remains unchanged in the control cells, indicating occurrence of futile ATP hydrolysis by F(o)F(1) in the absence of IF1. The lowered ATP level in IF1-KD cells then recovers gradually (~10 min) to the original level by consuming more glucose than control cells. The viability of IF1-KD cells and control cells is the same in the absence of pmf. Thus, IF1 contributes to ATP homeostasis, but its deficiency does not affect the growth and survival of HeLa cells. Only when cells are exposed to chemical ischemia (no glycolysis and no respiration) or high concentrations of reactive oxygen species does IF1 exhibit its ability to alleviate cell injury."
https://openalex.org/W2041243958,"Many models for the origin of life have focused on understanding how evolution can drive the refinement of a preexisting enzyme, such as the evolution of efficient replicase activity. Here we present a model for what was, arguably, an even earlier stage of chemical evolution, when polymer sequence diversity was generated and sustained before, and during, the onset of functional selection. The model includes regular environmental cycles (e.g. hydration-dehydration cycles) that drive polymers between times of replication and functional activity, which coincide with times of different monomer and polymer diffusivity. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this proposed prebiotic scenario provides a robust mechanism for the exploration of sequence space. Introduction of a polymer sequence with monomer synthetase activity illustrates that functional sequences can become established in a preexisting pool of otherwise non-functional sequences. Functional selection does not dominate system dynamics and sequence diversity remains high, permitting the emergence and spread of more than one functional sequence. It is also observed that polymers spontaneously form clusters in simulations where polymers diffuse more slowly than monomers, a feature that is reminiscent of a previous proposal that the earliest stages of life could have been defined by the collective evolution of a system-wide cooperation of polymer aggregates. Overall, the results presented demonstrate the merits of considering plausible prebiotic polymer chemistries and environments that would have allowed for the rapid turnover of monomer resources and for regularly varying monomer/polymer diffusivities."

We created a mouse model of liver-specific knockdown of p70 S6 kinase (S6K) (L-S6K-KD) by systemic delivery of an adeno-associated virus carrying a shRNA for S6K and examined the effects on steatosis and insulin resistance. High fat diet (HFD) fed L-S6K-KD mice showed improved glucose tolerance and systemic insulin sensitivity compared with controls, with no changes in food intake or body weight. The induction of lipogenic gene expression was attenuated in the L-S6K-KD mice with decreased sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c expression and mature SREBP-1c protein, as well as decreased steatosis on HFD. Our results demonstrate the importance of S6K: 1) as a modulator of the hepatic response to fasting/refeeding, 2) in the development of steatosis, and 3) as a key node in selective hepatic insulin resistance in obese mice.

https://openalex.org/W2097479184,"Background The aim of this study is to determine anti-cancer effect of Icariside II purified from the root of Epimedium koreanum Nakai on human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line U937. Methodology/Principal Findings Icariside II blocked the growth U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In this anti-proliferation process, this herb compound rendered the cells susceptible to apoptosis, manifested by enhanced accumulation of sub-G1 cell population and increased the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. Icariside II was able to activate caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent manner. Concurrently, the anti-apoptotic proteins, such as bcl-xL and survivin in U937 cells, were downregulated by Icariside II. In addition, Icariside II could inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and function and subsequently suppress the activation of Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), the upstream activators of STAT3, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Icariside II also enhanced the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SH2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP)-1, and the addition of sodium pervanadate (a PTP inhibitor) prevented Icariside II-induced apoptosis as well as STAT3 inactivation in STAT3 positive U937 cells. Furthermore, silencing SHP-1 using its specific siRNA significantly blocked STAT3 inactivation and apoptosis induced by Icariside II in U937 cells. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrated that via targeting STAT3-related signaling, Icariside II sensitizes U937 cells to apoptosis and perhaps serves as a potent chemotherapeutic agent for AML."

Combination of the modeled three-dimensional structures and x-ray crystallography indicates that the full-length structure of Tudor-SN resembles a stick with a hook, where SN-like domains form the stick and the tudor domain makes up the hook (11.Shaw N.

The pre-mRNA splicing process is essential for the successful execution of eukaryotic gene expression and mediates the production of mature mRNA through excision of introns and ligation of exons in pre-mRNAs by the spliceosome machinery. The spliceosome consists of five conserved snRNPs formed by an ordered binding of specific protein complexes onto metabolically stable U snRNAs, including U1, U2, U5, and base-paired U4/U6, which are highly abundant in eukaryotic cells (16.Will C.L.

The biogenesis of U snRNPs is a stepwise process, and the hallmark of which is the formation of an Sm protein ring consisting of seven polypeptides (B/B′, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G) around the U snRNAs (20.Achsel T.

There are two general types (i.e. type I and type II) of protein-arginine methyltransferase responsible for protein arginine methylation.

Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). sDMA is detected on both nuclear and cytoplasmic Sm proteins, whereas asymmetrical dimethylarginine is only identified on nuclear Sm proteins (28.Miranda T.B.

For example, sDMA-modified Sm proteins are recognized by the tudor domains of SMN and SPF30 (29.Sprangers R. Groves M.R. Sinning I. Sattler M.

The formation of the spliceosome complex is a dynamic process of snRNP particles occurring on pre-mRNA. The U5 snRNP binds the 5′ and 3′ splice sites of exons, allowing the spliceosome to “tether” the exons at the 5′ splice site, and it intermediately carries out the first catalytic step and then aligns with the 3′ splice site of exon for the second step. Prp8, U5–116, and hBrr2 are three key components of U5 snRNP that interact extensively with each other and play essential roles in the formation, activation, and remodeling of the spliceosome. We reported earlier that purified Tudor-SN could accelerate the first catalytic step of splicing, but it did not affect the overall level of splicing (13.Yang J. Välineva T. Hong J. Bu T. Yao Z. Jensen O.N. Frilander M.J. Silvennoinen O. Transcriptional co-activator protein p100 interacts with snRNP proteins and facilitates the assembly of the spliceosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4485-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The association of Tudor-SN- and U5 snRNP-specific proteins may explain the phenomenon. However, it cannot explain how Tudor-SN could associate with different U snRNAs, such as U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs. The tudor domain in Tudor-SN shows a high level of homology to the tudor domain of the SMN protein (13.Yang J. Välineva T. Hong J. Bu T. Yao Z. Jensen O.N. Frilander M.J. Silvennoinen O. Transcriptional co-activator protein p100 interacts with snRNP proteins and facilitates the assembly of the spliceosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4485-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SMN protein associates with the spliceosomal Sm proteins via its tudor domain and plays essential roles in the assembly of U snRNPs (32.Kolb S.J. Battle D.J. Dreyfuss G. Molecular functions of the SMN complex.J. Child Neurol. 2007; 22: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33.Bühler D. Raker V. Lührmann R. Fischer U. Essential role for the Tudor domain of SMN in spliceosomal U snRNP assembly. Implications for spinal muscular atrophy.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Tudor-SN protein participates in snRNP assembly through similar interaction mechanisms, which led us to investigate the relationship between the TSN domain and Sm proteins. In addition, surface electrostatic potential plots of tudor domain in Tudor-SN protein also reveal negatively charged surfaces, which are involved in recognition and binding of methylation marks (11.Shaw N. Zhao M. Cheng C. Xu H. Saarikettu J. Li Y. Da Y. Yao Z. Silvennoinen O. Yang J. Liu Z.J. Wang B.C. Rao Z. The multifunctional human p100 protein “hooks” methylated ligands.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was thus to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the Tudor-SN protein in the pre-mRNA splicing process. In this study, we demonstrate that the interaction of Tudor-SN and snRNPs involves the efficient association of Sm protein, apart from the interaction with U5 snRNPs. HeLa cells and COS-7 cells were cultured as reported previously (12.Yang J. Aittomäki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O.

COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids by electroporation with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 220 V/950 microfarads. siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tudor-SN siRNA was generated as reported previously (14.Välineva T. Yang J. Palovuori R. Silvennoinen O.

The pSG5-Tudor-SN expression plasmid containing the full-length cDNA of human Tudor-SN and the GST-TSN plasmid containing the TSN domain (640–885 amino acids) of Tudor-SN protein were constructed as described previously (12.Yang J.

GST-Tudor was constructed by cloning PCR products corresponding to amino acids 678–769 of human TSN into pGEXT-4T-1 vector with EcoRI and NotI.

GST-TSN mutant constructs (F715A, Y721A, F715A/Y721A, Y741A, Y738A, and Y738A/Y741A) were generated as described previously (11.Shaw N. Zhao M. Cheng C. Xu H. Saarikettu J. Li Y. Da Y. Yao Z.

Biol. 2007; 14: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All PCR products were sequenced. The total cell lysates (TCLs) of HeLa cells were harvested with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium butyrate). The TCLs were layered on a 10-ml gradient of 10–30% glycerol and centrifuged at 24,000 rpm (Beckman SW-41Ti rotor) for 20 h at 4 °C. All glycerol solutions were prepared with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm NaF (pH 7.2), 1 mm DTT, 0.04% Nonidet P-40. and 10–30% glycerol. Eighteen fractions of 500 μl each were collected from top to bottom. Each fraction was run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with corresponding antibodies. The extracted snRNAs from each fraction were also analyzed by Northern blotting with U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNA probes as described previously (34.Pessa H.K. Ruokolainen A. Frilander M.J. The abundance of the spliceosomal snRNPs is not limiting the splicing of U12-type introns.RNA. 2006; 12: 1883-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes of U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNA were made by in vitro transcription of the linearized snRNA plasmids (34.Pessa H.K. Ruokolainen A. Frilander M.J.

HeLa cells (2.0 × 107) were incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link RNA protein. Then the glycine (125 mm, pH 7.0) was added to quench the cross-linking. Total cell lysates were harvested with SDS-lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology), supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and RiboLock Ribonuclease inhibitor (MBI E00381) for 10 min on ice. Then the lysates were incubated with corresponding antibodies conjugated with protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) or protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) in the binding buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 400 units/ml MBL RiboLock Ribonuclease inhibitor and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitors mixture) at 4 °C overnight with head-over-tail rotation. The precipitated complexes were sequentially washed with buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 150 mm NaCl, TE buffer (pH 8.0) and then incubated with the elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, 400 units/ml MBL RiboLock Ribonuclease inhibitor) at 4 °C for 15 min and at 65 °C for 2 h with addition of 5 m NaCl. The bound RNAs were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis with reverse transcriptase M-MLV(RNase H−) and random hexamer primers (Takara, Japan), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) assay was performed to detect the presence of precipitated U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNA with the specific primers (35.Zhang Z. Lotti F. Dittmar K. Younis I.

Amplification specificity was detected by gel electrophoresis and dissociation curve analysis. For the Q-PCR, the RIP fold changes were calculated validly using the ΔΔCt (cycle time) method (36.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

The ΔCt value of bound snRNAs with either experimental (anti-Y12 or anti-TMG) or control (anti-IgG) beads was normalized to the Input fraction Ct value in the same assay. Then the ΔΔCt value was calculated by subtracting the ΔCt(normalized anti-IgG control RIP) from the ΔCt(normalized Y12 or anti-TMG RIP). Fold change value (experimental RIP versus control RIP) was determined by raising 2 to the power of the negative ΔΔCt. GST pulldown assays were performed as described previously (12.Yang J.

GST alone or GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 bacteria and bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of GST fusion protein in the lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. TCLs of COS-7 cells or HeLa cells were collected with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (P8340, Sigma). Protein concentrations of TCLs were measured using the protein assay system from Bio-Rad. TCLs of HeLa cells were treated with or without 100 μl of RNase mixture (MBI Fermentas) at 37 °C for 30 min. The information on the RNase mixture system used in protein binding assay is shown in supplemental Table S1. The bead-bound fusion proteins were incubated with TCLs overnight at 4 °C with head-over-tail rotation and then washed five times with binding buffer containing 75 mm NaCl. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with monoclonal anti-SmB (Clone 12F5, Sigma) or anti-Sm (Y12, ab3138, Abcam). HeLa or COS-7 cells were incubated with or without the methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-deoxy-5-(methylthio)adenosine (250 μm, MTA, Sigma) for 20 h. The total cell lysates of HeLa or COS-7 cells were collected and then incubated with corresponding antibodies conjugated with either protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) or protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 12 h with head-over-tail rotation. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by blotting with corresponding antibodies. The following antibodies were used: anti-trimethylguanosine (TMG)-agarose beads and anti-TMG-cap antibody (K121, Calbiochem); mouse monoclonal anti-Tudor-SN antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); monoclonal anti-SmB antibody (Clone 12F5, Sigma); anti-Sm (Y12, Abcam); mouse monoclonal anti-FLAGM2 coupled with agarose and anti-His-agarose (H-0767, Sigma); goat anti-Tudor-SN (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal anti-sDMA antibody (anti-dimethylarginine, symmetric, SYM10, Upstate Biotechnology); and rabbit anti-SMN (H-195, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The rabbit polyclonal anti-Tudor-SN antibody was generated against TSN domain (amino acids 640–885) of Tudor-SN. [32P]UTP-labeled adenovirus-splicing substrates was produced by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) using the Adenovirus Major Late (AdML) plasmid linearized with HindIII as template and purified as described previously (13.Yang J.

https://openalex.org/W2061541382,"Background The suppression of amber stop codons with non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) is used for the site-specific introduction of many unusual functions into proteins. Specific orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (o-aaRS)/amber suppressor tRNACUA pairs (o-pairs) for the incorporation of ncAAs in S. cerevisiae were previously selected from an E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA mutant library. Incorporation fidelity relies on the specificity of the o-aaRSs for their ncAAs and the ability to effectively discriminate against their natural substrate Tyr or any other canonical amino acid. Methodology/Principal Findings We used o-pairs previously developed for ncAAs carrying reactive alkyne-, azido-, or photocrosslinker side chains to suppress an amber mutant of human superoxide dismutase 1 in S. cerevisiae. We found worse incorporation efficiencies of the alkyne- and the photocrosslinker ncAAs than reported earlier. In our hands, amber suppression with the ncAA containing the azido group did not occur at all. In addition to the incorporation experiments in S. cerevisiae, we analyzed the catalytic properties of the o-aaRSs in vitro. Surprisingly, all o-aaRSs showed much higher preference for their natural substrate Tyr than for any of the tested ncAAs. While it is unclear why efficiently recognized Tyr is not inserted at amber codons, we speculate that metabolically inert ncAAs accumulate in the cell, and for this reason they are incorporated despite being weak substrates for the o-aaRSs. Conclusions/Significance O-pairs have been developed for a whole plethora of ncAAs. However, a systematic and detailed analysis of their catalytic properties is still missing. Our study provides a comprehensive scrutiny of o-pairs developed for the site-specific incorporation of reactive ncAAs in S. cerevisiae. It suggests that future development of o-pairs as efficient biotechnological tools will greatly benefit from sound characterization in vivo and in vitro in parallel to monitoring intracellular ncAA levels."

In this study, we identified 73 miRNAs, belonging to 49 families, from Asiatic cotton using a well-developed comparative genome-based homologue search. Several of the predicted miRNAs were validated using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). The length of miRNAs varied from 18 to 22 nt with an average of 20 nt. The length of miRNA precursors also varied from 46 to 684 nt with an average of 138 ±120 nt. For a majority of Asiatic cotton miRNAs, there is only one member per family; however, multiple members were identified for miRNA 156, 414, 837, 838, 1044, 1533, 2902, 2868, 5021 and 5142 families. Nucleotides A and U were dominant, accounted for 62.95%, in the Asiatic cotton pre-miRNAs. The Asiatic cotton pre-miRNAs had high negative minimal folding free energy (MFE) and adjusted MFE (AMFE) and high MFE index (MFEI). Many miRNAs identified in Asiatic cotton suggest that miRNAs also play a similar regulatory mechanism in diploid cotton."
https://openalex.org/W2059316367,"Fundamental to vaccine development, manufacturing consistency, and product stability is an understanding of the vaccine structure-activity relationship. With the virus-like particle (VLP) approach for recombinant vaccines gaining popularity, there is growing demand for tools that define their key characteristics. We assessed a suite of non-intrusive VLP epitope structure and function characterization tools by application to the Hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg) VLP-based vaccine.The epitope-specific immune reactivity of rHBsAg epitopes to a given monoclonal antibody was monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and quantitatively analyzed on rHBsAg VLPs in-solution or bound to adjuvant with a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The structure of recombinant rHBsAg particles was examined by cryo transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM) and in-solution atomic force microscopy (AFM).SPR and competitive ELISA determined relative antigenicity in solution, in real time, with rapid turn-around, and without the need of dissolving the particulate aluminum based adjuvant. These methods demonstrated the nature of the clinically relevant epitopes of HBsAg as being responsive to heat and/or redox treatment. In-solution AFM and cryoTEM determined vaccine particle size distribution, shape, and morphology. Redox-treated rHBsAg enabled 3D reconstruction from CryoTEM images--confirming the previously proposed octahedral structure and the established lipid-to-protein ratio of HBsAg particles. Results from these non-intrusive biophysical and immunochemical analyses coalesced into a comprehensive understanding of rHBsAg vaccine epitope structure and function that was important for assuring the desired epitope formation, determinants for vaccine potency, and particle stability during vaccine design, development, and manufacturing.Together, the methods presented here comprise a novel suite of non-intrusive VLP structural and functional characterization tools for recombinant vaccines. Key VLP structural features were defined and epitope-specific antigenicity was quantified while preserving epitope integrity and particle morphology. These tools should facilitate the development of other VLP-based vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2084589295,"A surging interest in the evolution of consistent trait correlations has inspired research on pigment patterns as a correlate of behavioural syndromes, or ""animal personalities"". Associations between pigmentation, physiology and health status are less investigated as potentially conserved trait clusters. In the current study, lice counts performed on farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar naturally infected with ectoparasitic sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis showed that individual fish with high incidence of black melanin-based skin spots harboured fewer female sea lice carrying egg sacs, compared to less pigmented fish. There was no significant association between pigmentation and lice at other developmental stages, suggesting that host factors associated with melanin-based pigmentation may modify ectoparasite development to a larger degree than settlement. In a subsequent laboratory experiment a strong negative correlation between skin spots and post-stress cortisol levels was revealed, with less pigmented individuals showing a more pronounced cortisol response to acute stress. The observation that lice prevalence was strongly increased on a fraction of sexually mature male salmon which occurred among the farmed fish further supports a role for steroid hormones as mediators of reduced parasite resistance. The data presented here propose steroid hormones as a proximate cause for the association between melanin-based pigmentation and parasites. Possible fundamental and applied implications are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2036557521,"Hyaluronan (HA) and versican are key components of the dermis and are responsive to ultraviolet (UV)B-induced remodeling. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of estrogen (E2) on HA-rich extracellular matrix during photoaging. Hairless skh-1 mice were irradiated with UVB (three times, 1 minimal erythema dose (80 mJ/cm2), weekly) for 10 weeks, and endogenous sex hormone production was abrogated by ovariectomy. Subcutaneous substitution of E2 by means of controlled-release pellets caused a strong increase in the dermal HA content in both irradiated and nonirradiated skin. The increase in dermal HA correlated with induction of HA synthase HAS3 by E2. Expression of splice variant 2 of the HA-binding proteoglycan versican was also increased by E2. In search of candidate mediators of these effects, it was found that E2 strongly induced the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in UVB-irradiated epidermis in vivo and in keratinocytes in vitro. EGF in turn up-regulated the expression of HAS3 and versican V2 in dermal fibroblasts. HAS3 knockdown by shRNA caused inhibition of fibroblast proliferation. Furthermore, HAS3 and versican V2 induction by E2 correlated positively with proliferation in vivo. In addition, the accumulation of inflammatory macrophages, expression of inducible cyclooxygenase 2, as well as proinflammatory monocyte chemotactic protein 1 were decreased in response to E2 in the dermis. Collectively, these data suggest that E2 treatment increases the amount of dermal HA and versican V2 via paracrine release of EGF, which may be implicated in the pro-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of E2 during photoaging.

Photoaging of the skin inevitably occurs at sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, and hands. This process is characterized by intrinsic and extrinsic aging responses and by an overlap with photo-carcinogenesis under certain circumstances (1Fisher G.J. Datta S.C. Talwar H.S. Wang Z.Q.

In particular, the cleavage of collagen by matrix metalloproteinases has been demonstrated (2Brennan M. Bhatti H. Nerusu K.C. Bhagavathula N. Kang S. Fisher G.J. Varani J. Voorhees J.J. Matrix metalloproteinase-1 is the major collagenolytic enzyme responsible for collagen damage in UV-irradiated human skin.Photochem. Photobiol. 2003; 78: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The partially degraded collagen network heals imperfectly through de novo collagen synthesis, leaving microscars in the skin. Collagen fragments that are released as a result of matrix metalloproteinase-induced collagen cleavage are bioactive and participate in the regulation of fibroblast phenotype during photoaging. Moreover, collagen fragments reduce de novo synthesis of dermal collagen (3Varani J. Spearman D. Perone P. Fligiel S.E. Datta S.C. Wang Z.Q. Shao Y. Kang S. Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J.

Thus, matrix degradation and altered matrix expression influence fibroblast phenotypes and may thereby perpetuate UVB-induced aging responses.

Mammalian hyaluronan synthases.IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These enzymes extrude HA into the extracellular space after assembly of UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine into a growing chain of β(1–3)-linked d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine disaccharides. The repeating disaccharides are linked by hexosaminidic β(1–4) bonds that form high molecular weight HA of up to 107 Da and up to 20 μm in length (11Toole B.P. Hyaluronan.

HAS isoenzymes are expressed at a relatively low copy number per cell but can rapidly produce large amounts of HA. In addition to transcriptional regulation of HAS enzymes, it has recently been shown that regulation also takes place at the post-transcriptional level through phosphorylation, glycosylation, and mono-ubiquitination (12Bourguignon L.Y.

However, a limited number of studies have also demonstrated either no change or increased dermal HA in response to UVB (15Averbeck M. Gebhardt C.A. Voigt S. Beilharz S. Anderegg U. Termeer C.C.

Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 158-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The latter is likely an acute response associated with heliodermatitis. Hyaluronan is bound by versican, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, through specific binding domains termed link modules that each consist of ∼100 amino acids and are part of the link protein domain. The link protein domain is composed of an immunoglobulin domain and two link modules and is present in the N-terminal globular G1 domain of versican (19Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. Hyaluronan-binding proteins. Tying up the giant.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Because multiple versican molecules bind to one chain of HA, large networks of HA and versican are formed. These HA and versican-rich matrices are known to critically govern the proliferative and migratory phenotype of mesenchymal cells (20Evanko S.P. Angello J.C. Wight T.N. Formation of hyaluronan- and versican-rich pericellular matrix is required for proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that versican accumulates in response to UVB irradiation (7Knott A. Reuschlein K. Lucius R. Stäb F. Wenck H. Gallinat S. Deregulation of versican- and elastin-binding protein in solar elastosis.Biogerontology. 2009; 10: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, little is known about what the specific functions of versican might be during skin aging, how versican is regulated during skin aging, and specifically whether versican is responsive to estrogen. Skin aging is accelerated after menopause and positive effects on the skin including increased thickness, increased moisture, decreased wrinkling, and improved wound healing responses became obvious upon estrogen treatment of postmenopausal women (21Verdier-Sévrain S. Bonté F. Gilchrest B. Biology of estrogens in skin. Implications for skin aging.Exp. Dermatol. 2006; 15: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, hormone replacement therapy is confounded by thrombotic and malignant complications and is now restricted to short term use in selected cases (22Vickers M.R. MacLennan A.H. Lawton B. Ford D. Martin J. Meredith S.K. DeStavola B.L. Rose S. Dowell A. Wilkes H.C. Darbyshire J.H. Meade T.W. Main morbidities recorded in the women's international study of long duration estrogen after menopause (WISDOM). A randomized controlled trial of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.BMJ. 2007; 335: 239Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It is therefore of great interest to better understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the protection of the skin matrix by E2. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of E2 on the dermal hyaluronan and versican matrix during UVB-induced skin aging by use of ovariectomized and E2 treated hairless skh-1 mice. Female hairless mice (Skh:Hr1) (Charles River Laboratories) were housed according to standard procedures. Mice were randomly assigned to either sham procedure or bilateral ovariectomy (OVX, X) at the age of 8 weeks as described previously (23Oppermann M. Suvorava T. Freudenberger T. Dao V.T. Fischer J.W. Weber M. Kojda G. Regulation of vascular guanylyl cyclase by endothelial nitric oxide-dependent post-translational modification.Basic Res. Cardiol. 2011; 106: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). OVX mice were subdivided into four treatment groups, which received either placebo or E2 ± UVB irradiation. E2 treatment was performed by implantation of subcutaneous slow release hormone pellets (Innovative Research of America) prepared to dispense 1.1 μg/day E2 for the duration of the 10-week experimental period. Placebo (P) pellets served as control. After OVX and pellet implantation at 8 weeks, half of the mice were irradiated with UVB light and the other half served as nonirradiated controls. Sham-operated animals received placebo pellets ± UVB irradiation. Thus, six experimental groups (Fig. 1A) were compared in total as follows: 1) sham, placebo (S,P); 2) OVX, placebo (X,P); 3) OVX, E2 (X,E2); 4) sham, placebo, UVB (S,P UVB); 5) OVX, placebo, UVB (X,P UVB); and 6) OVX, E2, UVB (X,E2 UVB). Animals were exposed to UVB radiation in an irradiation chamber as described previously (8Dai G. Freudenberger T. Zipper P. Melchior A. Grether-Beck S. Rabausch B. de Groot J. Twarock S. Hanenberg H. Homey B. Krutmann J. Reifenberger J. Fischer J.W. Chronic ultraviolet B irradiation causes loss of hyaluronic acid from mouse dermis because of down-regulation of hyaluronic acid synthases.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 1451-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) using UV lamps with fluorescent bulbs (280–320 nm with a peak at 313 nm TL 20W/12; Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). UVB irradiation was performed three times per week at a dose of 80 mJ/cm2 (irradiation time 1 min 36 s) equaling one minimal erythema dose over a period of 10 weeks (Fig. 1A). The light intensity was determined by means of a UV meter (Waldmann, Villingen-Schwennigen, Germany). Skin biopsies from the dorsal skin of 1 × 1.5 cm2 in size were obtained from control and UVB-irradiated animals after 10 weeks. All animal experiments were approved by the local ethical committee for animal experiments. Skin biopsies were frozen in tissue freezing medium (Leica Nussloch, Bensheim, Germany) in liquid isopentane at −40 °C, and 12-μm cryosections were prepared for immunohistochemical staining. Affinity histochemistry of HA was performed with bovine HA-binding protein (bHABP, Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) and detected with biotin-labeled streptavidin (2 μg/ml, Calbiochem). The following primary antibodies were used: Versican (LF99, 1:400, rabbit anti-human, kindly provided by Dr. Larry Fisher, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda); HAS3 (H64, 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); MAC-2 (1:250, Cedarlane, Burlington, Canada); KI-67 (1:50, Novus Biological, Littleton, CO), and COX2 (1:1000, Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI). The respective biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:1000) were obtained from Calbiochem. Detection was performed using 3,3′ diaminobenzidine (Zytomed, Berlin, Germany) as a chromogen. Nuclei were stained with hemalaun solution (Merck). Negative controls without the primary antibody were performed for every antigen. No staining was detectable in the papillary dermis of any of these control stainings (data not shown). Digital image analysis was performed using a modified approach based on Dai et al. (8Dai G. Freudenberger T. Zipper P. Melchior A. Grether-Beck S. Rabausch B. de Groot J. Twarock S. Hanenberg H. Homey B. Krutmann J. Reifenberger J. Fischer J.W.

Pathol. 2007; 171: 1451-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Bright field images (8-bit) of the stained sections were captured using a Leica DM2000 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at ×100 magnification. For the quantification of the staining intensity, ImageJ software 1.41 Version (National Institutes of Health) was used according to instructions of ImageJ. The color deconvolution plug-in was employed to separate the color channels of hemalaun and DAB. Negative controls and strongly DAB-positive images were used to determine the thresholds and the analyzed range of signals. This procedure minimized the background interference and maximized the signal of DAB-positive tissue. Thresholds were set for the complete analysis of one antigen. The area fraction is defined as percentage of the area classified as DAB-positive. The measurement was performed in the papillary dermis excluding regions that contained hair follicles. Per skin section data from three randomly selected areas were averaged. Human dermal fibroblasts from female donors were purchased from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany), maintained in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without phenol red (Sigma), and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated, charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin-G). Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were purchased from PromoCell and cultured in keratinocyte media 2 (PromoCell). The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidified air. UVB irradiation of the cells was performed with a Bio-Sun irradiation system (Vilbert Lourmat, Munich, Germany) containing two 30-watt UVB sources (312 nm). During the UVB irradiation procedure (100 mJ/cm2; irradiation time ∼10 s), cells were kept in phosphate-buffered saline solution, which was replaced by DMEM containing 10% charcoal-treated FCS with or without 100 nm β-estradiol (Sigma) immediately after the irradiation. Cells were harvested 24 h after stimulation. For the cell media transfer experiments, NEHKs were UVB-irradiated and stimulated with E2 as described above in keratinocyte media 2. The supernatant was collected 24 h after stimulation and was transferred to fibroblasts in the presence or absence of erlotinib (3 μm) (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), EGF-neutralizing antibody, or IgG isotype control (both 0.35 μg/ml, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Fibroblasts were harvested 24 h after exposure to conditioned media. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy total RNA kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA concentration was determined via photometric measurement at absorbance 260/280. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the SuperscriptIII first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) (Invitrogen). Primers to analyze target mRNA expression levels were designed employing Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) based on published mRNA sequences. The sequences are given in Table 1. Real time RT-PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) as described (15Averbeck M. Gebhardt C.A. Voigt S. Beilharz S.

The 2−ΔΔC(T) method was used for comparison of the relative expression between control and treated cells. A melting curve analysis was performed after every run, and a negative control containing only master mix, the primer pair, and water was included on every plate.TABLE 1Primer sequences used for quantification of gene expressionGenePrimer sequenceHuman CD44f, 5′-GCTATTGAAAGCCTTGCAGAG-3′r, 5′-CGCAGATCGATTTGAATATAACC-3′Human COX2f, 5′-TGAGTGTGGGATTTGACCG-3′r, 5′-TGTGTTTGGAGTGGGTTTCA-3′Human EGFf, 5′-AGTTTTTCTGAATGGGTCAAGG-3′r, 5′-TCCAATTTATTGCCATTCCAG-3′Human GAPDHf, 5′-GTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3′r, 5′-TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTC-3′Human HAS1f, 5′-TACAACCAGAAGTTCCTGGG-3′r, 5′-CTGGAGGTGTACTTGGTAGC-3′Human HAS2f, 5′-GTGGATTATGTACAGGTTTGTGA-3′r, 5′-TCCAACCATGGGATCTTCTT-3′Human HAS3v1f, 5′-GAGATGTCCAGATCCTCAACAA-3′r, 5′-CCCACTAATACACTGCACAC-3′Human HYAL1f, 5′-CCAAGGAATCATGTCAGGCCATCAA-3′r, 5′-CCCACTGGTCACGTTCAGG-3′Human HYAL2f, 5′-GGCTTAGTGAGATGGACCTC-3′r, 5′-CCGTGTCAGGTAATCTTTGAG-3′Human RHAMMf, 5′-GAATATGAGAGCTCTAAGCCTG-3′r, 5′-CCATCATACTCCTCATCTTTGTC-3′Human pan-VERSICANf, 5′-AGACTGTCAGATATCCCATCC-3′r, 5′-AATCCATAAGTCCTGACTCCT-3′Human VERSICAN V1f, 5′-CGTCGAATGAGTGATTTGAG-3′r, 5′-TTTCAGCCATTAGATCATGCAC-3′Human VERSICAN V2f, 5′-AAGACAGGACCTGATCGCT-3′r, 5′-AGTGGCTCCATTACGACAGG-3′Human VERSICAN V3f, 5′-ACGACCTGATCGCTGCAA-3′r, 5′-CAAGTGGCTCCATTACGACA-3′Human VERSICAN Vof, 5′-ACCAGGACCTGATCGCTGCAA-3′r, 5′-GTTCATTTTGCAGCGATCAG-3′Murine Cd44f, 5′-CAAGTTTTGGTGGCACACAG-3′r, 5′-CTGTAGCGGCCATTTTTCTC-3′Murine Cox2f, 5′-CCGGACTGGATTCTATGGTG-3′r, 5′-CCTTGAAGTGGGTCAGGATG-3′Murine Egff, 5′-GCCACGCTTACATTCATTCC-3′r, 5′-ATCGCCTTGCTTTTCAACAC-3′Murine E2Rαf, 5′-AGCTGCTCCTCCACTTGGT-3′r, 5′-GGCGTCGATTGTCAGAATTAG-3′Murine E2Rβf, 5′-TACGGTGTCTGGTCCTGTGA-3′r, 5′-TACACTGATTCGTGGCTGGA-3′Murine Gapdhf, 5′-TGGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTGCC-3′r, 5′-AAGATGGTGATGGGCTTCCCG-3′Murine Has1f, 5′-TATGCTACCAAGTATACCTCG-3′r, 5′-TCTCGGAAGTAAGATTTGGAC-3′Murine Has2f, 5′-CGGTCGTCTCAAATTCATCTG-3′r, 5′-ACAATGCATCTTGTTCAGCTC-3′Murine Has3f, 5′-GATGTCCAAATCCTCAACAAG-3′r, 5′-CCCACTAATACATTGCACAC-3′Murine Hyal1f, 5′-AAGTACCAAGGAATCATGCC-3′r, 5′-CTCAGGATAACTTGGATGGC-3′Murine Hyal2f, 5′-GGTGGACCTTATCTCTACCAT-3′r, 5′-TATTGGCAGGTCTCCATACTT-3′Murine Il6f, 5′-GATGGATGCTACCAAACTGGA-3′r, 5′-GGTACTCCAGAAGACCAGAGGA-3′Murine Ki-67f, 5′-CCAGCTGTCCTCAAGACAATC-3′r, 5′-CACTGGAAGTCCTGCCTGAT-3′Murine Mac-2f, 5′-TGAGAGTGGCAAACCATTCA-3′r, 5′-GTCACCACTGATCCCCAGTT-3′Murine Mcp-1 (CcL2)f, 5′-CCCAATGAGTAGGCTGGAGA-3′r, 5′-TCTGGACCCATTCCTTCTTG-3′Murine Rhammf, 5′-GCCACTCAGAAGGACCTCAC-3′r, 5′-TGCACAGCTAATTTCTTGGATG-3′Murine Tgfβ1f, 5′-CTAATGGTGGACCGCAACA-3′r, 5′-ACTGCTTCCCGAATGTCTGA-3′Murine Tgfβ2f, 5′-CGAGGAGTACTACGCCAAGG-3′r, 5′-GTAGAAAGTGGGCGGGATG-3′Murine Tgfβ3f, 5′-TTCGACATGATCCAGGGACT-3′r, 5′-TCTCCACTGAGGACACATTGA-3′Murine Tnfαf, 5′-CGAGTGACAAGCCTGTAGCC-3′r, 5′-AGCTGCTCCTCCACTTGGT-3′Murine Tpx2f, 5′-TCCCTGGATGCTAAGAGAGC-3′r, 5′-TTTCAACAGAGGCAACATGG-3′Murine pan-Versicanf, 5′-ACCATGTCACTGGCTGTGG-3′r, 5′-AGCGGCAAAGTTCAGAGTGT-3′Murine Versican V1f, 5′-GCCTACTGCTTTAAACGTCGA-3′r, 5′-GCAAACAGATCATGCAGTGG-3′Murine Versican V2f, 5′-ACAGGACCTGATCTCTGCAAAA-3′r, 5′-CCATTCCGACAAGGGTTAGA-3′Murine Versican V3f, 5′-ACGACCTGATCTCTGCAA-3′r, 5′-CCATTCCGACAAGGGTTAGA-3′Murine Versican Vof, 5′-AAGACAGGTCGATTGAGTGATAT-3′r, 5′-GCAAACAGATCATGCAGTGG-3′ Open table in a new tab HAS3 knockdown was achieved by usage of the MISSIONTM lentiviral shRNA knockdown system (Sigma) as described previously (24Twarock S.

A scrambled shRNA served as control, and the anti-HAS3 hairpin sequence was 5′-CGGGCTCTACAACTCTCTGTGGTTCTCGAGAACCACAGAGAGTTGTAGAGCTTTTTG-3′.FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used for the transfer into the packaging cell line HEK293T (ATCC, Wesel, Germany). For better stability of the produced lentiviral particles, the medium was changed to Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium after 16 h. The lentiviruses were harvested 24 h later and concentrated by centrifugation with poly-l-lysine as reported previously (25Zhang B. Xia H.Q. Cleghorn G. Gobe G. West M. Wei M.Q. A highly efficient and consistent method for harvesting large volumes of high titer lentiviral vectors.Gene Ther. 2001; 8: 1745-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were transfected with a multiplicity of infection of 5 and kept in normal growth medium for at least 5 days before stimulation with conditioned keratinocyte medium. Before using the cells in proliferation assays, the efficacy of the lentiviral HAS3 knockdown was verified by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown) and Western blot analysis (anti-HAS3, 1:1000, Sigma) (supplemental Fig. 1). HA concentration in the supernatants was determined using an HA test kit based on bHABP (Corgenix, Peterborough, UK) 24 h after stimulation and was normalized to total cellular protein. The EGF concentration in the supernatants was determined by EGF human ELISA kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol 24 h after stimulation. In equal aliquots of cell culture supernatants or skin extracts, versican was first enriched by DEAE ion exchange chromatography and was chondroitin ABC lyase-digested, and subsequently core proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and Western blotted as described previously (26Chang M.Y.

HAS3 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-HAS3 antibody (H64, 1:1000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for murine samples and anti-HAS3 antibody (1:1000 Sigma) for human samples. β-Tubulin antibody was from Sigma (1:1000, Munich). MAC-2 was from Cedarlane (1:250, Burlington, Canada), and COX2 was from Cayman (1:1000, Ann Arbor, MI). Primary antibodies were detected by infrared fluorescent-coupled secondary antibodies (1:5000 LI-COR, Bad Homburg, Germany) allowing fluorescent detection using the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. For HA extraction from murine skin, biopsies were lyophilized; the dry weight was determined, and samples were digested by Pronase (protease from Streptomyces griseus, 6 mg/ml in 100 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 1500 units/ml heparin, 60 °C, 24 h; Sigma). HA was subsequently ethanol-precipitated (12 h, −20 °C) and recovered by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min).

https://openalex.org/W2061058669,"Phagocytosis is a pivotal process by which macrophages eliminate microorganisms upon recognition by pathogen sensors. Surprisingly, the self-ligand cell surface receptor Slamf1 functions not only as a co-stimulatory molecule but also as a microbial sensor of several Gram-negative bacteria. Upon entering the phagosome of macrophages Slamf1 induces production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, which positively regulates the activity of the NOX2 enzyme and phagolysosomal maturation. Here, we report that in Escherichia coli-containing phagosomes of mouse macrophages, Slamf1 interacts with the class III PI3K Vps34 in a complex with Beclin-1 and UVRAG. Upon phagocytosis of bacteria the NOX2 activity was reduced in macrophages isolated from Beclin-1(+/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. This Slamf1/Beclin-1/Vps34/UVRAG protein complex is formed in intracellular membrane compartments as it is found without inducing phagocytosis in macrophages, human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, and transfectant HEK293 cells. Elimination of its cytoplasmic tail abolished the interaction of Slamf1 with the complex, but deletion or mutation of the two ITAM motifs did not. Both the BD and CCD domains of Beclin-1 were required for efficient binding to Slamf1. Because Slamf1 did not interact with Atg14L or Rubicon, which can also form a complex with Vps34 and Beclin-1, we conclude that Slamf1 recruits a subset of Vps34-associated proteins, which is involved in membrane fusion and NOX2 regulation."

Even if activation of NMDA receptors in the striatum has important implications for synaptic plasticity and disease states, the contribution of specific NMDA receptor subunits still remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that treatment of corticostriatal slices with NR2A antagonist NVP-AAM077 or with NR2A blocking peptide induces a significant increase of spine head width. Sustained treatment with D1 receptor agonist (SKF38393) leads to a significant decrease of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors and to a concomitant increase of spine head width. Interestingly, co-treatment of corticostriatal slices with NR2A antagonist (NVP-AAM077) and D1 receptor agonist augmented the increase of dendritic spine head width as obtained with SKF38393. Conversely, NR2B antagonist (ifenprodil) blocked any morphological effect induced by D1 activation.

It has been demonstrated clearly that all MSNs express both NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor (12.Albers D.S. Weiss S.W. Iadarola M.J. Standaert D.G.

In particular, some studies demonstrated the presence of heterotrimeric NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptor assemblies (13.Li L. Murphy T.H. Hayden M.R. Raymond L.A.

Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, heterotrimeric NR1/NR2A/NR2B assemblies predominate at striatal MSN synapses (15.Dunah A.W. Standaert D.G. Subcellular segregation of distinct heteromeric NMDA glutamate receptors in the striatum.J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Notably, NMDA receptors in corticostriatal synapse show a peculiar behavior as it has been proposed that NR2A containing but not NR2B containing NMDA receptors regulates the homeostasis of corticostriatal transmission (16.Schotanus S.M. Chergui K. NR2A-containing NMDA receptors depress glutamatergic synaptic transmission and evoked dopamine release in the mouse striatum.J.

Dopamine D1 receptor-dependent trafficking of striatal NMDA glutamate receptors to the postsynaptic membrane.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5546-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent reports have suggested that NR2A and NR2B subunits differentially sculpt glutamatergic inputs in striatal MSNs (10.Jocoy E.L. André V.M. Cummings D.M. Rao S.P. Wu N. Ramsey A.J.

In this context, even if it is known that alterations of NMDA receptor composition at the corticostriatal synapse contribute to the clinical features of disease states, i.e. PD and Huntington disease (18.Gardoni F.

Here, we show that modulation of the levels of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors at synaptic sites is per se sufficient to induce a significant alteration of dendritic spine morphology at MSN levels. Treatment with NR2A antagonist or with NR2A blocking peptide induces morphological modifications of dendritic spines as induced by D1 receptor activation. The following antibodies (Ab) were used: mAb anti-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich; polyclonal Ab anti-D1 from Abcam; polyclonal Ab anti-NR2B and mAb anti-NR2A from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; polyclonal Ab anti-GluR1 and mAb anti-GluR2 from Millipore; mAb anti-PSD-95 from Neuromab, mAb NR1 from Invitrogen. NVP-AAM0077 was provided kindly by Novartis. AP-5, CNQX, ifenprodil hemitartrate, and picrotoxin were provided by Tocris Cookson. Cell-permeable peptides were obtained linking the 11 amino acids (YGRKKRRQRRR) human immunodeficiency virus TAT transporter sequence to the last C-terminal nine amino acids of NR2A (TAT2A) or to the last nine amino acids of NR2B (TAT2B) (21.Aarts M.

TAT2A(-SDV) or TAT2B(-SDV) inactive peptides (lacking the last C-terminal three amino acids of NR2A or NR2B) were used as negative controls. All peptides were synthesized by Xigen Pharma. For in vitro electrophysiological recordings, drugs were applied by diluting them in Kreb's solution to the final concentration and by switching the perfusion from control to drug-containing solution. Adult (8-week-old) male Wistar rats were decapitated, and brains were removed quickly from the skulls. Consecutive series of corticostriatal slices were cut at 270-μm thickness using a vibratome. Slices were then placed into custom-made chambers filled with Kreb's buffer (124 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm NaHCO3, and 10.0 mm glucose) equilibrated continuously with O2 (95%) and CO2 (5%). After the preincubation period (1 h), slices were treated with the different compounds (45 min) as indicated under “Results.” Control series of slices were maintained in the vehicle alone. Striatal areas were carefully isolated and collected on dry ice for further processing. For in vivo experiments, adult (8-week-old) male Wistar rats were injected (i.p.) with SKF38393 (2 mg/ml/kg) in the presence or absence of NVP-AAM077 (2 mg/kg) or ifenprodil (20 mg/kg), or vehicle only. 45 min later, animals were sacrificed, and whole striata were collected and snap-frozen on dry ice immediately. Samples were kept deep-frozen until further processing. All experiments were carried out according to the guidelines on the ethical use of animals from the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC). A Triton-insoluble postsynaptic fraction (TIF) was purified from striatal tissue using a previously validated biochemical fractionating method (22.Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Malinverno M. Polli F.

Briefly, whole striatal tissue was homogenized in 0.32 m ice-cold sucrose, containing 1 mm Hepes, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaHCO3, 0.1 mm PMSF at pH 7.4 in presence of a complete set of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Diagnostics) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). The homogenized tissue was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min to obtain a crude membrane fraction (P2 fraction). The pellet was resuspended in 1 mm Hepes + CompleteTM in a glass-glass Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet (P3) was resuspended in buffer containing 75 mm KCl and 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final pellet (P4) was homogenized in a glass-glass Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder in 20 mm Hepes. Then, an equal volume of glycerol was added and this fraction, referred to as the TIF, was stored at −80 °C until processing. TIF fraction was used instead of the classical postsynaptic density (PSD) because of the limited amount of starting material. Protein composition of this preparation was tested for the absence of presynaptic synaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin and the high enrichment in the PSD proteins (23.Gardoni F. Bellone C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Protein kinase C activation modulates α-calmodulin kinase II binding to NR2A subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex.J. Biol.

Cross-linking experiments by means of the membrane-impermeable reagent bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate (BS3) were performed as described previously (24.Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation drives synapse-associated protein 97 into spines.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to evaluate the AMPA and NMDA receptor subunit intracellular pool. Free-floating sections were shaken gently in the presence or absence of BS3 solution (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Excess of BS3 were removed by repeated washes in presence of ethanolamine; striatal areas were separated from cortex and homogenized in a glass-glass Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. The AMPA and NMDA subunit surface pool was not detectable following treatment of slices with BS3 because of the formation of high-molecular weight aggregates that did not enter the gel. 50 μg of homogenate was incubated in a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS with antibody against D1 receptor overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added, and incubation was continued for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min and washed three times before adding sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and boiling for 5 min. Beads were collected by centrifugation, and all supernatants were applied onto 6% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting analysis was performed as described before with minor modifications (22.Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Malinverno M. Polli F. Costa C. Tozzi A. Siliquini S. Picconi B. Cattabeni F. Calabresi P. Di Luca M. Decreased NR2B subunit synaptic levels cause impaired long term potentiation but not long term depression.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Samples (10 μg) were applied to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted. For each homogenate and TIF preparation, three independent Western blotting experiments were run. Quantification of Western blot analysis was performed by means of computer-assisted imaging (ImageJ) after normalization on tubulin levels. drd1-EGFP and drd2-EGFP bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB containing 0.2% picric acid and 0.02% glutaraldehyde. Brains were removed from the skulls and were postfixed overnight at 4 °C in the same fixative omitting glutaraldahyde. Sections were cut with a vibratome in the sagittal plane at a 40-μm thickness. Free-floating sections were then washed in PBS several times, pretreated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and incubated in 4% horse serum/1% BSA for 1.5 h. Primary antibodies (NR2A and NR2B, 1:500; GFP, 1:1000) were applied overnight at 4C, diluted in 4% horse serum/PBS. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rat, Alexa Fluor goat anti-rabbit 633; Invitrogen, 1:2000) were applied for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreacted sections were mounted and coverslipped. Acquisition of fluorescent images were performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Combination of immunohistochemistry with diolistic labeling was performed as described previously with minor modifications (25.Neely M.D. Stanwood G.D. Deutch A.Y. Combination of diOlistic labeling with retrograde tract tracing and immunohistochemistry.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 184: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Direct pathway MSNs were immunohistochemically identified as “substance P-positive” (SP+). Briefly, animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 0.1 m PB followed by 1.5% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB. Brains were sectioned with a vibratome in the coronal plane at 40-μm thickness. Sections containing striatal areas were selected for diolistic labeling. Tungsten particles and tubes were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. DiI-coated particles were delivered onto corticostriatal slices with a handheld gene gun (Helios, Bio-Rad) at a pressure of 1.6–1.8 psi. DiI-labeled sections were stored in 0.04% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. On the next day, permeabilization (0.05% Triton X-100 for 15 min) and blocking step (5% normal horse serum) were followed by incubation with anti-substance P primary antibody (Millipore, 1:300) for 36 h at 4 °C. Secondary Ab (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:500) were used overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then mounted, covered in Permafluor (Sigma-Aldrich), and analyzed on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser confocal microscope. Confocal z-stacks of double-stained MSN neurons were acquired with a 63× objective at 0.5-μm intervals, and a projection image was rendered. At least 10 z-stack images were acquired for each animal and for each area of interest. Analysis of dendritic spine morphology was performed with ImageJ software; for each dendritic spine, length and head width were measured, which have been used to classify dendritic spines into categories (26.Bourne J.N. Harris K.M. Balancing structure and function at hippocampal dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In particular, protrusions having the length longer than 3 μm were considered filopodia, and the others were considered spines. Coronal corticostriatal brain slices (240–270-μm thickness) were transferred to a submerged recording chamber, perfused (2–3 ml/min) with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid, and visualized with 20× and 40× water immersion objectives (Nikon) using standard infrared and differential interference contrast microscopy. Whole-cell recordings were performed using 1.5-mm external diameter borosilicate pipettes. For the voltage-clamp recordings, electrodes (3.5–5 megohms) were filled with a solution containing the following: 120 mm CsMeSO3, 15 mm CsCl, 8 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 0.3 mm Na-GTP, 10 mm tetraethylammonium, and 5 mm QX-314, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. Neurons were voltage clamped at −70 mV and +40 mV to record, respectively, AMPA receptor- and NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed 100–300 μm rostral to the recording electrode and used to stimulate excitatory terminals at 0.1 Hz. NMDA EPSCs were pharmacologically isolated at +40 mV by the application of the AMPA antagonist CNQX (10 μm), whereas the NMDA receptor-NR2A component was obtained by applying ifenprodil 3–10 μm after a stable recording of the NMDA component. The NMDA/AMPA receptor ratio was calculated by dividing the peak NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs by the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs. Similarly, the NMDA-NR2A/AMPA receptor ratio was calculated by dividing NMDA-NR2A-mediated EPSCs by the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs. Recordings in whole-cell patch clamp were made using MultiClamp 700 B (Molecular Devices) and were acquired at 10 kHz using pClamp10 software (Axon Instrument) and a data acquisition unit (Digidata 1440A; Molecular Devices). Input resistances and injected currents were monitored throughout the experiments. Variations of these parameters >20% led to the rejection of the experiment. For spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, MSNs were clamped at the holding potential (Vh) of −70 mV. Data were acquired with pClamp (version 10.2); current was filtered at 0.1 kHz and digitized at 200 μs using Clampex (gap-free mode; version 10.2) and analyzed offline using the automatic detection and subsequently checked manually for accuracy. The threshold amplitude for the detection of an event (5 pA) was adjusted above root mean square noise level (2–3 pA at Vh = −70 mV). For the experiments on NMDA-isolated currents, neurons were clamped at +40 mV, incubated with picrotoxin and CNQX until a stable recording was obtained and SKF38393 was bath-applied for 45 min. Corticostriatal slices were incubated with selective antagonists of NR2A-containing versus NR2B-containing NMDA receptors (respectively, NVP-AAM077 and ifenprodil). As shown in Fig. 1A, application of NR2A antagonist (NVP-AAM077; 300 nm; 45 min), progressively and significantly reduced the amplitude of the NMDA-isolated currents to 36.42 ± 5.1% of the control (n = 4; **, p < 0.01). Similarly, treatment of the corticostriatal slices with ifenprodil (10 μm; 45 min), a known antagonist of the NR2B subunit, reduced the amplitude of the NMDA evoked current to 41.51 ± 6.49% of control (n = 6; ***, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). Treatment either with NVP-AAM077 or with ifenprodil did not induce any modification of NR2A or NR2B subunit levels in a TIF (n = 4; p > 0.05; Fig. 1B). Furthermore, no alteration of D1 receptor localization in the postsynaptic compartment was observed following treatment with NVP-AAM077 or ifenprodil (Fig. 1C; n = 4; p > 0.05). As shown in Fig. 1E, no significant change in dendritic spine head width was observed after treatment with ifenprodil (p > 0.05, ifenprodil versus control). Conversely, statistical analysis revealed a significant increase in spine head width after treatment with NVP-AAM077 (**, p < 0.005, NVP-AAM007 versus control; Fig. 1D). No changes in the mean spine density were found after treatment with ifenprodil or NVP-AAM077 (data not shown). It is well established that interactions of NR2A and NR2B subunits C-terminal regions with PDZ domains of PSD-MAGUK proteins play an important role in the regulation of NMDA receptors localization at synaptic sites (22.Gardoni F.

Previous reports showed that cell-permeable peptides, corresponding to the last nine amino acids of the NR2A or NR2B protein fused to the TAT sequence (namely TAT2A or TA2B), reduce NR2A or NR2B binding to PSD-MAGUKs and induce a consequent decrease in the synaptic levels of NR2A- or NR2B-containing NMDA receptors (18.Gardoni F.

Corticostriatal slices were incubated with TAT2A or TAT2B peptides to test the role of NR2A or NR2B synaptic localization on dendritic spine morphology in MSNs. Treatment with TAT2A(-SDV) or TAT2B(-SDV) peptides (lacking the last C-terminal three amino acids of the two subunits) was performed as control. In agreement with previous data (19.Paillé V.

https://openalex.org/W1981068392,"The typical host response to infection of humans and some animals by M. tuberculosis is the accumulation of reactive oxygen species generating inflammatory cells into discrete granulomas, which frequently develop central caseous necrosis. In previous studies we showed that infection of immunologically naïve guinea pigs with M. tuberculosis leads to localized and systemic oxidative stress that results in a significant depletion of serum total antioxidant capacity and the accumulation of malondialdehyde, a bi-product of lipid peroxidation. Here we show that in addition, the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species in vivo resulted in the accumulation of oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDL) in pulmonary and extrapulmonary granulomas, serum and lung macrophages collected by bronchoalveolar lavage. Macrophages from immunologically naïve guinea pigs infected with M. tuberculosis also had increased surface expression of the type 1 scavenger receptors CD36 and LOX1, which facilitate the uptake of oxidized host macromolecules including OxLDL. Vaccination of guinea pigs with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) prior to aerosol challenge reduced the bacterial burden as well as the intracellular accumulation of OxLDL and the expression of macrophage CD36 and LOX1. In vitro loading of guinea pig lung macrophages with OxLDL resulted in enhanced replication of bacilli compared to macrophages loaded with non-oxidized LDL. Overall, this study provides additional evidence of oxidative stress in M. tuberculosis infected guinea pigs and the potential role OxLDL laden macrophages have in supporting intracellular bacilli survival and persistence."

Employing an EGFR knock-out mice model, we further investigated the role of the ErbB family of receptors in mechanotranduction during lung development. Deletion of EGFR prevented endogenous and mechanical stretch-induced type II cell differentiation via the ERK pathway, which was rescued by overexpression of a constitutively active MEK. Interestingly, the expression of ErbB4, the only ErbB receptor that EGFR co-precipitates in wild-type cells, was decreased in EGFR-deficient type II cells. Similar to EGFR, ErbB4 was activated by stretch and participated in ERK phosphorylation and type II cell differentiation. However, neuregulin (NRG) or stretch-induced ErbB4 activation were blunted in EGFR-deficient cells and not rescued after ErbB4 overexpression, suggesting that induction of ErbB4 phosphorylation is EGFR-dependent. Finally, we addressed how shedding of ligands is regulated by EGFR. In knock-out cells, TGF-α, a ligand for EGFR, was not released by stretch, while HB-EGF, a ligand for EGFR and ErbB4, was shed by stretch although to a lower magnitude than in normal cells. Release of these ligands was inhibited by blocking EGFR and ERK pathway. In conclusion, our studies show that EGFR and ErbB4 regulate stretch-induced type II cell differentiation via ERK pathway. Interactions between these two receptors are important for mechanical signals in lung fetal type II cells. These studies provide novel insights into the cell signaling mechanisms regulating ErbB family receptors in lung cell differentiation.

Release of these ligands was inhibited by blocking EGFR and ERK pathway. In conclusion, our studies show that EGFR and ErbB4 regulate stretch-induced type II cell differentiation via ERK pathway. Interactions between these two receptors are important for mechanical signals in lung fetal type II cells. These studies provide novel insights into the cell signaling mechanisms regulating ErbB family receptors in lung cell differentiation."

Cisplatin is an anti-neoplastic agent that damages the inner ear through reactive oxygen species and by the formation of DNA adducts. This study reveals a correlation between cisplatin-mediated hearing loss and nitroxidative modification of cochlear proteins and is the first to report nitration of Lmo4. Cisplatin induced a dose-dependent increase in hearing loss in Wistar rats. A 10-15-dB decrease in distortion product amplitude and massive loss of outer hair cells at the basal turn of the cochlea was observed 3 days post-treatment after a 16 mg/kg dose. Cisplatin induced nitration of cellular proteins within the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion, and stria vascularis, which are known targets of cisplatin ototoxicity. Nitration of a 76-kDa cochlear protein correlated with cisplatin dose. The nitrated protein was identified as Lmo4 (LIM domain only 4) by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight) mass spectrometry and confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Co-localization of nitrotyrosine and Lmo4 was particularly high in outer hair cell nuclei after cisplatin treatment. Cochlear levels of Lmo4 were decreased in rats treated with cisplatin. In vitro studies supported the repression of Lmo4 in nitroxidative conditions and the induction of apoptosis upon repression of Lmo4. Inhibition of cochlear protein nitration prevented cisplatin-induced hearing loss. As Lmo4 is a transcriptional regulator that controls the choice between cell survival and cell death, these results support the hypothesis that nitration of Lmo4 influences cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.

https://openalex.org/W2069229451,"Histone H2A variants generate diversity in chromatin structure and functions, as nucleosomes containing variant H2A histones have altered physical, chemical, and biological properties. H2A.Z is an evolutionarily ancient and highly conserved H2A variant that regulates processes ranging from gene expression to the DNA damage response. Here we find that the unstructured portion of the C-terminal tail of H2A.Z is required for the normal functions of this histone variant in budding yeast. We have also identified a novel splice isoform of the human H2A.Z-2 gene that encodes a C-terminally truncated H2A.Z protein that is similar to the truncation mutants we identified in yeast. The short forms of H2A.Z in both yeast and human cells are more loosely associated with chromatin than the full-length proteins, indicating a conserved function for the H2A.Z C-terminal tail in regulating the association of H2A.Z with nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1991087698,"Maternal exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) causes the impairment of reproduction and development in the pups. Our previous studies have revealed that maternal treatment with TCDD attenuates the fetal production of pituitary gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone) at gestational day (GD) 20, leading to the impairment of sexual behavior in adulthood. However, the mechanism underlying such a reduction has remained unknown until now. When pregnant rats at GD15 were given an oral dose of TCDD (1 μg/kg), the testicular expression of steroidogenic proteins was reduced between GD20 and postnatal days (PND) 2. In accordance with this, the pituitary expression of gonadotropin β-subunit and serum gonadotropin were also attenuated from GD20 to PND0 in a pup-specific fashion. To identify the target genes linked to a fetal reduction in gonadotropin β-subunit, we performed a DNA microarray analysis using the fetal pituitary and its regulatory organ, the hypothalamus. The results obtained showed that TCDD induced histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the fetal pituitary. In support with this, TCDD markedly deacetylated histones H3 and H4 twined around the promoter of the fetal LHβ gene. This effect was fetus- and LHβ-specific, and this was not observed in the maternal pituitary or for other pituitary hormone genes. Finally, an LHβ reduction caused by TCDD was completely restored by maternal co-treatment with valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor. These results strongly suggest that the increased deacetylation of histone owing to HDAC induction plays a critical role in the TCDD-induced reduction in LHβ in the fetal pituitary."
https://openalex.org/W1584326903,"Obese white adipose tissue is hypoxic but is incapable of inducing compensatory angiogenesis. Brown adipose tissue is highly vascularized, facilitating delivery of nutrients to brown adipocytes for heat production. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which white and brown adipocytes respond to hypoxia. Brown adipocytes produced lower amounts of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) than white adipocytes in response to low O(2) but induced higher levels of hypoxia-associated genes. The response of white adipocytes to hypoxia required HIF-1α, but its presence alone was incapable of inducing target gene expression under normoxic conditions. In addition to the HIF-1α targets, hypoxia also induced many inflammatory genes. Exposure of white adipocytes to a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligand (troglitazone) attenuated induction of these genes but enhanced expression of the HIF-1α targets. Knockdown of PPARγ in mature white adipocytes prevented the usual robust induction of HIF-1α targets in response to hypoxia. Similarly, knockdown of PPARγ coactivator (PGC) 1β in PGC-1α-deficient brown adipocytes eliminated their response to hypoxia. These data demonstrate that the response of white adipocytes requires HIF-1α but also depends on PPARγ in white cells and the PPARγ cofactors PGC-1α and PGC-1β in brown cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048561073,"Explosive blast results in multiple organ injury and polytrauma, the intensity of which varies with the nature of the exposure, orientation, environment and individual resilience. Blast overpressure alone may not precisely indicate the level of body or brain injury after blast exposure. Assessment of the extent of body injury after blast exposure is important, since polytrauma and systemic factors significantly contribute to blast-induced traumatic brain injury. We evaluated the activity of plasma enzymes including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) at different time points after blast exposure using a mouse model of single and repeated blast exposures to assess the severity of injury. Our data show that activities of all the enzymes in the plasma were significantly increased as early as 1 h after blast exposure. The elevated enzyme activity remained up to 6 h in an overpressure dose-dependent manner and returned close to normal levels at 24 h. Head-only blast exposure with body protection showed no increase in the enzyme activities suggesting that brain injury alone does not contribute to the systemic increase. In contrast to plasma increase, AST, ALT and LDH activity in the liver and CK in the skeletal muscle showed drastic decrease at 6 h after blast exposures. Histopathology showed mild necrosis at 6 h and severe necrosis at 24 h after blast exposures in liver and no changes in the skeletal muscle suggesting that the enzyme release from the tissue to plasma is probably triggered by transient cell membrane disruption from shockwave and not due to necrosis. Overpressure dependent transient release of tissue enzymes and elevation in the plasma after blast exposure suggest that elevated enzyme activities in the blood can be potentially used as a biological dosimeter to assess the severity of blast injury."
https://openalex.org/W2000694260,"Associative learning relies on event timing. Fruit flies for example, once trained with an odour that precedes electric shock, subsequently avoid this odour (punishment learning); if, on the other hand the odour follows the shock during training, it is approached later on (relief learning). During training, an odour-induced Ca++ signal and a shock-induced dopaminergic signal converge in the Kenyon cells, synergistically activating a Ca++-calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase, which likely leads to the synaptic plasticity underlying the conditioned avoidance of the odour. In Aplysia, the effect of serotonin on the corresponding adenylate cyclase is bi-directionally modulated by Ca++, depending on the relative timing of the two inputs. Using a computational approach, we quantitatively explore this biochemical property of the adenylate cyclase and show that it can generate the effect of event timing on associative learning. We overcome the shortage of behavioural data in Aplysia and biochemical data in Drosophila by combining findings from both systems."
https://openalex.org/W2065777971,"Escherichia coli O104:H4 was identified as an emerging pathogen during the spring and summer of 2011 and was responsible for a widespread outbreak that resulted in the deaths of 50 people and sickened over 4075. Traditional phenotypic and genotypic assays, such as serotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), permit identification and classification of bacterial pathogens, but cannot accurately resolve relationships among genotypically similar but pathotypically different isolates. To understand the evolutionary origins of E. coli O104:H4, we sequenced two strains isolated in Ontario, Canada. One was epidemiologically linked to the 2011 outbreak, and the second, unrelated isolate, was obtained in 2010. MLST analysis indicated that both isolates are of the same sequence type (ST678), but whole-genome sequencing revealed differences in chromosomal and plasmid content. Through comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of five O104:H4 ST678 genomes, we identified 167 genes in three gene clusters that have undergone homologous recombination with distantly related E. coli strains. These recombination events have resulted in unexpectedly high sequence diversity within the same sequence type. Failure to recognize or adjust for homologous recombination can result in phylogenetic incongruence. Understanding the extent of homologous recombination among different strains of the same sequence type may explain the pathotypic differences between the ON2010 and ON2011 strains and help shed new light on the emergence of this new pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2085536117,"Background There are few clinical tools that assess decision-making under risk. Tests that characterize sensitivity and bias in decisions between prospects varying in magnitude and probability of gain may provide insights in conditions with anomalous reward-related behaviour. Objective We designed a simple test of how subjects integrate information about the magnitude and the probability of reward, which can determine discriminative thresholds and choice bias in decisions under risk. Design/Methods Twenty subjects were required to choose between two explicitly described prospects, one with higher probability but lower magnitude of reward than the other, with the difference in expected value between the two prospects varying from 3 to 23%. Results Subjects showed a mean threshold sensitivity of 43% difference in expected value. Regarding choice bias, there was a ‘risk premium’ of 38%, indicating a tendency to choose higher probability over higher reward. An analysis using prospect theory showed that this risk premium is the predicted outcome of hypothesized non-linearities in the subjective perception of reward value and probability. Conclusions This simple test provides a robust measure of discriminative value thresholds and biases in decisions under risk. Prospect theory can also make predictions about decisions when subjective perception of reward or probability is anomalous, as may occur in populations with dopaminergic or striatal dysfunction, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2118716547,"Frugivorous and nectarivorous bats are able to ingest large quantities of sugar in a short time span while avoiding the potentially adverse side-effects of elevated blood glucose. The glucose transporter 4 protein (GLUT4) encoded by the Slc2a4 gene plays a critical role in transmembrane skeletal muscle glucose uptake and thus glucose homeostasis. To test whether the Slc2a4 gene has undergone adaptive evolution in bats with carbohydrate-rich diets in relation to their insect-eating sister taxa, we sequenced the coding region of the Slc2a4 gene in a number of bat species, including four Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) and three New World fruit bats (Phyllostomidae). Our molecular evolutionary analyses revealed evidence that Slc2a4 has undergone a change in selection pressure in Old World fruit bats with 11 amino acid substitutions detected on the ancestral branch, whereas, no positive selection was detected in the New World fruit bats. We noted that in the former group, amino acid replacements were biased towards either Serine or Isoleucine, and, of the 11 changes, six were specific to Old World fruit bats (A133S, A164S, V377F, V386I, V441I and G459S). Our study presents preliminary evidence that the Slc2a4 gene has undergone adaptive changes in Old World fruit bats in relation to their ability to meet the demands of a high sugar diet."
https://openalex.org/W2033118508,Is senescence the adaptive result of tradeoffs between younger and older ages or the nonadaptive burden of deleterious mutations that act at older ages? To shed new light on this unresolved question we combine adaptive and nonadaptive processes in a single model. Our model uses Penna's bit-strings to capture different age-specific mutational patterns. Each pattern represents a genotype and for each genotype we find the life history strategy that maximizes fitness. Genotypes compete with each other and are subject to selection and to new mutations over generations until equilibrium in gene-frequencies is reached. The mutation-selection equilibrium provides information about mutational load and the differential effects of mutations on a life history trait--the optimal age at maturity. We find that mutations accumulate only at ages with negligible impact on fitness and that mutation accumulation has very little effect on the optimal age at maturity. These results suggest that life histories are largely determined by adaptive processes. The non-adaptive process of mutation accumulation seems to be unimportant at evolutionarily relevant ages.
https://openalex.org/W2029063363,"The mechanisms that govern whether a cell dies by apoptosis or necrosis are not fully understood. Here we show that serglycin, a secretory granule proteoglycan of hematopoietic cells, can have a major impact on this decision. Wild type and serglycin(-/-) mast cells were equally sensitive to a range of cell death-inducing regimens. However, whereas wild type mast cells underwent apoptotic cell death, serglycin(-/-) cells died predominantly by necrosis. Investigations of the underlying mechanism revealed that cell death was accompanied by leakage of secretory granule compounds into the cytosol and that the necrotic phenotype of serglycin(-/-) mast cells was linked to defective degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. Cells lacking mouse mast cell protease 6, a major serglycin-associated protease, exhibited similar defects in apoptosis as observed in serglycin(-/-) cells, indicating that the pro-apoptotic function of serglycin is due to downstream effects of proteases that are complex-bound to serglycin. Together, these findings implicate serglycin in promoting apoptotic versus necrotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1990770560,"Development of the adult olfactory system of the moth Manduca sexta depends on reciprocal interactions between olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons growing in from the periphery and centrally-derived glial cells. Early-arriving ORN axons induce a subset of glial cells to proliferate and migrate to form an axon-sorting zone, in which later-arriving ORN axons will change their axonal neighbors and change their direction of outgrowth in order to travel with like axons to their target areas in the olfactory (antennal) lobe. These newly fasciculated axon bundles will terminate in protoglomeruli, the formation of which induces other glial cells to migrate to surround them. Glial cells do not migrate unless ORN axons are present, axons fail to fasciculate and target correctly without sufficient glial cells, and protoglomeruli are not maintained without a glial surround. We have shown previously that Epidermal Growth Factor receptors and the IgCAMs Neuroglian and Fasciclin II play a role in the ORN responses to glial cells. In the present work, we present evidence for the importance of glial Fibroblast Growth Factor receptors in glial migration, proliferation, and survival in this developing pathway. We also report changes in growth patterns of ORN axons and of the dendrites of olfactory (antennal lobe) neurons following blockade of glial FGFR activation that suggest that glial FGFR activation is important in reciprocal communication between neurons and glial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2129128217,"Background Social support is frequently linked to positive parenting behavior. Similarly, studies increasingly show a link between neighborhood residential environment and positive parenting behavior. However, less is known about how the residential environment influences parental social support. To address this gap, we examine the relationship between neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy and the level and change in parental caregiver perceptions of non-familial social support. Methodology/Principal Findings The data for this study came from three data sources, the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) Study's Longitudinal Cohort Survey of caregivers and their offspring, a Community Survey of adult residents in these same neighborhoods and the 1990 Census. Social support is measured at Wave 1 and Wave 3 and neighborhood characteristics are measured at Wave 1. Multilevel linear regression models are fit. The results show that neighborhood collective efficacy is a significant (ß = .04; SE = .02; p = .03), predictor of the positive change in perceived social support over a 7 year period, however, not of the level of social support, adjusting for key compositional variables and neighborhood concentrated disadvantage. In contrast concentrated neighborhood disadvantage is not a significant predictor of either the level or change in social support. Conclusion Our finding suggests that neighborhood collective efficacy may be important for inducing the perception of support from friends in parental caregivers over time."

The present work aims to address the role of TolAIII in the uptake of ColA through determination of the x-ray crystal structures of E. coli TolAIII on its own and in complex with the TolA binding region of ColA. E. coli B834(DE3) was used as an expression host for plasmids pYZ48 (residues 302–421 of TolA (TolAIII) cloned into pET21a via NdeI/XhoI restriction sites with an in-frame N-terminal His6 tag) or pYZ69 (27Hecht O. Zhang Y. Li C. Penfold C.N. James R. Moore G.R.

An overnight culture of 10 ml of Luria Bertani medium (LB) was used to inoculate 0.5 liter of 2×YT broth supplemented with ampicillin (Melford Laboratories) to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Cultures were shaken in 2-liter baffled flasks at 180 rpm at 37 °C until they reached an A600 of 0.6–0.8; protein expression was induced for a period of 4 h after adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. For selenomethionine-labeled protein expression, E. coli 834 (DE3) harboring pYZ48 or pYZ69 was used as the expression host. The pellet from a 5-ml overnight culture grown in LB supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) was resuspended in 5 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl and incubated in a shaker at 37 °C for 30 min, and the cells were spun down and washed again with 5 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl before the pellet was transferred into 100 ml of Selenomethionine medium complete (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) containing l-methionine and grown overnight at 37 °C. The overnight culture was washed twice in 0.9% sterile NaCl as described previously, and the pellet was transferred into 500 ml of selenomethionine medium complete containing l-selenomethionine before protein induction was carried out for 4 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the cell A600 reached 0.6–0.8. Once resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole (lysis buffer), the cell pellets were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered into nickel-agarose beads (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen), which were previously equilibrated with lysis buffer and gently mixed by circular rotation in a cold room for 1 h. The beads were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10–30 mm imidazole (wash buffer), and finally, the proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole (elution buffer). A region of TA1–107 containing a TolA binding site (TA53–107) was separated from the TolB box by digestion of TA1–107 with thrombin at a thrombin recognition site engineered into TA1–107 after residue 52. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl containing 5 units/mg of thrombin (Haematologic Technologies Inc., Essex Junction, VT), and the mixture was left on a circulating platform rotor at room temperature overnight. The thrombin was then removed using ρ-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and TA53–107 was purified using metal chelate chromatography and nickel-agarose beads in His tag lysis buffer as described previously (27Hecht O.

TA53–107 was finally loaded to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) to remove any undigested TA1–107. The purity of protein samples was checked by running 15–17% SDS-PAGE gels. Pure fractions of TA53–107 were combined, concentrated using 5-kDa molecular mass cut off concentrators (Vivascience), and dialyzed to 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. Protein concentration was determined by using absorption at 280 nm and extinction coefficients of 15,470, 8480, and 6085 m−1cm−1 for TA1–107 with a thrombin cleavage site after residue 52, TA53–107, and TolAIII, respectively. Isotopically labeled TolAIII comprising amino acids 302–421 of the E. coli TolA protein (Swiss-Prot accession number P19934) and TA1–52 and TA53–107 containing the TolB box and TolA binding region of ColA, respectively, were prepared as described previously (27Hecht O.

The B1–13 peptide representing the N-terminal sequence of TolB lacking its signal peptide and comprising residues 21–33 of TolB (AEVRIVIDSGVDS) was purchased from United Peptide Corp. at a purity of 95%. NMR spectra were acquired at the indicated temperatures using a Bruker Avance III 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and pulse sequences incorporated into the Bruker Topspin 2.1 software. Resonance assignments of 13C/15N-labeled TA53–107 in complex with unlabeled TolAIII (1.2 mm) were obtained from 1H-15N HSQC, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, and HNCA spectra at 27 °C. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe: a multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol.

TA53–107 and TolAIII in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl were mixed in a 1.1:1 molar ratio and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The mixed sample was loaded onto a Superdex 75 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl and run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on an FPLC system (ÄKTA). The elution fractions were checked by running on 17% SDS-PAGE gels. The methylation of the TolAIII-TA53–107 complex was carried out using a published protocol (30Walter T.S. Meier C. Assenberg R.

Briefly, both TA53–107 and TolAIII were exchanged into 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl and were mixed in a 1.1:1 molar ratio. Then the complex was adjusted to 1 mg/ml or 0.5 mg/ml for methylation of the selenomethionine-labeled complex. Methylation was carried out by adding borane dimethylamine complex (Sigma), which is a reducing agent, followed by formaldehyde (Sigma) before an overnight incubation at 4 °C (30Walter T.S. Meier C.

The reaction was quenched by adding Tris buffer, pH 8, to 20 mm, and then the product was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl for gel filtration to remove the small reactants and excess TA53–107. The methylated TA53–107-TolAIII complex was crystallized by using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C with 2 μl of the complex at 35 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl mixed in equal volumes with the reservoir solution containing 0.2 m K2HPO4, 2.2 m ammonium sulfate. The complex crystals grew after 3–4 weeks. Before being frozen in a nitrogen stream, crystals were soaked in 0.2 m KH2PO4, 2.26 m ammonium sulfate, and 1.1 m disodium malonate for cryoprotection. Diffraction data sets were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France, using a MAR 225 detector at a microfocus beamline of ID23-2 (λ = 0.8726 Å) for native crystals and an ADSC Quantum Q315r detector at a beamline of ID14-4 (λ = 0.9795 Å) for selenomethionine-labeled crystals. A wavelength of 0.9795 Å was used for collecting the single anomalous dispersion data sets for selenomethionine-labeled crystals.

https://openalex.org/W1996358362,"We study the amino acid transport system b(0,+) as a model for folding, assembly, and early traffic of membrane protein complexes. System b(0,+) is made of two disulfide-linked membrane subunits: the carrier, b(0,+) amino acid transporter (b(0,+)AT), a polytopic protein, and the helper, related to b(0,+) amino acid transporter (rBAT), a type II glycoprotein. rBAT ectodomain mutants display folding/trafficking defects that lead to type I cystinuria. Here we show that, in the presence of b(0,+)AT, three disulfides were formed in the rBAT ectodomain. Disulfides Cys-242-Cys-273 and Cys-571-Cys-666 were essential for biogenesis. Cys-673-Cys-685 was dispensable, but the single mutants C673S, and C685S showed compromised stability and trafficking. Cys-242-Cys-273 likely was the first disulfide to form, and unpaired Cys-242 or Cys-273 disrupted oxidative folding. Strikingly, unassembled rBAT was found as an ensemble of different redox species, mainly monomeric. The ensemble did not change upon inhibition of rBAT degradation. Overall, these results indicated a b(0,+)AT-dependent oxidative folding of the rBAT ectodomain, with the initial and probably cotranslational formation of Cys-242-Cys-273, followed by the oxidation of Cys-571-Cys-666 and Cys-673-Cys-685, that was completed posttranslationally."
https://openalex.org/W1966199021,"Recently, structural variation in the genome has been implicated in many complex diseases. Using genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, researchers are able to investigate the impact not only of SNP variation, but also of copy-number variants (CNVs) on the phenotype. The most common analytic approach involves estimating, at the level of the individual genome, the underlying number of copies present at each location. Once this is completed, tests are performed to determine the association between copy number state and phenotype. An alternative approach is to carry out association testing first, between phenotype and raw intensities from the SNP array at the level of the individual marker, and then aggregate neighboring test results to identify CNVs associated with the phenotype. Here, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches using both simulations and real data from a pharmacogenomic study of the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine. Our results indicate that pooled marker-level testing is capable of offering a dramatic increase in power (-fold) over CNV-level testing, particularly for small CNVs. However, CNV-level testing is superior when CNVs are large and rare; understanding these tradeoffs is an important consideration in conducting association studies of structural variation."
https://openalex.org/W2157808321,"Minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM) are highly expressed in actively replicating cells. The need for biological markers for cervical carcinoma and its precursor lesions is emerging. Our main aim was to determine the immunohistochemical expression of MCM-2 in HIV-positive and -negative dysplastic cervical specimens.Immunohistochemical analysis of MCM-2 was performed in a total of 352 cervical TMA specimens of normal control, low-grade CIN, high-grade CIN and invasive tumor. 38 specimens were from HIV-positive women. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to determine the best cutoff to diagnose high-grade CIN and invasive cervical cancer.In the progression from normal epithelium to high-grade CIN and invasive tumor we found significant differences in the MCM-2 expression (p<0.05). Based on the ROC curve of 80% with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78, expression of MCM-2 to diagnose high-grade CIN and invasive tumor resulted in sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 66%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 86% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 57%. HIV-positive cervices revealed a decreasing expression of MCM-2 in both LGCIN and HGCIN compared with HIV-negative specimens (p<0.0001).The present study suggests that immunohistochemical MCM-2 may not be a promising biomarker for diagnosing high-grade CIN and invasive cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2091307893,"The process of local adaptation creates diversity among allopatric populations, and may eventually lead to speciation. Plant-feeding insect populations that specialize on different host species provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate the causes of ecological specialization and the subsequent consequences for diversity. In this study, we used geographically separated Drosophila mettleri populations that specialize on different host cacti to examine oviposition preference for and larval performance on an array of natural and non-natural hosts (eight total). We found evidence of local adaptation in performance on saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) for populations that are typically associated with this host, and to chemically divergent prickly pear species (Opuntia spp.) in a genetically isolated population on Santa Catalina Island. Moreover, each population exhibited reduced performance on the alternative host. This finding is consistent with trade-offs associated with adaptation to these chemically divergent hosts, although we also discuss alternative explanations for this pattern. For oviposition preference, Santa Catalina Island flies were more likely to oviposit on some prickly pear species, but all populations readily laid eggs on saguaro. Experiments with non-natural hosts suggest that factors such as ecological opportunity may play a more important role than host plant chemistry in explaining the lack of natural associations with some hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2058640740,"Pancreatic acinar cells AR42J-B13 can transdifferentiate into hepatocyte-like cells permissive for efficient hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Here, we profiled miRNAs differentially expressed in AR42J-B13 cells before and after transdifferentiation to hepatocytes, using chip-based microarray. Significant increase of miRNA expression, including miR-21, miR-22, and miR-122a, was confirmed by stem-loop real-time PCR and Northern blot analyses. In contrast, miR-93, miR-130b, and a number of other miRNAs, were significantly reduced after transdifferentiation. To investigate the potential significance of miR-22 in hepatocytes, we generated cell lines stably expressing miR-22. By 2D-DIGE, LC-MS/MS, and Western blot analyses, we identified several potential target genes of miR-22, including parathymosin. In transdifferentiated hepatocytes, miR-22 can inhibit both mRNA and protein expression of parathymosin, probably through a direct and an indirect mechanism. We tested two computer predicted miR-22 target sites at the 3' UTR of parathymosin, by the 3' UTR reporter gene assay. Treatment with anti-miR-22 resulted in significant elevation of the reporter activity. In addition, we observed an in vivo inverse correlation between miR-22 and parathymosin mRNA in their tissue distribution in a rat model. The phenomenon that miR-22 can reduce parathymosin protein was also observed in human hepatoma cell lines Huh7 and HepG2. So far, we detected no major effect on several transdifferentiation markers when AR42J-B13 cells were transfected with miR-22, or anti-miR-22, or a parathymosin expression vector, with or without dexamethasone treatment. Therefore, miR-22 appears to be neither necessary nor sufficient for transdifferentiation. We discussed the possibility that altered expression of some other microRNAs could induce cell cycle arrest leading to transdifferentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2085940225,"High temperature superconducting (HTS) surface resonators have been used as a low loss RF receiver resonator for improving magnetic resonance imaging image quality. However, the application of HTS surface resonators is significantly limited by their filling factor. To maximize the filling factor, it is desirable to have the RF resonator wrapped around the sample so that more nuclear magnetic dipoles can contribute to the signal. In this study, a whole new Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu2O3 (Bi-2223) superconducting saddle resonator (width of 5 cm and length of 8 cm) was designed for the magnetic resonance image of a mouse's whole body in Bruker 3 T MRI system. The experiment was conducted with a professionally-made copper saddle resonator and a Bi-2223 saddle resonator to show the difference. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with the HTS saddle resonator at 77 K was 2.1 and 2 folds higher than that of the copper saddle resonator at 300 K for a phantom and an in-vivo mice whole body imaging. Testing results were in accordance with predicted ones, and the difference between the predicted SNR gains and measured SNR gains were 2.4%∼2.7%. In summary, with this HTS saddle system, a mouse's whole body can be imaged in one scan and could reach a high SNR due to a 2 folds SNR gain over the professionally-made prototype of copper saddle resonator at 300 K. The use of HTS saddle resonator not only improves SNR but also enables a mouse's whole body screen in one scan."
