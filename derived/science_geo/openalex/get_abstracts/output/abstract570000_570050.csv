https://openalex.org/W2526529257,"Higher brain function relies upon the ability to flexibly integrate information across specialized communities of brain regions, however it is unclear how this mechanism manifests over time. In this study, we use time-resolved network analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to demonstrate that the human brain traverses between two functional states that maximize either segregation into tight-knit communities or integration across otherwise disparate neural regions. The integrated state enables faster and more accurate performance on a cognitive task, and is associated with dilations in pupil diameter, suggesting that ascending neuromodulatory systems may govern the transition between these alternative modes of brain function. Our data confirm a direct link between cognitive performance and the dynamic reorganization of the network structure of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2526887159,"Redirecting T cells to attack cancer using engineered chimeric receptors provides powerful new therapeutic capabilities. However, the effectiveness of therapeutic T cells is constrained by the endogenous T cell response: certain facets of natural response programs can be toxic, whereas other responses, such as the ability to overcome tumor immunosuppression, are absent. Thus, the efficacy and safety of therapeutic cells could be improved if we could custom sculpt immune cell responses. Synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors induce transcriptional activation in response to recognition of user-specified antigens. We show that synNotch receptors can be used to sculpt custom response programs in primary T cells: they can drive a la carte cytokine secretion profiles, biased T cell differentiation, and local delivery of non-native therapeutic payloads, such as antibodies, in response to antigen. SynNotch T cells can thus be used as a general platform to recognize and remodel local microenvironments associated with diverse diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2524431814,"The inflammasome is an intracellular signaling complex, which on recognition of pathogens and physiological aberration, drives activation of caspase-1, pyroptosis, and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Bacterial ligands must secure entry into the cytoplasm to activate inflammasomes; however, the mechanisms by which concealed ligands are liberated in the cytoplasm have remained unclear. Here, we showed that the interferon-inducible protein IRGB10 is essential for activation of the DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome by Francisella novicida and contributed to the activation of the LPS-sensing caspase-11 and NLRP3 inflammasome by Gram-negative bacteria. IRGB10 directly targeted cytoplasmic bacteria through a mechanism requiring guanylate-binding proteins. Localization of IRGB10 to the bacterial cell membrane compromised bacterial structural integrity and mediated cytosolic release of ligands for recognition by inflammasome sensors. Overall, our results reveal IRGB10 as part of a conserved signaling hub at the interface between cell-autonomous immunity and innate immune sensing pathways."

We report that loss of HVEM leads to cell-autonomous activation of B cell proliferation and drives the development of GC lymphomas in vivo. HVEM-deficient lymphoma B cells also induce a tumor-supportive microenvironment marked by exacerbated lymphoid stroma activation and increased recruitment of T follicular helper (TFH) cells. These changes result from the disruption of inhibitory cell-cell interactions between the HVEM and BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) receptors. Accordingly, administration of the HVEM ectodomain protein (solHVEM(P37-V202)) binds BTLA and restores tumor suppression. To deliver solHVEM to lymphomas in vivo, we engineered CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that produce solHVEM locally and continuously. These modified CAR-T cells show enhanced therapeutic activity against xenografted lymphomas. Hence, the HVEM-BTLA axis opposes lymphoma development, and our study illustrates the use of CAR-T cells as “micro-pharmacies” able to deliver an anti-cancer protein.

Most human lymphomas arise from germinal center (GC) B cells. These include diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and follicular lymphomas (FLs), which continue to pose a significant health challenge. Recent genomic studies have yielded important new insight into lymphoma pathogenesis and have cataloged recurrent genomic lesions (Challa-Malladi et al., 2011Challa-Malladi M. Lieu Y.K. Califano O.

However, precise mechanisms linking the GC microenvironment to the pathogenesis of GC lymphomas are largely unknown. The GC microenvironment is critical for most aspects of B cell function and likely contributes to lymphomagenesis. GCs are dynamic structures that are composed of multiple hematopoietic and stromal cell types (Chang and Turley, 2015Chang J.E. Turley S.J.

Klein U. Dynamics of B cells in germinal centres.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). For example, the main lymphoid stromal cell subtypes, fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), contribute to B cell recruitment, survival, and differentiation (Aguzzi et al., 2014Aguzzi A. Kranich J. Krautler N.J.

Acton S.E. Knoblich K. Lymph node fibroblastic reticular cells in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In turn, activated B cells produce the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family cytokines TNF-α and LTα1β2 that stimulate FRCs and FDCs (Roozendaal and Mebius, 2011Roozendaal R. Mebius R.E. Stromal cell-immune cell interactions.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). CXCL13 derived from these stromal cells is the major attractant for follicular T helper (TFH) cells that, in turn, support B cells through CD40L and secretion of cytokines interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-21 (Crotty, 2014Crotty S. T follicular helper cell differentiation, function, and roles in disease.Immunity. 2014; 41: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Especially, FL B cells retain a strong dependence on the GC microenvironment, which is thought to form a permissive niche and engage in crosstalk with malignant B cells (Amé-Thomas and Tarte, 2014Amé-Thomas P.

Cancer-specific gene alterations can shed light on tumor biology. For example, somatic mutations in the HVEM (Herpes Virus Entry Mediator; TNFRSF14) receptor gene are among the most frequent genetic lesions in GC lymphomas and have been variably associated with prognosis (Cheung et al., 2010Cheung K.J. Johnson N.A. Affleck J.G. Severson T. Steidl C. Ben-Neriah S. Schein J. Morin R.D. Moore R.

USA. 2012; 109: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Exactly how HVEM mutations contribute to the biology of GC lymphomas is not known. Studies of the HVEM receptor in T lymphocytes inform our current knowledge of this receptor’s function. In T lymphocytes HVEM engages in stimulating cell-cell interactions by binding to LIGHT or CD160 receptors, whereas HVEM binding to the BTLA receptor (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) results in an inhibitory signal (Bjordahl et al., 2013Bjordahl R.L.

Expression of HVEM and its partner receptors is lineage restricted. For example, normal B cells variably express HVEM and BTLA depending on their differentiation and activation stage but they lack LIGHT and CD160, whereas TFH cells are characterized by their high BTLA expression (M’Hidi et al., 2009M’Hidi H.

We further explore strategies to restore HVEM function by delivering the HVEM ectodomain (solHVEM(Pro37-Val202)) to lymphomas in vivo. In a large collection (n = 141) of human FLs, we find HVEM mutations in 28% (n = 40), and one-third (35%) of these are homozygous mutations (Figures 1A–1C) (Cheung et al., 2010Cheung K.J.

HVEM mutations target the receptor’s ectodomain and include missense (65%), nonsense (32.5%), and frameshift mutations (2.5%). Moreover, HVEM localizes to the minimal common region of the chromosome 1p36 deletion—a region that is commonly lost across B cell malignancies (Cheung et al., 2010Cheung K.J. Johnson N.A.

Genomic identification of significant targets in cancer (GISTIC) analysis indicates that 22%–24% of these lesions are homozygous losses in both indolent and transformed samples (Figures 1E and S1A). Hence, the genomic evidence indicates a powerful selection against the HVEM receptor gene during FL development.Figure S1HVEM Mutations and Deletions in Human Lymphomas, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Chr. 1p36 deletions in a second series of FL (UNMC, n = 198).(inset: GISTIC analysis of DNA copy number indicates frequent homozygous loss.(B) Frequency of deletions by zygosity in transformed FLs.(C) Distribution of the percentages of HVEM-positive tumor cells in FL tissue specimens arranged on a TMA.

(F) BTLA staining intensity in Human FLs in cases that are HVEM + or HVEM -. (G) Numbers indicate breakdown of how individual TMA sections scored. We also examined HVEM protein expression in human FLs. We evaluated tissue microarrays comprising 198 FL samples for HVEM protein expression by immunohistochemistry. We scored a sample as HVEM positive when at least 20% of tumor cells showed specific staining. Using this cutoff, 61 samples (31.3%) were HVEM negative, and 135 samples (68.7%) were classified as HVEM positive (Figures 1G and S1C). This proportion is consistent with the genomic data, and we confirm reduced or absent protein expression in HVEM mutated or deleted samples for samples (n = 14) with available genomic and protein data (Figure S1D). BTLA is a known HVEM binding partner and the only HVEM receptor expressed on normal and FL B cells (Murphy et al., 2006Murphy K.M. Nelson C.A. Sedý J.R. Balancing co-stimulation and inhibition with BTLA and HVEM.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated BTLA expression across the lymphoma tissue arrays. For a positive BTLA score, we demanded that tumor cells showed a stronger stain than reactive GC B cells, which are weakly positive and were used as on-slide controls. Using this cutoff for BTLA, 102 samples were negative (51.2%), and 94 samples (48.2%) scored as positive (Figures 1G and S1E). Together, 145 of 198 samples (73%) were negative for either HVEM or BTLA, and we wondered whether these events might be linked. We tested their association using the chi-square and found a significant negative (mutual exclusive) association such that HVEM positive tumors were more likely to lose BTLA than expected by chance (OR = 0.254; 95% CI 0.126–0.511; p < 0.0001) (Figures 1G–1I, S1F, and S1G). We did not observe mutations or deletions of BTLA, and it is most likely silenced transcriptionally. In this regard, we notice that BTLA expression is controlled by the KMT2D (MLL2) methyltransferase in FL (Ortega-Molina et al., 2015Ortega-Molina A. Boss I.W. Canela A. Pan H. Jiang Y. Zhao C. Jiang M. Hu D. Agirre X. Niesvizky I. et al.The histone lysine methyltransferase KMT2D sustains a gene expression program that represses B cell lymphoma development.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Hence, the interaction between the HVEM and BTLA receptors is disrupted in the majority of human FLs indicating a potentially important tumor suppressor axis. To elucidate the role of HVEM inactivation in FL development, we took advantage of the vavPBcl2 model that recapitulates key aspects of the genetics and pathology of human BCL2-positive FLs (Egle et al., 2004Egle A. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. O’Reilly L. Cory S. VavP-Bcl2 transgenic mice develop follicular lymphoma preceded by germinal center hyperplasia.Blood. 2004; 103: 2276-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, Oricchio et al., 2011Oricchio E.

Olshen A.B. et al.The Eph-receptor A7 is a soluble tumor suppressor for follicular lymphoma.Cell. 2011; 147: 554-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, we transduced vavPBcl2 hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) isolated from fetal livers with retroviruses expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against Hvem or empty vector controls. We then transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated mice and monitored the recipients for lymphoma development (Figure 2A). Knockdown of Hvem (red, n = 19) caused a significant acceleration and increased penetrance of lymphoma development compared to controls (blue, n = 11). Ninety percent of control animals remained tumor free for >100 days compared to only 10% of animals receiving the shHvem (p < 0.01) (Figure 2B). We confirmed these results with a second shRNA against Hvem (Figure S2A). We also confirmed knockdown of the Hvem mRNA and Hvem surface expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2B). To test whether the HVEM knockdown in the B cell compartment was responsible for lymphoma development, we tracked the expression of the shHvem co-expressed with the GFP reporter from the initial HPC infection into the derived hematopoietic compartments and did the same with HPCs expressing empty vector and GFP. The initial transduction efficiencies of the HPCs were ∼15%, and we found enrichment only in the FACS shHvem-expressing lymphoma B cells (approximately 80%); by contrast, we saw no enrichment with empty vector and GFP-transduced HPCs (Figures 2E and S2C). We noticed that the shHvem and GFP were also expressed but not enriched in a fraction of whole CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (∼15%) and specialized TFH cells (∼2%). This may contribute to the observed phenotype, although we could detect no significant change in Hvem mRNA levels in the total T cell population or in sorted TFH in association with the small proportion of GFPpos cells (Figures S2D and S2E; FACS not shown). We conclude that loss of Hvem drives specific B cell expansion leading to lymphoma development in vivo.Figure S2HVEM Knockdown Promotes FL Development In Vivo, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Kaplan–Meier analysis of tumor onset using a second shRNA against Hvem (shHvem-2) compared to empty vector (blue: vector, n = 11; red: shHvem-2, n = 12; p < 0.01).(B) Representative FACS analysis for surface Hvem in B lymphocytes isolated from normal spleen, control lymphomas (vavPBcl2/-vector), and two independent lymphomas expressing the shRNA against Hvem (vavPBcl2/-shHvem).(C) FACS analysis of MSCV-IRES-GFP expressing cells from control lymphomas before HPC transplantation and after tumor harvest.(D) qRT-PCR expression of HVEM in FACS sorted CD4+ T cells.(E) qRT-PCR measurement of expression of HVEM in FACS sorted TFH cells (mean ± SD).(F) FACS analysis for the indicated surface markers on HVEM deficient (shHvem) and control (Vector) lymphomas.(G) Quantification of Ki67 in vavPBcl2/-vector and vavPBcl2/-Hvem tumors (n = 6; mean ± SD; ∗p < 0.01).(H) FACS analysis for the indicated surface markers on HVEM (shHvem) deficient and control (Vector) lymphomas.(I) Quantification of CD3+ cells in shHvem or control lymphomas (mean ± SD).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Kaplan–Meier analysis of tumor onset using a second shRNA against Hvem (shHvem-2) compared to empty vector (blue: vector, n = 11; red: shHvem-2, n = 12; p < 0.01).

Pathological and molecular analyses of murine HVEM-deficient lymphomas showed hallmarks of GC-derived FLs and activation of key signaling molecules. For example, we found follicular architecture, expression of GC markers PNA, BCL6, and GL7 by immunohistochemistry and FACS analysis (Figures 2F and S2F). Immunohistochemistry further showed increased Ki67 staining in HVEM-deficient lymphomas (Figure S2G). FACS analysis showed that all lymphomas were largely composed of small B220+ and CD19+ B cells and showed no significant change in infiltrating CD3+ T cells (p = 0.14) (Figures S2H and S2I). A survey of signaling molecules further indicated activation and phosphorylation of signaling molecules related to the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway such as SYK, BTK, and BLNK, and their downstream targets ERK and IkB in HVEM-deficient lymphomas compared to control lymphomas (Figure 2G). Deep sequencing-based BCR analysis revealed an oligoclonal disease and associated repertoire bias, with somatic hypermutation (SHM) yielding intraclonal diversity consistent with ongoing clonal evolution of a GC-driven disease (Figure S3). In human FL samples, we had noticed a mutual exclusive pattern of HVEM and BTLA expression (Figures 1G–1I). Studies in T cells have indicated that HVEM and BTLA can directly interact on the same cell—in cis (Cheung et al., 2009Cheung T.C. Oborne L.M. Steinberg M.W. Macauley M.G. Fukuyama S. Sanjo H. D’Souza C. Norris P.S. Pfeffer K. Murphy K.M. et al.T cell intrinsic heterodimeric complexes between HVEM and BTLA determine receptivity to the surrounding microenvironment.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 7286-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that loss of BTLA may similarly promote lymphoma development. We directly tested the effect of Btla knockdown in the same vavPBcl2 mouse lymphoma model. Briefly, Btla knockdown caused a significant acceleration of lymphoma development (n = 11 vector, n = 16 for Btla, p < 0.01) (Figures 3A and 3B ). Tumor pathology closely resembled the HVEM-deficient tumors with follicular structures, higher Ki67 than controls, expression of the GC markers PNA and BCL6, and FACS analysis revealed cellular composition of predominant B220+ and CD19+ B cells, with similar CD3+ levels (Figures 3C–3E and S3D; cf. Figure 2). Similar to HVEM-deficient lymphomas, we observed increased phosphorylation of signaling molecules including BTK, BLNK, SYK, ERK, and IkB by immunoblots, whereas AKT was not consistently affected (Figures 3F and S3E; data not shown). Hence, loss of either Hvem or Btla can cooperate with Bcl2 and pr"

Hypothalamic Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons are critical regulators of appetite. Hungry animals, bombarded by multiple sensory stimuli, are known to modify their behavior during times of caloric need, rapidly adapting to a consistently changing environment. Utilizing ARCAgRP neurons as an entry point, we analyzed the hierarchical position of hunger related to rival drive states. Employing a battery of behavioral assays, we found that hunger significantly increases its capacity to suppress competing motivational systems, such as thirst, anxiety-related behavior, innate fear, and social interactions, often only when food is accessible. Furthermore, real-time monitoring of ARCAgRP activity revealed time-locked responses to conspecific investigation in addition to food presentation, further establishing that, even at the level of ARCAgRP neurons, choices are remarkably flexible computations, integrating internal state, external factors, and anticipated yield.

Instead, the ICL is unhooked when one of the two N-glycosyl bonds forming the cross-link is cleaved by the DNA glycosylase NEIL3. Cleavage by NEIL3 is the primary unhooking mechanism for psoralen and abasic site ICLs. When N-glycosyl bond cleavage is prevented, unhooking occurs via FANCI-FANCD2-dependent incisions.

In summary, we identify an incision-independent unhooking mechanism that avoids DSB formation and represents the preferred pathway of ICL repair in a vertebrate cell-free system. DNA replication and transcription require DNA unwinding. Therefore, chemical agents that create DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are extremely cytotoxic. ICLs are induced by diverse chemical agents (Deans and West, 2009Deans A.J. West S.C. FANCM connects the genome instability disorders Bloom’s syndrome and fanconi anemia.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 943-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), including nitrogen mustards, platinum compounds, mitomycin C, and psoralen, which are used in chemotherapy. ICLs can also be generated by endogenous agents, most notably formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and malondialdehyde (Duxin and Walter, 2015Duxin J.P. Walter J.C. What is the DNA repair defect underlying Fanconi anemia?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 37: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, the deoxyribose sugar of an abasic (AP) site (generated by spontaneous hydrolysis or the action of a DNA glycosylase) can isomerize to a ring-open aldehyde that is attacked by a base on the opposite strand, generating an “AP-ICL” (Price et al., 2014Price N.E. Johnson K.M. Wang J. Fekry M.I. Wang Y. Gates K.S. Interstrand DNA-DNA cross-link formation between adenine residues and abasic sites in duplex DNA.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Given that mammalian cells contain ∼100,000 AP sites at steady state (Nakamura and Swenberg, 1999Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Endogenous apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in genomic DNA of mammalian tissues.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar), AP-ICLs may form in vivo. ICLs are chemically and structurally diverse. Cisplatin links guanines on opposing strands through their N7 nitrogens. The resulting ICL is so distorting that the cytidines opposite the crosslinked guanosines are flipped out of the DNA helix. Upon exposure to UV light, psoralen links thymines on opposite strands, but the resulting ICL is not highly distorting. Reactive aldehydes generally induce cross-links between the exocyclic amines of bases, but little is known about their structure. An important question is whether these chemically diverse ICLs are repaired via similar or distinct strategies. The vertebrate ICL repair pathway that contributes most to cell survival is coupled to DNA replication (Clauson et al., 2013Clauson C. Schärer O.D. Niedernhofer L.

This pathway involves structure-specific endonucleases, DNA recombinases, and translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases. In addition, it requires 19 “FANC” proteins, mutations in which cause the bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition syndrome Fanconi anemia. A key factor in this pathway is the FANCI-FANCD2 heterodimer (FANCI-D2), whose mono-ubiquitylation protects cells from ICL-inducing agents. Importantly, the Fanconi pathway also protects cells from the genotoxic effects of endogenous aldehydes, though the nature of the relevant DNA lesions is presently unclear (Duxin and Walter, 2015Duxin J.P.

By replicating a plasmid containing a site-specific cisplatin ICL in Xenopus egg extracts, we previously described a mechanism of replication-coupled ICL repair (Figure S1A; Räschle et al., 2008Räschle M. Knipscheer P. Enoiu M. Angelov T. Sun J. Griffith J.D. Ellenberger T.E. Schärer O.D. Walter J.C. Mechanism of replication-coupled DNA interstrand crosslink repair.Cell. 2008; 134: 969-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The leading strands of converging replication forks initially stall ∼20 nt from the lesion due to steric hindrance by the replicative CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS (CMG) helicase, which encircles and travels along the leading-strand template ahead of DNA polymerase (Fu et al., 2011Fu Y.V. Yardimci H. Long D.T. Ho T.V. Guainazzi A. Bermudez V.P. Hurwitz J. van Oijen A. Schärer O.D. Walter J.C. Selective bypass of a lagging strand roadblock by the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase.Cell. 2011; 146: 931-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The first known event in repair is removal of the stalled CMGs, which requires fork convergence, the tumor suppressor BRCA1-BARD1, and ubiquitin signaling (Long et al., 2014Long D.T. Joukov V. Budzowska M. Walter J.C. BRCA1 promotes unloading of the CMG helicase from a stalled DNA replication fork.Mol.

DNA interstrand cross-link repair requires replication-fork convergence.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the leading strand is extended to within 1 nt of the ICL (“−1” position). Ubiquitylated FANCI-D2 then binds near the ICL and helps recruit the XPF-ERCC1-SLX4 complex, which promotes incisions surrounding the ICL (Klein Douwel et al., 2014Klein Douwel D. Boonen R.A. Long D.T. Szypowska A.A. Räschle M. Walter J.C. Knipscheer P. XPF-ERCC1 acts in Unhooking DNA interstrand crosslinks in cooperation with FANCD2 and FANCP/SLX4.Mol.

Walter J.C. The Fanconi anemia pathway promotes replication-dependent DNA interstrand cross-link repair.Science. 2009; 326: 1698-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This “unhooking” reaction creates a double-stranded DNA break in one sister chromatid and a mono-adduct in the other strand, which is bypassed with ∼98% accuracy using the TLS polymerase REV1-Pol ζ (Budzowska et al., 2015Budzowska M. Graham T.G. Sobeck A. Waga S. Walter J.C. Regulation of the Rev1-pol ζ complex during bypass of a DNA interstrand cross-link.EMBO J. 2015; 34: 1971-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The DSB is repaired by RAD51-dependent homologous recombination (Long et al., 2011Long D.T. Räschle M. Joukov V. Walter J.C. Mechanism of RAD51-dependent DNA interstrand cross-link repair.Science. 2011; 333: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The remaining mono-adduct is not removed in egg extracts, although this may occur in cells. A similar mechanism of repair was observed for a nitrogen-mustard-like-ICL (Räschle et al., 2008Räschle M. Knipscheer P. Enoiu M. Angelov T. Sun J. Griffith J.D. Ellenberger T.E. Schärer O.D. Walter J.C. Mechanism of replication-coupled DNA interstrand crosslink repair.Cell. 2008; 134: 969-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Because this cell-free system requires all the major proteins implicated in ICL repair in cells, it likely recapitulates physiological repair. Importantly, all eukaryotic mechanisms of ICL repair described so far, including those operating outside of S phase (Williams et al., 2013Williams H.L. Gottesman M.E. Gautier J. The differences between ICL repair during and outside of S phase.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 386-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), involve nucleolytic incisions to unhook the cross-link. We wanted to address whether chemically diverse ICLs are repaired by similar or different mechanisms in Xenopus egg extracts. We therefore prepared plasmids containing a psoralen- or AP-ICL and incubated them in egg extract alongside a cisplatin-ICL plasmid. Strikingly, although repair of psoralen- and AP-ICLs requires replication fork convergence, as seen for the cisplatin-ICL, the downstream repair events are completely different. Specifically, one of the two N-glycosyl bonds that form the psoralen- or AP-ICL is cleaved by the NEIL3 DNA glycosylase, unhooking the cross-link in the absence of incisions. This reaction does not require FANCI-D2 or CMG unloading. After unhooking, gaps are filled in via TLS polymerases. When N-glycosyl bond cleavage is inhibited, repair switches to FANCI-D2-dependent incisions. Thus, N-glycosyl cleavage by NEIL3 represents the primary unhooking pathway for psoralen- and AP-ICLs, whereas incisions represent a backup mechanism. We conclude that ICLs can be unhooked via two independent mechanisms in S phase, one of which avoids DSB formation and thus minimizes the potential for gross chromosomal rearrangements. To examine the mechanism of psoralen-ICL repair, we prepared a 5.6-kb plasmid containing a site-specific psoralen-ICL (Figures 1A and S1B; pICLPso) and replicated it in Xenopus egg extracts containing [α-32P]dATP alongside undamaged (pCtrl) and cisplatin-ICL-containing plasmids (Figure 1A; pICLPt). Replication intermediates were examined by native gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. pCtrl was rapidly converted to open circular and supercoiled replication products (Figure 1C, lanes 1–10). In contrast, on pICLPt and pICLPso, replication forks converged on the ICL, leading to the accumulation of “figure 8” structures (Figures 1C, 1Bi, and 1Di; Räschle et al., 2008Räschle M. Knipscheer P. Enoiu M. Angelov T. Sun J. Griffith J.D. Ellenberger T.E. Schärer O.D. Walter J.C. Mechanism of replication-coupled DNA interstrand crosslink repair.Cell. 2008; 134: 969-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). During pICLPt repair, dual incisions of the figure 8 intermediate generated a DSB that is repaired via HR with the other sister (Figure 1Biii; Long et al., 2011Long D.T. Räschle M. Joukov V. Walter J.C. Mechanism of RAD51-dependent DNA interstrand cross-link repair.Science. 2011; 333: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The resulting HR intermediates were detected near the top of the gel (Figure 1C, arrowhead; Long et al., 2011Long D.T. Räschle M. Joukov V. Walter J.C. Mechanism of RAD51-dependent DNA interstrand cross-link repair.Science. 2011; 333: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Concurrently, supercoiled (SC) molecules accumulated (Figure 1C, lanes 15–20). Surprisingly, during pICLPso repair, HR intermediates were scarce, and figure 8 structures appeared to be directly converted into open circular molecules (nicked or gapped; OC) and then supercoiled species (Figure 1C, lanes 21–30). As seen for pICLPt (Räschle et al., 2008Räschle M. Knipscheer P. Enoiu M. Angelov T. Sun J. Griffith J.D. Ellenberger T.E. Schärer O.D. Walter J.C. Mechanism of replication-coupled DNA interstrand crosslink repair.Cell. 2008; 134: 969-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), unhooking and error-free repair of pICLPso was replication dependent (Figures S1C–S1F), although the efficiency of repair was low (Figure S1G; see Discussion). Furthermore, when only a single fork encountered the psoralen-ICL, it failed to trigger ICL processing (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang J. Dewar J.M. Budzowska M. Motnenko A. Cohn M.A. Walter J.C. DNA interstrand cross-link repair requires replication-fork convergence.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The data above indicate that psoralen-ICL repair, although dependent on replication fork convergence, might involve a novel mechanism. Given the apparent absence of HR products during pICLPso repair, we examined whether this process involves a DSB intermediate. During pICLPt repair, FANCI-D2-promotes incisions around the ICL (Figures 1Bi and 1Bii; Klein Douwel et al., 2014Klein Douwel D. Boonen R.A. Long D.T. Szypowska A.A. Räschle M. Walter J.C.

These fragments appear transiently, likely because they undergo resection and/or strand invasion into the sister chromatid (Figure 1Biii). In contrast, no 3.6-kb and 2.0-kb incision products were detected during pICLPso repair (Figure 1E, lanes 8–14). As shown previously (Knipscheer et al., 2009Knipscheer P. Räschle M. Smogorzewska A. Enoiu M. Ho T.V. Schärer O.D. Elledge S.J. Walter J.C. The Fanconi anemia pathway promotes replication-dependent DNA interstrand cross-link repair.Science. 2009; 326: 1698-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), when FANCI-D2 was immunodepleted from egg extracts (Figure S1H), pICLPt accumulated as figure 8 DNA structures, and supercoiled product was less abundant, consistent with an incision defect (Figure 1F, lanes 7–12). In contrast, FANCI-D2 depletion had almost no effect on the accumulation of open circular and supercoiled pICLPso products (Figure 1F, lanes 19–24), even though the psoralen-ICL induced FANCD2 ubiquitylation (Figure S1I). In summary, the data indicate that a psoralen-ICL is unhooked by an incision-independent pathway that does not involve a DSB intermediate or require FANCI-D2. We envisioned two mechanisms of psoralen-ICL unhooking without incisions. First, in a process analogous to photoreversal (Cimino et al., 1986Cimino G.D. Shi Y.B. Hearst J.E. Wavelength dependence for the photoreversal of a psoralen-DNA cross-link.Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the cyclobutane ring between the thymine and psoralen is broken (Figure 2A, left, blue arrowheads). This reaction would yield a psoralen mono-adduct on one strand and an undamaged thymine on the other strand (Figure 2A, middle). Alternatively, one of the two N-glycosyl bonds between a damaged thymine and a sugar is cleaved (Figure 2A, left, red arrowhead), generating an AP site on one parental strand and a thymine-psoralen mono-adduct on the other strand (Figure 2A, right). The first model predicts that after unhooking, gap filling on only one daughter molecule should require translesion DNA synthesis (not shown), whereas the second model predicts gap filling on both daughters requires TLS (Figure 2B). To distinguish between the models, we immunodepleted the TLS DNA polymerase REV1, which is required for ICL repair (Budzowska et al., 2015Budzowska M. Graham T.G. Sobeck A. Waga S. Walter J.C. Regulation of the Rev1-pol ζ complex during bypass of a DNA interstrand cross-link.EMBO J. 2015; 34: 1971-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In REV1-depleted egg extract (Figure 2C), the vast majority of pICLPso accumulated as gapped plasmids (Figure 2D), consistent with the second model. To examine where the leading strands stalled after REV1 depletion, we digested repair intermediates with AflIII and EcoRI (Figure 2E), which allowed us to monitor rightward and leftward leading strands on the same denaturing gel (Figure 2F). After REV1 depletion, rightward and leftward leading strands both stalled at or near the −1 position (Figure 2F, middle and bottom), and there was a strong reduction in extension products (Figure 2F, top), consistent with a lesion bypass defect on both strands. We conclude that gap filling of both daughter molecules is dependent on TLS, consistent with the N-glycosyl bond cleavage model (Figure 2A, right). The N-glycosyl bond cleavage model predicts that an AP site is generated during psoralen-ICL unhooking (Figure 2A, right). To test this prediction, we recovered pICLPso repair intermediates and digested them with recombinant APE1, which cleaves the phosphodiester bond 5′ to an AP site. If an AP site is present near the ICL, simultaneous digestion with APE1 and HincII should yield 3.6-kb and 2.0-kb DNA fragments (Figure 2G). As shown in Figure 2H, APE1 and HincII digestion led to a substantial increase in 3.6-kb and 2.0-kb fragments relative to HincII digestion alone (lanes 15–28, quantified in Figure S1J). Disappearance of these fragments at later times (Figure 2H, lanes 27 and 28) resulted from translesion DNA synthesis past the AP site, after which APE1 cleavage of one strand does not create a DSB (Figure 2G). In contrast, during cisplatin-ICL repair, APE1 digestion did not increase the basal level of 3.6-kb and 2.0-kb DNA fragments that arise from FANCI-D2-dependent incisions (Figures 2H, lanes 1–14, and S1J). We conclude that AP sites are specifically generated near the lesion during psoralen-ICL repair. We also examined whether there is a mono-adduct attached to the unhooked parental strand, as predicted for N-glycosyl bond cleavage (Figure 2A, right). If the two N-glycosyl bonds are cleaved with equal probability, the mono-adduct should be detected on both parental strands. To test this idea, we digested final pICLPso repair products with AflIII and AseI so that the unmodified top and bottom strands differed by 2 nt (Figure 2I), allowing us to differentiate them on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Figure 2J, lane 1). After replication of pICLPso and digestion with AflIII and AseI, we detected the top and bottom parental strands, respectively, by strand-specific Southern blotting. As shown in lanes 3 and 5 of Figure 2J, both parental strands contained a mono-adduct. Collectively, our data strongly argue that the psoralen-ICL is unhooked via cleavage of one of the two N-glycosyl bonds forming the cross-link. Although we detected APE1 cleavage products in every pICLPso repair reaction examined, the amount varied between experiments (data not shown). Therefore, to further examine whether the N-glycosyl bond is cleaved (Figure 2A), we made a new plasmid in which the psoralen cross-link is formed between two 2′-fluoroarabino-dT nucleotides (pICLFdT-Pso; Figure 3A). The 2′ fluorine renders the thymidine N-glycosyl bond resistant to enzymatic cleavage (Maiti et al., 2009Maiti A. Morgan M.T. Drohat A.C. Role of two strictly conserved residues in nucleotide flipping and N-glycosylic bond cleavage by human thymine DNA glycosylase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36680-36688Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and should therefore inhibit the N-glycosyl bond cleavage pathway. Strikingly, when pICLFdT-Pso was replicated in egg extracts, figure 8 structures were still resolved, but the repair intermediates included HR structures and thus much more closely resembled those of pICLPt than pICLPso (Figure 3B). Accordingly, in FANCI-D2-depleted extract (Figure S2A), pICLFdT-Pso accumulated as figure 8 structures (Figure 3C, arrowhead), as seen for pICLPt (Figure S2B; Knipscheer et al., 2009Knipscheer P.

These data confirm that the psoralen-ICL formed between normal thymidines is unhooked via cleavage of the N-glycosyl bond. Moreover, when the N-glycosyl bond cannot be cleaved, the psoralen-ICL is unhooked via FANCI-D2-dependent incisions, which appear to function as a backup repair pathway (Figure S3).Figure S2Repair of a 2′FdT-Psoralen-ICL Requires FANCI-FANCD2, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) FANCI-D2 immunodepletion.

We previously showed that during pICLPt replication, CMG unloading is required to allow a leading-strand approach to the −1 position and for ICL repair (Long et al., 2014Long D.T. Joukov V. Budzowska M. Walter J.C. BRCA1 promotes unloading of the CMG helicase from a stalled DNA replication fork.Mol. Cell. 2014; 56: 174-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To address whether CMG unloading is also required for psoralen-ICL repair, we first sought a convenient and specific means to inhibit CMG unloading. Because the P97 ATPase is required for CMG unloading during DNA replication termination (Maric et al., 2014Maric M. Maculins T. De Piccoli G. Labib K. Cdc48 and a ubiquitin ligase drive disassembly of the CMG helicase at the end of DNA replication.Science. 2014; 346: 1253596Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Moreno et al., 2014Moreno S.P. Bailey R. Campion N. Herron S. Gambus A. Polyubiquitylation drives replisome disassembly at the termination of DNA replication.Science. 2014; 346: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we reasoned it might also extract CMG from forks stalled at ICLs. To test this idea, we added NMS-873, an allosteric inhibitor of P97 (Magnaghi et al., 2013Magnaghi P. D’Alessio R. Valsasina B. Avanzi N. Rizzi S. Asa D. Gasparri F. Cozzi L. Cucchi U. Orrenius C. et al.Covalent and allosteric inhibitors of the ATPase VCP/p97 induce cancer cell death.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), to egg extracts. As shown by chromatin pull-down, NMS-873 blocked the unloading of CMG from an undamaged plasmid, as expected from a defect in termination (Figure S4A), and from pICLPt (Figure 4A, left). Under these conditions, pICLPt repair intermediates accumulated as figure 8 structures (Figure 4B, lanes 6–10), and leading strands stalled at the −20 position (Figure 4C, lanes 6–10). Strikingly, although NMS-873 also prevented CMG unloading from pICLPso (Figure 4A, right), unhooking was unaffected (Figure 4B, lanes 11–20). In the presence of NMS-873, leading strands also did not arrest at the −20 position (Figure 4C, lanes 16–20), presumably because psoralen-ICL unhooking allowed CMG to travel beyond the ICL, permitting extension of the leading strand to the ICL (Figures S3i and S3ii). On the other hand, NMS-873 efficiently blocked unhooking and leading-strand extension on pICLFdT-Pso (Figures S4B and S4C), demonstrating that repair of this template requires CMG unloading, as expected given its dependence on FANCI-D2-dependent incisions. Thus, CMG unloading is essential for ICL repair via the incision pathway, but not the N-glycosyl bond cleavage p"

Here, we examine the breadth of protein-based inheritance across the yeast proteome by assessing the ability of nearly every open reading frame (ORF; ∼5,300 ORFs) to induce heritable traits. Transient overexpression of nearly 50 proteins created traits that remained heritable long after their expression returned to normal. These traits were beneficial, had prion-like patterns of inheritance, were common in wild yeasts, and could be transmitted to naive cells with protein alone. Most inducing proteins were not known prions and did not form amyloid. Instead, they are highly enriched in nucleic acid binding proteins with large intrinsically disordered domains that have been widely conserved across evolution. Thus, our data establish a common type of protein-based inheritance through which intrinsically disordered proteins can drive the emergence of new traits and adaptive opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2528176007,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, primarily due to distant metastatic disease. Metastatic lung cancer cells can undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by various transcription factors, including a double-negative feedback loop between the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family and ZEB1, but the precise mechanisms by which ZEB1-dependent EMT promotes malignancy remain largely undefined. Although the cell-intrinsic effects of EMT are important for tumor progression, the reciprocal dynamic crosstalk between mesenchymal cancer cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is equally critical in regulating invasion and metastasis. Investigating the collaborative effect of EMT and ECM in the metastatic process reveals increased collagen deposition in metastatic tumor tissues as a direct consequence of amplified collagen gene expression in ZEB1-activated mesenchymal lung cancer cells. In addition, collagen fibers in metastatic lung tumors exhibit greater linearity and organization as a result of collagen crosslinking by the lysyl oxidase (LOX) family of enzymes. Expression of the LOX and LOXL2 isoforms is directly regulated by miR-200 and ZEB1, respectively, and their upregulation in metastatic tumors and mesenchymal cell lines is coordinated to that of collagen. Functionally, LOXL2, as opposed to LOX, is the principal isoform that crosslinks and stabilizes insoluble collagen deposition in tumor tissues. In turn, focal adhesion formation and FAK/SRC signaling is activated in mesenchymal tumor cells by crosslinked collagen in the ECM. Our study is the first to validate direct regulation of LOX and LOXL2 by the miR-200/ZEB1 axis, defines a novel mechanism driving tumor metastasis, delineates collagen as a prognostic marker, and identifies LOXL2 as a potential therapeutic target against tumor progression."

These translation products associate with nuclear-encoded, imported proteins to form enzyme complexes that produce ATP. Here, we show that human mitochondrial ribosomes display translational plasticity to cope with the supply of imported nuclear-encoded subunits. Ribosomes expressing mitochondrial-encoded COX1 mRNA selectively engage with cytochrome c oxidase assembly factors in the inner membrane. Assembly defects of the cytochrome c oxidase arrest mitochondrial translation in a ribosome nascent chain complex with a partially membrane-inserted COX1 translation product. This complex represents a primed state of the translation product that can be retrieved for assembly. These findings establish a mammalian translational plasticity pathway in mitochondria that enables adaptation of mitochondrial protein synthesis to the influx of nuclear-encoded subunits."

A major part of coding genes is therefore participating in gene-metabolism interactions that expose the metabolism regulatory network and enable access to an underexplored space in gene function. Metabolic alterations play a key role in cancer, metabolic disease, pathogen infections, microbial communities, caloric restriction, and driving the aging process. Consequently, conserved metabolic regulators and sensors, including the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway, have regained focus in medicine and biotechnology (Cornu et al., 2013Cornu M. Albert V. Hall M.N. mTOR in aging, metabolism, and cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2013; 23: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, in the early days of molecular biology, the metabolic network was regularly regarded as a static, chemical “housekeeping” network (Wolstenholme and O’Connor, 1959Wolstenholme G.E.W. O’Connor C.M. Ciba foundation symposium on regulation of cell metabolism. J. & A. Churchill Ltd, London1959Crossref Google Scholar). Metabolism consequently received limited attention in the context of gene regulatory networks, and many experiments in yeast and other organisms have been conducted under supplemented growth conditions that render large parts of biosynthetic metabolism artificially dispensable (Gibney et al., 2013Gibney P.A. Lu C. Caudy A.A. Hess D.C. Botstein D. Yeast metabolic and signaling genes are required for heat-shock survival and have little overlap with the heat-induced genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For these reasons, the genome-scale picture of the regulation of biosynthesis and the interactions between genome and metabolome is so far incomplete. Accounting for a major fraction of the metabolic flux and up to three-quarters of the total mass of polar metabolites, amino acid biosynthesis, homeostasis, and catabolism constitute a quantitatively dominating component of the metabolic network (Nissen et al., 1997Nissen T.L.

Biol. 2016; 12: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Amino acids serve as precursors for protein synthesis and as intermediates in nucleotide, cofactor, and lipid synthesis, carbon and nitrogen sensing and homeostasis, and redox buffering (Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012Ljungdahl P.O.

To enable functional genomic approaches to study their metabolism, we and others have recently repaired amino acid auxotrophies in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-scale knockout collection (Winzeler et al., 1999Winzeler E.A.

We here exploit targeted metabolomics to record precise amino acid concentration profiles for all of the strains and assemble the obtained information in a genome-scale gene-metabolism interaction map. By picturing the metabolic impact of transcription and signaling that operates predominantly at the chromatin level or via homeostatic feedback by metabolism-dependent systems, the ribosome, or protein transport, we achieve global insight into the regulation and homeostasis of metabolism during cell growth. Gene deletions impact the amino acid metabolome with an unanticipated precision. This renders the absolute quantitative amino acid signatures informative about gene function, as they cluster genetic and pharmacological perturbations according to functional similarity on the genomic scale. We find that functional metabolomics provides orthogonal information in comparison to existing functional genomic data, in particular compared to physical and genetic interaction networks, and is found to be a rich resource to annotate so far uncharacterized genes. 4,913 gene-deletion strains that are viable in the absence of amino acid supplements (Figure S1A; Mülleder et al., 2012Mülleder M. Capuano F. Pir P. Christen S. Sauer U. Oliver S.G. Ralser M. A prototrophic deletion mutant collection for yeast metabolomics and systems biology.Nat.

Glutamine was found to be the highest concentrated amino acid, being three orders of magnitude more abundant than the lowest concentrated amino acid, tryptophan (Figure 1B). The average amino acid concentration was sensitive to 163 gene deletions (median, Z-test, adjusted p value < 0.01), with alanine most frequently (431) and leucine least frequently affected (25) (Figure 1C). A combined multivariate (χ2-test based on robustly estimated Mahalanobis distance, adjusted p value < 0.01) and univariate statistic (Z-test, adjusted p value < 0.01) identified a total of 1,519 (32%) genes of significant impact (Figure 1D). The individual amino acid responded by 6%–34% in terms of relative SD (Figure 1B). The concentration of amino acids did not correlate with their variability (Figure S1G), with arginine being the most variable (34%) and serine (7%), threonine (6%), valine (6%), and isoleucine (6%) the most concentration stable (Figure 1B).Figure 1Genome-Metabolome Interactions that Affect Amino Acid Biosynthetic MetabolismShow full caption(A) Amino acid quantification in a genome-scale collection of Saccharomyces gene deletion strains, grown in minimal synthetic medium, harvested in exponential phase (mean ± SD, nt0 = 92, nt8 = 83), and processed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (LC) selective reaction monitoring (SRM) for the precise quantification of amino acids.

Amino acid signatures were not a consequence of growth rate (Figure S1I), as the average amino acid profile of slow- and fast-growing strains corresponded largely to that of an average strain (Figure S1J) and only a weak correlation of growth rate and individual concentrations was detected (absolute Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient < 0.15; Figure S1K). However, several of the 5% most slow-growing strains (Breslow et al., 2008Breslow D.K. Cameron D.M. Collins S.R. Schuldiner M. Stewart-Ornstein J. Newman H.W. Braun S. Madhani H.D. Krogan N.J.

Changes in amino acid metabolism caused by gene deletion hence manifest upstream of the growth rate. Indeed, amino acid signatures were highly gene specific. 455 profiles were characterized by a single concentration change, while only 378 (25%) were characterized by more than two amino acid changes (Figure 1E). As extreme cases of specificity, we detect a genome-wide unique accumulation of glycine in the absence of the mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase subunits GCV1 and GCV2, of methionine upon deletion of the S-adenosylmethionine synthetases SAM1 and SAM2, of glutamine in yeast lacking the transcriptional regulator URE2, and of threonine in the absence of its feedback regulator, FPR1 (Figure 1F). The metabolic signatures of genes grouped according to sequence homology (Kuepfer et al., 2005Kuepfer L. Sauer U. Blank L.M. Metabolic functions of duplicate genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genome Res. 2005; 15: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) revealed metabolic specialization of typical paralogs. In 173 cases, solely one paralog altered amino acids, followed by 20 cases where each paralog created a specific signature. At least one amino acid was commonly affected in only 12 cases. Specialization is observed for all genes, as well as the subset of metabolic enzymes (Figure 1G). Genes functioning in transcription, chromatin biology, translation, protein transport, and mitochondrial biology were found to be responsible for most amino acid concentration changes in an analysis for Gene Ontology (GO) slim terms (Figure 2A). As these groups constitute large gene classes, we continued to test for specific enrichments in a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Väremo et al., 2013Väremo L. Nielsen J. Nookaew I. Enriching the gene set analysis of genome-wide data by incorporating directionality of gene expression and combining statistical hypotheses and methods.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 4378-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) based on GO term associations stored in the Saccharomyces genome database (Cherry et al., 2012Cherry J.M.

Genes participating in “translation,” “protein and vesicle transport,” “amino acid biosynthesis,” the “mitochondrion,” “ribosome biogenesis,” and “transcription/chromatin remodeling” alter metabolic profiles most frequently (Figures 2B and S2; Table S1). The network reveals a close association of amino acid biosynthesis and chromatin remodeling (Figure 2B). This is in contrast to gene-specific transcription factors (TFs) (Kemmeren et al., 2014Kemmeren P. Sameith K. van de Pasch L.A.L. Benschop J.J. Lenstra T.L. Margaritis T. O’Duibhir E.

Ranking of all gene deletions according to their metabolic impact highlights the dominating role of histone modifications and the implicated protein machinery (SWI/SNF [SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable], RSC [remodel the structure of chromatin], INO80, SAGA [Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase], and SAGA-like as well as the mediator, Cdc73/PAF1, and elongator complexes) (Figure 2D). Only intracellular transport had a comparably strong metabolic impact. This process is required for the recycling of amino acid by protein degradation and their intracellular transport. The strongest profiles are triggered by Golgi associated retrograde protein (GARP), Golgi to ER traffic (GET), and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes important for trafficking, class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) and SNARE proteins important vesicle fusion, as well as the PIKfyve/ArPIKfyve/Sac3 (PAS) complex required for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate synthesis (Figure 2E).Figure S2Identification of Cellular Processes and Components Important for Amino Acid Homeostasis over a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Related to Figures 2B–2E and Table S1Show full captionComprehensive labeling and complete probabilistic amino acid profiles for the directly associated and enriched GO terms among significantly changed deletion strains.BP, biological process; MF, molecular function; CC, cellular component.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comprehensive labeling and complete probabilistic amino acid profiles for the directly associated and enriched GO terms among significantly changed deletion strains. BP, biological process; MF, molecular function; CC, cellular component. On the genomic scale, threonine, alanine, serine, and valine change independently to other metabolites (Figure 3A), but the remaining amino acids could be assigned to groups that reflect shared biological properties. Correlated amino acids originate from a common precursor (e.g., branched chain or aromatic amino acids), share chemical similarity and function as nitrogen sensors and donors (glutamine, glutamate), or share their principal storage compartment, such as the positively charged arginine, histidine, and lysine. Furthermore, branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, which share with the Ehrlich pathway the same catabolic system, were correlated (Figure 3A). Indicative of co-regulation through the shared pathways, we addressed the function of transcription factors and kinases. Despite not being enriched as a GO category (Figure 3), 8% of altered metabolic signatures are attributed to the deletion of individual signaling kinases (51), phosphatases (11), and transcription factors (62) (Z-test, adjusted p value < 0.01). While many amino acids were dependent on both signaling and transcription factors, tryptophan was almost exclusively affected by transcriptional regulators, while two-thirds of genes affecting glutamate levels were kinases and phosphatases (Figure 3B; Table S2). Both transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional regulation are hence important to maintain the amino acid metabolome, but their relative contribution differs between metabolites. TFs, kinases, and phosphatases were then ranked to identify the most severe perturbations, which confirmed the importance of chromatin remodeling (SPT10, SNF2, UME6, and ADA2) (Figure 3C) and highlighted the importance of sensing nitrogen (GLN3), phosphate (PHO85, PHO80, PHO2, VIP1, and ADK1), and iron (AFT1), as well as the regulation of carbohydrate and energy metabolism (GCR2, HAP5, and ELM1). Of note, some of the key transcriptional regulators active under starvation and stress were only of moderate importance under the exponential growth conditions studied. This includes the unfolded protein response (UPR), the Ssy1p-Ptr3p-Ssy5p (SPS)-sensor systems, and GCN4 of the general amino acid control (GAAC) pathway, which under nutrient limitation affects all amino acid pathways except cysteine (Natarajan et al., 2001Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Transcriptional profiling shows that Gcn4p is a master regulator of gene expression during amino acid starvation in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) (Figure 3D). A similar result was obtained for the TOR1 kinase. Despite the deletion of TOR1 causes a strong amino acid signature under starvation (Zhang et al., 2011Zhang J. Vaga S. Chumnanpuen P. Kumar R. Vemuri G.N. Aebersold R. Nielsen J. Mapping the interaction of Snf1 with TORC1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 545Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), under exponential growth, its metabolic impact was not significant. However, in a network analysis, TORC1 signaling was significantly overrepresented (Figure 3D). Deletion of the TORC1 subunit TCO89, the downstream kinases SCH9 and subunits SIT4 and SAP155 of the PP2A-related protein phosphatase complex, NPR1, and the transcription factor SFP1 (Conrad et al., 2014Conrad M. Schothorst J. Kankipati H.N. Van Zeebroeck G. Rubio-Texeira M. Thevelein J.M. Nutrient sensing and signaling in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEMS Microbiol.

Target of rapamycin (TOR) in nutrient signaling and growth control.Genetics. 2011; 189: 1177-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) (Figure 3C), all triggered strong and characteristic amino acid signatures. The metabolic signatures attribute particular importance to metabolic signaling kinases, which, as exemplified by FAB1 that generates phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (Yamamoto et al., 1995Yamamoto A. DeWald D.B. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Emr S.D. Koshland D. Novel PI(4)P 5-kinase homologue, Fab1p, essential for normal vacuole function and morphology in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), were characterized by stronger profiles as protein kinases (Figure 3C). We treated yeast with rapamycin to inhibit TORC1 pharmacologically and obtained a strongly altered amino acid signature, characterized by an increase in alanine, aspartate, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, branched-chain amino acids, and aromatic amino acids as well as reduction in glycine, serine, and lysine (Figures 4A and S3). We mapped this profile to the genome-scale data and identified the Δtco89 profile to be of close resemblance (Figure 4A; Data S1, hierarchical cluster analysis). Revealing the metabolic signature to be a direct consequence of TORC1 inhibition, rapamycin treatment marginally further changed the profile of the Δtco89 strain (Figure 4B).Figure S3Reduced TORC1 Activity Produces a Specific and Informative Amino Acid Profile, Related to Figure 4Show full captionThe application of sublethal rapamycin concentration (50 nM) generates a strong response on all amino acid concentrations.

Amino acid concentrations were determined as described for untreated WT and tco89Δ (n = 3) and for treated WT (n = 6) and are represented as mean ± SD. We corroborated the metabolic effects by perturbation of TORC1 activating proteins. This includes the exit from G0 (EGO) complex (EGO1, EGO2, EGO3, and GTR1) and the GTPase activating proteins for Gtr2p (LST4/LST7) (Figure 4B). Also, the absence of other activators, such as the Seh1-associated activating TORC1 signaling (SEACAT) complex, the type 2A phosphatase scaffold protein TPD3 (Sutter et al., 2013Sutter B.M. Wu X. Laxman S. Tu B.P. Methionine inhibits autophagy and promotes growth by inducing the SAM-responsive methylation of PP2A.Cell. 2013; 154: 403-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), or the activator PIB2 (Kim and Cunningham, 2015Kim A. Cunningham K.W. A LAPF/phafin1-like protein regulates TORC1 and lysosomal membrane permeabilization in response to endoplasmic reticulum membrane stress.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2015; 26: 4631-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) resulted in a matching signature (Figure 4B). Conversely, the deletion of NPR3 of the Seh1-associated complex TORC1-inhibiting (SEACIT) complex (Neklesa and Davis, 2009Neklesa T.K. Davis R.W. A genome-wide screen for regulators of TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation reveals a conserved Npr2/3 complex.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000515Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) mirrored the metabolic profile (Figure 4B). Hence, the perturbation of TOR upstream activators mimics the metabolic signatures of rapamycin and TCO89 deletion, while the deletion of inhibitors causes opposing metabolic defects. Next, we exploited the metabolic signatures to identify the causative downstream processes. The metabolic signature of the major TORC1 effector pathways through SCH9 (Urban et al., 2007Urban J. Soulard A. Huber A. Lippman S. Mukhopadhyay D. Deloche O. Wanke V. Anrather D. Ammerer G. Riezman H. et al.Sch9 is a major target of TORC1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1467-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and the inhibition of translation with cycloheximide did not match the metabolic profile of TORC1 inhibition (Figures 4A and 4C). Instead, a comprehensive set of genes required for protein transport through the endomembrane system revealed similar metabolic defects. This included retrograde trafficking from endosome to Golgi and Golgi to ER, the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, the machinery essential for vesicle fusion (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS)/CORVET complexes), and subunits of the vacuolar ATPase (Figures 4D and 4E). 69.2% and 61.3% of mutants associated with Golgi to ER and endosome to Golgi transport (GO terms) showed altered amino acid levels. In contrast, mutants in ER to Golgi and Golgi to endosome transport, which are also not sensitive to TORC1 inhibition (Thomas et al., 2014Thomas J.D. Zhang Y.-J. Wei Y.-H. Cho J.-H. Morris L.E. Wang H.-Y. Zheng X.F.S. Rab1A is an mTORC1 activator and a colorectal oncogene.Cancer Cell. 2014; 26: 754-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), were underrepresented (Figure 4F). The closest resemblance to TORC1 inhibition was obtained for the endosomal transport processes, in particular when interrupting the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, the retromer complex, and the sorting nexins Snx4p and Snx41p (Figure 4D). Indeed, a TORC1-like signature was triggered by all subcomplexes of the ESCRT apparatus and its associated genes, DOA1 and DOA4. Furthermore, the TORC1 signature was shared upon deletion of the SNARE protein Pep12p and the tethering factor Vps3p (Figure 4D). Finally, despite slow growth, yeast lacking the clathrin light or heavy chain genes (CLC1, CHC1) and yeast with a deficiency in the integral membrane lipids phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) by deletion of VPS15 and FAB1, respectively, had matching prof"

Here, we report the crystal structure of a silkworm PIWI-clade Argonaute, Siwi, bound to the endogenous piRNA, at 2.4 Å resolution. Siwi adopts a bilobed architecture consisting of N-PAZ and MID-PIWI lobes, in which the 5' and 3' ends of the bound piRNA are anchored by the MID-PIWI and PAZ domains, respectively. A structural comparison of Siwi with AGO-clade Argonautes reveals notable differences in their nucleic-acid-binding channels, likely reflecting the distinct lengths of their guide RNAs and their mechanistic differences in guide RNA loading and cleavage product release. In addition, the structure reveals that Siwi and prokaryotic, but not eukaryotic, AGO-clade Argonautes share unexpected similarities, such as metal-dependent 5'-phosphate recognition and a potential structural transition during the catalytic-tetrad formation. Overall, this study provides a critical starting point toward a mechanistic understanding of piRNA-mediated transposon silencing."

These studies show how the effects of functionally independent non-coding variants in a coordinated gene regulatory network amplify their individually small effects, providing a model for complex disorders. Regulatory control of gene expression is the fundamental basis for cell differentiation during organismal development. Gene expression control is modular, using a current set of biochemical signals to alter the expression of a specific set of target genes affecting subsequent cellular functions (Davidson, 2006Davidson E.H. The regulatory genome: gene regulatory networks in development and evolution, New edn. Academic, Burlington, MA2006Google Scholar). These modules are not arbitrary but have adapted during evolution to have specific motifs that encode classes of gene expression control (Alon, 2007Alon U. An introduction to systems biology: design principles of biological circuits. Chapman & Hall/CRC, Boca Raton, FL2007Google Scholar). Thus, the function of a gene should not be considered in isolation but in the context of its gene regulatory network (GRN), i.e., the set of genes and their products that interact to control specific cell functions. GRNs are coordinated through cis-regulatory elements (CRE), chiefly enhancers, which integrate signals from numerous transcription factors (TFs), lineage markers and signaling proteins within a cell type to modulate target gene expression (Alon, 2007Alon U. An introduction to systems biology: design principles of biological circuits. Chapman & Hall/CRC, Boca Raton, FL2007Google Scholar, Davidson, 2006Davidson E.H. The regulatory genome: gene regulatory networks in development and evolution, New edn. Academic, Burlington, MA2006Google Scholar). Therefore, perturbations of these GRNs are highly relevant to human disease. This can be particularly relevant for multifactorial disorders that arise mostly from non-coding variants within cell-type-specific CREs (Bauer et al., 2013Bauer D.E. Kamran S.C. Lessard S. Xu J.

Chakravarti A. Cohen J.C. Hardy J. Mendelian disorders and multifactorial traits: the big divide or one for all?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mendelian and multifactorial diseases also differ in the magnitude of the effect of disease-associated variants: the latter have small-to-modest risks making their detection difficult (Manolio et al., 2009Manolio T.A.

Common genetic variation and human traits.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 1696-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). However, three recent advances strongly argue against this view: (1) the genomic segment relevant to transcriptional control of a gene is highly organized into a topologically associated domain (TAD) within which CREs interact with greater frequency than with elements outside (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B.

ENCODE Project ConsortiumAn integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11104) Google Scholar); and (3) multiple enhancer use for a specific gene is dynamic and interactive during development (Andrey et al., 2013Andrey G. Montavon T. Mascrez B. Gonzalez F. Noordermeer D. Leleu M. Trono D. Spitz F. Duboule D. A switch between topological domains underlies HoxD genes collinearity in mouse limbs.Science. 2013; 340: 1234167Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, Davidson, 2006Davidson E.H. The regulatory genome: gene regulatory networks in development and evolution, New edn. Academic, Burlington, MA2006Google Scholar). This suggests the hypothesis that combinations of sequence variants within multiple enhancers of a gene, depending on temporal use and transcriptional effect, not individual variants, are the primary yet variable risk factors in a complex disease. The first evidence of multiple CREs controlling mammalian gene expression arose from studies of beta hemoglobin (Grosveld et al., 1987Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Position-independent, high-level expression of the human beta-globin gene in transgenic mice.Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), shown subsequently to be deleted in some thalassemias (Driscoll et al., 1989Driscoll M.C. Dobkin C.S. Alter B.P. Gamma delta beta-thalassemia due to a de novo mutation deleting the 5′ beta-globin gene activation-region hypersensitive sites.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 7470-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). More recently, mutations in an evolutionary conserved limb enhancer of sonic hedgehog was shown to cause preaxial polydactyly in humans and other species (Lettice et al., 2003Lettice L.A. Heaney S.J. Purdie L.A. Li L. de Beer P. Oostra B.A. Goode D. Elgar G. Hill R.E. de Graaff E.

Genet. 2003; 12: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Here, we extend these observations to multifactorial Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) by demonstrating that the causal defect arises from the synergistic effects of polymorphisms in multiple RET enhancers that reduce RET gene expression and affects its entire GRN through feedback mechanisms. HSCR or congenital intestinal aganglionosis is a severe but common (∼15/100,000 live births) developmental disorder of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in which the gut fails to be innervated and loses motility: the resulting aganglionosis is always caudal to rostral, and partial but contiguous (Chakravarti and Lyonnet, 2001Chakravarti A.M.A.S. Lyonnet S. Hirschsprung Disease.in: Valle D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Antonarakis S.E. Ballabio A. Gibson K. Mitchell G. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, 2001Google Scholar). Genetic studies have identified rare, high-penetrance coding variants in 14 genes (RET, GDNF, NRTN, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, ZFHX1B, TCF4, PHOX2B, KBP, L1CAM, SEMA3C, and SEMA3D) that together explain ∼10% of cases, usually syndromic and severe forms (Alves et al., 2013Alves M.M.

Genet. 2015; 96: 581-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All known HSCR genes are expressed in enteric neuroblasts or their supporting mesenchymal cells, are involved in the early stages of fate determination of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs), and affect their subsequent survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation into neurons (Heanue and Pachnis, 2007Heanue T.A. Pachnis V. Enteric nervous system development and Hirschsprung’s disease: advances in genetic and stem cell studies.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Of these, the most frequent coding mutations occur in RET, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase (Emison et al., 2010Emison E.S. Garcia-Barcelo M. Grice E.A. Lantieri F. Amiel J. Burzynski G. Fernandez R.M. Hao L. Kashuk C. West K. et al.Differential contributions of rare and common, coding and noncoding Ret mutations to multifactorial Hirschsprung disease liability.Am. J. Hum.

Green E.D. Chakravarti A. A common sex-dependent mutation in a RET enhancer underlies Hirschsprung disease risk.Nature. 2005; 434: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, significantly greater risk to the more common, isolated, non-syndromic HSCR arises from three polymorphic, low-penetrance non-coding variants at RET (rs2435357, rs2506030) and SEMA3C/D (rs11766001), in patients of European ancestry (Kapoor et al., 2015Kapoor A. Jiang Q. Chatterjee S. Chakraborty P. Sosa M.X. Berrios C. Chakravarti A. Population variation in total genetic risk of Hirschsprung disease from common RET, SEMA3 and NRG1 susceptibility polymorphisms.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 2997-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Of these, we have shown that the RET intronic variant rs2435357 has high (∼24%) allele frequency, disrupts SOX10 binding to a fetal gut enhancer (CRE: RET+3), reduces RET expression, and increases Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) risk 4-fold (Emison et al., 2010Emison E.S. Garcia-Barcelo M. Grice E.A. Lantieri F. Amiel J. Burzynski G. Fernandez R.M. Hao L. Kashuk C.

Genet. 2010; 87: 60-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that RET loss-of-function is necessary, but not sufficient, for clinical expression of HSCR based on the following observations in human patients, mouse models, human fetal gut tissue, and cellular assays: (1) nearly every HSCR patient carries at least one non-coding RET deficiency allele, the risk arising largely from three common, non-coding, interacting RET alleles (rs2506030 at RET-7, rs7069590 at RET-5.5, and rs2435357 at RET+3; see STAR Methods for nomenclature explanation and Figure 1B for schematic representation of the position of each named RET CRE) with increased risk jointly specified by RET-5.5 and RET+3 with modulation by RET-7; (2) each risk allele resides within a Ret enhancer (CRE) active during mouse gut development, with RET-7, RET-5.5, and RET+3 being bound by Rarb, Gata2, and Sox10, respectively; (3) enhancer use is dynamic with all three enhancers active early in gut development but only RET+3 active later; (4) each risk variant significantly reduces its cognate enhancer activity through reduced binding of its respective TF, leading to reduced Ret gene expression; and (5) in vitro and in vivo reduction of RET gene expression perturbs the entire RET GRN, including the genes that affect its production through TFs (SOX10, GATA2), its activation (GDNF, GFRA1), and its signal termination (CBL), through distinct and conserved feedback mechanisms. These results provide an explanation of how HSCR arises from amplification of the effects of multiple low-penetrance enhancer variants through coordinate dysregulation of the entire RET GRN, comprising unlinked but functionally related genes. Given the existence of one loss-of-function enhancer allele at RET leading to HSCR (Emison et al., 2010Emison E.S. Garcia-Barcelo M. Grice E.A. Lantieri F. Amiel J. Burzynski G. Fernandez R.M. Hao L.

Thus, we searched a 153 Kb region upstream of RET for all known and predicted RET enhancers, a region associated in our prior genome-wide association study (GWAS)(Jiang et al., 2015Jiang Q. Arnold S.

Of 146 variants, 38 were associated (p ≤ 5 × 10−8) either by direct genotyping or imputation based on a prior GWAS (Jiang et al., 2015Jiang Q. Arnold S. Heanue T. Kilambi K.P. Doan B. Kapoor A.

Association of an individual variant can arise from causality or linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a causal variant; thus, we restricted attention to eight SNPs in CREs that overlapped known TF-bound regions assessed in the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH (Figure 1B; Table S1) (Consortium, 2012Consortium T.E.P. ENCODE Project ConsortiumAn integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11104) Google Scholar). These variants were tested for differential luciferase activity by cloning 1kb fragments containing either the reference or the variant allele into the pGL4.23 vector with a minimal TATA-box of the mouse β-globin gene transfected into Ret-expressing Neuro2A cells. All eight CREs acted as enhancers, five with similar activity for both alleles (Figure 1C); however, CREs containing three variants—allele G at rs2506030 (RET-7), allele T at rs7069590 (RET-5.5), and allele T at rs2435357 (RET+3)—showed statistically significant reduction in reporter activity (Figure 1C). In support of their potential disease role, these variant alleles increased HSCR risk (see next section). The non-risk allele (A) at rs2506030 for RET-7 (chr10: 43,447,346-43,448,347) showed a 4.3-fold increased luciferase activity as compared to the control (basal promoter) while its risk allele (G) showed a 1.7-fold drop in activity compared to the non-risk allele (p = 6 × 10−4). The corresponding values for rs7069590 in RET-5.5 (chr10: 43,552,395-43,553,394) were 5.8-fold increase and 1.4-fold decrease (p = 1.6 × 10−6) and for rs2435357 at RET+3 (chr10: 43,581,812-43,582,711) were 12.7-fold increase and 1.9-fold decrease (p = 9 × 10−9). These three CREs are, therefore, potential enhancers, consistent with their electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) results, using a 20-bp Cy5-labeled probe centered on each variant and using nuclear extracts from Neuro2A cells; further, the observed protein-DNA binding can be abrogated by a 10-bp deletion containing the SNP (Figure S1). Our forward genetic screen identified three putative functionally independent HSCR-associated enhancer variants among many other candidates that do not lie within known CREs: the previously discovered rs2435357 (Emison et al., 2005Emison E.S. McCallion A.S. Kashuk C.S. Bush R.T. Grice E. Lin S. Portnoy M.E. Cutler D.J. Green E.D. Chakravarti A. A common sex-dependent mutation in a RET enhancer underlies Hirschsprung disease risk.Nature. 2005; 434: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), one ∼125 kb upstream of RET (rs2506030) recently identified as a sentinel variant in GWAS (Jiang et al., 2015Jiang Q. Arnold S. Heanue T. Kilambi K.P. Doan B. Kapoor A. Ling A.Y. Sosa M.X. Guy M. Jiang Q. et al.Functional loss of semaphorin 3C and/or semaphorin 3D and their epistatic interaction with ret are critical to Hirschsprung disease liability.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2015; 96: 581-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and a new variant ∼18kb upstream of RET (rs7069590). To examine their individual and joint effects, we genotyped them in 346 HSCR probands and 732 controls, all of European ancestry (Tables 1 and S2) to demonstrate three features. First, individual risk alleles are pervasive and have major effects, with frequencies of 41%, 76%, and 25% in European controls increasing to 56%, 84%, and 58% in HSCR cases for rs2506030 (allele G), rs7069590 (allele T), and rs2435357 (allele T) with highly significant odds ratios of 1.8 (p = 4.46 × 10−11), 1.7 (p = 4.36 × 10−6), and 4.1 (p = 3.31 × 10−50), respectively. Second, most humans have at least one non-coding RET risk allele: homozygosity for the non-risk ACC haplotype is 1.7% in cases and 3.7% in controls. Third, there is wide variation in HSCR risk across variant haplotypes. We estimated the odds ratio for each haplotype relative to haplotype ACC that was free of any risk alleles; clearly, risk is elevated only for ATT (OR 3.13, 95% CI: 2.17-4.50, p = 8.31 × 10−10) and GTT (OR 4.40, 95% CI: 3.26-5.94, p = 3.62 × 10−22) haplotypes (Table 1). These haplotype effects are not the result of LD within the RET locus only since, in control samples, rs2506030, rs7069590, and rs2435357 are very weakly associated (all three pairwise r2 values ∼0.08; Figure S2) but demonstrate significantly greater LD on haplotypes from affected individuals (rs2506030 - rs2435357: r2 = 0.16, p = 0.03 versus controls; rs7069590 - rs2435357: r2 = 0.19, p = 0.005 versus controls; rs2506030 - rs769590 in cases: r2 = 0.11, p = 0.4 versus controls). Haplotype effects are, therefore, also a consequence of epistasis between risk variants, chiefly between rs7069590 (allele T) and rs2435357 (allele T) with further modulation by rs2506030 (allele G) (Table 1). Since HSCR risk is sex dependent (Badner et al., 1990Badner J.A. Sieber W.K. Garver K.L. Chakravarti A. A genetic study of Hirschsprung disease.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 568-580PubMed Google Scholar, Emison et al., 2010Emison E.S. Garcia-Barcelo M. Grice E.A. Lantieri F. Amiel J. Burzynski G. Fernandez R.M. Hao L. Kashuk C.

Males show significant risk from both ATT (OR 3.06, 95% CI: 1.84-5.07, p = 1.53 × 10−5) and GTT (OR 5.47, 95% CI: 3.53-8.48, p = 2.91 × 10−14) haplotypes, as in the total data, but females show significant risk (OR 3.23, 95% CI: 1.91-5.46, p = 1.17 × 10−5) from GTT haplotypes only (Figure S3). These results are consistent with a higher male risk effect but the big (2.6-fold) difference in sample size between male and female probands lowers the statistical power of testing for sex differences in risk.Table 1RET Haplotype-Specific Risks of Hirschsprung DiseaseHaplotypeFrequency in cases (n = 346)Frequency in controls (n = 732)Odds ratio (95% CI)Prs2506030 (RET-7)rs7069590 (RET-5.5)rs2435357 (RET+3)ACC0.120.201 (reference)–G∗CC0.030.041.39 (0.80-2.43)0.24AT∗C0.170.320.91 (0.66-1.25)0.54G∗T∗C0.110.200.96 (0.68-1.36)0.82AT∗T∗0.140.083.13 (2.17-4.50)8.31 × 10−10G∗T∗T∗0.420.164.40 (3.26-5.94)3.62 × 10−22Haplotypes for three polymorphisms (rs2506030, rs7069590, and rs2435357) located within the enhancers RET-7, RET-5.5, and RET+3, 124.6 kb upstream, 19.6 kb upstream, and 9.5 kb downstream of the RET transcription start site, respectively, are shown. ∗ denotes risk alleles.

NGI-1 blocked EGFR signaling in non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines and promoted cell-cycle arrest and senescence. Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation is a protein modification critical for glycoprotein folding, stability, and cellular localization. To identify small molecules that inhibit new targets in this biosynthetic pathway, we initiated a cell-based high-throughput screen and lead-compound-optimization campaign that delivered a cell-permeable inhibitor, NGI-1. NGI-1 targets oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), a hetero-oligomeric enzyme that exists in multiple isoforms and transfers oligosaccharides to recipient proteins. In non-small-cell lung cancer cells, NGI-1 blocks cell-surface localization and signaling of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) glycoprotein, but selectively arrests proliferation in only those cell lines that are dependent on EGFR (or fibroblast growth factor, FGFR) for survival. In these cell lines, OST inhibition causes cell-cycle arrest accompanied by induction of p21, autofluorescence, and cell morphology changes, all hallmarks of senescence. These results identify OST inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for treating receptor-tyrosine-kinase-dependent tumors and provides a chemical probe for reversibly regulating N-linked glycosylation in mammalian cells."

The intrinsic diffraction limit of light makes visualization of individual signaling complexes using visible light extremely difficult. However, using super-resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), we observed intimate association of individual molecules within signaling complexes containing ion channels (M-type K+, L-type Ca2+, or TRPV1 channels) and G protein-coupled receptors coupled by the scaffolding protein A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP)79/150. Some channels assembled as multi-channel supercomplexes. Surprisingly, we identified novel layers of interplay within macromolecular complexes containing diverse channel types at the single-complex level in sensory neurons, dependent on AKAP79/150. Electrophysiological studies revealed that such ion channels are functionally coupled as well. Our findings illustrate the novel role of AKAP79/150 as a molecular coupler of different channels that conveys crosstalk between channel activities within single microdomains in tuning the physiological response of neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2551833309,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) ion channel has an essential function in modulating cell survival following oxidant injury and is highly expressed in many cancers including neuroblastoma. Here, in xenografts generated from neuroblastoma cells in which TRPM2 was depleted with CRISPR/Cas9 technology and in in vitro experiments, tumor growth was significantly inhibited and doxorubicin sensitivity increased. The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1/2α (HIF-1/2α) signaling cascade including proteins involved in oxidant stress, glycolysis, and mitochondrial function was suppressed by TRPM2 depletion. TRPM2-depleted SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells demonstrated reduced oxygen consumption and ATP production after doxorubicin, confirming impaired cellular bioenergetics. In cells in which TRPM2 was depleted, mitochondrial superoxide production was significantly increased, particularly following doxorubicin. Ectopic expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) reduced ROS and preserved viability of TRPM2-depleted cells, however, failed to restore ATP levels. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also significantly increased in cells in which TRPM2 function was inhibited by TRPM2-S, and pretreatment of these cells with the antioxidant MitoTEMPO significantly reduced ROS levels in response to doxorubicin and protected cell viability. Expression of the TRPM2 pore mutant E960D, in which calcium entry through TRPM2 is abolished, also resulted in significantly increased mitochondrial ROS following doxorubicin treatment, showing the critical role of TRPM2-mediated calcium entry. These findings demonstrate the important function of TRPM2 in modulation of cell survival through mitochondrial ROS, and the potential of targeted inhibition of TRPM2 as a therapeutic approach to reduce cellular bioenergetics, tumor growth, and enhance susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents."

The level of women's knowledge about cervical cancer is not well documented in Ethiopia. The current study sought to assess women's knowledge about cervical cancer and associated factors.A community based cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of 620 women aged 15-49 years residing in Dessie town, Northeast Ethiopia. Respondents were selected using a multistage sampling technique. The women were interviewed at home by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire on cervical cancer knowledge. Knowledge about cervical cancer was measured using an eight item instrument. The maximum possible score was 8; those scoring 5 or more were categorized as having ""sufficient"" knowledge. Binary and multiple logistic regressions were employed to determine factors associated with knowledge about cervical cancer.A total of 51% of the participants had sufficient knowledge about cervical cancer. After adjusting for covariates, having sufficient knowledge about cervical cancer was positively associated with better educational level and income. Women with primary education (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 3.4; 95% CI: 2.2-5.1) and those who had secondary and above education (AOR: 8.7; 95% CI: 5.5-13.7) were more likely to have sufficient knowledge about cervical cancer compared to those who had no formal education. Furthermore, women earning an average household monthly income above 1500 Ethiopian birr (ETB) (~75 U.S. dollars) were more likely to have sufficient knowledge (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3-3.9) than women with an average household monthly income less than 500 ETB (~25 U.S. dollars).This study shows a suboptimal knowledge about cervical cancer regarding its risk factors, signs and symptoms, prevention and treatment among women in the study site. The level of education and economic status were found to be important determinants for knowledge about cervical cancer.

RAI1 encodes a nuclear protein but little is known about its molecular function or the cell types responsible for SMS symptoms. Using genetically engineered mice, we found that Rai1 preferentially occupies DNA regions near active promoters and promotes the expression of a group of genes involved in circuit assembly and neuronal communication. Behavioral analyses demonstrated that pan-neural loss of Rai1 causes deficits in motor function, learning, and food intake. These SMS-like phenotypes are produced by loss of Rai1 function in distinct neuronal types: Rai1 loss in inhibitory neurons or subcortical glutamatergic neurons causes learning deficits, while Rai1 loss in Sim1+ or SF1+ cells causes obesity. By integrating molecular and organismal analyses, our study suggests potential therapeutic avenues for a complex neurodevelopmental disorder."

They are not only responsible for the mechanical properties but also for various physiological activities in different cells and tissues. The building blocks of IFs are extended coiled-coil-forming proteins exhibiting a characteristic central α-helical domain (rod). The fundamental principles of the filament assembly mechanism and the network formation have been widely elucidated for the cytoplasmic IF protein vimentin. Also, a comprehensive structural model for the tetrameric complex of vimentin has been obtained by X-ray crystallography in combination with various biochemical and biophysical techniques. To extend these static data and to investigate the dynamic properties of the full-length proteins in solution during the various assembly steps, we analyzed the patterns of hydrogen-deuterium exchange in vimentin and in four variants carrying point mutations in the IF consensus motifs present at either end of the α-helical rod that cause an assembly arrest at the unit-length filament (ULF) stage. The results yielded unique insights into the structural properties of subdomains within the full-length vimentin, in particular in regions of contact in α-helical and linker segments that stabilize different oligomeric forms such as tetramers, ULFs, and mature filaments. Moreover, hydrogen-deuterium exchange analysis of the point-mutated variants directly demonstrated the active role of the IF consensus motifs in the oligomerization mechanism of tetramers during ULF formation. Ultimately, using molecular dynamics simulation procedures, we provide a structural model for the subdomain-mediated tetramer/tetramer interaction via cross-coiling as the first step of the assembly process."
https://openalex.org/W2525821325,"The correlation between aberrant DNA methylation with cancer promotion and progression has prompted an interest in discerning the associated regulatory mechanisms. Kaiso (ZBTB33) is a specialized transcription factor that selectively recognizes methylated CpG-containing sites as well as a sequence-specific DNA target. Increasing reports link ZBTB33 overexpression and transcriptional activities with metastatic potential and poor prognosis in cancer, although there is little mechanistic insight into how cells harness ZBTB33 transcriptional capabilities to promote and progress disease. Here we report mechanistic details for how ZBTB33 mediates cell-specific cell cycle regulation. By utilizing ZBTB33 depletion and overexpression studies, it was determined that in HeLa cells ZBTB33 directly occupies the promoters of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1, inducing proliferation by promoting retinoblastoma phosphorylation and allowing for E2F transcriptional activity that accelerates G1- to S-phase transition. Conversely, in HEK293 cells ZBTB33 indirectly regulates cyclin E abundance resulting in reduced retinoblastoma phosphorylation, decreased E2F activity, and decelerated G1 transition. Thus, we identified a novel mechanism by which ZBTB33 mediates the cyclin D1/cyclin E1/RB1/E2F pathway, controlling passage through the G1 restriction point and accelerating cancer cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2527610520,"Eosinophils are major effector cells during allergic responses and helminth infections. Recent studies further highlight eosinophils as important players in many other biological processes. Therefore it is important to understand how these cells can be modulated in terms of survival and effector function. In the present study we investigated how eosinophils respond to the alarmin IL-33. We show that IL-33 promotes eosinophil survival in a ST2- and MyD88-dependent manner. IL-33-mediated protection from apoptosis was dependent on autocrine GM-CSF release. In addition, GM-CSF increased the IL-33-induced secretion of IL-4 and IL-13 from eosinophils. Unexpectedly, this effect was further enhanced by cross-linking of Siglec-F, a proposed inhibitory and apopotosis-inducing receptor on eosinophils. Co-culture experiments with eosinophils and macrophages revealed that the IL-33-induced release of IL-4 and IL-13 from eosinophils was required for differentiation of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs). The differentiation of AAMs could be further increased in the presence of GM-CSF. These results indicate that cross-talk between Siglec-F and the receptors for IL-33, LPS and GM-CSF plays an important role for efficient secretion of IL-4 and IL-13. Deciphering the molecular details of this cross-talk could lead to the development of new therapeutic option to treat eosinophil-associated diseases."

Spectrophotometric experiments in combination with enzymatic assays in solution showed that TsdB acts as an effective electron acceptor of TsdA in vitro when TsdA and TsdB originate from the same source organism. Although TsdA covers a range from −300 to +150 mV, TsdB is redox active between −100 and +300 mV, thus enabling electron transfer between these hemoproteins. The three-dimensional structure of the TsdB-TsdA fusion protein from the purple sulfur bacterium Marichromatium purpuratum was solved by X-ray crystallography to 2.75 Å resolution providing insights into internal electron transfer. In the oxidized state, this tetraheme cytochrome c contains three hemes with axial His/Met ligation, whereas heme 3 exhibits the His/Cys coordination typical for TsdA active sites. Interestingly, thiosulfate is covalently bound to Cys330 on heme 3. In several bacteria, including Allochromatium vinosum, TsdB is not present, precluding a general and essential role for electron flow. Both AvTsdA and the MpTsdBA fusion react efficiently in vitro with high potential iron-sulfur protein from A. vinosum (Em +350 mV).

In the oxidized state, this tetraheme cytochrome c contains three hemes with axial His/Met ligation, whereas heme 3 exhibits the His/Cys coordination typical for TsdA active sites. Interestingly, thiosulfate is covalently bound to Cys330 on heme 3. In several bacteria, including Allochromatium vinosum, TsdB is not present, precluding a general and essential role for electron flow. Both AvTsdA and the MpTsdBA fusion react efficiently in vitro with high potential iron-sulfur protein from A. vinosum (Em +350 mV). High potential iron-sulfur protein not only acts as direct electron donor to the reaction center in anoxygenic phototrophs but can also be involved in aerobic respiratory chains."

The present study explores decision making in Substance use disorder (SUD), Gambling disorder (GD) and Obesity (OB) when assessed by Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and compares them with healthy controls (HC). Methods For the aims of this study, 591 participants (194 HC, 178 GD, 113 OB, 106 SUD) were assessed according to DSM criteria, completed a sociodemographic interview and conducted the IGT. Results SUD, GD and OB present impaired decision making when compared to the HC in the overall task and task learning, however no differences are found for the overall performance in the IGT among the clinical groups. Results also reveal some specific learning across the task patterns within the clinical groups: OB maintains negative scores until the third set where learning starts but with a less extend to HC, SUD presents an early learning followed by a progressive although slow improvement and GD presents more random choices with no learning. Conclusions Decision making impairments are present in the studied clinical samples and they display individual differences in the task learning. Results can help understanding the underlying mechanisms of OB and addiction behaviors as well as improve current clinical treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2529833387,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, and it involves extensive local tumour invasion, metastasis and poor prognosis. Understanding the mechanisms regulating the progression of GC is necessary for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Transducin (β)-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) is an important regulator controlling gene activation and repression, which has been thought to be involved in tumorigenesis. However, the role of TBL1XR1 in human GC remains largely unknown. Here, we find that TBL1XR1 is aberrantly expressed in human GC tissues, and TBL1XR1 levels are highly correlated with local tumour invasion, late tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) stage and poor prognosis. Knockdown of TBL1XR1 by shRNA inhibits GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro, as well as tumorigenesis and peritoneal metastasis in vivo, whereas overexpression of TBL1XR1 produces the opposite effects. These effects are mediated by activation of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway, and inhibition of this pathway with a specific ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126) significantly impairs the tumour-promoting effects induced by TBL1XR1. Moreover, TBL1XR1 mediated ERK1/2 activation is dependent on the β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR signalling pathway. In conclusion, TBL1XR1 contributes to GC tumorigenesis and progression through the activation of the β-catenin/MMP7/EGFR/ERK signalling pathway and may act as a new therapeutic target for GC."
https://openalex.org/W2525609606,"Although the therapeutic effects of Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) have been recognized in pre-clinical and pilot clinical studies, the effect of different stimulation configurations on the cardiovascular response is still an open question, especially in the case of VNS delivered synchronously with cardiac activity. In this paper, we propose a formal mathematical methodology to analyze the acute cardiac response to different VNS configurations, jointly considering the chronotropic, dromotropic and inotropic cardiac effects. A latin hypercube sampling method was chosen to design a uniform experimental plan, composed of 75 different VNS configurations, with different values for the main parameters (current amplitude, number of delivered pulses, pulse width, interpulse period and the delay between the detected cardiac event and VNS onset). These VNS configurations were applied to 6 healthy, anesthetized sheep, while acquiring the associated cardiovascular response. Unobserved VNS configurations were estimated using a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model. In order to quantitatively analyze the effect of each parameter and their combinations on the cardiac response, the Sobol sensitivity method was applied to the obtained GPR model and inter-individual sensitivity markers were estimated using a bootstrap approach. Results highlight the dominant effect of pulse current, pulse width and number of pulses, which explain respectively 49.4%, 19.7% and 6.0% of the mean global cardiovascular variability provoked by VNS. More interestingly, results also quantify the effect of the interactions between VNS parameters. In particular, the interactions between current and pulse width provoke higher cardiac effects than the changes on the number of pulses alone (between 6 and 25% of the variability). Although the sensitivity of individual VNS parameters seems similar for chronotropic, dromotropic and inotropic responses, the interacting effects of VNS parameters provoke significantly different cardiac responses, showing the feasibility of a parameter-based functional selectivity. These results are of primary importance for the optimal, subject-specific definition of VNS parameters for a given therapy and may lead to new closed-loop methods allowing for the optimal adaptation of VNS therapy through time."
https://openalex.org/W2524090577,"Chinese dark teas (CDTs) are now among the popular tea beverages worldwide due to their unique health benefits. Because the production of CDTs involves fermentation that is characterized by the effect of microbes, microorganisms are believed to play critical roles in the determination of the chemical characteristics of CDTs. Some dominant fungi have been identified from CDTs. In contrast, little, if anything, is known about the composition of bacterial community in CDTs. This study was set to investigate the diversity and variation of bacterial community in four major types of CDTs from China. First, the composition of the bacterial community of CDTs was determined using MiSeq sequencing. From the four typical CDTs, a total of 238 genera that belong to 128 families of bacteria were detected, including most of the families of beneficial bacteria known to be associated with fermented food. While different types of CDTs had generally distinct bacterial structures, the two types of brick teas produced from adjacent regions displayed strong similarity in bacterial composition, suggesting that the producing environment and processing condition perhaps together influence bacterial succession in CDTs. The global characterization of bacterial communities in CDTs is an essential first step for us to understand their function in fermentation and their potential impact on human health. Such knowledge will be important guidance for improving the production of CDTs with higher quality and elevated health benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2525734015,"Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major phospholipid of mitochondria, comprising 40-50% of both the outer and the inner membranes. However, PC must be imported from its production organelles because mitochondria lack the enzymes essential for PC biosynthesis. In a previous study, we found that StarD7 mediates the intracellular transfer of PC to mitochondria. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the contribution of StarD7 to the maintenance of mitochondrial phospholipid content and function using siRNA-mediated knockdown and knock-out (KO) of the StarD7 gene in HEPA-1 cells. Real time analysis of respiratory activity demonstrated that the oxygen consumption rate and activity of mitochondrial complexes were impaired in StarD7-KD cells. To confirm these results, we established StarD7-KO HEPA-1 cells by double nicking using CRISPR/Cas9n. As expected, StarD7-KD and -KO cells showed a significant reduction in mitochondrial PC content. The ATP level and growth rate of KO cells were notably lower compared with wild-type cells when cultured in glucose-free galactose-containing medium to force cells to rely on mitochondrial ATP production. In KO cells, the level of the MTCO1 protein, a primary subunit of complex IV, was reduced without a concomitant decrease in its mRNA, but the level was restored when StarD7-I was overexpressed. StarD7-KO cells showed impaired formation of the mitochondrial supercomplexes and exhibited a disorganized cristae structure, with no changes in optic atrophy 1 protein. These findings indicate that StarD7 plays important roles in maintaining the proper composition of mitochondrial phospholipids as well as mitochondrial function and morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2523888156,"We conducted a systematic review of mathematical models of transmission dynamic of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in healthcare settings, to provide an overview of existing models and their assessment of different CDI control strategies.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science up to February 3, 2016 for transmission-dynamic models of Clostridium difficile in healthcare settings. The models were compared based on their natural history representation of Clostridium difficile, which could include health states (S-E-A-I-R-D: Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infectious-Resistant-Deceased) and the possibility to include healthcare workers and visitors (vectors of transmission). Effectiveness of interventions was compared using the relative reduction (compared to no intervention or current practice) in outcomes such as incidence of colonization, CDI, CDI recurrence, CDI mortality, and length of stay.Nine studies describing six different models met the inclusion criteria. Over time, the models have generally increased in complexity in terms of natural history and transmission dynamics and number/complexity of interventions/bundles of interventions examined. The models were categorized into four groups with respect to their natural history representation: S-A-I-R, S-E-A-I, S-A-I, and S-E-A-I-R-D. Seven studies examined the impact of CDI control strategies. Interventions aimed at controlling the transmission, lowering CDI vulnerability and reducing the risk of recurrence/mortality were predicted to reduce CDI incidence by 3-49%, 5-43% and 5-29%, respectively. Bundles of interventions were predicted to reduce CDI incidence by 14-84%.Although CDI is a major public health problem, there are very few published transmission-dynamic models of Clostridium difficile. Published models vary substantially in the interventions examined, the outcome measures used and the representation of the natural history of Clostridium difficile, which make it difficult to synthesize results and provide a clear picture of optimal intervention strategies. Future modeling efforts should pay specific attention to calibration, structural uncertainties, and transparent reporting practices."
https://openalex.org/W2557326422,"Liver receptor homolog 1 (NR5A2, LRH-1) is an orphan nuclear hormone receptor that regulates diverse biological processes, including metabolism, proliferation, and the resolution of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Although preclinical and cellular studies demonstrate that LRH-1 has great potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases and cancer, development of LRH-1 modulators has been difficult. Recently, systematic modifications to one of the few known chemical scaffolds capable of activating LRH-1 failed to improve efficacy substantially. Moreover, mechanisms through which LRH-1 is activated by synthetic ligands are entirely unknown. Here, we use x-ray crystallography and other structural methods to explore conformational changes and receptor-ligand interactions associated with LRH-1 activation by a set of related agonists. Unlike phospholipid LRH-1 ligands, these agonists bind deep in the pocket and do not interact with residues near the mouth nor do they expand the pocket like phospholipids. Unexpectedly, two closely related agonists with similar efficacies (GSK8470 and RJW100) exhibit completely different binding modes. The dramatic repositioning is influenced by a differential ability to establish stable face-to-face π-π-stacking with the LRH-1 residue His-390, as well as by a novel polar interaction mediated by the RJW100 hydroxyl group. The differing binding modes result in distinct mechanisms of action for the two agonists. Finally, we identify a network of conserved water molecules near the ligand-binding site that are important for activation by both agonists. This work reveals a previously unappreciated complexity associated with LRH-1 agonist development and offers insights into rational design strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2524759568,"Knowledge of the relative influence of population- versus species-level genetic variation is important to understand patterns of phenotypic variation and ecological relationships that exist among and within morphologically indistinguishable cryptic species and subspecies. In the case of cryptic species groups that are pests, such knowledge is also essential for devising effective population management strategies. The globally important crop pest Thrips tabaci is a taxonomically difficult group of putatively cryptic species. This study examines population genetic structure of T. tabaci and reproductive isolation among lineages of this species complex using microsatellite markers and mitochondrial COI sequences. Overall, genetic structure supports T. tabaci as a cryptic species complex, although limited interbreeding occurs between different clonal groups from the same lineage as well as between individuals from different lineages. These results also provide evidence that thelytoky and arrhenotoky are not fixed phenotypes among members of different T. tabaci lineages that have been generally associated with either reproductive mode. Possible biological and ecological factors contributing to these observations are discussed."

Although sequence similarity between different START domains can be very low, all are characterized by a specific fold consisting of four α-helices and a nine-stranded twisted antiparallel β-sheet that together form a cavity in which a hydrophobic phospholipid or sterol is held (2.Roderick S.L.

Phospholipid transfer proteins in Plasmodium are of particular interest as one of the most striking changes induced by the parasite in the host erythrocyte, the site of replication of the parasite during the clinical stage of the disease, is the formation of a large exomembrane system (25.Sherling E.S. van Ooij C. Host cell remodeling by pathogens: the exomembrane system in Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2016; 40: 701-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This consists of several different, most likely unconnected, membranous compartments that have various functions within the cell. One of these membranous compartments is the parasitophorous vacuole membrane that surrounds the parasite during the entire intraerythrocytic life cycle and that separates the parasite from the erythrocyte cytosol. Another group of membranous compartments is the Maurer's clefts, small vesicles that are important for the transfer of parasite proteins to the surface of the infected cell (26.Mundwiler-Pachlatko E.

How the parasite transfers phospholipids across the aqueous environment of the parasitophorous vacuole lumen to the parasitophorous membrane and the Maurer's clefts is unknown. It has been suggested that PFA0210c may play a part in this process (24.van Ooij C. Withers-Martinez C. Ringel A. Cockcroft S. Haldar K. Blackman M.J.

In support of this, a unique feature of PFA0210c among the Plasmodium falciparum START proteins is the presence of a signal sequence, which mediates the secretion of the protein from the parasite into the parasitophorous vacuole, as well as a PEXEL export signal, which directs export beyond the parasitophorous vacuole membrane into the erythrocyte cytosol (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have indicated that PFA0210c can be exported from the parasite to the erythrocyte cytosol (29.van Ooij C. Tamez P. Bhattacharjee S. Hiller N.L. Harrison T. Liolios K. Kooij T. Ramesar J. Balu B. Adams J. Waters A.P. Waters A. Janse C.J. Janse C. Haldar K. The malaria secretome: from algorithms to essential function in blood stage infection.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000084Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), although at least a fraction remains in the parasitophorous vacuole (24.van Ooij C. Withers-Martinez C. Ringel A. Cockcroft S. Haldar K. Blackman M.J. Identification of a Plasmodium falciparum phospholipid transfer protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 31971-31983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The presence of the protein at these locations indicates that it may function to transfer phospholipids between the parasite and parts of the exomembrane system. Here, we show that PFA0210c and its Plasmodium orthologues contain an unusual C-terminal extension that regulates the phospholipid transfer activity of the protein. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the Plasmodium knowlesi orthologue of PFA0210c, PKH_020910, is essential, and we apply new genetic techniques to show that P. falciparum parasites lacking PFA0210c do not develop or proliferate within the infected erythrocyte. Additionally, we show that the regulation of phospholipid transfer through the C-terminal extension is required for parasite growth. Together, these experiments reveal a new mechanism of regulating phospholipid transfer and show that phospholipid transfer is an essential and regulated process in Plasmodium parasites. PFA0210c was initially identified as a conserved exported protein (29.van Ooij C. Tamez P. Bhattacharjee S. Hiller N.L. Harrison T. Liolios K. Kooij T. Ramesar J. Balu B. Adams J. Waters A.P.

The malaria secretome: from algorithms to essential function in blood stage infection.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000084Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We subsequently showed that PFA0210c as well as its orthologues in the simian and human malaria pathogen P. knowlesi (PKH_020910 or PKNH_0209300) and the rodent parasite Plasmodium chabaudi (PCHAS_020730 or PCHAS_0207300) are phospholipid transfer proteins that can transfer a broad range of phospholipids in vitro (24.van Ooij C. Withers-Martinez C. Ringel A. Cockcroft S. Haldar K. Blackman M.J. Identification of a Plasmodium falciparum phospholipid transfer protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 31971-31983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All three proteins contain a signal sequence and a predicted PEXEL motif that directs export from the parasite into the host erythrocyte (Fig. 1A) (29.van Ooij C. Tamez P. Bhattacharjee S.

The proteins are characterized by a poorly conserved N-terminal region, a START domain that is required for the phospholipid transfer activity (24.van Ooij C. Withers-Martinez C. Ringel A. Cockcroft S. Haldar K. Blackman M.J. Identification of a Plasmodium falciparum phospholipid transfer protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 31971-31983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal extension of ∼84 amino acid residues (Fig. 1B). To gain further insight into the function of this protein, we used the recently developed P. knowlesi A.1-H.1 strain that has been adapted to in vitro growth in human erythrocytes (32.Moon R.W. Hall J. Rangkuti F. Ho Y.S. Almond N. Mitchell G.H. Pain A. Holder A.A. Blackman M.J. Adaptation of the genetically tractable malaria pathogen Plasmodium knowlesi to continuous culture in human erythrocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) to attempt to generate a mutant that lacks the gene encoding PKH_020910. The P. knowlesi model is highly genetically tractable, allowing for rapid gene modification by homologous recombination. We first confirmed that PKH_020910 is expressed in in vitro culture by immunoblotting. Full-length PKH_020910 has a predicted molecular mass of 55.4 kDa, which is reduced to 52.7 kDa after removal of the signal sequence and further reduced to 43.7 kDa after cleavage of the PEXEL domain. Using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, a protein of approximately the expected molecular mass was detectable in extracts of infected erythrocytes (Fig. 2A) but not in that of uninfected erythrocytes, despite the presence of a higher amount of protein in the lane with uninfected erythrocyte extract (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence staining of erythrocytes infected with late stage parasites (schizonts) revealed that the protein is likely expressed in a subset of apical organelles, as indicated by the localized punctate pattern of staining (Fig. 2C). The identity of this organelle could not be ascertained because of the lack of organelle markers for P. knowlesi, and no signal was obtained by immunoelectron microscopy using the available anti-PKH_020910 antibodies. Nonetheless, these experiments confirmed that PKH_020910 is expressed in blood stages of the P. knowlesi life cycle. To determine whether PKH_020910 is required for parasite growth, we attempted to disrupt the PKH_020910 gene through single crossover homologous recombination (Fig. 3A). Parasites were transfected with linearized plasmids that were designed to integrate into the genome and either reconstitute the entire gene or truncate the coding sequence to remove 46 residues of the START domain. A similar truncation of PFA0210c ablates its capacity to transfer phospholipids in an in vitro assay (24.van Ooij C. Withers-Martinez C. Ringel A. Cockcroft S. Haldar K. Blackman M.J. Identification of a Plasmodium falciparum phospholipid transfer protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 31971-31983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After selection of the transfected parasites with pyrimethamine, drug-resistant parasites were recovered in all cases within 10–14 days. Diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of genomic DNA (Fig. 3A) indicated that integration of the plasmid could only be detected in the case of the plasmids designed to reconstitute the entire open reading frame (PKH_020910 476 in Fig. 3B); no integration was detected in the plasmid designed to truncate the gene (PKH_020910 346 in Fig. 3B). To rule out the unlikely scenario that the different results reflected the different lengths of the targeting region within the plasmids (972 bp versus 1362 bp), we engineered a plasmid that contained the same 972-bp homology region as the deletion plasmid but also contained the remainder of the entire gene in a re-codonized form. Integration of this plasmid was thus mediated by the same targeting sequence as the truncation plasmid but would lead to reconstitution of the full-length gene. This plasmid readily integrated into the chromosome (PKH_020910 346+recodonized in Fig. 3B), indicating that the inability of the truncation to integrate was not a consequence of the insufficient targeting sequence but rather reflected a requirement for PKH_020910 for parasite viability. To avoid caveats associated with negative data, we wanted to confirm further that this protein is required for parasite survival. We exploited a combination of recently developed Cas9 technology with conditional gene excision (33.de Koning-Ward T.F. Gilson P.R. Crabb B.S. Advances in molecular genetic systems in malaria.Nat.

For this, we replaced the native PFA0210c open reading frame with a form interrupted by a loxP-containing intron (37.Jones M.L. Das S. Belda H. Collins C.R. Blackman M.J. Treeck M. A versatile strategy for rapid conditional genome engineering using loxP sites in a small synthetic intron in Plasmodium falciparum.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 21800Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This was followed by 855 bp of a re-codonized PFA0210c-coding sequence plus a second loxP site immediately following the stop codon (Fig. 4A). This gene modification was performed in the 1G5DC P. falciparum clone (38.Collins C.R. Das S. Wong E.H. Andenmatten N. Stallmach R. Hackett F. Herman J.P. Müller S. Meissner M. Blackman M.J.

Several transgenic parasite clones were generated expressing the loxP-containing PFA0210c gene (called PFA0210c-LoxP; Fig. 4B). Treatment of these clones with rapamycin resulted in the expected excision of the segment of the PFA0210c gene that is flanked by the loxP sites (Fig. 4C). In confirmation of this, no PFA0210c protein could be detected in schizonts of the rapamycin-treated parasites (Fig. 4D). To assess the effects of gene disruption on parasite viability, growth assays were performed, comparing rapamycin-treated PFA0210c-LoxP parasites with control mock-treated counterparts. This revealed a severe growth defect in the parasites lacking PFA0210c (Fig. 4E), whereas treatment of 1G5 parasites with rapamycin did not affect their growth rate. Giemsa staining of the parasites revealed that loss of PFA0210c resulted in the formation of dysmorphic ring-stage parasites in the growth cycle following that in which the parasites were treated with rapamycin (the 60-h time point in Fig. 4F). These parasites have a translucent, nearly white center and do not develop past the ring stage, whereas DMSO-treated parasites and 1G5 parasites do develop into trophozoites (see the 76-h time point in Fig. 4F). These results demonstrate that PKH_020910 and PFA0210c are essential proteins in the asexual blood stage of the Plasmodium life cycle. The 84-residue C-terminal extension of PFA0210c is highly unusual among START proteins. Although the 15 human START proteins range in size from 205 residues (STARD5) to 4705 residues (STARD9), the START domain is almost exclusively located at or very near the extreme C terminus of the protein (Table 1); the longest C-terminal extension found in a human START protein, STARD10, is 50 residues. All orthologues of PFA0210c possess a C-terminal extension ranging from 81 residues in the Plasmodium yoelii orthologue (PY17X_0210300) to 92 residues in the Plasmodium berghei orthologue (PBANKA_0208900), with most (including those of PFA0210c, PKH_020910, and PCHAS_020730) comprising 84 residues (Table 1)). Sequence conservation in the C-terminal extension is overall much lower than within the START domain (Fig. 1B), However, we noticed the presence of a number o"

We carried out a cross-sectional study in a sample population of 1015 schoolchildren aged 12 to 15 years from São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil. The explanatory variable was malocclusion, evaluated on the basis of the normative need or the adolescent's self-perceived need for dental treatment. Normative need for dental treatment was determined by professional diagnosis, made on the basis of Angle's classification, the Dental Aesthetic Index, and other morphological deviations (e.g., posterior crossbite, posterior open bite, and deep overbite). We analyzed the impact of malocclusion on the QOL using the Portuguese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile-14. Associations were estimated by using the prevalence ratio (PR) in Poisson regression analysis, with hierarchized modeling. An alpha of 5% was adopted as the criterion for statistical significance. The QOL of adolescents was impacted by malocclusion, classified by a normative need for treatment according to the Dental Aesthetic Index (PR = 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.56) or by the self-perceived need for treatment (PR = 2.54; 95% CI = 1.81-3.56). Certain sociodemographic variables, including the head of the family (PR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.02-2.23), greater educational level of the head of the family (PR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.17-0.61), and female sex (PR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.05-1.89), had negative associations with QOL. We conclude that malocclusion has a negative impact on the QOL of adolescents, associated with socioeconomic conditions and the cosmetic effects of malocclusion."

https://openalex.org/W2524681024,"Host responses to pathogens include defenses that reduce infection burden (i.e., resistance) and traits that reduce the fitness consequences of an infection (i.e., tolerance). Resistance and tolerance are affected by an organism's physiological status. Corticosterone (“CORT”) is a hormone that is associated with the regulation of many physiological processes, including metabolism and reproduction. Because of its role in the stress response, CORT is also considered the primary vertebrate stress hormone. When secreted at high levels, CORT is generally thought to be immunosuppressive. Despite the known association between stress and disease resistance in domesticated organisms, it is unclear whether these associations are ecologically and evolutionary relevant in wildlife species. We conducted a 3x3 fully crossed experiment in which we exposed American toads (Anaxyrus [Bufo] americanus) to one of three levels of exogenous CORT (no CORT, low CORT, or high CORT) and then to either low or high doses of the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (“Bd”) or a sham exposure treatment. We assessed Bd infection levels and tested how CORT and Bd affected toad resistance, tolerance, and mortality. Exposure to the high CORT treatment significantly elevated CORT release in toads; however, there was no difference between toads given no CORT or low CORT. Exposure to CORT and Bd each increased toad mortality, but they did not interact to affect mortality. Toads that were exposed to CORT had higher Bd resistance than toads exposed to ethanol controls/low CORT, a pattern opposite that of most studies on domesticated animals. Exposure to CORT did not affect toad tolerance to Bd. Collectively, these results show that physiological stressors can alter a host’s response to a pathogen, but that the outcome might not be straightforward. Future studies that inhibit CORT secretion are needed to better our understanding of the relationship between stress physiology and disease resistance and tolerance in wild vertebrates."

The SNaPshot Multiplex sequencing assay was used for SNP genotyping, and the potential association of genotype distributions and allele frequencies with ischemic stroke was analyzed statistically. Compared with the GG genotype, the CC+GC genotype of rs5128 was significantly associated with an increased risk in females (adjusted OR = 3.38, 95% CI = 1.82–6.28, P <0.01) after all of the risk factors were adjusted for with logistic regression analyses. A similar relationship was found between the rs4520 polymorphism and ischemic stroke risk in Han Chinese women. Under a recessive genetic model, the TT+TC genotypes of this variant increased ischemic stroke risk (adjusted OR = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.28–3.29; P <0.01). Haplotype analysis revealed that in males, the T-C-T-C haplotype of rs2854116-rs2854117-rs4520-rs5128 was significantly more frequent in the ischemic stroke group than in the control group (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.18–1.87, P<0.01).

https://openalex.org/W2523815963,"O6-Methyl-2′-deoxyguanosine (O6-MeG) is a ubiquitous DNA lesion, formed not only by xenobiotic carcinogens but also by the endogenous methylating agent S-adenosylmethionine. It can introduce mutations during DNA replication, with different DNA polymerases displaying different ratios of correct or incorrect incorporation opposite this nucleoside. Of the translesion Y-family human DNA polymerases (hpols), hpol η is most efficient in incorporating equal numbers of correct and incorrect C and T bases. However, the mechanistic basis for this specific yet indiscriminate activity is not known. To explore this question, we report biochemical and structural analysis of the catalytic core of hpol η. Activity assays showed the truncated form displayed similar misincorporation properties as the full-length enzyme, incorporating C and T equally and extending from both. X-ray crystal structures of both dC and dT paired with O6-MeG were solved in both insertion and extension modes. The structures revealed a Watson-Crick-like pairing between O6-MeG and 2-deoxythymidine-5-[(α, β)-imido]triphosphate (approximating dT) at both the insertion and extension stages with formation of two H-bonds. Conversely, both the structures with O6- MeG opposite dCTP and dC display sheared configuration of base pairs but to different degrees, with formation of two bifurcated H-bonds and two single H-bonds in the structures trapped in the insertion and extension states, respectively. The structural data are consistent with the observed tendency of hpol η to insert both dC and dT opposite the O6-MeG lesion with similar efficiencies. Comparison of the hpol η active site configurations with either O6-MeG:dC or O6-MeG:dT bound compared with the corresponding situations in structures of complexes of Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4, a bypass pol that favors C relative to T by a factor of ∼4, helps rationalize the more error-prone synthesis opposite the lesion by hpol η."

Among these is a syndrome of long-term neurocognitive dysfunction called cancer/chemotherapy related cognitive impairment. To date, all studies examining the cognitive impact of cancer treatment have emphasized chemotherapy. Radiation-induced bystander effects have been described in cell culture and, to a limited extent, in rodent model systems. The purpose of this study was to examine, for the first time, the impact of non-brain directed radiation therapy on the brain in order to elucidate its potential relationship with cancer/chemotherapy related cognitive impairment. To address this objective, female BALB/c mice received either a single 16 gray fraction of ionizing radiation to the right hind limb or three doses of methotrexate, once per week for three consecutive weeks. Mice were sacrificed either 3 or 30 days post-treatment and brain injury was determined via quantification of activated astrocytes and microglia. To characterize the effects of non-brain directed radiation on brain glucose metabolism, mice were evaluated by fluorodeoxygluocose positron emission tomography. A single fraction of 16 gray radiation resulted in global decreases in brain glucose metabolism, a significant increase in the number of activated astrocytes and microglia, and increased TNF-α expression, all of which lasted up to 30 days post-treatment. This inflammatory response following radiation therapy was statistically indistinguishable from the neuroinflammation observed following methotrexate administration. In conclusion, non-brain directed radiation was sufficient to cause significant brain bystander injury as reflected by multifocal hypometabolism and persistent neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that radiation induces significant brain bystander effects distant from the irradiated cells and tissues. These effects may contribute to the development of cognitive dysfunction in treated human cancer patients and warrant further study."

However, the biologic significance of FEN1 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage remains unknown. Here, we report an in vivo role for FEN1 phosphorylation, using a mouse line carrying S187A FEN1, which abolishes FEN1 phosphorylation. Although S187A mouse embryonic fibroblast cells showed normal proliferation under low oxygen levels (2%), the mutant cells accumulated oxidative DNA damage, activated DNA damage checkpoints, and showed G1-phase arrest at atmospheric oxygen levels (21%). This suggests an essential role for FEN1 phosphorylation in repairing oxygen-induced DNA damage and maintaining proper cell cycle progression. Consistently, the mutant cardiomyocytes showed G1-phase arrest due to activation of the p53-mediated DNA damage response at the neonatal stage, which reduces the proliferation potential of the cardiomyocytes and impairs heart development. Nearly 50%of new borns with the S187 A mutant died in the first week due to failure to undergo the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling-dependent switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation. The adult mutant mice developed dilated hearts and showed significantly shorter life spans. Altogether, our results reveal an important role of FEN1 phosphorylation to counteract oxygen-induced stress in the heart during the fetal-to-neonatal transition.—Zhou, L., Dai, H., Wu, J., Zhou, M., Yuan, H., Du, J., Yang, L., Wu, X., Xu, H., Hua, Y., Xu, J., Zheng, L., Shen, B.

https://openalex.org/W2525333547,"Globally, a body of comparative case-control studies suggests that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients are more prone to developing hearing loss (HL). However, experimental evidence that supports this hypothesis is still lacking because the human auditory organ is not readily accessible. The aim of this study was to determine the association between bone damage to the ossicles of the middle ear and HL, using a widely accepted murine model of collagen-induced arthritis (RA mice). Diarthrodial joints in the middle ear were examined with microcomputer tomography (microCT), and hearing function was assessed by auditory brainstem response (ABR). RA mice exhibited significantly decreased hearing sensitivity compared to age-matched controls. Additionally, a significant narrowing of the incudostapedial joint space and an increase in the porosity of the stapes were observed. The absolute latencies of all ABR waves were prolonged, but mean interpeak latencies were not statistically different. The observed bone defects in the middle ear that were accompanied by changes in ABR responses were consistent with conductive HL. This combination suggests that conductive impairment is at least part of the etiology of RA-induced HL in a murine model. Whether the inner ear sustains bone erosion or other pathology, and whether the cochlear nerve sustains pathology await subsequent studies. Considering the fact that certain anti-inflammatories are ototoxic in high doses, monitoring RA patients’ auditory function is advisable as part of the effort to ensure their well-being."

Correlations are identified by analysis of mutual information between columns of protein and DNA alignments. The algorithm reduces the effects of common phylogenetic history and of abundance of closely related proteins and binding sites. We apply it to five closely related subfamilies of the MerR family of bacterial transcription factors that regulate heavy metal resistance systems. We validate the approach using known 3D structures of MerR-family proteins in complexes with their cognate DNA binding sites and demonstrate that a significant fraction of correlated positions indeed form specific side-chain-to-base contacts.

Results A total of 106 PACG, 186 POAG, and 95 controls were enrolled. In multivariable regression analysis of all three groups(PACG/POAG/controls), compared to POAG, PACG showed a weakly positive association with social functioning (R2 = 0.13, β = 0.22, P = 0.04). PACG showed no significantly negative impact on pVRQOL compared to controls. Taking only glaucoma patients into consideration, PACG patients had a higher score on social functioning compared to POAG (R2 = 0.16, β = 0.27, P = 0.01). The results of other domains of NEI VFQ-25(T) between the two groups did not differ significantly(p>0.05). Conclusions In patients with controlled disease, the impact of PACG and POAG on most domains of NEI VFQ-25(T) were similar, except for better social functioning in PACG compared to POAG."

However, comprehensive information regarding the utilization of rehabilitation for such patients remains scarce.This population-based study aimed to examine the characteristics, trends, and most important factors affecting rehabilitation usage in patients with hemophilia A using a nationwide database in Taiwan.Data from 777 patients with hemophilia A who were registered in the National Health Insurance Research Database between 1998 and 2008 were analyzed using SAS 9.0.Musculoskeletal or nervous system-related surgical procedures and clotting factor VIII concentrate costs were identified as factors affecting rehabilitation usage; musculoskeletal or nervous system-related surgical procedures (odds ratio = 3.788; P < 0.001) were the most important predictor of whether a patient with hemophilia A would use rehabilitation services. Joint disorders, arthropathies, bone and cartilage disorders, intracranial hemorrhage, and brain trauma were common diagnoses during rehabilitation use. The costs of physical therapy (physiotherapy) comprised the majority (71.2%) of rehabilitation therapy categories. Increasingly, rehabilitation therapy was performed at physician clinics. The total rehabilitation costs were <0.1% of the total annual medical costs.Musculoskeletal or nervous system-related surgical procedures and increased use of clotting factor VIII concentrate affect the rehabilitation utilization of patients with hemophilia A the most. The findings in this study could help clinicians comprehensively understand the rehabilitation utilization of patients with hemophilia A."
