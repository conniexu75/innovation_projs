https://openalex.org/W4294045128,"In this study, we use an exceptional skeleton of the pachycephalosaur Stegoceras validum (UALVP 2) to inform a comprehensive appendicular muscle reconstruction of the animal, with the goal of better understanding the functional morphology of the pachycephalosaur postcranial skeleton. We find that S. validum possessed a conservative forelimb musculature, particularly in comparison to early saurischian bipeds. By contrast, the pelvic and hind limb musculature are more derived, reflecting peculiarities of the underlying skeletal anatomy. The iliotibialis, ischiocaudalis, and caudofemoralis muscles have enlarged attachment sites and the caudofemoralis has greater leverage owing to the distal displacement of the fourth trochanter along the femur. These larger muscles, in combination with the wide pelvis and stout hind limbs, produced a stronger, more stable pelvic structure that would have proved advantageous during hypothesized intraspecific head-butting contests. The pelvis may have been further stabilized by enlarged sacroiliac ligaments, which stemmed from the unique medial iliac flange of the pachycephalosaurs. Although the pubis of UALVP 2 is not preserved, the pubes of other pachycephalosaurs are highly reduced. The puboischiofemoralis musculature was likely also reduced accordingly, and compensated for by the aforementioned improved pelvic musculature."
https://openalex.org/W4294043519,"SARS-CoV-2 has affected people worldwide as the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus is related to the highly lethal SARS-CoV-1 responsible for the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Asia. Research is ongoing to understand why both viruses have different spreading capacities and mortality rates. Like other beta coronaviruses, RNA-RNA interactions occur between different parts of the viral genomic RNA, resulting in discontinuous transcription and production of various sub-genomic RNAs. These sub-genomic RNAs are then translated into other viral proteins. In this work, we performed a comparative analysis for novel long-range RNA-RNA interactions that may involve the Spike region. Comparing in-silico fragment-based predictions between reference sequences of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 revealed several predictions amongst which a thermodynamically stable long-range RNA-RNA interaction between (23660-23703 Spike) and (28025-28060 ORF8) unique to SARS-CoV-2 was observed. The patterns of sequence variation using data gathered worldwide further supported the predicted stability of the sub-interacting region (23679-23690 Spike) and (28031-28042 ORF8). Such RNA-RNA interactions can potentially impact viral life cycle including sub-genomic RNA production rates."
https://openalex.org/W4294044978,"The success of the COVID-19 vaccination programme to achieve herd immunity depends on the proportion of the population inoculated. COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy is a barrier to reaching a sufficient number of people to achieve herd immunity. This study aims to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and to identify the reasons contributing to vaccine hesitancy using the Theory of Planned Behavior. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between May 2021 to June 2021. Using exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling, participants were recruited via social media and telecommunication platforms. We used a questionnaire that obtained information on participant socio-demographics, vaccine hesitancy, pseudoscientific practices, conspiracy beliefs, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, main reasons for not intending to get the COVID-19 vaccine; influential leaders, gatekeepers and anti-or pro-vaccination lobbies; and global vaccine hesitancy. A total of 354 responses (mean age = 32.5 years old ±13.6; 70.3% females) were included for analysis. The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 11.6%. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was significantly and positively associated with those who agreed with influential leaders, gatekeepers, and anti- or pro-vaccination lobbies (adjusted B coefficient = 1.355, p = 0.014), having a “wait and see” attitude to see if the COVID-19 vaccine is safe (adjusted B coefficient = 0. 822, p &lt;0.001), perceiving that the vaccine will give them COVID-19 (adjusted B coefficient = 0.660, p &lt;0.002), planned to use masks/others precautions instead (adjusted B coefficient = 0.345, p = 0.038) and having higher scores in conspiracy beliefs (adjusted B coefficient = 0.128, p &lt;0.001). Concern about the costs associated with the vaccine (adjusted B coefficient = -0.518, p &lt;0.001), subjective norms (adjusted B coefficient = -0.341, p &lt;0.001), and perceived behavioural control (adjusted B coefficient = -0.202, p = 0.004) were negatively associated with vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Malaysia is low. Several factors were identified as being associated with vaccine hesitancy. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy would be useful in tailoring specific interventions involving positive messages by influential leaders, which address vaccine misinformation and the wait-and-see attitude which may delay the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4294043670,"Background The behavioural phenotype of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) implies a specific emotional and social-interactive burden for the caregivers of the individuals with PWS. The aim of the study was to perform an in-depth exploratory analysis of experiences of the familial caregivers of individuals with PWS. Method The study was carried out using a sociological methodology of the grounded theory (qualitative research). A purposively selected sample of 20 familial caregivers of children/adults with PWS was invited to take part in individual, semi-structured in-depth interviews which included questions pertaining to coping with problems arising from the condition, including its impact on social interactions, as well as to the meanings of PWS. Results The core category emerging from our analysis emphasized “experiencing PWS as a crisis”. The phases in the process of experiencing PWS were specified, each of which is characterised by specific cognitive, emotional and social problems, implying relevant requirements in the care of individuals with PWS. I. Crisis in response to the diagnosis; II. Crisis in response to lack of control over the hunger of individuals with PWS; III. Crisis in response to the social milieu’s failure to understand the nature of the condition; IV. Crisis in response to attempts to plan the future of individuals with PWS. The specificity of the PWS caregiver’s experience is primarily determined by the need to reconstruct the entire family’s lifestyle. The experiences of caregivers of PWS persons, at the time when they were available for study, had the characteristics of crisis. Moreover the psychosocial consequences of PWS were not subject to normalization and attempts to attribute any meaningful existential sense to the PWS were ineffective in the time period under scrutiny. Conclusions Identifying phases of the PWS experience process from the perspective of the caregivers of individuals with PWS may be used to profile interventions supporting PWS individuals’ families in a manner corresponding to the flow of the illness experience."
https://openalex.org/W4294044328,"The present study explored whether pyroptosis is involved in the injury process of PC12 cells induced by glucocorticoid (GC) and the regulatory relationship between endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and pyrolysis.LDH leakage of PC12 cells was detected by LDH assay. The number of dead cells was detected by SYTOX green nucleic acid staining. The levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in the supernatants was detected by ELSIA assay. The expression levels of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), cleaved gasdermin D-NT (cleaved-GSDMD-NT), NLR-pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and cleaved-caspase-1 were observed by immunofluorescence staining and western blot.The LDH assay revealed that GC exposure significantly increased the release of LDH. The results of SYTOX green acid staining showed that GC exposure significantly increased the number of SYTOX green acid-positive cells. The ELSIA assay revealed that GC exposure significantly increased the levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in the supernatants. The results of immunofluorescence staining and western blot showed that GC exposure significantly increased the expression of GRP78, cleaved-GSDMD-NT, NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1. Treatment with the ERS inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) and siRNA GSDMD attenuated related damage and downregulated the expression of the abovementioned proteins.The present study clearly demonstrated that GC exposure can induce GSDMD-dependent pyrolysis, and ERS is involved in the above damage process."
https://openalex.org/W4294044375,"Deep convolutional networks have been developed to detect prohibited items for automated inspection of X-ray screening systems in the transport security system. To our knowledge, the existing frameworks were developed to recognize threats using only baggage security X-ray scans. Therefore, the detection accuracy in other domains of security X-ray scans, such as cargo X-ray scans, cannot be ensured. We propose an object detection method for efficiently detecting contraband items in both cargo and baggage for X-ray security scans. The proposed network, MFA-net, consists of three plug-and-play modules, including the multiscale dilated convolutional module, fusion feature pyramid network, and auxiliary point detection head. First, the multiscale dilated convolutional module converts the standard convolution of the detector backbone to a conditional convolution by aggregating the features from multiple dilated convolutions using dynamic feature selection to overcome the object-scale variant issue. Second, the fusion feature pyramid network combines the proposed attention and fusion modules to enhance multiscale object recognition and alleviate the object and occlusion problem. Third, the auxiliary point detection head adopts an auxiliary head to predict the new keypoints of the bounding box to emphasize the localizability without requiring further ground-truth information. We tested the performance of the MFA-net on two large-scale X-ray security image datasets from different domains: a Security Inspection X-ray (SIXray) dataset in the baggage domain and our dataset, named CargoX, in the cargo domain. Moreover, MFA-net outperformed state-of-the-art object detectors in both domains. Thus, adopting the proposed modules can further increase the detection capability of the current object detectors on X-ray security images."
https://openalex.org/W4294044379,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in changes in muscle strength and muscle thickness (MT) of the plantar flexor muscles between traditional resistance training (RT) involving passive rest and RT combined with inter-set stretch in the calf raise exercise. Employing a within-subject design, 21 young, healthy men performed plantar flexion exercises twice per week in both a traditional RT (TRAD) format and combined with a 20-second inter-set stretch (STRETCH). One leg was randomly assigned to the TRAD condition and the contralateral leg performed the STRETCH condition throughout the 8-week study period. Dependent variables included MT of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and the soleus (SOL), and isometric strength of the plantar flexors. Results indicated a potential beneficial hypertrophic effect of STRETCH compared to TRAD for the SOL [0.7 mm, CI90% = (0, 1.6)], while the LG had more ambiguous effects [0.4 mm (-0.4, 1.3)] and MG effects were equivocal [0 mm (-0.6, 0.7)]. In general, LG demonstrated greater standardized growth [z = 1.1 (1, 1.3)] as compared to MG [z = 0.3 (0.2, 0.5)] and SOL [z = 0.3 (0.2, 0.5)]. Measures of isometric strength showed a modest advantage to STRETCH. In conclusion, loaded inter-set stretch may enhance MT of the soleus but effects on the gastrocnemii appear uncertain or unlikely in untrained men; plantar flexor strength appears to be modestly enhanced by the interventional strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4294044980,"Postoperative abdominal adhesion is one of most common complications after abdominal operations. 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) is an adenosine 5'-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway agonist that inhibits inflammation, reduces cell fibrosis and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) injury, promotes autophagy and mitochondrial function. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of AICAR in inhibiting adhesion formation.Forty rats were randomly divided into five groups. All of the rats except the sham group received cecal abrasion to establish an adhesion model. The rats in the sodium hyaluronate group were treated with 2 mL sodium hyaluronate before closing the peritoneal cavity. The AICAR 1 and 2 groups were treated with 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg AICAR, respectively. Seven days after the operation, all of the rats were euthanized, and the adhesion condition was evaluated by Nair's system. Inflammation was assessed by Eosin-hematoxylin (HE) staining and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β1) detection. Oxidative stress effect was determined by ROS, nitric oxide (NO) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in adhesion tissue. Then, Sirius red picric acid staining was used to detect the fiber thickness. Immunohistochemical staining of cytokeratin-19 (CK-19), alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was also performed. Finally, HMrSV5 cells were treated with TGF-β1 and AICAR, the mRNA expression of E-cadherin, α-SMA and vimentin was assessed by q-PCR and cellular immunofluorescent staining.The rats in the AICAR-treated group had fewer adhesion formation incidences and a reduced Nair's score. The inflammation was determined by HE staining and TGF-β1 concentration. The ROS, SOD, Catalase, Gpx, MDA levels and fiber thickness were decreased by AICAR treatments compared to the control. However, the NO production, Nrf2 levels and peritoneal mesothelial cell integrity were promoted after AICAR treatments. In vitro work, AICAR treatments reduced E-cadherin, α-SMA and vimentin mRNA level compared to that in the TGF-β1 group.AICAR can inhibit postoperative adhesion formation by reducing inflammation, decreasing oxidative stress response and promoting peritoneal mesothelial cell repair."
https://openalex.org/W4294045010,"Breast abscess is developed on the basis of acute mastitis, which will cause damage to the physical and mental health of lactating women and is an important factor affecting the rate of breastfeeding. This study examined the risk factors for mastitis to develop into breast abscess, and analyzed the distribution of pathogenic bacteria, bacterial resistance, and treatment outcome.The medical records of 316 cases of mastitis and 219 cases of breast abscess were retrospectively collected. We analyzed the bacterial distribution of mastitis and breast abscess, and compared the differences of bacterial drug resistance. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the following aspects: age, primiparity or not, history of breast surgery, body temperature, puerperium or not, onset time, located in the nipple/areolar complexe area or not, history of massage by non-professionals, staphylococcus aureus/methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection or not, diabetes and white blood cell count.Of the 535 patients, 203 (37.9%) were positive for staphylococcus aureus. There were 133 (65.5%) cases of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and 70 (34.5%) cases of MRSA. Concerning bacterial drug resistance, a statistical analysis showed that MSSA had high resistance rate to penicillin (96.2%), ampicillin (91%), clindamycin (42.9%) and erythromycin (45.9%). MRSA had a high resistance rate to penicillin (100%), ampicillin (98.6%), oxacillin (95.7%), erythromycin (81.4%), clindamycin (80%), and amoxicillin (31.7%). Risk factors for progression of mastitis to breast abscess include a body temperature<38.5°C, a postpartum time ≥ 42 days, an onset time ≥ 2 days, lesions in the nipple/areolar complex area, a history of massage by non-medical staff and bacterial cultures for milk or pus that test positive for staphylococcus aureus or MRSA (P < 0.001).The most common pathogenic bacteria of mastitis and breast abscess is staphylococcus aureus. There are many risk factors for mastitis to develop into breast abscess. We should take effective measures for its risk factors and select sensitive antibiotics according to the results of bacterial culture to reduce the formation of breast abscess."
https://openalex.org/W4294043553,"Investigating the 3D structures and rearrangements of organelles within a single cell is critical for better characterizing cellular function. Imaging approaches such as soft X-ray tomography have been widely applied to reveal a complex subcellular organization involving multiple inter-organelle interactions. However, 3D segmentation of organelle instances has been challenging despite its importance in organelle characterization. Here we propose an intensity-based post-processing tool to identify and separate organelle instances. Our tool separates sphere-like (insulin vesicle) and columnar-shaped organelle instances (mitochondrion) based on the intensity of raw tomograms, semantic segmentation masks, and organelle morphology. We validate our tool using synthetic tomograms of organelles and experimental tomograms of pancreatic β-cells to separate insulin vesicle and mitochondria instances. As compared to the commonly used connected regions labeling, watershed, and watershed + Gaussian filter methods, our tool results in improved accuracy in identifying organelles in the synthetic tomograms and an improved description of organelle structures in β-cell tomograms. In addition, under different experimental treatment conditions, significant changes in volumes and intensities of both insulin vesicle and mitochondrion are observed in our instance results, revealing their potential roles in maintaining normal β-cell function. Our tool is expected to be applicable for improving the instance segmentation of other images obtained from different cell types using multiple imaging modalities."
https://openalex.org/W4294043681,"Sex change occurs as a usual part of the life cycle for many teleost fish and the modifications involved (behavioural, gonadal, morphological) are well studied. However, the mechanism that transduces environmental cues into the molecular cascade that underlies this transformation remains unknown. Cortisol, the main stress hormone in fish, is hypothesised to be a key factor linking environmental stimuli with sex change by initiating gene expression changes that shift steroidogenesis from oestrogens to androgens but this notion remains to be rigorously tested. Therefore, this study aimed to experimentally test the role of cortisol as an initiator of sex change in a protogynous (female-to-male) hermaphrodite, the New Zealand spotty wrasse (Notolabrus celidotus). We also sought to identify potential key regulatory factors within the head kidney that may contribute to the initiation and progression of gonadal sex change. Cortisol pellets were implanted into female spotty wrasses under inhibitory conditions (presence of a male), and outside of the optimal season for natural sex change. Histological analysis of the gonads and sex hormone analyses found no evidence of sex change after 71 days of cortisol treatment. However, expression analyses of sex and stress-associated genes in gonad and head kidney suggested that cortisol administration did have a physiological effect. In the gonad, this included upregulation of amh, a potent masculinising factor, and nr3c1, a glucocorticoid receptor. In the head kidney, hsd11b2, which converts cortisol to inactive cortisone to maintain cortisol balance, was upregulated. Overall, our results suggest cortisol administration outside of the optimal sex change window is unable to initiate gonadal restructuring. However, our expression data imply key sex and stress genes are sensitive to cortisol. This includes genes expressed in both gonad and head kidney that have been previously implicated in early sex change in several sex-changing species."
https://openalex.org/W4294043792,"The purpose of this field study was to compare the effects of top-dressing tropical lactating cows with soybean meal (SBM) or citric waste fermented yeast waste (CWYW) on intake, digestibility, ruminal fermentation, blood metabolites, purine derivatives, milk production, and economic return. Sixteen mid-lactation Thai crossbreeds, Holstein Friesian (16.7 ± 0.30 kg/day milk yield and 490 ± 40.0 kg of initial body weight) were randomly allocated to two treatments in a completed randomized design: SBM as control (n = 8) or CWYW (n = 8). The feeding trial lasted for 60 days plus 21 days for treatment adaptation. The results showed that total dry matter intake, nutrient intake, and digestibility did not (p>0.05) differ between SBM and CWYW top-dressing. Ruminal pH and the protozoal population did not (p>0.05) differ between SBM and CWYW top-dressing. After 4 hours of feeding, CWYW top-dressing showed greater ammonia nitrogen, plasma urea nitrogen, and bacterial population compared with the top-dressing of SBM. Volatile fatty acids and purine derivatives were not different (p>0.05) between SBM and CWYW top-dressing. For milk urea nitrogen, there was a greater (p<0.05) and somatic cell count was lower (p<0.05) for cows fed the CWYW top-dress compared to cows fed the SBM top-dress. The cost of the top-dress and total feed cost were less (p<0.05) for CWYW compared to SBM top-dressing, at 0.59 vs 1.16 US dollars/cow/day and 4.14 vs 4.75 US dollars/cow/day, respectively. In conclusion, CWYW could be used as an alternative protein source to SBM without having a negative impact on tropical lactating cows."
https://openalex.org/W4294043810,"Introduction Intermittent claudication is the leading symptom of peripheral artery disease (leg pain when walking). The present study investigates the extent to which walking impairment is associated with health-related quality of life, mental health and health risk behavior. Methods A theory-based, cross-sectional path model was empirically examined using pre-intervention baseline data from a multicenter, randomized-controlled trial of patients with intermittent claudication ( PAD-TeGeCoach ). Data were available from 1 696 patients who completed a battery of questionnaires between April 14, 2018 and March 12, 2019, including measures of walking impairment (Walking Impairment Questionnaire), health-related quality of life (SF-12), mental burden (GAD-7, PHQ-9), nicotine- and alcohol-related risk behavior (Fagerström-Test, AUDIT-C). Sociodemographic characteristics and comorbid conditions were included in the postulated model a priori to minimize confounding effects. Results Walking impairment was associated with an increase in depressive (β = -.36, p &lt; .001) and anxiety symptoms (β = -.24, p &lt; .001). The prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 48.3% and 35.5%, respectively, with female patients and those of younger age being at greater risk. Depressive symptoms were predictive of an increased tobacco use (β = .21; p &lt; .001). Walking impairment had adverse effects on physical quality of life, both directly (β = .60, p &lt; .001) and indirectly mediated through depressive symptoms (β = -.16, p &lt; .001); and indirectly on mental quality of life mediated through depressive (β = -.43, p &lt; .001) and anxiety symptoms (β = -.35, p &lt; .001). Discussion The findings underscore the need for a comprehensive treatment strategy in patients with intermittent claudication. Measures to improve walking impairment (e.g. exercise training) are key to enhance quality of life and should be the primary treatment. As a key mediator of mental quality of life, depressive and anxiety symptoms should be addressed by rigorously including mental health treatment. Risky health behaviors should be approached by promoting behavior change (e.g. smoking cessation) as a secondary prevention of peripheral artery disease."
https://openalex.org/W4294044330,"Psychological problems commonly experienced by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) cause diabetes fatigue conditions that can further worsen the treatment prognosis. We conducted this investigation to determine the effectiveness of a resilience-based Islamic program on diabetes fatigue and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by measuring the biochemical indicators of T2DM. This was a quasi-experimental study performed from May to August 2021, in which 80 respondents aged 18–64 years diagnosed with T2DM were included through purposive sampling at a male:female sex ratio of 1:1 in the control group and 17:23 in the treatment group. A resilience-based Islamic program (a combination of stress management, mindfulness, prayer, and dhikr (the ritual formula of Sufi brotherhood recited devotionally in praise of Allah and as a means of attaining ecstatic experience)) was implemented in the treatment group for six sessions by blended online and offline interventions. Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 and World Health Organization Quality of Life, Brief Form were used to evaluate diabetes fatigue and HRQoL. Blood tests were performed to measure HbA1c, total antioxidant serum, insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels from baseline to 3 months. Statistical analyses were conducted using paired t test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, independent t test, and Mann–Whitney U test. The resilience-based Islamic program had a beneficial impact on the levels of HbA1c (p &lt; 0.001), lipid profile (triglyceride) (p = 0.011), HDL-c (p = 0.01), LDL-c (p &lt; 0.001), total antioxidant serum (p = 0.001), insulin (p &lt; 0.001), diabetes fatigue (p &lt; 0.05), and HRQoL (p &lt; 0.05) in patients of the treatment group. The results of biochemical tests related to T2DM also indicated a reduction in diabetes fatigue and an increase in HRQoL due to the resilience-based Islamic program. Considering that a patient’s resilience to diabetes is an important factor in the management of diabetes fatigue, the resilience-based Islamic program can be applied at public health centers and community levels to increase T2DM resilience."
https://openalex.org/W4294044363,"Humanlike entities deviating from the norm of human appearance are perceived as strange or uncanny. Explanations for the eeriness of deviating humanlike entities include ideas specific to human or animal stimuli like mate selection, avoidance of threat or disease, or dehumanization; however, deviation from highly familiar categories may provide a better explanation. Here it is tested whether experts and novices in a novel (greeble) category show different patterns of abnormality, attractiveness, and uncanniness responses to distorted and averaged greebles. Greeble-trained participants assessed the abnormality, attractiveness, uncanniness of normal, averaged, and distorted greebles and their responses were compared to participants who had not previously seen greebles. The data show that distorted greebles were more uncanny than normal greebles only in the training condition, and distorted greebles were more uncanny in the training compared to the control condition. In addition, averaged greebles were not more attractive than normal greebles regardless of condition. The results suggest uncanniness is elicited by deviations from stimulus categories of expertise rather than being a purely biological human- or animal-specific response."
https://openalex.org/W4294044395,"In an era where the rate of bacteria evolving to be resistant to clinically-used antibiotics far exceeds that of antibiotic discovery, the search for new sources of antibacterial agents has expanded tremendously. In recent years, interest in plant-based natural products as promising sources of antibacterial agents has taken an upward trend. Mansonones, botanically-derived naphthoqionones, having many uses in Asian traditional medicine-including anti-infective roles-have sparked interest as a possible source of antibacterial agents. Here, we show that mansonone G, extracted from Mansonia gagei Drumm. heartwoods, possessed antibacterial activities towards Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli lptD4213, inhibiting the growth of the bacteria at 15.6 μM, 62.5 μM and 125 μM, respectively. Fourteen derivatives of mansonone G were synthesized successfully and were found to have a similar antibacterial spectrum to that of the parent compound, with some derivatives possessing improved antibacterial activities. Bacterial cytological profiling analysis showed that mansonone G harbors membrane permeabilizing activities against B. subtilis and E. coli lptD4213. Temporal analysis of SYTOX Green staining among individual cells showed that mansonone G rapidly permeabilized bacterial membrane within 10 min, with SYTOX Green intensity reaching 13-fold above that of the control. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of mansonone G and its derivatives as potential antibacterial agents, paving the way for further modifications in order to improve their antibacterial spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W4294044662,"A distinct feature of Hindu religious and philosophical text is that they come from a library of texts rather than single source. The Upanishads is known as one of the oldest philosophical texts in the world that forms the foundation of Hindu philosophy. The Bhagavad Gita is core text of Hindu philosophy and is known as a text that summarises the key philosophies of the Upanishads with major focus on the philosophy of karma. These texts have been translated into many languages and there exists studies about themes and topics that are prominent; however, there is not much study of topic modelling using language models which are powered by deep learning. In this paper, we use advanced language produces such as BERT to provide topic modelling of the key texts of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. We analyse the distinct and overlapping topics amongst the texts and visualise the link of selected texts of the Upanishads with Bhagavad Gita. Our results show a very high similarity between the topics of these two texts with the mean cosine similarity of 73%. We find that out of the fourteen topics extracted from the Bhagavad Gita, nine of them have a cosine similarity of more than 70% with the topics of the Upanishads. We also found that topics generated by the BERT-based models show very high coherence as compared to that of conventional models. Our best performing model gives a coherence score of 73% on the Bhagavad Gita and 69% on The Upanishads. The visualization of the low dimensional embeddings of these texts shows very clear overlapping among their topics adding another level of validation to our results."
https://openalex.org/W4294044673,"Purpose This study aimed to evaluate and compare the discriminating ability of corneal elevation maps generated using a swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) (SS-OCT ANTERION, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany), which was estimated with different reference surfaces, to distinguish normal corneas from those with keratoconus and keratoconus suspect. Methods A total of 126 eyes of patients, which comprised 43, 37, and 46 keratoconus, keratoconus suspects, and normal controls, respectively, were included in this study. The anterior and posterior elevations at the thinnest point under the best-fit sphere (BFS) and toric-ellipsoid (BFT), respectively, and other corneal parameters were measured using the SS-OCT. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and cut-off value were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic ability of the corneal elevation values in differentiating keratoconus and keratoconus suspects from normal eyes. Results The mean total keratometric and corneal elevation values were significantly higher in the keratoconus group than in the other groups. Pachymetric parameters exhibited the lowest values for keratoconus. In addition, ROC curve analyses showed a high accuracy of the thinnest point anterior and posterior BFT for both keratoconus and keratoconus suspects and normal controls (area under the ROC were 0.969 and 0.961, respectively). Furthermore, the optimal cut-off point of the posterior elevation at the thinnest point under BFT was 16.44 μm (sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 98%, respectively) for differentiating keratoconus from normal and keratoconus suspect eyes. Conclusions The elevation map using the BFS and BFT references measured with the anterior segment SS-OCT is considered an effective indicator for keratoconus diagnosis. Therefore, the anterior segment SS-OCT can effectively differentiate keratoconus from suspected keratoconus and normal corneas by measuring parameters such as posterior and anterior elevations, pachymetry, and keratometry."
https://openalex.org/W4294045007,"There is growing evidence to suggest that phosphohistidines are present at significant levels in mammalian cells and play a part in regulating cellular activity, in particular signaling pathways related to cancer. Because of the chemical instability of phosphohistidine at neutral or acid pH, it remains unclear how much phosphohistidine is present in cells. Here we describe a protocol for extracting proteins from mammalian cells in a way that avoids loss of covalent phosphates from proteins, and use it to measure phosphohistidine concentrations in human bronchial epithelial cell (16HBE14o-) lysate using 31P NMR spectroscopic analysis. Phosphohistidine is determined on average to be approximately one third as abundant as phosphoserine and phosphothreonine combined (and thus roughly 15 times more abundant than phosphotyrosine). The amount of phosphohistidine, and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine per gram of protein from a cell lysate was determined to be 23 μmol/g and 68 μmol/g respectively. The amount of phosphohistidine, and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine per cell was determined to be 1.8 fmol/cell, and 5.8 fmol/cell respectively. Phosphorylation is largely at the N3 (tele) position. Typical tryptic digest conditions result in loss of most of the phosphohistidine present, which may explain why the amounts reported here are greater than is generally seen using mass spectroscopy assays. The results further strengthen the case for a functional role of phosphohistidine in eukaryotic cells."

Thus, chloroplast genomes (cp-genome) of some of these important species must be studied.In this study, we analyzed the chloroplast genomes of C. jubata, C. erinacea, C. opulens, and C. bicolor, including their structure, repeat sequences, mutation sites, and phylogeny.The size of the chloroplast genomes was between 127,862 and 132,780 bp, and such genomes contained 112 genes (30 tRNA, 4 rRNA, and 78 protein-coding genes), 43 of which were photosynthesis-related genes. The total guanine + cytosine (G+C) content of four Caragana species was between 34.49% and 35.15%. The four Caragana species all lacked inverted repeats and can be classified as inverted repeat-lacking clade (IRLC). Of the anticipated genes of the four chloroplast genomes, introns were discovered in 17 genes, most of which were inserted by one intron. A total of 50 interspersed repeated sequences (IRSs) were found among them, 58, 29, 61, and 74 simple sequences repeats were found in C. jubata, C. bicolor, C. opulens, and C. erinacea, respectively. Analyses of sequence divergence showed that some intergenic regions (between trnK-UUU and rbcl; trnF-GAA and ndhJ; trnL-CAA and trnT-UGU; rpoB and trnC-GCA; petA and psbL; psbE and pebL; and sequences of rpoC, ycf1, and ycf2) exhibited a high degree of variations. A phylogenetic tree of eight Caragana species and another 10 legume species was reconstructed using full sequences of the chloroplast genome.(1) Chloroplast genomes can be used for the identification and classification of Caragana species. (2) The four Caragana species have highly similar cpDNA G+C content. (3) IRS analysis of the chloroplast genomes showed that these four species, similar to the chloroplast genome of most legumes, lost IRLC regions. (4) Comparative cp-genomic analysis suggested that the cp genome structure of the Caragana genus was well conserved in highly variable regions, which can be used to exploit markers for the identification of Caragana species and further phylogenetic study. (5) Results of phylogenetic analyses were in accordance with the current taxonomic status of Caragana. The phylogenetic relationship of Caragana species was partially consistent with elevation and geographical distribution."
https://openalex.org/W4294045132,"Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is characterized by the growth and contraction of cellular membranes within the vitreous cavity and on both surfaces of the retina, resulting in recurrent retinal detachments and poor visual outcomes. Proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) have been associated with PVR and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Cigarette smoke is the only known modifiable risk factor for PVR, but the mechanisms are unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of cigarette smoke on the proinflammatory TNFα/NF-κB/Snail pathway in RPE cells to better understand the mechanisms through which cigarette smoke increases the risk of PVR. Human ARPE-19 cells were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE), for 4 to 24-hours and TNFα, Snail, IL-6, IL-8, and α-SMA levels were analyzed by qPCR and/or Western blot. The severity of PVR formation was assessed in a murine model of PVR after intravitreal injection of ARPE-19 cells pre-treated with CSE or not. Fundus imaging, OCT imaging, and histologic analysis 4 weeks after injection were used to examine PVR severity. ARPE-19 cells exposed to CSE expressed higher levels of TNFα, SNAIL, IL6 and IL8 mRNA as well as SNAIL, Vimentin and α-SMA protein. Inhibition of TNFα and NF-κB pathways blocked the effect of CSE. In vivo, intravitreal injection of ARPE-19 cells treated with CSE resulted in more severe PVR compared to mice injected with untreated RPE cells. These studies suggest that the TNFα pathway is involved in the mechanism whereby cigarette smoke increases PVR. Further investigation into the role of TNFα/NF-κB/Snail in driving PVR and pharmacological targeting of these pathways in disease are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3199162494,"Globally, 21 percent of young women are married before their 18th birthday. Despite some progress in addressing child marriage, it remains a widespread practice, in particular in South Asia. While household predictors of child marriage have been studied extensively in the literature, the evidence base on macro-economic factors contributing to child marriage and models that predict where child marriage cases are most likely to occur remains limited. In this paper we aim to fill this gap and explore region-level indicators to predict the persistence of child marriage in four countries in South Asia, namely Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. We apply machine learning techniques to child marriage data and develop a prediction model that relies largely on regional and local inputs such as droughts, floods, population growth and nightlight data to model the incidence of child marriages. We find that our gradient boosting model is able to identify a large proportion of the true child marriage cases and correctly classifies 77% of the true marriage cases, with a higher accuracy in Bangladesh (92% of the cases) and a lower accuracy in Nepal (70% of cases). In addition, all countries contain in their top 10 variables for classification nighttime light growth, a shock index of drought over the previous and the last two years and the regional level of education, suggesting that income shocks, regional economic activity and regional education levels play a significant role in predicting child marriage. Given the accuracy of the model to predict child marriage, our model is a valuable tool to support policy design in countries where household-level data remains limited."
https://openalex.org/W4294043358,"The Saltin-Grimby Physical Activity Level Scale (SGPALS) is commonly used to measure physical activity (PA) in population studies, but its validity in adolescents is unknown. This study aimed to assess the criterion validity of the SGPALS against accelerometry in a large sample of adolescents. A secondary aim was to examine the validity across strata of sex, body mass index (BMI), parental educational level, study program and self-reported health.The study is based on data from 572 adolescents aged 15-17 years who participated in the Fit Futures Study 2010-11 in Northern Norway. The participants were invited to wear an accelerometer (GT3X) attached to their hip for seven consecutive days. We used Spearman's rho and linear regression models to assess the validity of the SGPALS against the following accelerometry estimates of PA; mean counts/minute (CPM), steps/day, and minutes/day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).The SGPALS correlated with mean CPM (ρ = 0.40, p<0.01), steps/day (ρ = 0.35, p<0.01) and MVPA min/day (ρ = 0.35, p<0.01). We observed no differences between correlations within demographic strata (all p>0.001). Higher scores on SGPALS were associated with a higher CPM, higher number of steps per day and more minutes of MVPA per day, with the following mean differences in PA measurements between the SGPALS ranks: CPM increased by 53 counts (95% CI: 44 to 62), steps/day increased by 925 steps (95% CI: 731 to 1118), and MVPA by 8.4 min/day (95% CI: 6.7 to 10.0). Mean difference between the highest and lowest SGPALS category was 2947 steps/day (6509 vs. 9456 steps/day) and 26.4 min/day MVPA (35.2 minutes vs 61.6 minutes).We found satisfactory ranking validity of SGPALS measured against accelerometry in adolescents, which was fairly stable across strata of sex, BMI, and education. However, the validity of SGPALS in providing information on absolute physical activity levels seem limited."
https://openalex.org/W4294043686,"Understanding the distribution of pathogens causing acute febrile illness (AFI) is important for clinical management of patients in resource-poor settings. We evaluated the proportion of AFI caused by specific pathogens among outpatients in Bangladesh. During May 2019-March 2020, physicians screened patients aged ≥2 years in outpatient departments of four tertiary level public hospitals. We randomly enrolled patients having measured fever (≥100.4°F) during assessment with onset within the past 14 days. Blood and urine samples were tested at icddr,b through rapid diagnostic tests, bacterial culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Acute and convalescent samples were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA) for Rickettsia and Orientia (R/O) and Leptospira tests. Among 690 patients, 69 (10%) had enteric fever (Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi orSalmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi), 51 (7.4%) Escherichia coli, and 28 (4.1%) dengue detected. Of the 441 patients tested for R/O, 39 (8.8%) had rickettsioses. We found 7 (2%) Leptospira cases among the 403 AFI patients tested. Nine patients (1%) were hospitalized, and none died. The highest proportion of enteric fever (15%, 36/231) and rickettsioses (14%, 25/182) was in Rajshahi. Dhaka had the most dengue cases (68%, 19/28). R/O affected older children and young adults (IQR 8-23 years) and was detected more frequently in the 21-25 years age-group (17%, 12/70). R/O was more likely to be found in patients in Rajshahi region than in Sylhet (aOR 2.49, 95% CI 0.85-7.32) between July and December (aOR 2.01, 1.01-5.23), and who had a history of recent animal entry inside their house than not (aOR 2.0, 0.93-4.3). Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae were the most common bacterial infections, and dengue was the most common viral infection among AFI patients in Bangladeshi hospitals, though there was geographic variability. These results can help guide empiric outpatient AFI management."
https://openalex.org/W4294044090,"Exposure to traumatic stress leads to persistent, deleterious behavioral and biological changes in both human and non-human species. The effects of stress are not always consistent, however, as exposure to different stressors often leads to heterogeneous effects. The intensity of the stressor may be a key factor in determining the consequences of stress. While it is difficult to quantify intensity for many stress types, electric shock exposure provides us with a stressor that has quantifiable parameters (presentation length x intensity x number = shock volume). Therefore, to test the procedural differences in shock volume that may account for some reported heterogeneity, we used two common shock procedures. Learned helplessness is a commonly reported behavioral outcome, highlighted by a deficit in subsequent shuttle-box escape, which requires a relatively high-volume stress (HVS) of about 100 uncontrollable shocks. Conversely, stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) is another common behavioral outcome that requires a relatively moderate-volume stress (MVS) of only 15 shocks. We exposed rats to HVS, MVS, or no stress (NS) and examined the effects on subsequent fear learning and normal weight gain. We found doubly dissociable effects of the two levels of stress. MVS enhanced contextual fear learning but did not impact weight, while HVS produced the opposite pattern. In other words, more stress does not simply lead to greater impairment. We then tested the hypothesis that the different stress-induced sequalae arouse from an energetic challenge imposed on the hippocampus by HVS but not MVS. HVS rats that consumed a glucose solution did exhibit SEFL. Furthermore, rats exposed to MVS and glucoprivated during single-trial context conditioning did not exhibit SEFL. Consistent with the hypothesis that the inability of HVS to enhance fear learning is because of an impact on the hippocampus, HVS did enhance hippocampus-independent auditory fear learning. Finally, we provide evidence that stressors of different volumes produce dissociable changes in glutamate receptor proteins in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dorsal hippocampus (DH). The data indicate that while the intensity of stress is a critical determinant of stress-induced phenotypes that effect is nonlinear."
https://openalex.org/W4294044370,"Previous studies have suggested positive effects of mindfulness on inhibitory control (stopping behaviour). However, scarce previous studies suggest the relationship may depend on context. We provide first evidence that inhibitory control is challenged when perceiving attractive faces, especially when being mindful. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between mindfulness and inhibitory control and the moderating role of a social reward context (being exposed to attractive opposite sex faces). Participants (n = 50) between 18–43 years old (M = 25, SD = 5.4) filled out questionnaires assessing standard demographic variables and dispositional mindfulness. Subsequently, they performed a Go/No-go task with a neutral condition and attractive faces condition. Results showed that inhibitory control was challenged in the attractive condition relative to the neutral condition, p = 0.019. Dispositional mindfulness was negatively correlated with inhibitory performance, but only in the attractive faces condition (r = -0.32, p = 0.024). Results did not support a moderating role of gender. Finally, though post-hoc, higher mindfulness was associated with reduced perceived attractiveness of presented faces (r = -0.33, p = 0.019). However, the relationship between mindfulness and reduced inhibitory control could not be explained by mindfulness associated reduced attractiveness. Taken together, results show that mindfulness challenges inhibitory control when perceiving attractive faces. This implies that mindfulness interventions aimed at enhancing inhibitory control, may not render the desired effect in a context of being exposed to attractive faces. Though certainly plausible, it remains an open question whether results generalize to other reward contexts as well."

Nine experienced radiation oncologists delineated PORT CTVs for distal EBDC (pT2N1), proximal EBDC (pT2bN1) and GBC (pT2bN1) patients. The expectation maximization algorithm for Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) was used to quantify expert agreements. We generated volumes with a confidence level of 80% to compare the maximum distance to each CTV in six directions. The degree of agreement was moderate; overall kappa values were 0.573 for distal EBDC, 0.513 for proximal EBDC, and 0.511 for GBC. In the distal EBDC, a larger variation was noted in the right, post, and inferior direction. In the proximal EBDC, all borders except the right and left direction showed a larger variation. In the GBC, a larger variation was found in the anterior, posterior, and inferior direction. The posterior and inferior borders were the common area having discrepancies, associated with the insufficient coverage of the paraaortic node. A consensus guideline is needed to reduce inter-clinician variability in the CTVs and adequate coverage of regional lymph node area."
https://openalex.org/W4294044377,"The present study refers to an anthropometric model, Dahlmann-Body-Analysis (DBA), based on formerly developed weight-height-frame tables. Including the anthropometric variable abdomen circumference (AC), a further differentiation into muscularity and fat mass could be realized. This enables to calculate the individual percentage fat mass (%FM), providing a cost-effective method for epidemiological studies. The present work sets out to investigate, whether %FM computed by the DBA model compares to BIA measurements, notably under conditions of heavy obesity.In 103 adults (37 males, 66 females, age 42.5 ± 12.5 years, BMI 38.2 ± 4.8 kg/m²) %FM was estimated by a tetrapolar BIA device and compared to results derived by the DBA system. Bland-Altman and simple linear regression analyses were used to determine agreement between methods.The mean %FM estimates of men (women) ± standard deviation were 36.1 ± 4.8 (49.7 ± 4.5) for BIA and 36.7 ± 4.2 (49.1 ± 4.9) for DBA measurements. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) were r = 0.86 and CCC = 0.84 for men and r = 0.85 and CCC = 0.83 for women, respectively. Bland-Altman plot showed limits of agreement between DBA and BIA %FM that ranged from 5.5% to -4.3% for men and 4.6% to- 5.7% for women, respectively. Correlations between values measured by both methods were high and the observed confidence interval (SD of the difference between DBA and BIA result multiplied by 2) was low. No systematic error was found. The DBA system overestimates FM by 0.63 ± 4.98 (2SD) % for men and underestimates FM by -0.56 ± 5.28 (2SD) % for women, respectively, compared to the BIA results. The result for both genders is -0.066 ± 5.17 (2SD) %FM. Over all, there is a strong concordance and reproducibility between the DBA and BIA data sets.The implementation of the abdomen circumference (AC) into the DBA model as a proxy for body fat (%FM) resulted in a strong concordance with BIA measurements. These findings indicate that the DBA model may reflect the body shape of severely obese white European patients with regard to body composition."

Patients were assessed with HRCT, histopathology and received a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) IPF diagnosis. Endpoints of interest were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and lung function decline.A total of 1626 patients were analysed, treated with either pirfenidone (N = 808) or receiving no antifibrotic treatment (N = 818). When patients treated with pirfenidone were compared to patients not receiving antifibrotic treatment, OS (one-, two- and three-year probability of survival 0.871 vs 0.798; 0.728 vs 0.632; 0.579 vs 0.556, P = 0.002), and PFS (one-, two- and three-year probability of survival 0.597 vs 0.536; 0.309 vs 0.281; 0.158 vs 0.148, P = 0.043) was higher, and FVC decline smaller (-0.073 l/yr vs -0.169 l/yr, P = 0.017). The benefit of pirfenidone on OS and PFS was also seen in patients with probable or possible IPF.This EMPIRE analysis confirms the favourable outcomes observed for pirfenidone treatment in patients with definitive IPF and indicates benefits also for patients with probable or possible IPF."
https://openalex.org/W4294044960,"The validated 17-gene Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score® (GPS™) assay risk-stratifies prostate-cancer patients with localized disease. The assay has primarily been utilized in lower risk patients deciding between active surveillance versus definitive therapy. In this retrospective cohort study, we analyze the association of the GPS result with time to biochemical recurrence post-prostatectomy in patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN) intermediate and higher risk prostate cancer. The 141 patients included in the study were from the NorthShore University HealthSystem diagnosed 2014-2019 with NCCN intermediate (n = 109) or higher risk (n = 32) prostate cancer, treated with radical prostatectomy 2015-2019. The association of GPS result with time to biochemical recurrence was evaluated using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models in 120 patients with unfavorable intermediate or higher risk. Median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 28 (20 to 38) months. The GPS result was significantly associated with time to biochemical recurrence as both a continuous and dichotomous variable in univariable (hazard ratio [HR] per 20 GPS units 2.36, 95% CI 1.45-3.80, p < 0.001; HR for GPS result 41-100 vs 0-40 3.28, 95% CI 1.61-7.19, p < 0.001) and in multivariable models accounting for NCCN risk group (HR per 20 GPS units 2.14, 95% CI 1.31-3.46, p = 0.003; HR for GPS result 41-100 vs 0-40 3.00, 95% CI 1.43-6.72, p = 0.003) or biopsy Gleason Score and diagnostic PSA or PSA density. These results indicate that the GPS assay was a strong predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in this unfavorable intermediate and higher risk prostate cancer patient population."

Social Capital can be developed through offline and online relationships. It can be distinguished between cognitive Social Capital (perception of trustworthiness, reciprocity, and support) and structural Social Capital (density of social networks and membership, and participation in groups and associations). It can also be distinguished between bonding Social Capital (resources associated with informal networks; i.e., neighbors, friends, colleagues) and bridging Social Capital (resources associated with formal networks; i.e., community service, cultural, religious or political groups/associations). The different forms and dimensions of Social Capital may have distinct effects on health outcomes and self-rated health. Therefore, public health researchers need valid and reliable instruments to investigate Social Capital. However, valid instruments including the measurement of online Social Capital are not available. The Personal Social Capital Scale aims to assess bonding and bridging Social Capital by means of cognitive and structural items. In the present investigation, three studies were carried out ( N = 1149) to adapt the Personal Social Capital Scale to develop the Personal On-Offline Social Capital Brief Scale, a brief scale for measuring online and offline bonding and bridging Social Capital in Italy. Factorial structure and convergent/divergent validity in relation to scales measuring constructs with different patterns of relationships with bonding and bridging Social Capital (i.e., social support and stress; sense of community and health) were also investigated. Overall, these studies provide evidence of reliability and validity related to the internal structure of the Personal On-Offline Social Capital Brief Scale in measuring online and offline bonding and bridging Social Capital and discriminating them from similar constructs. This scale is a useful instrument for planning public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4294123021,"Plasmodium falciparum , a protozoan parasite and causative agent of human malaria, has one of the most A/T-biased genomes sequenced to date. This may give the genome and the transcriptome unusual structural features. Recent progress in sequencing techniques has made it possible to study the secondary structures of RNA molecules at the transcriptomic level. Thus, in this study we produced the in vivo RNA structurome of a protozoan parasite with a highly A/U-biased transcriptome. We showed that it is possible to probe the secondary structures of P . falciparum RNA molecules in vivo using two different chemical probes, and obtained structures for more than half of all transcripts in the transcriptome. These showed greater stability (lower free energy) than the same structures modelled in silico , and structural features appeared to influence translation efficiency and RNA decay. Finally, we compared the P . falciparum RNA structurome with the predicted RNA structurome of an A/U-balanced species, P . knowlesi , finding a bias towards lower overall transcript stability and more hairpins and multi-stem loops in P . falciparum . This unusual protozoan RNA structurome will provide a basis for similar studies in other protozoans and also in other unusual genomes."

Measures were repeated after 10km of running, the 50km finish (post-race), and again 24-hrs post-race.Compared with baseline values, Δ muscle thickness (resting to contracted) increased significantly 24 hrs post-race (11 ± 11% vs. 22 ± 8%; P = 0.01). Knee extensor torque was significantly reduced immediately post-race (151 ± 46 vs. 134 ± 43 Nm; P = 0.047) but remained similar to post-race values at 24 hrs post-race (P = 0.613). Compared with pre-race levels, IL-6 and calprotectin concentrations increased 302% and 50% after 10km, respectively (P<0.017 for both), peaked post-race (2598% vs. pre-race for IL-6 and 68% vs. pre-race for calprotectin; P = 0.018 for both), and returned to pre-race levels at 24-hrs post-race (P>0.05 for both).

https://openalex.org/W4294129811,"Background Best outpatient treatment of nonspecific chronic low back pain is high-dosed exercise that is maintained after therapy. Primary care biopsychosocial intervention (PCBI) is an outpatient multicomponent intervention that includes an active component (exercise, physical activity, or physiotherapy) and at least one psychological, social, or occupational component. Research has shown that PCBI can reduce pain intensity and disability. While scattered studies support low-dosed (&lt;15 treatment hours) PCBI, there is no systematic review comparing the effectiveness of low-dosed PCBI treatment with traditional physical activity interventions in adults with nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP). Inclusion criteria Randomised controlled trials that evaluate low-dosed outpatient biopsychosocial interventions compared to physical treatment with an active component such as exercise, physical activity or usual physiotherapy treatment for adult participants (18 years or older) who suffer from nonspecific CLBP will be included. Methods A comprehensive search of multiple databases will be used to find relevant studies. The databases will be searched from inception to December 2021, with English or German language restrictions imposed. Keywords and derivatives of “chronic back pain”, “exercise intervention”, “cognitive-behavioral therapy”, “primary care” and “randomized controlled trials” will be used. Sources will include CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid Medline, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), PubMed and Web of Science. Discussion To our knowledge, this will be the first systematic review and meta-analysis of narrowly defined low- dosed PCBI across populations with nonspecific chronic low back pain. The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dosed outpatient biopsychosocial interventions versus physical active interventions on pain intensity and disability in adults with CLBP.

https://openalex.org/W3204643108,"Zoonotic diseases spread through pathogens-infected animal carriers. In the case of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), evidence supports that the main carriers are fruit bats and non-human primates. Further, EVD spread is a multi-factorial problem that depends on sociodemographic and economic (SDE) factors. Here we inquire into this phenomenon and aim at determining, quantitatively, the Ebola spillover infection exposure map and try to link it to SDE factors. To that end, we designed and conducted a survey in Sierra Leone and implement a pipeline to analyze data using regression and machine learning techniques. Our methodology is able (1) to identify the features that are best predictors of an individual’s tendency to partake in behaviors that can expose them to Ebola infection, (2) to develop a predictive model about the spillover risk statistics that can be calibrated for different regions and future times, and (3) to compute a spillover exposure map for Sierra Leone. Our results and conclusions are relevant to identify the regions in Sierra Leone at risk of EVD spillover and, consequently, to design and implement policies for an effective deployment of resources (e.g., drug supplies) and other preventative measures (e.g., educational campaigns)."
https://openalex.org/W4294043775,"High calcium (Ca) intake and fine limestone reduces precaecal phosphorus (P) absorption independently of P solubility in broilers. This study aimed to determine whether dietary total Ca: total P ratio (Ca:P) and limestone particle size (LPS) affect gene expression of P transporters in the small intestine. A total of 384 one-day-old Ross 308 male broiler chickens received diets low (0.50), medium (1.00) or high (1.75) in Ca:P containing either fine (160 μm) or coarse (1062 μm) limestone, in a 3×2 factorial arrangement. Expression of Ca- and P-related genes were determined using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in duodenum and jejunum. Increasing dietary Ca:P decreased duodenal calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), calbindin-D28k (CaBP-D28k), plasma membrane Ca-ATPase 1 (PMCA1) and sodium-coupled P cotransporter type IIb (NaPi-IIb), but not transient receptor potential canonical 1 (TRPC1) mRNA. This effect was greater with fine limestone when Ca:P increased from low to medium, but greater with coarse limestone when increased from medium to high. A similar inhibitory effect was observed for jejunal CaBP-D28k expression where increasing dietary Ca:P and fine limestone decreased CaSR mRNA, while dietary Ca:P decreased TRPC1 mRNA only for coarse limestone. It also decreased jejunal NaPi-IIb mRNA irrespective of LPS. Dietary treatments did not affect jejunal PMCA1 mRNA expression or that of inorganic phosphate transporter 1 and 2 and xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor 1 in both intestinal segments. Dietary Ca increase reduced mucosal claudin-2 mRNA in both segments, and jejunal zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) mRNA only for coarse limestone. In conclusion, increasing dietary Ca:P reduced expression of duodenal P transporters (NaPi-IIb) in a LPS dependent manner, hence Ca induced reduction in intestinal P absorption is mediated by decreasing P transporters expression. Dietary Ca reduces Ca digestibility by downregulating mRNA expression of both Ca permeable claudin-2 and Ca transporters (CaBP-D28k, PMCA1)."
https://openalex.org/W4294043790,"COVID-19 has had adverse impacts on the health sector in Thailand and information on hospital costs is required for planning and budgeting. The aim of this study was to estimate costs that the pandemic imposed on a teaching hospital in the country, focusing on the first wave which took place in March-May 2020. A retrospective cost analysis was performed. Data on COVID-related activities, including when and where they were undertaken, were retrieved from existing sources and supplemented by in-depth interviews with the hospital's staff. The data collection period was January-October 2020, covering three distinct phases: before, during, and after the first wave of the pandemic. The total costs during the preparation phase in January-February, the pandemic phase in March-May, and the standby phase in June-October were 0.6, 3.9, and 1.2 million US dollars respectively. Costs related to treatment of COVID-19 patients were higher than those related to infection control in the first two phases but not in the standby phase, making up 82.09%, 75.23%, and 43.95% of the total costs in the three phases respectively. Costs were incurred in all areas of the hospital, including those that were set up to serve COVID patients, those serving non-COVID patients, and those serving both groups. Public donations were integral to the provision of services and made up 20.94% of the total cost during the pandemic phase. This study was the first to estimate hospital costs of COVID-19 in Thailand. It demonstrated high costs of a national outbreak and supported the establishment of a contingency fund for medical emergencies at the hospital level."

According to our knowledge, studies which attempted to identify determinants and their contributions to explain BMI-based nutritional gap between the poorest and the richest categories of Wealth Index are still scarce.To identify the nutritional gap of women between the richest-poorest classes in Bangladesh, and to determine how much of this gap are attributed to differences in predictors and differences in coefficients.Reproductive-aged (15-49 years) women of Bangladesh.We utilized the latest round (2017-2018) data of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS). Body mass index (BMI) has been used to measure the nutritional status of women. The kernel density was used to visualize the nutritional gap. The Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) decomposition method was used to ascertain influential determinants and their contributions to the existing gap between the richest-poorest classes of women.We analyzed the data of 18,682 reproductive-aged women. There was a significant mean BMI gap of 4.1 unit (95% CI: 3.90-4.35) between the poorest-richest (25.6 vs 21.5) women. The overall prevalence of underweight, overweight and obese were 11.8%, 33.8% and 15.4%, respectively. The richest women were less underweight (7.5%) but more overweight (23.7%) and obese (42.2%). In contrast, the poorest women were more underweight (32.0%) but less overweight (13.9%) and obese (7.0%). According to results of OB decomposition method, all predictors combinedly can explain 1.62 units (95% CI: 1.31-1.93) of the total mean BMI gap (equivalent to 40%). Some of the major predictors were women years of education (0.45 units, 95% CI: 0.27-0.64), spouse years of education (0.16 units, 95% CI: -0.02-0.34), current working status (0.17 units, 95% CI: 0.10-0.34), access to Television (0.50 units, 95% CI: 0.28-0.72), and place of residence (0.37 units, 95% CI: 0.22-0.72). The unexplained part of the poorest-richest gap was 2.51 units (95% CI: 2.13-2.89), which means that this particular gap will remain unchanged even though the mean difference of the predictors was diminished.A large part of the nutritional gap (approximately 60%) between the poorest and richest classes of women are found to be unchanged by the predictors of the study. Therefore, further predictors should be identified to minimize such gap. Moreover, policy makers and relevant stakeholders should implement feasible strategies to minimize the existing differences in the major predictors."

It is unknown whether the number and type of antigen affect results of diagnostic testing or prognosis, whether antigen identified by clinical history alone affects prognosis, and whether feather exposure is associated with outcomes similar to those of other antigens.To evaluate whether the number or type of antigen identified by clinical history alone affects clinical outcomes, we evaluated a retrospective cohort of patients with a high or definite probability of HP based on recent guidelines.In our retrospective cohort, 136 patients met high or definite probability of HP and were included in the analysis. Median transplant-free survival was better in patients with antigen identified on clinical history alone than patients without identified antigen. Feather exposure was associated with improved TFS compared to patients without antigen identified; there was no difference in TFS between patients with feather exposure and either mold or live bird exposure. Mold antigen was associated with increased risk of fibrotic HP compared to avian antigen. Among patients with identified antigen, the number and type of antigen did not affect TFS.Our study suggests that clinical history is adequate for providing prognostic information to patients with HP and classifying the diagnostic probability of HP according to recent guidelines. Feather exposure should be considered an inciting antigen in patients with ILD."
https://openalex.org/W4294044390,"Malawi spearheaded the development and implementation of Option B+ for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), providing life-long ART for all HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women. We used data from the 2015-2016 Malawi Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (MPHIA) to estimate progress toward 90-90-90 targets (90% of those with HIV know their HIV-positive status; of these, 90% are receiving ART; and of these, 90% have viral load suppression [VLS]) for HIV-positive women reporting a live birth in the previous 3 years.MPHIA was a nationally representative household survey; consenting eligible women aged 15-64 years were interviewed on pregnancies and outcomes, including HIV status during their most recent pregnancy, PMTCT uptake, and early infant diagnosis (EID) testing. Descriptive analyses were weighted to account for the complex survey design. Viral load (VL) results were categorized by VLS (<1,000 copies/mL) and undetectable VL (target not detected/below the limit of detection).Of the 3,153 women included in our analysis, 371 (10.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.8%-11.3%) tested HIV positive in the survey. Most HIV-positive women (84.2%, 95% CI: 79.9%-88.6%) reported knowing their HIV-positive status; of these, 94.9% (95% CI: 91.7%-98.2%) were receiving ART; and of these, 91.2% (95% CI: 87.4%-95.0%) had VLS. Among the 371 HIV-positive women, 76.0% (95% CI: 70.4%-81.7%) had VLS and 66.5% (95% CI: 59.8%-73.2%) had undetectable VL. Among 262 HIV-exposed children, 50.8% (95% CI: 42.8%-58.8%) received EID testing within 2 months of birth, whereas 17.9% (95% CI: 11.9%-23.8%) did not receive EID testing. Of 190 HIV-exposed children with a reported HIV test result, 2.1% (95% CI: 0.0%-4.6%) had positive results.MPHIA data demonstrate high PMTCT uptake at a population level. However, our results identify some gaps in VLS in postpartum women and EID testing."
https://openalex.org/W4294044393,"Laboratory medicine plays a critical role in the modern healthcare system, and it is reported to influence 60-70% of clinical decision makings. The quantitative laboratory test results are interpreted by comparing to the Reference Intervals (RIs) and therefore the use of appropriate RIs is critical. Clinical laboratories in Bhutan have been randomly using RIs from textbooks and manufacturer's package inserts without even verifying their applicability and therefore lessening their contribution to clinical decision makings. To improve the healthcare service delivery in Bhutan, this study aims to establish routine clinical chemistry and haematological test RIs for healthy adults in the Bhutanese population. Out of 1150 (male, n = 570; female, n = 580) healthy Bhutanese adults listed for the study through a simple random sampling technique, 1002 (male, n = 405; female, n = 597) individuals were assessed and 815 (male, n = 372; female, n = 443) individuals were enrolled in the study. An adequate volume of venous blood was drawn from these participants with the use of standard phlebotomy technique for clinical chemistry and haematological analysis. The laboratory data were analysed with the use of statistical methods recommended by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. After excluding the test results indicating underlying pathology and statistically detected outliers, a maximum of 775 (male, n = 346; female, n = 429) and 784 (male, n = 351; female, n = 433) individuals test values were eligible for clinical chemistry and haematology RIs establishment respectively. Statistically, there were no significant differences between age groups of same-sex for both test categories; however, significant differences between sex were observed for various test parameters in both test categories. Our RIs are generally comparable to other published literature. The established RIs are applicable to all the adult Bhutanese population; however, clinical laboratories should validate the transference of these RIs before using them for clinical purposes."
https://openalex.org/W4294044656,"Background Many cardiocirculatory mechanisms are involved in the adaptation to orthostatic stress. While these mechanisms may be impaired in Fontan patients. However, it is yet unclear how Fontan patients, who exhibit a critical fluid balance, respond to orthostatic stress. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are often prescribed to Fontan patients, but they may negatively influence orthostatic tolerance. Therefore, we evaluated the response to orthostatic stress in pediatric Fontan patients before and after treatment with enalapril. Methods Thirty-five Fontan patients (aged 14 years) with moderate-good systolic ventricular function without pre-existent enalapril treatment were included. Before and after a three-month enalapril treatment period, the hemodynamic response to head-up tilt test was evaluated by various parameters including cardiac index, blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, aortic stiffness and cardiac autonomous nervous activity. Thirty-four healthy subjects (aged 13 years) served as controls. Results Fontan patients had a decreased cerebral blood flow and increased aortic stiffness in the supine position compared to controls, while all other factors did not differ. Patients and controls showed a comparable response to head-up tilt test for most parameters. Twenty-seven patients completed the enalapril study with a mean dosage of 0.3±0.1mg/kg/day. Most parameters were unaffected by enalapril, only the percent decrease in cardiac index to tilt was higher after treatment, but the cardiac index during tilt was not lower (3.0L/min/m 2 pre-enalapril versus 2.8L/min/m 2 after treatment; P = 0.15). Conclusion Pediatric Fontan patients adequately respond to orthostasis with maintenance of blood pressure and cerebral blood flow and sufficient autonomic response. Enalapril treatment did not alter the response. Clinical trial information Scientific title: ACE inhibition in Fontan patients: its effect on body fluid regulation (sAFE-study).

https://openalex.org/W4294044661,"Mosquitoes transmit many pathogens responsible for human diseases, such as malaria which is caused by parasites in the genus Plasmodium. Current strategies to control vector-transmitted diseases are increasingly undermined by mosquito and pathogen resistance, so additional methods of control are required. Paratransgenesis is a method whereby symbiotic bacteria are genetically modified to affect the mosquito's phenotype by engineering them to deliver effector molecules into the midgut to kill parasites. One paratransgenesis candidate is Asaia bogorensis, a Gram-negative bacterium colonizing the midgut, ovaries, and salivary glands of Anopheles sp. mosquitoes. Previously, engineered Asaia strains using native signals to drive the release of the antimicrobial peptide, scorpine, fused to alkaline phosphatase were successful in significantly suppressing the number of oocysts formed after a blood meal containing P. berghei. However, these strains saw high fitness costs associated with the production of the recombinant protein. Here, we report evaluation of five different partner proteins fused to scorpine that were evaluated for effects on the growth and fitness of the transgenic bacteria. Three of the new partner proteins resulted in significant levels of protein released from the Asaia bacterium while also significantly reducing the prevalence of mosquitoes infected with P. berghei. Two partners performed as well as the previously tested Asaia strain that used alkaline phosphatase in the fitness analyses, but neither exceeded it. It may be that there is a maximum level of fitness and parasite inhibition that can be achieved with scorpine being driven constitutively, and that use of a Plasmodium specific effector molecule in place of scorpine would help to mitigate the stress on the symbionts."
https://openalex.org/W4294044674,"Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) catalyzes the interconversion between glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), thereby regulating sucrose synthesis in plant cells. In general, plants contain a pair of PGI isozymes located in two distinct compartments of the cell (cytosol and plastid) with differences in both the primary structure and the higher-order structure. Previously, we showed that the activity of cytosolic PGI (PGIc) is more robust (activity, thermal stability, substrate turnover rate, etc.) than that of the plastid counterpart (PGIp) in multiple organisms, including wheat, rice, and Arabidopsis . The crystal structures of apoTaPGIc (an isotype cytosol PGIc in Triticum aestivum ), TaPGIc-G6P complex, and apoTaPGIp (an isotype plastid PGIp in Triticum aestivum ) were first solved in higher plants, especially in crops. In this study, we detailed the structural characteristics related to the biochemical properties and functions of TaPGIs in different plant organelles. We found that the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of TaPGIc and TaPGIp are very different, which affects the stability of the dimerized enzyme, and that Lys213 TaPGIc /Lys193 TaPGIp and its surrounding residues at the binding pocket gateway may participate in the entrance and exit of substrates. Our findings provide a good example illuminating the evolution of proteins from primary to higher structures as a result of physical barriers and adaptation to the biochemical environment."
https://openalex.org/W4294044965,"Purpose Preventing falls in patients is one of the most important concerns in acute hospitals. Balance disorder and hypnotic drugs lead to falls. The Standing Test for Imbalance and Disequilibrium (SIDE) is developed for the evaluation of static standing balance ability. There have been no reports of a comprehensive assessment of falls risk including hypnotic drugs and SIDE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the fall rate of each patient who took the hypnotic drug and the factor associated with falls. Methods Fall rates for each hypnotic drug were calculated as follows (number of patients who fell/number of patients prescribed hypnotic drug x 100). We investigated the hypnotic drugs as follows; benzodiazepine drugs, Z-drugs, melatonin receptor agonists, and orexin receptor antagonists. Hypnotic drug fall rate was analyzed using Pearson’s chi-square test. Decision tree analysis is the method we used to discover the most influential factors associated with falls. Results This study included 2840 patients taking hypnotic drugs. Accidents involving falls were reported for 211 of inpatients taking hypnotic drugs. Z-drug recipients had the lowest fall rate among the hypnotic drugs. We analyzed to identify independent factors for falls, a decision tree algorithm was created using two divergence variables. The SIDE levels indicating balance disorder were the initial divergence variable. The rate of falls in patients at SIDE level ≦ 2a was 14.7%. On the other hand, the rate of falls in patients at SIDE level ≧ 2b was 2.9%. Gender was the variable for the second classification. In this analysis, drugs weren’t identified as divergence variables for falls. Conclusion The SIDE balance assessment was the initial divergence variable by decision tree analysis. In order to prevent falls, it seems important not only to select appropriate hypnotic drugs but also to assess patients for balance and implement preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W4294044986,"Objectives Patients with Panic Disorder (PD) show an abnormal stress-induced functioning of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis. Different protocols for stress induction are of rather low relevance for the psychotherapeutic treatment. In practice, interoceptive exposure is often realized as Low Intensity Exercise (LIE), as compared to an incremental cycle exercise test to exhaustion. Currently, it is not known, whether LIE displays an effective interoceptive stressor 1.) leading to a significant anxiety induction; 2.) a comparable HPA- and Sympathetic-Adreno-Medullar (SAM)-axis response in both patients and healthy controls; 3.) stress responses under LIE are associated with treatment outcomes. Patients and methods N = 20 patients with PD and n = 20 healthy controls were exposed to ten minutes of LIE on an exercise bike. LIE was applied as part of the interoceptive exposure, during an intensive Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in a day clinic. Heart rate was monitored and salivary cortisol samples collected. Before and after the LIE, state anxiety/ arousal were assessed. In order to evaluate psychopathology, the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, Mobility Inventory, Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire and Body Sensations Questionnaire were applied, before (T1) and after five weeks (T2) of an intensive CBT. Results LIE led to a significant and similar heart rate increase in both groups. Cortisol decreased over time in both groups, especially in male patients. A higher psychopathology before, and after CBT, was associated with a significantly lower cortisol response under LIE. Conclusions In the present study, LIE led to a divergent stress response: while there was a significant heart rate increase, cortisol decreased over time, particularly in male patients. A lower reactivity of the HPA-axis seems to be associated with a lower treatment outcome, which may affect extinction based learning. The findings suggest, that interoceptive stimuli should be designed carefully in order to be potent stressors."
https://openalex.org/W4294044993,"Introduction Transgender women (TGW) are one of the most vulnerable groups, including higher prevalence of HIV and mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression than in the general population. Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is one of the most important mental health conditions due to an increasing trend in prevalence in the general population. This study aims at describing the prevalence of symptoms of MDD (SMDD) and associated factors among TGW in capitals of three States in Northeast Brazil. Methods TGW n = (864) were selected from the cities of Salvador (n = 166), Recife (n = 350), and Fortaleza (n = 348) using Respondent Driven Sampling methodology. Symptoms of MDD were defined according to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare those with mild/moderate or moderately severe/severe symptoms of depression with those with no depression, respectively, using complex sample design. Weighted Odds Ratio with 95% confidence interval were estimated. Results 51.1% of the sample was classified as mild/moderate and 18.9% as moderately severe/severe SMDD. Mild/moderate SMDD was associated with a history of sexual violence (OR = 2.06, 95%CI: 1.15–3.68), history of physical violence (OR = 2.09, 95%CI: 1.20–3.67),) and poor self-rated quality of life (OR = 2.14, 95%CI: 1.31–3.49).). Moderately severe/severe SMDD was associated with history of sexual violence (OR = 3.02, 95%CI: 1.17–7.77), history of physical violence (OR = 4.34, 95% CI:1.88–6.96), poor self-rated quality of life (OR = 3.32, 95%CI:1.804–6.12), lack of current social support (OR = 2.53, 95%IC: 1.31–4.88) and lack of family support in childhood (OR = 2.17, 95%IC 1.16–4.05)). Conclusions Our findings strengthens the evidence of a higher prevalence of SMDD among TGW as compared to the general population. Public health policies and actions that target social determinants of risk and protection for MDD among TGW must be urgently implemented."
https://openalex.org/W4294125850,"Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is the genetic loci that encodes rRNA in eukaryotes. It is typically arranged as tandem repeats that vary in copy number within the same species. We have recently shown that rDNA repeats copy number in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled by cell volume via a feedback circuit that senses cell volume by means of the concentration of the free upstream activator factor (UAF). The UAF strongly binds the rDNA gene promoter, but is also able to repress SIR2 deacetylase gene transcription that, in turn, represses rDNA amplification. In this way, the cells with a smaller DNA copy number than what is optimal evolve to increase that copy number until they reach a number that sequestrates free UAF and provokes SIR2 derepression that, in turn, blocks rDNA amplification. Here we propose a mathematical model to show that this evolutionary process can amplify rDNA repeats independently of the selective advantage of yeast cells having bigger or smaller rDNA copy numbers. We test several variants of this process and show that it can explain the observed experimental results independently of natural selection. These results predict that an autoregulated feedback circuit may, in some instances, drive to non Darwinian deterministic evolution for a limited time period."
https://openalex.org/W4294127568,"Human alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3) is one of three alkaline ceramidases (ACERs) that catalyze the conversion of ceramide to sphingosine. ACERs are members of the CREST superfamily of integral-membrane hydrolases. All CREST members conserve a set of three Histidine, one Aspartate, and one Serine residue. Although the structure of ACER3 was recently reported, catalytic roles for these residues have not been biochemically tested. Here, we use ACER3 as a prototype enzyme to gain insight into this unique class of enzymes. Recombinant ACER3 was expressed in yeast mutant cells that lack endogenous ceramidase activity, and microsomes were used for biochemical characterization. Six-point mutants of the conserved CREST motif were developed that form a Zn-binding active site based on a recent crystal structure of human ACER3. Five point mutants completely lost their activity, with the exception of S77A, which showed a 600-fold decrease compared with the wild-type enzyme. The activity of S77C mutant was pH sensitive, with neutral pH partially recovering ACER3 activity. This suggested a role for S77 in stabilizing the oxyanion of the transition state. Together, these data indicate that ACER3 is a Zn2+-dependent amidase that catalyzes hydrolysis of ceramides via a similar mechanism to other soluble Zn-based amidases. Consistent with this notion, ACER3 was specifically inhibited by trichostatin A, a strong zinc chelator."
