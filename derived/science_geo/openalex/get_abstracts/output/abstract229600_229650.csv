https://openalex.org/W2102677290,"Adiponectin/Acrp30 is a hormone secreted by adipocytes, which acts as an antidiabetic and antiatherogenic adipokine. We reported previously that AdipoR1 and -R2 serve as receptors for adiponectin and mediate increased fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake by adiponectin. In the present study, we examined the expression levels and roles of AdipoR1/R2 in several physiological and pathophysiological states such as fasting/refeeding, obesity, and insulin resistance. Here we show that the expression of AdipoR1/R2 in insulin target organs, such as skeletal muscle and liver, is significantly increased in fasted mice and decreased in refed mice. Insulin deficiency induced by streptozotocin increased and insulin replenishment reduced the expression of AdipoR1/R2 in vivo. Thus, the expression of AdipoR1/R2 appears to be inversely correlated with plasma insulin levels in vivo. Interestingly, the incubation of hepatocytes or myocytes with insulin reduced the expression of AdipoR1/R2 via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Foxo1-dependent pathway in vitro. Moreover, the expressions of AdipoR1/R2 in ob/ob mice were significantly decreased in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, which was correlated with decreased adiponectin binding to membrane fractions of skeletal muscle and decreased AMP kinase activation by adiponectin. This adiponectin resistance in turn may play a role in worsening insulin resistance in ob/ob mice. In conclusion, the expression of AdipoR1/R2 appears to be inversely regulated by insulin in physiological and pathophysiological states such as fasting/refeeding, insulin deficiency, and hyper-insulinemia models via the insulin/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Foxo1 pathway and is correlated with adiponectin sensitivity.

Very recently, we have reported the cloning of complementary DNAs encoding adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and -R2 by expression cloning (14Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S.

Kadowaki T. Nature. 2003; 423: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). AdipoR1 is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas AdipoR2 is predominantly expressed in the liver. AdipoR1 and -R2 are predicted to contain seven transmembrane domains (14Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M. Hara K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohteki T.

It has not yet been determined whether the expressions of AdipoR1 and -R2 are altered in physiological and pathophysiological states. To address these questions, we first studied the expressions of AdipoR1 and -R2 during fasting and refeeding. We also analyzed the expressions of AdipoR1/R2 in an insulin deficiency model by streptozotocin (STZ) treatment (18Rakieten N. Rakieten M.L. Nadkarni M.R. Cancer Chemother. Rep. 1963; 29: 91-98Google Scholar). Moreover, we studied these expressions in a hyperinsulinemia model because of obesity-linked insulin resistance. The results of these studies reveal that insulin negatively regulates the expression levels of adiponectin receptors and adiponectin sensitivity and that obesity-linked insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia can cause down-regulation of adiponectin receptors and adiponectin resistance. We have also demonstrated that down-regulation of adiponectin receptors by insulin may be mediated via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Foxo1 dependent pathway.

Animals—Fifteen-week-old ob/ob mice and their wild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Male mice were housed in colony cages and maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Our high fat diet contains oil (1152 g of safflower oil (high oleic type containing 46% oleic acid (18: 1n-9) and 45% linoleic acid (18:2n-6) from total fatty acids (from Benibana, Tokyo, Japan), casein (1191.6 g of No. 19 from Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan), sucrose (633.6 g of No. 13 from Oriental Yeast), vitamin mix (50.4 g of No. 20 from Oriental Yeast (AIN76)), mineral mix (352.8 g of No. 25 from Oriental Yeast (AIN76)), cellulose powder (201.6 g of No. 19 from Oriental Yeast), dl-methionine (18 g from Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), and water 360 ml; total, 3600 g (19Yamauchi T.

Plasma insulin was measured by an insulin immunoassay (Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan). The animal care and procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Tokyo. STZ Treatments—Diabetes was induced by a double intraperitoneal injection of 0.2–0.3 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate solution (pH 4.5) containing STZ (200 mg/kg body weight). Control (non-STZ) mice were injected with 50 mm sodium citrate solution (pH 4.5). Three days after injection, plasma glucose levels were checked, and diabetes was confirmed (glucose level >250 mg/dl). Human regular insulin (1 unit/kg, Lilly) given in 0.2 ml of saline was administered to the STZ + insulin group. The mice in the STZ + vehicle and non-STZ groups received 0.2 ml of saline injected intraperitoneally. After the injection of insulin or saline, the animals were fasted for 6 h, and then the hind limb skeletal muscles were removed. Fasting and Refeeding—In the refeeding experiment, food was reintroduced after 48 h of fasting. The animals were killed 6 h after refeeding to isolate the tissues. Mice Primary Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were isolated from fasting 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice by the collagenase perfusion method (20Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 0.8 × 106 cells were plated onto collagen I-coated 12-well dishes (Iwaki, Chiba, Japan) in Williams medium E supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 10 nm dexamethasone, 1 nm insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 5 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Williams medium E supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin for 6 h. The cells were then switched to Williams medium E supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 100 nm insulin and harvested 6 h after the addition of insulin to isolate total RNA. Studies with C2C12 Cells—Induction of myogenic differentiation was carried out according to a method described previously (10Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Minokoshi Y. Ito Y. Waki H. Uchida S. Yamashita S. Noda M. Kita S. Ueki K. Eto K. Akanuma Y. Froguel P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Carling D. Kimura S. Nagai R. Kahn B.B. Kadowaki T. Nat.

In brief, the mouse C2C12 myoblasts were grown in 90% Dulbecco's modified high glucose Eagle's medium, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. When the cells were 80% confluent, the myoblasts were induced to differentiate into myotubes by replacing the medium with a low serum differentiation medium (98% Dulbecco's modified high glucose Eagle's medium, 2.5% (v/v) horse serum), which was changed daily. By day 5, the cells had differentiated into multinucleated contracting myotubes. Inhibition of PI3-kinase Pathways—C2C12 cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified high glucose Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin for 12 h. The cells were exposed to inhibitors (10 μm LY294002 or 10 μm PD98059) 30 min before the addition of insulin. The cells were harvested 6 h after the addition of insulin to isolate total RNA. Adenovirus-mediated Gene Transfer of Foxo1—Murine cDNAs encoding Foxo1-T24A/S253D/S316A were used (21Nakae J. Park B.-C. Accili D. J. Biol.

Binding Assay—Synthetic adiponectin was 125I-labeled at Tyr by IODO-beads (Pierce) in the presence of Na125I (2,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Membrane fractions of muscles were purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with binding buffer (ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/10% skim milk) containing the designated concentrations of [125I]adiponectin (2,000 cpm/ng of protein) plus unlabeled competitors. The binding equilibrium was judged to have been established when the binding assay was conducted at 4 °C after 2 h. The membrane fractions were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the membrane-bound radioactivity was determined using a γ-counter (10Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Minokoshi Y. Ito Y. Waki H. Uchida S. Yamashita S. Noda M. Kita S. Ueki K. Eto K. Akanuma Y. Froguel P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Carling D. Kimura S. Nagai R. Kahn B.B. Kadowaki T. Nat.

Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. The values presented under “Results” represent an average of triplicate determinations of three experiments. Fasting Increased, but Refeeding Decreased AdipoR1/R2 Gene Expressions—To clarify whether the expressions of AdipoR1 and/or AdipoR2 would be regulated under physiological and/or pathophysiological states, we first examined the expression levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in insulin as well as adiponectin target organs such as skeletal muscle and liver in mice under ad libitum fed, fasted, and refed conditions. At the start of the night cycle (9:00 p.m.), the animals were either provided with food or deprived of food for 48 h. A third group of mice was refed for 6 h after the 48-h fast. As can be seen in Fig. 1, A and B, the levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA expression in the liver increased dramatically after the 48-h fast, and refeeding rapidly restored these to a level equal to the original fed state. We observed similar regulation of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA by fasting and refeeding in skeletal muscle (Fig. 1, C and D). Plasma Insulin Levels Appear to Be Inversely Correlated with Expression Levels of the AdipoR1/R2 Gene—The particular hormones or nutrients responsible for this response to fasting and feeding are of considerable interest. Because insulin is the classic hormone of the fed state, we next measured plasma insulin levels under the ad libitum fed, fasted, and refed states. As expected, fasting decreased the plasma insulin levels (Fig. 1F), whereas they were increased by refeeding in a parallel fashion with the plasma glucose levels (Fig. 1E). These findings suggested that plasma insulin levels may appear to be inversely correlated with the expression levels of the AdipoR1/R2 gene and raised the possibility that insulin may control AdipoR1/R2 expression. STZ Treatment Increased, but Insulin Decreased AdipoR1/R2 Expression—To address this issue, we next studied the effects of insulin on AdipoR1/R2 expression in mice treated with STZ. To eliminate the effects of insulin on food intake, we withdrew food from all of the mice and killed the animals 6 h later. STZ treatment abolished plasma insulin (Fig. 2A) and, at the same time, caused a significantly marked increase in plasma glucose (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). The animals treated with STZ plus insulin exhibited reduced plasma glucose levels compared with the animals treated with STZ alone (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). We next measured the amounts of mRNA for AdipoR1 and -R2 in skeletal muscle and liver extracts. The results revealed 103 and 38% increases in AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA, respectively, in skeletal muscle of the STZ-treated mice, which was almost completely restored by insulin treatment (Fig. 2, C and D). These observations further support the possibility that insulin would reduce AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels. STZ treatment had little effect on AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels in the liver, whereas insulin significantly decreased the AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels in the liver of STZ-treated mice (data not shown). These results may be explained by the observations that inflammation may decrease AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels 2A. Tsuchida, T. Yamauchi, and T. Kadowaki, manuscript in preparation. and that STZ treatment may induce inflammation in the liver (23Levine B.S. Henry M.C. Port C.D. Rosen E. Drug Chem. Toxicol. 1980; 3: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Insulin Decreased AdipoR1/R2 mRNA Levels in Vitro—To determine whether insulin has a direct effect on AdipoR1/R2 expression in hepatocytes, we isolated hepatocytes from the C57BL/6 mice and incubated them for 5 h in medium containing fetal bovine serum, insulin, and dexamethasone, a mixture that preserves the differentiated state of freshly isolated hepatocytes (20Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). We then starved the cells for 6 h in the same medium without fetal bovine serum, insulin, and dexamethasone and incubated them for a further 6 h with or without 100 nm insulin. The hepatocytes were harvested, and then we measured the amounts of total AdipoR1 and -R2 mRNA. Insulin produced a decrease in the total amount of AdipoR1/R2 mRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). To further address the possibility that insulin may reduce AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels, we next studied whether insulin would reduce AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels in C2C12 myocytes in vitro. Insulin treatment at 10 nm did indeed decrease AdipoR1/R2 expression after 6 h (Fig. 3, C and D). Insulin-mediated Reduction in AdipoR1/R2 mRNA Is Suppressed by Inhibitors of PI3-kinase—The level of AdipoR1/R2 mRNA in C2C12 myocytes was investigated 6 h after the addition of insulin to myocytes incubated with various inhibitors of insulin signaling pathways (Fig. 3, C and D). The PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 abolished the decreased effect of insulin. In contrast, the response to insulin was essentially unaffected by PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. The inhibitory effects shown in Fig. 3, C and D, were maximal for all of the drugs tested, a point that was verified by dose-response experiments (results not shown). Foxo1 Increased AdipoR1/R2 mRNA Levels and Blocked Insulin-induced Reduction of the Levels—Insulin-dependent repression of the genes, which harbor a cis-acting element capable of binding Foxo1 in their promoter, might depend, at least in part, on PI3-kinase/Akt-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of this forkhead transactivator (21Nakae J. Park B.-C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 22Nakae J. Kitamura T. Siliver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Expression of the constitutively active form of Foxo1 (Foxo1-T24A/S253D/S316A) caused a marked increase in AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels. Insulin could not reverse the effect of Foxo1 on AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels (Fig. 3, E and F). These findings suggest that Foxo1 increased the expression levels of AdipoR1/R2 and that insulin repressed AdipoR1/R2 mRNA expressions via inactivation of Foxo1. AdipoR1/R2 Expression Levels Were Down-regulated in ob/ob Mice—We studied the expression of AdipoR1 and -R2 in insulin-sensitive tissues (such as liver), skeletal muscle (such as the soleus muscle and extensor digitorum longus (EDL)), and adipose tissues (such as white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT)) in control C57BL/6 mice and insulin-resistant ob/ob mice. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, in control C57BL/6 mice, AdipoR1 was most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas AdipoR2 was most abundantly expressed in the liver. Interestingly, both AdipoR1 and -R2 were more abundantly expressed in the EDL than in the soleus muscle. Moreover, both WAT and BAT expressed AdipoR1 and -R2. The expressions of both AdipoR1 and -R2 were significantly decreased in most of the insulin-sensitive tissues examined, except the liver, in ob/ob mice as compared with control C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 4, A and B). The expressions of AdipoR1 in the liver, soleus, EDL, WAT, and BAT from ob/ob mice were 79.4, 54.5, 50.5, 31.9, and 28.1% of those from the wild-type mice, respectively (Fig. 4A). The expressions of AdipoR2 in the liver, soleus, EDL, WAT, and BAT from ob/ob mice were 63.3, 51.4, 59.5, 7.9, and 29.4% of those from the wild-type mice, respectively (Fig. 4B). Decreased Expression Levels of AdipoR1/R2 in ob/ob Mice Appear to Be Correlated with Decreased Adiponectin Sensitivity—To clarify whether the expression levels of AdipoR1/R2 are associated with the effects of adiponectin in each tissue, we measured adiponectin binding to the membrane fractions of skeletal muscle and AMPK activation by adiponectin. Interestingly, adiponectin had a higher binding to the membrane fractions of skeletal muscle of wild-type mice than ob/ob mice (Fig. 5, A and B). Scatchard plot analysis revealed that both of the high affinity and low affinity binding sites for globular adiponectin and adiponectin binding in skeletal muscles of ob/ob mice were reduced compared with those of wild-type mice, suggesting that the numbers of both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were reduced (Fig. 5, A and B) (14Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M. Hara K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohteki T. Uchida S. Takekawa S. Waki H. Tsuno N.H. Shibata Y. Terauchi Y. Froguel P. Tobe K. Koyasu S. Taira K. Kitamura T. Shimizu T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Nature. 2003; 423: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). Moreover, adiponectin was able to activate AMPK in skeletal muscle of wild-type mice, whereas adiponectin was unable to activate AMPK in skeletal muscles of ob/ob mice (Fig. 5, C and D). These observations suggest that the expression levels of AdipoR1/R2 might regulate adiponectin binding and AMPK activation by adiponectin referred to as adiponectin sensitivity. We have recently cloned the adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, which appear to mediate the insulin-sensitizing actions of adiponectin (14Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M. Hara K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohteki T. Uchida S. Takekawa S. Waki H. Tsuno N.H. Shibata Y. Terauchi Y. Froguel P. Tobe K. Koyasu S. Taira K. Kitamura T. Shimizu T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Nature. 2003; 423: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the expression levels of AdipoR1 and -R2 to explore the potential role of altered expression of adiponectin receptors in the regulation of insulin and/or adiponectin sensitivity. Interestingly, we showed for the first time in this study that fasting increased, whereas refeeding decreased, the expression levels of AdipoR1 and -R2. During fasting, increased plasma catecholamines and glucagons can raise cAMP levels, resulting in the activation of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein through protein kinase A (24Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B. Montminy M. Nature. 2001; 13: 179-183Crossref Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). This factor then functions in a variety of fasting-sensitive genes through a canonical cAMP response element-binding protein binding site. Fasting also leads to an elevation of glucocorticoids, which control gene expression mainly if not exclusively through the glucocorticoid receptor and its well defined cognate sequence (25Friedman J.E. Sun Y. Ishizuka T. Farrell C.J. McCormack S.E. Herron L.M. Hakimi P. Lechner P. Yun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31475-31481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, neither cAMP nor glucocorticoids appear to have marked effects on the expression levels of AdipoR1/R2. 3A. Tsuchida, T. Yamauchi, and T. Kadowaki, unpublished data. Plasma insulin levels are decreased by fasting and increased by refeeding. Thus, we hypothesized that insulin can negatively regulate the expression levels of AdipoR1/R2. To test this hypothesis, we employed another animal model, STZ-induced insulin deficiency. Interestingly, STZ treatment diminished plasma insulin and at the same time caused a marked increase in AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels, and replenishment of insulin into STZ-treated mice reduced the levels to those observed in mice without STZ treatment, indicating that insulin reversed the effect of STZ on AdipoR1/R2 mRNA levels. Insulin greatly decreased AdipoR1/R2 expressions at the mRNA level and did so at doses of insulin consistent with those functioning through the insulin receptor. Of course, it is entirely possible that other hormones or nutrients in addition to insulin participate in the regulation of AdipoR1/R2 in this in vivo context. Most, if not all, of the known actions of insulin can be attributed to the receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2, which in turn triggers kinase cascades involving the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (26Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 27Kadowaki T. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 28Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). With respect to AdipoR1/R2 gene expression, insulin signaling via several possibly redundant pathways remains an intriguing possibility. The insulin effect on AdipoR1/R2 gene expression was virtually unaffected by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059, and thus does not appear to require activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. By contrast, results with LY294002 clearly implicated the PI3-kinase signaling pathway. These results of experiments using an inhibitor of PI3-kinase lead us to propose that the induction of AdipoR1/R2 gene expression is most likely mediated via the PI3-kinase branch of the insulin signaling pathways. The PI3-kinase signaling pathway is thought to be involved in the regulation of several genes by insulin, notably the gene for the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (29Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Recently, Akt, which is the downstream effector of PI3-kinase, was shown to phosphorylate several transcriptional activators of the forkhead family, including Foxo1, in vitro and in intact cells. The phosphorylation of specific residues in these factors inhibited their ability to activate the transcription of target genes as a result of the sequestration of the phosphorylated factors in the cytoplasm (30Biggs W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 31Takaishi H. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y.

Thus, the insulin-dependent repression of the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 gene, which harbors a cis-acting element capable of binding Foxo1 in its promoter, is thought to depend (at least in part) on Akt-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of this fork-head transactivator (29Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding characteristics are noteworthy because several (but not all) identified insulin response elements appear to be recognized by Foxo1. Visual and computer-assisted examination reveals many potential responsible sites (a sequence such as an insulin response element) in the AdipoR1/R2 promoter. 3A. Tsuchida, T. Yamauchi, and T. Kadowaki, unpublished data. Thus, we next examined whether Foxo1 would regulate the AdipoR1/R2 expressions. Interestingly, Foxo1 increased the AdipoR1/R2 expressions, and insulin was unable to reduce them, suggesting that Foxo1 increased and insulin reduced the AdipoR1/R2 expressions via down-regulation of Foxo1 activity. To date, there are no data indicating that ectopic expression of other factors can regulate AdipoR1/R2 expression. Further studies will be required to clarify this point. Finally, we found that the expressions of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were down-regulated in ob/ob mice, a model of insulin resistance linked to obesity. We have shown previously that plasma adiponectin levels were decreased in ob/ob mice (12Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Imai Y. Shimozawa N. Hioki K. Uchida S. Ito Y. Takakuwa K. Matsui J. Takata M. Eto K. Terauchi Y. Komeda K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohnishi Y. Naitoh T. Yamamura K. Ueyama Y. Froguel P. Kimura S. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2461-2468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and that these alterations in plasma adiponectin levels may play causal roles in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. These in combination raise the interesting possibility that altered expressions of AdipoR1/R2 in addition to plasma adiponectin levels may play a causal role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. This is consistent with our previous observation that decreased expressions of AdipoR1 or AdipoR2 by their respective small interfering RNA were associated with the reduced insulin-sensitizing effects of adiponectin (14Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Tsuchida A. Yokomizo T. Kita S. Sugiyama T. Miyagishi M. Hara K. Tsunoda M. Murakami K. Ohteki T. Uchida S. Takekawa S. Waki H. Tsuno N.H. Shibata Y. Terauchi Y. Froguel P. Tobe K. Koyasu S. Taira K. Kitamura T. Shimizu T. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Nature. 2003; 423: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). We provided the first evidence that the decreased expressions of AdipoR1 or AdipoR2 in these mouse models are associated with reductions in the insulin-sensitizing effects of adiponectin in vivo. Chronic overfeeding and its attending elevation of insulin would be expected to result in the decreased expression of AdipoR1/R2. This is likely to cause both adiponectin resistance and hence insulin resistance. The decrease in AdipoR1/R2 mRNA leads to a decrease in adiponectin binding, and this in turn leads to a decrease in the adiponectin effects, termed adiponectin resistance, the so-called vicious cycle. These findings may provide a novel molecular mechanism for the well known ability of insulin to induce insulin resistance, down-regulation of adiponectin receptors, in addition to the previously recognized down-regulation of insulin receptors. In conclusion, the expressions of AdipoR1/R2 in insulin target tissues appear to be inversely correlated with plasma insulin levels. The present study is the first to demonstrate that insulin negatively regulates the expression levels of adiponectin receptors via the PI3-kinase/Foxo1 pathway. Our data also suggest that not only agonism of AdipoR1/R2 but also strategies to increase AdipoR1/R2 may be logical approaches to provide a novel treatment modality for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

A C-terminal proteolytic event exposes two glycine residues at the C terminus that are involved in the formation of a peptide bond with the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue of a target protein.

The E2 enzyme, UBC9, is specific for sumoylation, and recently, two additional SUMO family members have been identified based on the interaction with UBC9, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 (10Saitoh H. Hinchey J.

Very little is known regarding the functions of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3.

Thus, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 may have different roles in cellular functions.

The primer was removed from the reaction mixture by purification using a Cycle-Pure kit from Omega Bio-Tek (Doraville, GA). The purified cDNA (10 μl to one-third of the total) was amplified in 25 μl of PCR reactions containing dNTPs, 1.25 m betaine (Sigma), and primers for SUMO-4F1 (forward) (5′-GCAATATGCTTGTGTACACATAC-3′) and either SUMO-4R1 (reverse) (5′-CACAGAAGAAGTCAAGACTGAG-3′) or SUMO-2R1 (5′-CAAGGAAGGAGTCAAGACTGA-3′). The PCR reaction was “hot-started” by adding Taq polymerase (PGC Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD) at 95 °C. The SUMO-2R1 and SUMO-4R1 primers have three mismatches, which were sufficient to obtain allele-specific PCR using the conditions described. After 35 cycles of PCR using an annealing temperature of 55 °C, 5 μl of the PCR product was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel to identify the expected 466-bp DNA fragments. Control experiments were performed in which equivalent amounts of RNA were amplified without the prior reverse transcriptase step to demonstrate that RT-PCR products were generated from RNA and not from contaminating DNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis at our Child Health Research Center Sequencing Core at Baylor College of Medicine was used to confirm the specificities of the SUMO-2 and SUMO-4 RT-PCR products, respectively. Genotyping—Genotyping was done using a 3-step primer extension assay (12Devaney J.M. Pettit E L. Daler S.G. Vallone P.M. Butler J.M. Marino M.A. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). First, a defined region was amplified using 30 cycles of PCR consisting of 1 min at 94 °C (denaturation), 1 min at 55 °C (annealing), and 1 min at 72 °C (extension). PCR using SUMO-4F1 and SUMO-R2 primers (see RT-PCR above) resulted in a PCR product of 466 bp. In the next step, dNTPs and primers remaining from the PCR were removed by enzymatic digestion using shrimp alkaline phosphatase and exonuclease I (each from Amersham Biosciences). In the final step, the single base extension (SBE) reaction using an oligonucleotide primer resides directly adjacent to the nucleotide in question. The SBE primer was 5′-GAACCACGGGGATTGTCA-3′. The SBE reaction contained the extension primer, all four dideoxy dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences), Taq polymerase, and the purified PCR product. The SBE assay was done using 49 cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 60 °C for 30 s. After the SBE primer was extended with the nucleotide analogue, the resulting products were analyzed using ion-pair reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with the WAVE System (Transgenomic, Inc., Omaha, NE). Recombinant Clones—Vectors pHSE-Luc, pNF-κB-Luc, pTAL-Luc, and pCMV-Myc were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Renilla luciferase reporter phRL-null vector was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and HSF2 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). pET-15b vector was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, SUMO-4M, and SUMO-4V constructs were made to express active recombinant proteins ending in the terminal di-glycine residues (Fig. 1, additional C-terminal residues are cleaved normally in vivo). UBC9 was made to the full-length protein. All of the recombinant proteins were expressed in pET-15b vector. This vector allows the expression of recombinant proteins containing a His tag at the N terminus of the recombinant protein. The recombinant proteins were propagated in BL21(DE3)-transformed cells, and recombinant proteins were purified utilizing the His-bind resin (Ni2+) as described by the manufacturer (Novagen). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, with the exception of SUMO-4, which was dialyzed against 25 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 75 mm NaCl. The sequence of all of the recombinant clones was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. RT-PCR from 293 human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (Ambion) was used as a source of RNA to make cDNA in all of the constructs. The HEK cells are heterozygous and express mRNA for both SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V. For SUMO-4, the primer SUMO-4F2-GCCATATGGCCAACGAAAAGCC containing a NdeI site and primer SUMO-4R2-TCAACCTCCCGTAGGCTGTTG, which terminates the SUMO-4 amino acid sequence by two amino acids, were utilized. The RT-PCR products were ligated into TA-cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and transformed into XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells. A 328-bp restriction endonuclease fragment created by the digestion of recombinant clones with the restriction endonucleases, NdeI (site in primer) and BamHI (site in vector), was subcloned into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET-15b. RT-PCR products of SUMO-2 were made using primers SUMO-2F2-GCCATATGGCCGACGAAAAGCC (NdeI site in primer) and SUMO-2R2-CCGGATCCTCAACCTCCCGTCTGCT (BamHI site in primer) and were ligated into pCR2.1. A NdeI/BamHI restriction endonuclease fragment from recombinant SUMO-2/pCR2.1 was subcloned into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET-15b. UBC9, SUMO-1, and SUMO-3 cDNA were made by RT-PCR using primers that did not contain NdeI or BamHI restriction endonuclease sites: UBC9F1-CGAGGGACTTTGAACATGTC; UBC9R1-CTGCGATGCCACAAGGT; SUMO-1F-GGTGAAGCCACCGTCATC; SUMO-1R-GAATATCTAAACTGTTGAATGACCC; SUMO-3F-CGCTCGGAAGCCATGT; and SUMO-3R-CTGCCAGGCTGCTCTCCG. An aliquot of the above reactions was re-amplified by PCR using primers containing NdeI and BamHI sites: UBC9F2-CGAGGGACTTTGCATATGTC; UBC9-R2-CAAGGTGGATCCTTATGAGG; SUMO-1F2-CCA-CCGTCCATATGTCTGACCAG; SUMO-1R2-AAAGAATATCGGATCCGTTGACTAACCCCCC; SUMO-3F2-CGCTCGGAACATATGTCCG; and SUMO-3-R2-CAGGCTGGGATCCGGCTAACCTCC. The secondary PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and were subcloned directly into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET-15b. For subcloning into a mammalian expression vector, pCMV-Myc (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), the recombinant SUMO-4/pET vectors were altered by 3 nucleotide changes to create a EcoRI site, in-frame with the first Met of both SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit utilizing PfuTurbo DNA polymerase and primers 5′-GTGCCGCGCGGAATTCATATG-3′ and its reverse complement were used per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An EcoRI/BamHI double digest resulted in a restriction endonuclease fragment, which was subcloned into the EcoRI/BglII sites of pCMV-Myc. HSF2 plasmid was amplified with primers HSF2NDEF-CGCCGCGTTACATATGAAGCAGAG and HSF2BAMR-CTGTTTTATCGGATCCTTCTGAGCAC, which resulted in a 410-bp PCR product containing NdeI and BamHI sites and included the complete DNA-binding domain (DBD) of HSF2. After digestion with NdeI and BamHI, the sequence was sub-cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-15b. The recombinant HSF2-DBD/pET vector was altered to create a EcoRI site, in-frame with the first Met of HSF2, and the EcoRI/BamHI restriction endonuclease fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI/BglII sites of pCMV-Myc as described above and is called pCMV-Myc-HSF2-DBD82K. The lysine 82 was mutated to arginine using the primer 5′-GACTCTGGAATTGTAAGGCAAGAAAGAGATG-3′ and its reverse complement as described above and is called pCMV-Myc-HSF2-DBD82R. Antibodies—The SUMO-4-specific antibodies were prepared by the following protocol. The antiserum was made in rabbits immunized with the peptide-CEPRGLSVKQIRFRFG (SUMO-4V) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein through the N-terminal Cys of the peptide (Sigma Genosys). The IgG fraction of the antiserum (4 ml/run) was purified using the Ag antibody purification kit from Pierce. SUMO-2 peptide-CERQGLSMRQIRFRFD made by Sigma Genosys was bound to Sepharose using the Sulfolink kit from Pierce (Rockford, IL). The IgG was fractionated over the SUMO-2 peptide column using the Pierce protocol and was tested for specificity against recombinant proteins for SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, SUMO-4M, and SUMO-4V by Western blotting. The SUMO-4 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000 and detected only SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V at approximately equal signal intensities. Monoclonal antibody for c-Myc (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used at a 1:2000 dilution. Transfections—HepG2 were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. The cells were transfected at ∼75% confluency with 20 μg of DNA/well of pCMV-Myc-SUMO-4 constructs using a standard calcium phosphate protocol (13Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Genomics. 1999; 60: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After 6 h, the cells were shocked in 15% glycerol for 90 s and allowed to recover in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. After a 48-h incubation, the wells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped and the cells were concentrated by centrifugation. Nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (14Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-120213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was suspended in buffer 1 (200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT) for 30 min, cells were lysed by passage through a 22-guage needle, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was stored at -20 °C, and the nuclei were suspended in buffer 2 (50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25% sucrose, 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT) for 60 min. The nuclear extract was recovered from the supernatant after centrifugation and stored at -20 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using c-Myc primary antibody. For co-transfections of pCMV-Myc-SUMO-4/pCMV-Myc-DBD-HSF2 constructs, 1 μg of each plasmid was transfected in 24-well plates as described above and whole cell extracts (WCEs) were made by dissolving the cells directly into 100 μl of 1× NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer containing reducing agent (Invitrogen). 20 μl of WCE was analyzed by Western blotting using the c-Myc primary antibody. Western Blotting—Nuclear, cytoplasmic, or WCEs were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with primary antibodies followed by anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase or anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Bands were visualized using ECL chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography (Kodak X-Omat AR film). Luciferase Assay—Transfections for luciferase reporter assays were done as described above using 2.2 μg of transfected DNA in 24-well plates. The amount of DNA transfected was 1 μg of test plasmid (either the SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V construct or the control pCMV-Myc lacking the SUMO-4 sequences), 1 μg of either firefly luciferase reporter vector (pHSE-Luc or pNF-κB-Luc) or the pTAL-Luc control vector lacking any response element, and 0.2 μg of Renilla vector. The Renilla vector (phRL-null) served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Dual-luciferase assays were done using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI) as described previously (13Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Genomics. 1999; 60: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amount of firefly luciferase activity was normalized to that of the control Renilla luciferase activity. To determine the specific effect of the heat shock element (HSE) and NF-κB response elements without SUMO-4 overexpression in HepG2 cells, the combination of pCMV-Myc control/pTAL-Luc/phRL-null vector was transfected to determine background luciferase activity. The combination of pCMV-Myc control/pHSE-Luc/phRL-null or pCMV-Myc control/pNF-κB-Luc/phRL-null were transfected next into HepG2 cells, and the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase was compared with the background levels determined above. This comparison provided a relative amount of active transcription factors in the resting HepG2 cells that could bind to the HSE or NF-κB response elements, respectively. SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V/pHSE-Luc or pNF-κB-luc/phRL-null combinations were transfected into HepG2 cells to determine the effect of SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V overexpression on the specific response elements. The effect of overexpression of SUMO-4 on reporter gene expression was compared with the levels of reporter expression lacking SUMO-4 calculated above. To study the effect of oxidative stress, H2O2 (Sigma) was added to media to a final concentration of 2 or 4 mm during the final 18 h of transfection. 4–8 transfections were done for each combination of constructs, and the results were plotted as the mean ± S.E. The student's t test was used to determine the significance of the findings. In Vitro Sumoylation Assay—HepG2 cells (∼3 × 105) were concentrated by centrifugation and suspended in 100 μl of solution 3 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 1% Triton X-100) (14Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-120213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 5 min of incubation on ice, the lysed cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm and the supernatant was collected. The whole cell extract was used in the in vitro sumoylation assay. Formation of the thioester adducts between the recombinant E2 enzyme UBC9 and SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V was initiated essentially as described previously (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Reactions contained whole cell extracts from HepG2 (7 μg), and recombinant SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V (2 μg) and UBC9 (5 μg) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 2 mm DTT (30 μl of total reaction volume). Control reactions lacking recombinant UBC9 or including 100 mm DTT also were prepared. Reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C and then stopped by adding 5 μl of NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate buffer and heated to 100 °C for 4 min. Samples (15 μl) were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blotting using SUMO-4-specific primary and anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies as described above. Genetic Analyses—The chromosome 6q25 region has been shown to be associated with type I diabetes susceptibility (IDDM5) by linkage studies (16Cox N.J. Wapelhorst B. Morrison V.A. Johnson L. Pinchuk L. Spielman R.S. Todd J.A. Concannon P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 820-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). SUMO-4 is located in this region. The Tsp test (17Martin E.R. Kaplan N.L. Weir B.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was used to access linkage disequilibrium between the SUMO-4 marker alleles and disease, because this test provides a valid χ2 test for linkage disequilibrium in the presence of linkage. Tsp examines whether a heterozygous parent transmits the same or different marker alleles to each of their affected children (sibling pairs). Tissue Specificity of an mRNA Encoded by a Novel SUMO Gene on Chromosome 6q25—A SUMO-related nucleotide sequence is located within intron 6 of the TAB2 (mitogen-activating protein kinase kinase kinase 7-interacting protein-2, MAPK7IP2) gene on chromosome 6q25 (TAB2 DNA NCBI accession number AL031133 and smt3-like protein NCBI accession number CAA20019). In contrast to SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3, the SUMO-related DNA sequence does not contain any introns; however, it contains an open reading frame of 95 amino acids, a putative polyadenylation site, and a consensus ribosome-binding site (Kozak sequence) for correct translation initiation. Moreover, the predicted amino acid sequence is similar to that of SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 with the largest sequence homology to SUMO-2 (Fig. 1, 87% amino acid homology). We have named this “putative” protein SUMO-4 based on the strong sequence homologies. To determine whether an mRNA specific to SUMO-4 is expressed, we performed RT-PCR from total RNA of various tissues. In contrast to SUMO-2, which is highly expressed in all of the tissues examined, SUMO-4 mRNA was detected mainly in kidney and HEK cells (Fig. 2). A nucleotide sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products confirmed their identities as SUMO-2 and SUMO-4, respectively. Amino Acid Polymorphism in SUMO-4 —A SNP was identified previously in this gene (rs237025, chromosome 6 position 149656820; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The C/T polymorphism is in the antisense strand and encodes methionine 55 (ATG) and valine 55 (GTG), respectively. Indeed, DNA isolated from HEK cells is heterozygous for the A/G DNA polymorphism. To determine the frequency of the SNP, we typed 115 unrelated Caucasian individuals. The allele frequencies of A and G were 0.49 and 0.51, respectively. Met-55 is conserved in SUMO 1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 proteins in humans (Fig. 1) as well as in SUMO-related sequences in the following organisms: mouse; Xenopus; Drosophila, and yeast (18Su H.-L Li S.S.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of Met-55 between SUMO proteins within humans and among different species suggests that the M55V substitution may affect the structure and function of SUMO proteins. In Vitro Sumoylation—To determine whether SUMO-4 utilizes the E2 enzyme, UBC9, we tested recombinant SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V proteins in an in vitro sumoylation assay containing whole cell extract from HepG2 cells containing or lacking recombinant UBC9 (Fig. 3, lanes 1–6). High molecular weight (HMW) bands with molecular masses greater than 60 kDa were identified in Western blots for both SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V proteins (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4, respectively) but were absent when recombinant UBC9 was omitted from the reaction (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 5). The HMW bands were also absent when recombinant UBC9 plus 100 mm DTT was present (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 6). DTT (100 mm) inhibits the formation of the thioester bonds and therefore provides additional evidence that the HMW bands are the result of sumoylation (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4). UBC9-dependent SUMO-4 bands of 26 and 33 kDa are also present but in relatively lesser quantities than the HMW bands (Fig. 3, lane 1 and very weak in lane 4). These complexes are of the correct size for a SUMO-4 dimer and a SUMO-4·UBC9 complex, respectively (Fig. 3). Transfection Studies in HepG2 Cells—To test SUMO-4 overexpression in vivo, we used SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V constructs tagged with c-Myc in mammalian expression vectors containing the CMV promoter that were transfected into HepG2 cells (Fig. 3, lanes 7–10). In cytoplasmic extracts prepared from SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V transfections, most of the protein detected in Western blots was unconjugated free SUMO-4 (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 10). In contrast, nuclear extracts from these experiments demonstrated mostly multiple bands greater than 50 kDa (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 9). These results suggest that SUMO-4 targets multiple proteins, and these are found primarily in the nucleus. Furthermore, the SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V expression products detected by the c-Myc tag appear to be equally present in the HepG2 cells (Fig. 3, lanes 7–10), demonstrating that the most abundant sumoylated proteins in HepG2 cells are not sumoylated differentially by the Met and Val variants. To characterize a specific substrate, we tested lysine 82 located in the DBD of HSF2, which is known to be sumoylated with SUMO-1 in vitro (7Goodson M. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis J. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), for sumoylation with SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V. SUMO-4M or SUMO-4V and either pCMV-Myc-HSF2-DBD82K (lysine-normal) or pCMV-Myc-HSF2-DBD82R (arginine-mutant) were co-transfected into HepG2 cells, and the WCE was analyzed by Western blotting with a c-Myc antibody (Fig. 4). Both DBD82K (Fig. 4, lane 5) and DBD82R (Fig. 4, lane 6) were expressed as 20-kDa proteins in HepG2 cells, whereas free SUMO-4 is expressed as a 12-kDa protein (Fig. 4, lanes 3 (Met) and 4 (Val)). A small amount of SUMO-4 is conjugated to HMW (100,000) HepG2 proteins (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). However, in co-transfection experiments, DBD82K (Fig. 4, lanes 1 (Met) and 2 (Val)) was sumoylated, whereas DBD82R (Fig. 4, lanes 7 (Met) and 8 (Val)) was not. These results confirm a single sumoylation site in the DBD of HSF2 at lysine 82 (7Goodson M. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis J. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the major sumoylated species was not 32 but was 44 kDa, whereas minor sumoylated products were detected at 32 and 56 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). These results suggest that the DBD·SUMO-4 complexes have 1–3 copies of SUMO-4 and one copy of DBD82K. Indeed, SUMO-4 has a consensus sumoylation site, VKTE, located at amino acids 10–13 (Fig. 1), and thus, our results are consistent with SUMO-4 forming polymeric SUMO side chains. The degree of sumoylation of DBD82K with SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V was not different (Fig. 4, lane 1 versus 2 and data not shown). To determine whether SUMO-4 overexpression had a biological effect in the HepG2 cells, luciferase reporter constructs containing or lacking multiple copies of HSE or NF-κB binding elements were utilized in co-transfection experiments. These two response elements were selected because IκBα, HSF1, and HSF2 are known targets of sumoylation by SUMO-1 (3Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 6Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis J. Mayhew C.N. Goodson M. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40263-40267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Goodson M. Hong Y. Rogers R. Matunis J. Park-Sarge O.-K. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18513-18518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). IκBα sumoylation inhibits NF-κB activity, whereas HSF1 and HSF2 sumoylation is required for the transcription factors to efficiently bind to and activate the HSE elements. The transfection of SUMO-4M activated the expression from the HSE elements (Fig. 5, lane 4 versus 5; p = 3.6 × 10-5) while suppressing activation from the NF-κB elements by ∼32% (Fig. 5, lane 1 versus 2; p = 3.7 × 10-4). Transfection of SUMO-4V also activated the expression from the HSE elements (Fig. 5, lane 4 versus 6; p = 0.002); however, the increase was significantly less compared with SUMO-4M (Fig. 4, 2.8-versus 4.2-fold, lane 6 versus 5; p = 0.004). Likewise, the transfection of SUMO-4V suppressed NF-κB activation (Fig. 5, lane 1 versus 3; p = 7.4 × 10-4); however, the suppression was the same for SUMO-4M compared with SUMO-4V (Fig. 5, lane 2 versus 3; p = not significant). In transfection studies of HepG2 cells under basal conditions (Fig. 5, lane 4), endogenous HSFs were not active (relative luciferase levels of ∼1) but were activated 4.2- and 2.8-fold when transfected with SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V, respectively (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6). To test the effect of oxidative stress on HSF activation, HepG2 cells were treated with 2 or 4 mm H2O2 for 18 h. Endogenous HSFs were activated 2.1- and 8.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 4). At 2 mm H2O2, the transfection of SUMO-4M and SUMO-4V both increased the amount of HSF reporter levels (Fig. 6, lane 1 versus 2, 5.7-fold activation, p = 0.0004; lane 1 versus 3, 4.2-fold activation, p = 0.002), and the levels were higher for SUMO-4M than they were for SUMO-4V (Fig. 6, lane 2 versus 3; p = 0.0008). At 4 mm H2O2, SUMO-4M increased reporter levels (Fig. 6, lane 4 versus 5, 8.5–13.5-fold activation; p = 0.04) and SUMO-4V levels were intermediate (Fig. 6, lane 6, 10.4-fold activation); however, the SUMO-4V activation was not statistically different compared with either 4 mm H2O2 alone or SUMO-4M (Fig. 6, lanes 4 versus 6 and 5 versus 6, respectively). Association of SUMO-4M with Susceptibility to Type I Diabetes Mellitus—Studies have shown the linkage of markers on chromosome 6q25 (IDDM5) with susceptibility to type I diabetes mellitus (16Cox N.J. Wapelhorst B. Morrison V.A. Johnson L. Pinchuk L. Spielman R.S. Todd J.A. Concannon P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 820-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the specific identity of IDDM5 has yet to be determined. Type I diabetes is characterized by selective β-cell destruction, resulting in an absolute requirement for exogenous insulin and a young albeit heterogeneous age of onset. The etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms of β-cell destruction are not understood completely, although an autoimmune process clearly is involved. The location of SUMO-4 in the IDDM5 region makes it an interesting “candidate gene” for the IDDM5 diabetes susceptibility. We typed the M55V DNA polymorphisms (A/G) in 478 families to determine whether there was a familial association with type I diabetes. The A polymorphism (encoding Met) was transmitted 57.1% of the time (467/818) to the diabetic offspring from heterozygous (A/G) parents (Tsp = 4.0 × 10-4). For comparison, the A polymorphism was transmitted 46.2% of the time (78/169) to the unaffected offspring from the heterozygous parents. The transmission results in the unaffected siblings demonstrates that the association with type I diabetes susceptibility is not a general transmission bias. We have characterized a novel SUMO gene that is related to SUMO-2 but whose mRNA is expressed in a limited number of tissues. We confirm that this novel protein belongs to the SUMO family, because its expression uses the SUMO-specific E2 enzyme UBC9 in vitro. This becomes the fourth member of the SUMO family (SUMO-4). We identified and characterized a polymorphism within this family, SUMO-4M55V. Although, the allelic frequency of SUMO-4V is 0.51 in the Caucasian population, the valine substitution has not been reported in any other human SUMO member (18Su H.-L Li S.S.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The highly conserved nature of this Met amino acid across various SUMO family members (Fig. 1) and across species (18Su H.-L Li S.S.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggests that it may be biologically important for the function of the molecule. We demonstrate an increase in HSE reporter expression due to SUMO-4M compared with SUMO-4V. However, the differences in reporter expression were specific for HSE and were not found for NF-κB (Fig. 5) or activator protein 1 (data not shown). HSF1 molecules are not normally active in resting cells but become active after cells are exposed to various stress conditions (19Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In contrast, HSF2 is activated by hemin in human K562 erythroleukemia cells and is active in mouse ES cells during early embryogenesis but is not activated by the classical stress stimuli (19Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The difference in HSF-reporter expression due to SUMO-4M compared with SUMO-4V also was found under mild oxidative stress conditions (2 mm H2O2), which resulted in a 2-fold activation of endogenous HSFs (Fig. 6). However, under severe oxidative stress (4 mm H2O2), the increased levels of HSE-reporter levels of Met-55 compared with Val-55 was less evident (Fig. 6) and may be attributed to endogenous SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3, competing with SUMO-4 for activated HSF-1 substrate. Alternatively, the HSE reporter assay may no longer be in a linear range because of saturation of HSE binding sites in the reporter. It remains to be determined whether our differential activation of HSFs by SUMO-4M compared with SUMO-4V is due to HSF1 and/or HSF2. However, the roles of HSF1 and HSF2 may not be independent in stressed cells because interactions and cooperative effects have been detected in both of them (20He H. Soncin F. Grammatikakis N. Li Y.

We also have demonstrated that SUMO-4M is associated with type I diabetes susceptibility. SUMO-4 sumoylation of HSF1 and/or HSF2 may be involved directly in the type I diabetes pathogenesis through abnormal HSP expression in pancreatic β-cells. HSPs are “molecular chaperons” present during the assembly of proteins and take part in the processing and presentation of antigens. In the non-obese diabetic mouse, the onset of β-cell destruction is associated with spontaneous development of T-lymphocytes reactive to members of the 60-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp60). Autoimmune non-obese diabetes may involve molecular mimicry between epitopes of Hsp60 and a β-cell-specific molecule (21Birk O.S. Elias D. Weiss A.S. Rosen A. van-der Zee R. Walker M.D. Cohen I.R. J. Autoimmun. 1996; 9: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in humans, autoantibodies are found in multiple autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, which react with Hsp60 (22Jones D.B. Coulson A.F. Duff G.W. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 115-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Type I diabetes seems to respond favorably to therapeutic vaccination with a peptide of Hsp60 (23Cohen I.R. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1468-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The SUMO-4 association with the type I diabetes may be due to altered HSF regulation of Hsp60, although the specific mechanism of susceptibility remains to be determined.

The polyunsaturated FAE anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide) increases food intake by activating G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors. On the other hand, the monounsaturated FAE oleoylethanolamide (OEA) reduces feeding and body weight gain by activating the nuclear receptor PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α). In the present report, we examined whether OEA can also influence energy utilization. OEA (1–20 μm) stimulated glycerol and fatty acid release from freshly dissociated rat adipocytes in a concentration-dependent and structurally selective manner. Under the same conditions, OEA had no effect on glucose uptake or oxidation. OEA enhanced fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle strips, dissociated hepatocytes, and primary cardiomyocyte cultures. Administration of OEA in vivo (5 mg kg–1, intraperitoneally) produced lipolysis in both rats and wild-type mice, but not in mice in which PPAR-α had been deleted by homologous recombination (PPAR-α–/–). Likewise, OEA was unable to enhance lipolysis in adipocytes or stimulate fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle strips isolated from PPAR-α mice. The synthetic PPAR-α agonist Wy-14643 produced similar effects, which also were dependent on the presence of PPAR-α. Subchronic treatment with OEA reduced body weight gain and triacylglycerol content in liver and adipose tissue of diet-induced obese rats and wild-type mice, but not in obese PPAR-α–/– mice. The results suggest that OEA stimulates fat utilization through activation of PPAR-α and that this effect may contribute to its anti-obesity actions.

Amides of long-chain fatty acids with ethanolamine (FAE) 1The abbreviations used are: FAE, fatty acid with ethanolamine; OEA, oleoylethanolamide; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; FAT/CD36, fatty acid translocase; UCP-2, uncoupling protein-2; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. are a family of lipid mediators produced through the concerted action of two enzymes present in mammalian cells: N-acyltransferase, which transfers a fatty acid from the sn-1 position of a donor phospholipid to the free amine in phosphatidylethanolamine, producing N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine; and phospholipase D, which converts N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine to FAE (1Schmid H.H.

Although the FAE were first described four decades ago (6Colodzin M. Bachur N. Weissbach H. Udenfriend S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 10: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), they did not attract much attention until the discovery that a polyunsaturated member of this family, anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide), is an endogenous ligand for cannabinoid receptors, G protein-coupled receptors targeted by the marijuana constituent Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (7Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin G. Gibson D. Mandelbaum A. Etinger A. Mechoulam R. Science. 1992; 258: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (4685) Google Scholar). Anandamide is now established as a brain endocannabinoid messenger (8Piomelli D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar) and multiple roles for other FAE have also been proposed (9Mazzari S. Canella R. Petrelli L. Marcolongo G. Leon A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 300: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 10Calignano A. La Rana G. Giuffrida A. Piomelli D.

Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D. Nature. 2001; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). One emerging function of these lipid mediators is the regulation of feeding behavior. Anandamide causes overeating in rats because of its ability to activate cannabinoid receptors (12Berry E.M. Mechoulam R. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 95: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This action is of therapeutic relevance: cannabinoid agonists such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol are currently used to alleviate anorexia and nausea in AIDS patients, whereas the CB1 antagonist rimonabant (SR141716A) was recently found to be effective in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of obesity (12Berry E.M. Mechoulam R. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 95: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast to anandamide, the monounsaturated FAE oleoylethanolamide (OEA) decreases food intake and body weight gain through a cannabinoid receptor-independent mechanism (11Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodríguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D.

Pharmacological and molecular biological experiments have demonstrated that these effects result from the high affinity binding of OEA to, and consequent activation of, the nuclear receptor PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α) (14Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Because PPAR-α serves an essential function in the regulation of lipid metabolism (15Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar, 16Bocher V. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Soc. Biol. 2002; 196: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) we investigated whether OEA may also influence nutrient utilization by altering fat storage and catabolism. Chemicals—FAE synthesis was conducted as described (17Giuffrida A. Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Piomelli D. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For in vitro experiments, drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and used at a final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration of 0.1–0.2 (v/v). For in vivo experiments, drugs were dissolved in a vehicle of 70% dimethyl sulfoxide/sterile saline (acute administrations) or 90% sterile saline, 5% polyethylene glycol, 5% Tween 80 (subchronic administrations). Cell and Tissue Preparation—Hepatocytes (18Beynen A.C. Vaartjes W.J. Geelen M.J. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and epididymal adipocytes (19Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated by collagenase digestion of freshly isolated tissue from free-feeding male Wistar rats (150–200 g, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) or PPAR-α–/– mice (C57.129S4-Ppara(tm1Gonz); Taconic M&B, Ry, Denmark) and their corresponding wild-type C57BL/6N controls. Heart myocytes were prepared by collagenase digestion of embryonic rat hearts and maintained in primary culture as described (20Flink I.L. Edwards J.G. Bahl J.J. Liew C.C. Sole M. Morkin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9917-9924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat plasma was prepared by centrifugation of EDTA-treated (0.02 m) blood obtained by cardiac puncture. Lipolysis—Glycerol was determined spectrophotometrically in cell incubation media or plasma using a commercial kit (Sigma). Fatty acid release was measured in cells labeled by incubation with [3H]oleic acid (2 μCi per well, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 37°C. After labeling, the cells were washed with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, 2 mm glucose, and 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of buffer; the incubation medium was separated by centrifugation and fatty acids were isolated by solvent extraction followed by thin-layer chromatography (21Blázquez C. Galve-Roperh I. Guzmán M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Plasma fatty acids were measured with a commercial kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Fatty Acid Oxidation—Fatty acid oxidation was measured using [1-14C]oleic acid as a substrate (0.4 mm, 0.5 μCi per sample; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). In soleus muscle strips and heart myocytes, fatty acid oxidation to CO2 was determined by trapping released [14C]CO2 as bicarbonate in wells containing filter paper soaked with benzethonium hydroxide (1 m in methanol) (22Blázquez C. Sánchez C. Velasco G. Guzmán M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1597-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, [14C]ketone bodies, which constitute about 90% of total fatty acid oxidation products, were determined as non-volatile acid-soluble products (23Guzmán M. Geelen M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Glucose Uptake and Oxidation—Glucose uptake was measured by using 2-d-[3H]deoxyglucose as a substrate (1 μCi per sample, Amersham Biosciences). Cells in suspension (adipocytes or hepatocytes) were rapidly separated from the incubation medium by centrifugation, whereas in the case of attached heart myocytes and soleus muscle strips the medium was removed by aspiration. Samples were washed with ice-cold buffer, and radioactivity was counted in perchloric acid extracts. Glucose oxidation was measured by using d-[U-14C]glucose as a substrate (1 μCi per sample; Amersham Biosciences), trapping [14C]CO2 on filter paper, as described above. Tissue Lipids and Protein—Tissue triacylglycerols were extracted with chloroform:methanol:NaCl (1 m) (1:1:0.5), suspended in a solvent of tert-butanol:methanol:Triton X-114 (3:1:1), and measured using a commercial kit (GPO-Trinder; Sigma). Tissue protein content was determined using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). Polymerase Chain Reaction—Reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA was carried out with 0.2 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 primer for 50 min at 42 °C, and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was done with an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer/probe sets were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) and gene sequences available from GenBank™ data base. Primers and fluorogenic probes were synthesized at TIB Molbiol (Adelphia, NJ). The primer/probe sequences for the rat genes were as follows. For PPAR-α: forward, 5′-TGGTGGACCTCCGGCA-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTTCTTGATGACCTGCACGA-3′; and probe, 5′-CTGGTCACGGAGCATGCGCAG-3′. For fat fatty acid-binding protein: forward, 5′-GGCTTCGCCACCAGGAA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCTTCTACGCTGATGATCAAGT-3′; and probe, 5′-TGGCCGGTATGGCCAAGCCC-3′. For fat fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36): forward, 5′-CATCGGCGATGAGAAAGCA-3′; reverse, 5′-ACCAGGCCCAGGAGCTTTA-3′; and probe, 5′-AAATGTTCAGAAACCAAGTGACCGGGAAA-3′. For uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2): forward, 5′-CCAGAGCACTGTCGAAGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCCAGAGGCCCCGGA-3′; and probe, 5′-ACAAGACCATTGCACGAGAGGAAGGG-3′. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): forward, 5′-AAGTATGATGACATCCAAGAAGGTGGT-3′; reverse, 5′-AGCCCAGGATGCCCTTTAGT-3′; and probe, 5′-AAGCAGGCGGCCGAGGGC-3′. RNA levels were normalized by GAPDH as an internal standard, and measurements were made as described (24Schmittgen T.D. Zakrajsek B.A. Mills A.G. Gorn V. Singer M.J. Reed M.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Diet-induced Obesity Model—Animals (either 6-week-old male Wistar rats (Charles River) or 7-week-old male C57Bl/6J, PPAR-α–/– (129S4/SvJae-Ppara(tm1Gonz)) and wild-type 129S1/SvImj mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were fed a high-fat diet (fat was 35% weight or 60% kcal; Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). After 8 (rats) or 7 (mice) weeks, the animals received for 2 (rats) or 4 (mice) additional weeks daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle or OEA (5 mg kg–1) 30 min before dark. The pair-fed group of rats received only vehicle injections. Food intake and body weight were measured daily. At the end of the experiments, the animals were food-deprived for 16–18 h prior to blood and tissue collection. Other Analytical Methods—Commercial kits were used to measure plasma glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate (Sigma), as well as glucagon and insulin (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Statistics—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n separate experiments. The significance of differences among groups was evaluated using Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by a Tukey's multiple comparisons test or a Dunnett's post-hoc test, as appropriate. OEA Stimulates Lipolysis in Vitro—Incubation of freshly dissociated rat adipocytes in the presence of OEA (10 μm, 30 min) significantly increased the release of non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol into the bathing medium (Fig. 1A). By contrast, OEA had no effect on adipocyte glucose uptake or oxidation, irrespective of whether the cells were isolated from free-feeding (Fig. 1A) or 18-h starved rats (data not shown). Moreover, OEA did not affect insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (insulin 100 nm, 69 ± 17% stimulation; insulin plus OEA 10 μm, 79 ± 22% stimulation; n = 3). The lipolytic effects of OEA were concentration-dependent (half-maximal effective concentration, EC50, ≈2 μm)(Fig. 1B) and structurally selective, as oleic acid and anandamide had no such effect (Fig. 1C). Because lipolysis is primarily controlled through cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation (25Stralfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11486-11489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether this second messenger pathway participates in the effects of OEA. At a concentration that produced maximal lipolysis (10 μm), OEA did not change either basal or forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels (in %: vehicle, 100 ± 11; OEA, 96 ± 8; forskolin, 0.5 μm, 127 ± 11; OEA plus forskolin, 0.5 μm, 124 ± 9; forskolin, 25 μm, 287 ± 40; OEA plus forskolin, 25 μm, 280 ± 70). Moreover, the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (5 μm) had no effect on basal, OEA-stimulated or forskolin-stimulated lipolysis (data not shown). The results suggest that OEA promotes lipolysis in isolated rat adipocytes through a mechanism that is independent of cAMP or Ca2+. OEA Stimulates Lipolysis in Vivo—Systemic administration of OEA to rats (5 mg kg–1, intraperitoneal) produced a rapid elevation in the circulating levels of non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol, which was followed by a rise in the concentration of 3-hydroxybutyrate, a marker of hepatic fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 2A). This response was dose-dependent (half-maximally effective dose, ED50, ≈2.6 mg kg–1) (Fig. 2B) and accompanied by a decrease in the triacylglycerol content of epididymal fat and liver, but not skeletal muscle (Fig. 2C). By contrast, plasma glucose levels remained unchanged after OEA injection (Fig. 2A), as did those of insulin and glucagon (insulin, in ng ml–1: vehicle, 1.7 ± 0.3; OEA, 30 min, 1.5 ± 0.1; OEA, 60 min, 1.6 ± 0.1; glucagon, in pg ml–1; vehicle, 116.5 ± 8.3; OEA, 30 min, 135.7 ± 21.1; OEA, 60 min, 95.9 ± 13.6). Oleic acid and anandamide had no significant lipolytic effect in vivo at any of the doses tested (up to 20 mg kg–1, intraperitoneal) (Fig. 2D). PPAR-α Mediates OEA-induced Lipolysis—As previously seen in rats, administration of OEA (5 mg kg–1, intraperitoneal) to C57Bl/6 mice significantly reduced liver triacylglycerol content 1 h after injection (Fig. 3A). To test the role of PPAR-α in this response we used three distinct approaches. First, we examined the effects of the synthetic PPAR-α agonist Wy-14643, which is structurally unrelated to OEA (26Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). At a dose that fully activates PPAR-α in vivo (20 mg kg–1, intraperitoneal) (14Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), Wy-14643 reduced liver triacylglycerol levels to the same extent as did 5 mg kg–1 OEA (Fig. 3A). Second, we examined whether genetic deletion of PPAR-α affects the lipolytic response to OEA and Wy-14643 in vivo. In striking contrast with their effects in wild-type mice, both drugs increased liver triacylglycerol levels in mice in which PPAR-α had been deleted by homologous recombination (PPAR-α–/–) (27Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). We did not investigate the bases for this paradoxical stimulation, although an intriguing possibility is that, in the absence of PPAR-α, OEA might activate other lipogenic nuclear receptors (28Kersten S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Third, we investigated whether genetic deletion of PPAR-α affects the lipolytic response to OEA or Wy-14643 in vitro. Incubation of adipocytes isolated from wild-type mice with either compound stimulated lipolysis (Fig. 3B), whereas no such effect was observed in adipocytes isolated from PPAR-α–/– mice (Fig. 3B). To further explore the role of PPAR-α in the response to OEA, we fed wild-type and PPAR-α–/– mice for 7 weeks with a high-fat chow and then treated them for 4 additional weeks with OEA (5 mg kg–1, once daily, intraperitoneal), a drug regimen that was previously shown to reduce body weight gain (14Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). In wild-type mice, this treatment caused a significant decrease in liver and fat triacylglycerol content (Fig. 3, C and D), but had no such effect in PPAR-α–/– mice (Fig. 3, C and D). To investigate the mechanism by which these changes might occur, we assessed the effects of OEA on the expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism. In rats, 6 h following a single injection of OEA (10 mg kg–1 intraperitoneally), we found increased levels of PPAR-α mRNA in adipose tissue (Fig. 4A) and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4F). Concordantly, two downstream genes under the regulation of PPAR-α, fatty acid-binding protein, and fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), which encode for proteins that participate in the cellular transport of fatty acids (29Stremmel W. Pohl L. Ring A. Herrmann T. Lipids. 2001; 36: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), were elevated by OEA treatment in fadipose (Fig. 4, B and C) and muscle tissue (Fig. 4, G and H). These changes were paralleled by an increase in the expression of UCP-2 (Fig. 4, D and I), which is thought to play a key role in mitochondrial energy utilization (30Nakatani T. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Takahashi M. Miura S. Ezaki O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9562-9569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Samec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). OEA Stimulates Fatty Acid Oxidation in Vitro—PPAR-α plays a pivotal role in the control of fatty acid oxidation, suggesting that OEA may also affect this process. In support of this possibility, we found that stimulation of rat soleus muscle strips with OEA enhanced fatty acid oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 ≈ 2 μm) (Fig. 5, A and B), whereas having no effect on glucose uptake or oxidation (Fig. 5A). To test the role of PPAR-α in this response, we examined the effect of OEA on soleus muscle strips isolated from PPAR-α–/– mice and wild-type controls. OEA stimulated fatty acid oxidation in tissue excised from wild-type (Fig. 5C), but not PPAR-α–/– mice (Fig. 5C). As is the case with lipolysis, oleic acid and anandamide had no effect on fatty acid oxidation (Fig. 5D). The ability of OEA to enhance fatty acid oxidation was not limited to skeletal muscle, as similar results were obtained in primary cultures of rat heart myocytes and in dissociated rat hepatocytes (Fig. 5E). Although modest (21 ± 4% stimulation after a 30-min incubation), 10 μm OEA-induced ketogenesis in hepatocytes was comparable with that produced by 20 nm glucagon, a potent ketogenic stimulus (33 ± 5% stimulation; n = 4). Role of Energy Utilization in the Anti-obesity Effects of OEA—Subchronic administration of OEA to obese rats or mice inhibits food intake and body weight gain (11Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodríguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D. Nature. 2001; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 14Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), however, it remains unclear whether the weight-suppressing effects of this compound may be entirely attributed to its anorexiant properties. To address this problem we first induced obesity in rats by feeding them with a high-fat diet for 8 weeks and then treating them once daily with OEA (5 mg kg–1, intraperitoneal) or vehicle for 2 additional weeks. In keeping with previous results (11Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodríguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D.

Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), we found that OEA produced a substantial attenuation of body weight gain (Fig. 6A), which was accompanied by a small, but significant reduction in the amount of food consumed throughout the treatment period (Fig. 6B). The compound also reduced visceral fat mass (Fig. 6C) and triacylglycerol content in both white fat (Fig. 6D) and liver (Fig. 6E). It seemed unlikely that the modest reduction in food intake caused by prolonged OEA treatment could account for the observed changes in body weight gain and visceral fat mass. To clarify this point, we incorporated in the experiment a third group of rats, which received the same amount of food consumed by OEA-treated animals along with vehicle injections. These pair-fed rats gained as much weight as did control, free-feeding animals (Fig. 6A). Moreover, in these animals visceral fat mass (Fig. 6C) and triacylglycerol content in adipose tissue (Fig. 6D) and liver (Fig. 6E) were identical to those of free-feeding controls. Thus, whereas OEA reduces body weight gain in lean rats primarily by inhibiting food intake (11Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodríguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D. Nature. 2001; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), the actions of this compound in obese animals might involve a distinct mechanism, possibly linked to its ability to stimulate fatty acid utilization. The main finding of this study is that OEA stimulates lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation through activation of the nuclear receptor PPAR-α. The effects of OEA were observed both in vitro and in vivo, and the role of PPAR-α in such effects was supported by two complementary observations. First, OEA was potent at stimulating lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in wild-type mice, but not in mutant mice deficient in PPAR-α; second, the synthetic PPAR-α agonist Wy-14643 exerted similar effects, which were also contingent on PPAR-α expression. These results are consistent with the proposed role of OEA as a high affinity agonist for PPAR-α (14Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) and reveal a regulatory role of this lipid mediator in two distinct aspects of energy balance, namely feeding (11Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodríguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D.

Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) and fat utilization (present study). We have previously (11Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodríguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D. Nature. 2001; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 14Fu J. Gaetani S.

Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) reported that OEA, by activating PPAR-α, reduces body weight gain in various rodent models. The present findings raise the question of whether PPAR-α-mediated fat utilization contributes to these effects (14Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The answer to this question appears to depend on the particular model under consideration. Pair-feeding experiments indicate that induction of satiety may account for the weight-reducing actions of OEA in lean rats (11Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodríguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D. Nature. 2001; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), but not in rats made obese by a high-fat diet (present study). Thus, in the latter model OEA-mediated changes in lipid metabolism might play a role. This hypothesis is confirmed by the marked ability demonstrated by OEA to lower tissue triacylglycerol levels. The stimulatory effects of this lipid mediator on fatty acid oxidation may also be significant in this regard, as OEA is able to induce the expression of PPAR-α-regulated genes that participate in fatty acid utilization (FAT/CD36, FABP) and energy balance (UCP-2). Another pressing question raised by our results relates to the molecular mechanism underlying the rapid onset lipolytic actions of OEA. Although PPAR-α activation regulates expression of lipid transporters and lipid-metabolizing enzymes (15Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar, 16Bocher V. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Soc. Biol. 2002; 196: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the time course of OEA-induced lipolysis suggests that it may be initiated by non-genomic signaling events. Such events, and particularly the activation of membrane phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, have been shown to contribute in important ways to the action of estrogen receptors (32Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar), but they have not yet been documented for PPAR-α or other members of the PPAR family. Elucidating these events may not only help to understand the mechanism by which OEA induces lipolysis, but also provide important clues on the ability of the compound to induce satiety (11Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodríguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D.

The physiological significance of the metabolic actions of OEA is still undefined, although the relatively high levels of OEA found in white fat (rats, 106 ± 9 pmol/g; mice, 316 ± 46 pmol/g; n = 5–6) suggest that this compound may play a local modulatory role in this tissue, possibly complementary to those of adipocyte-derived signaling proteins such as leptin (33Unger R.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and adiponectin (34Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Scherer P.E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 84-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, the magnitude of OEA-induced stimulation of fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle, the tissue responsible for the bulk of whole body fatty acid oxidation, is comparable with that exerted by leptin (35Muoio D.M. Dohm G.L. Fiedorek Jr., F.T. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Dohn G.L. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and adiponectin (36Fruebis J. Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D.

However, unlike the latter, our findings suggest that OEA may not have a significant impact on glucose metabolism. Synthetic PPAR-α agonists such as the fibrates (e.g. fenfibrate) are currently used in the clinic as lipid-lowering and anti-atherogenic drugs. However, the potencies of these compounds at PPAR-α are 500–900 times lower than that of OEA (14Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) and, consequently, they do not significantly affect food intake (14Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F.

Alterations in the expression and function of voltage-gated tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) sodium channels have been implicated in animal models of neuropathic pain, including models of diabetic neuropathy. We investigated the expression and function of TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) and TTX-R sodium channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and the responses to thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in streptozotocin-treated rats between 4–8 weeks after onset of diabetes. Diabetic rats demonstrated a significant reduction in the threshold for escape from innocuous mechanical pressure (allodynia) and a reduction in the latency to withdrawal from a noxious thermal stimulus (hyperalgesia). Both TTX-S and TTX-R sodium currents increased significantly in small DRG neurons isolated from diabetic rats. The voltage-dependent activation and steady-state inactivation curves for these currents were shifted negatively. TTX-S currents induced by fast or slow voltage ramps increased markedly in neurons from diabetic rats. Immunoblots and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated significant increases in the expression of Nav1.3 (TTX-S) and Nav 1.7 (TTX-S) and decreases in the expression of Nav 1.6 (TTX-S) and Nav1.8 (TTX-R) in diabetic rats. The level of serine/threonine phosphorylation of Nav 1.6 and In Nav1.8 increased in response to diabetes. addition, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 was observed in DRGs from diabetic rats. These results suggest that both TTX-S and TTX-R sodium channels play important roles and that differential phosphorylation of sodium channels involving both serine/threonine and tyrosine sites contributes to painful diabetic neuropathy.

Med. 2003; 20: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Diabetic patients frequently exhibit one or more types of stimulus-evoked pain, including increased responsiveness to noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia) as well as hyper-responsiveness to normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia). The underlying mechanisms of persistent pain in diabetic patients remain poorly understood. In animal models of diabetes, hyperalgesia to nonnoxious thermal stimulation as well as tactile allodynia have been observed (2Calcutt N.A. Jorge M.C. Yaksh T.L. Chaplan S.R.

Voltage-gated sodium channels generate and propagate action potentials in excitable cells. Based on differential sensitivity to tetrodotoxin (TTX), sodium currents in DRG neurons are classified into TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) and TTX-resistant (TTX-R) components (12Caffrey J.M. Eng D.L.

In addition, Nav1.3, a TTX-S sodium channel that is normally expressed during embryonic development, is up-regulated in the peripheral nervous system following nerve injury (16Black J.A. Cummins T.R.

TTX-S sodium channels in brain are composed of a pore-forming α-subunit and one or two auxiliary β-subunits (24Yu F.H. Catterall W.A.

Yasuda H. Omatsu-Kanbe M. Kikkawa R. Kitasato H. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but decreased expression levels of Nav1.8 mRNA and protein have been reported in models of diabetic neuropathy (28Craner M.J. Klein J.P. Renganathan M. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, a systematic analysis of the relative contributions of TTX-S and TTX-R sodium channels, including their phosphorylation status, has not been performed in animal models with documented painful diabetic neuropathy. In the present study, we investigated the expression and functional properties of TTX-S and TTX-R sodium channels in acutely dissociated small to medium sized (nociceptive) DRG neurons isolated from diabetic rats with documented painful neuropathy. We demonstrate that TTX-S and TTX-R sodium currents increased significantly and the voltage-dependent activation and steady-state inactivation curves were negatively shifted in these DRG somas. TTX-S currents induced by both fast and slow voltage ramps increased significantly in diabetic neurons. The protein expression levels of Nav1.3 and Nav1.7 increased in DRG homogenates from diabetic animals. In contrast, the protein expression levels of Nav1.6 and Nav1.8 decreased in DRG homogenates. Interestingly, serine/threonine phosphorylation of Nav1.6 and Nav1.8 and tyrosine phosphorylation of Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 increased in neurons from diabetic rats. We propose that Nav1.8 phosphorylation may, in part, be responsible for the increased TTX-R current observed in diabetic neurons. Using immunofluorescence staining, we observed that the expression of Nav1.7 increased while the expression of Nav1.8 decreased in small C-fiber neurons of diabetic rats compared with controls, in agreement with our Western blot results. These data support that the abnormal function of nociceptive fibers observed in early painful diabetic neuropathy involves both TTX-S and TTX-R sodium channels. All experiments were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Animal Model—Male Sprague-Dawley (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) rats weighing 180–200 g were fasted overnight to maximize the effectiveness of STZ treatment. Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single injection of STZ (Sigma) at a dose of 45 mg/kg body weight in a citrate buffer (pH 4.5). Age-matched rats in the control group received injections of saline vehicle. STZ-injected animals were given 10% sucrose water for 48 h after injection to prevent hypoglycemia. Tail vein blood glucose levels were measured 48 h after injection and the onset of the diabetic condition was defined as glucose levels greater than 300 mg/dl. Animals were euthanized for study 4 to 8 weeks after induction of diabetes. Our previous studies with this model indicated that rats with diabetes for 4–8 weeks demonstrate a variety of functional abnormalities including delayed nerve conduction velocity, increased calcium influx, impaired inhibitory G protein function, impaired mitochondrial function, and activation of the apoptosis cascade in acutely dissociated DRG neurons that were reversible after 2 weeks of insulin-mediated euglycemia (6Srinivasan S. Stevens M. Wiley J.W. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 7Barber A.J. Lieth E. Khin S.A. Antonetti D.A. Buchanan A.G. Gardner T.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Behavioral Tests—Prior to electrophysiological studies, a subset of STZ-treated diabetic rats and age-matched healthy controls were evaluated for changes in sensory perception as described below. All animals were acclimated for 1 week prior to testing. During this period the animals were handled extensively and habituated to the behavioral testing procedures. Mechanical Allodynia—To quantify mechanical sensitivity of the foot, brisk foot withdrawal in response to a normally innocuous mechanical stimulus was measured as described previously (30Moller K.A. Johansson B. Berge O.G. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 84: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Response to the mechanical stimulus was measured with a calibrated electronic von Frey pressure algometer (Somedic Sales AB). This system consists of a hand-held electronic von Frey probe with a circular probe tip of 0.5 mm in diameter. The algometer is connected to a computerized data collection system, allowing on-line display of the applied force as well as rate of stimulus application. The rat was placed in a hanging cage with a metal mesh floor and acclimated for 10 min. A 0.5-mm diameter von Frey probe was manually applied to the plantar surface of the hind foot with a pressure increasing by ∼0.05 Newtons/s and the pressure at which a paw withdrawal occurred was recorded. For each hind paw, the procedure was repeated 5 times and the average pressure to produce a withdrawal computed. Successive stimuli were applied to alternating feet at ∼30-s intervals. A significant decrease in the pressure necessary to elicit a brisk foot withdrawal in response to this mechanical stimulus was interpreted as mechanical allodynia. Thermal Hyperalgesia (Hargreaves Test)—To quantify thermal sensitivity, rats were placed in a clear a Plexiglas chamber (10 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm) located on an elevated floor of clear glass (2-mm thick) and given 5–10 min to habituate. The glass floor was maintained at 30 ± 1 °C. A radiant heat source delivered a thermal stimulus to the plantar surface of each hind foot. The latency to foot withdrawal (escape) served as the behavioral measure of thermal nociception. If the foot was not withdrawn within 20 s, the stimulus was automatically terminated to avoid tissue damage. Each foot was tested 5 times with 3 min between stimulations of either foot to avoid peripheral sensitization effects. The mean withdrawal latency for each foot was computed by averaging the 5 measurements. As compared with the baseline (control) latency, a significant decrease in the latency of foot withdrawal in response to the thermal stimulus was interpreted as indicating the presence of thermal hyperalgesia (31Hargreaves K. Dubner R. Brown F. Flores C. Joris J. Pain. 1988; 32: 77-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4215) Google Scholar). Cell Preparation—DRGs were isolated from acutely dissociated thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal column, and neurons were prepared according to the methods described previously (32Hall K.E. Liu J. Sima A.A. Wiley J.W. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 760-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, ganglia were digested with 0.3% collagenase (Worthington Type 2) in a minimal essential medium (MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 16.5 mm NaHCO3 and 28.2 mm glucose (M-MEM) for 50 min and then 0.1% trypsin (type 1, Sigma) for 10 min. The digested DRGs were centrifuged in 2% bovine serum albumin in M-MEM at 4 °C for 5 min and washed twice with M-MEM solution. After titration in M-MEM with additional 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), DRG neurons were plated on 35-mm sterile culture dishes coated with calf collagen. Isolated neurons were incubated in 95% air + 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 2–7 h prior to the recording. Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recording—Sodium currents were recorded in the whole cell patch clamp configuration using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) at room temperature (20–23 °C). Electrodes (1–2 MΩ) were pulled from standard wall glass pipettes (G150F-4, Warner Instrument) using a horizontal puller P-87 (Sutter Instrument) and filled with (in mm): 100 CsCl, 30 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 3 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 1 Li-GTP; pH was adjusted to 7.2 by Tris base and osmolarity was adjusted to 285 mOsm. Pipette solutions were filtered at 0.2 μm immediately before use. The bath solution used to record currents contained (in mm): 35 NaCl, 30 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 65 choline-Cl, 0.1 CaCl2, 5 MgCl2, 0.05 CdCl2, 10 HEPES, and 11 glucose. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 and osmolarity was 325 mOsm. Reduced extracellular Na+ was required to reduce the magnitude of sodium currents to improve the fidelity of the voltage clamp (33Kral M.G. Xiong Z. Study R.E. Pain. 1999; 81: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Under these recording conditions, the estimated Nernst reversal potential for Na+ was +33 mV. In some experiments, action potentials were recorded in the current clamp mode using methods described previously (34Renganathan M. Cummins T.R. Waxman S.G. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). TTX-R sodium currents were isolated from TTX-S currents by adding TTX (200 nm, Sigma) to the bath solution. The TTX stock solution (20 mm) was prepared with distilled water and stored at –20 °C. Working TTX solutions were made with extracellular solution on the day of experiments. After formation of a gigaohm seal (1–5 GΩ) and compensation of pipette capacitance with amplifier circuitry, whole cell access was established. The pipette potential was zeroed before seal formation. Membrane resistance, series resistance, and capacitance were determined from current transients elicited by 5-mV depolarizing steps from a holding potential of –60 mV, via the membrane test application of pClamp 8.2. Series resistance was compensated 75–85% as necessary, and recordings were conducted only when access resistance was lower than 10 mΩ. During recordings, the cells were held at –80 mV, and the junction potentials (about 4–5 mV) were not corrected. To access the changes in the current-voltage (I-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) relationships, data were collected for an I-V curve 5 min after cell rupture. To assess changes in the steady-state inactivation of TTX-R sodium currents, H-infinity curves were collected after obtaining the I-V curve as described previously (21Hirade M. Yasuda H. Omatsu-Kanbe M. Kikkawa R. Kitasato H. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TTX-R sodium currents were evoked from a holding potential of –80 mV to 0 mV every 30 s. Recording data were acquired using a Digidata 1322A 16-bit data acquisition system (Axon Instruments), digitized at 10 kHz, low-pass filtered at 5 kHz, and stored on a computer that was controlled by pClamp software (v8.2, Axon Instruments). Data Analysis—Activation and steady-state inactivation data were fitted with a Boltzmann equation of the form: G = Gmax/(1 + exp(V50–Vm)/k). Here G equals to I/(Vm-Vres), where Vm is the potential at which current is evoked, and Vres is the reversal potential for the current determined by extrapolating the linear portion of the I-V curve through 0 current, Gmax = the calculated maximal conductance, V50 = the potential of half activation or inactivation, and k = the slope factor. All data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. Immunofluorescence Labeling of Peripherin and Sodium Channels—DRG sections were prepared and stained according to the method described (35Amaya F. Decosterd I. Samad T.A. Plumpton C. Tate S. Mannion R.J. Costigan M. Woolf C.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2000; 15: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, the animals were anesthetized with halothane and transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline solution. DRGs from thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal column were quickly removed, postfixed for 2–3 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB), and cryoprotected in 10% sucrose in 0.1 m PB for 24 h at 4 °C. Transverse sections through the DRG (10 μm) were cut on a cryostat and mounted serially onto Superfrost/plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific). For immunofluorescence labeling of sodium channels, the sections were first washed with 0.1 m PB, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m PB (PBST) for 2 h at room temperature, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBST (PBSTG) for at least 4 h. The sections then were incubated with anti-sodium channel antibodies and monoclonal anti-peripherin (1:150, Chemicon) antibody in PBSTG for 24 h at 4 °C. Antibodies for sodium channels used were anti-rabbit Nav1.6 (1:200, Sigma), anti-rabbit Nav1.7 (1:100, Sigma), or anti-rabbit Nav1.8 (1:100) from Dr. S. R. Levinson. After three washes with PBST, the sections were incubated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-mouse IgG) and Alexa Fluor 594 (goat anti-rabbit IgG) from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were then washed, mounted with anti-fade fluorescence mounting medium and stored at 4 °C. All images were captured with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with a CCD digital camera and processed with Adobe Photoshop 7. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—DRGs in the lumbar and thoracic regions of the spinal column from diabetic and control rats were removed and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, and “Complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Aliquots of DRG homogenates containing equal amounts of total protein were mixed with the anti-phosphoserine (Chemicon), anti-phosphothreonine (Chemicon), or anti-phosphotyrosine (Sigma) specific antibodies at a 1:40 dilution. The mixtures were incubated and rotated in Eppendorf tubes in the presence of 50 mm NaF and protease inhibitors for 4–14 h at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose beads (Roche Diagnostics) were then added to the samples and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, the protein G beads were pelleted and mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 4–15% gradient Tris-HCl gels and transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). In some experiments, crude DRG homogenates were loaded on gels for Western blot analysis. The membrane blots were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk for 12 h and incubated with primary antibodies: anti-Nav1.3 (1:200, Sigma), anti-Nav1.6 (1: 200), anti-Nav1.7 (1:100), or anti-Nav1.8 (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at room temperature and developed using the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). The corresponding bands were scanned at 1200 dpi and semiquantified with Image Quanti-Scan software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Short Term Diabetic Rats Develop Mechanical Allodynia and Thermal Hyperalgesia—Two days after injection of STZ, 70% of the rats developed high levels of blood glucose (mean level = 460 ± 22 mg/dl), whereas untreated rats had normal levels (mean level = 85 ± 6 mg/dl). The elevated level of blood glucose in STZ-injected rats was maintained during the entire experimental period. These results are very similar to our previous studies (32Hall K.E. Liu J. Sima A.A. Wiley J.W. J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 86: 760-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the present study, mechanical allodynia was determined by measuring the paw withdrawal threshold in response to application of a von Frey probe (Fig. 1A). Diabetic rats showed a significant decrease in the pressure required to elicit paw withdrawal as compared with their pre-diabetic baseline responses (p < 0.05, n = 6). The paw pressure withdrawal threshold for diabetic rats began to decrease 1 week following STZ-injection, but this change in responsiveness to mechanical stimuli did not reach significance until 4 weeks after the induction of diabetes. Thermal hyperalgesia was determined by measuring the withdrawal latency to a radiant heat stimulus applied to the hind foot. Fig. 1B illustrates the decrease in the withdrawal latency to thermal stimulation in hind paws of diabetic rats. As compared with pre-diabetic baseline responses, diabetic rats began to exhibit a significant reduction in the temperature required to elicit a hind paw withdrawal 4 weeks after STZ injection (p < 0.01, n = 6). Behavioral signs of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia persisted for up to 8 weeks after the onset of diabetes, the maximum duration of our observations. We found no significant differences between baseline and post-injection responses to either mechanical or thermal stimuli of similarly tested, age matched, non-diabetic controls injected with saline instead of STZ. Diabetic Neuropathy Is Associated with Increased Amplitude and Altered Properties of TTX-R Sodium Current—To record TTX-R sodium currents (INa), small-sized DRG neurons (soma diameter < 25 μm, cell capacitance < 35 pF) were isolated and voltage-clamped at –80 mV in the presence of 200 nm TTX in the bath solution. The average resting membrane potential was –60.3 ± 0.3 mV in DRG neurons from control rats and –52.7 ± 0.7 mV in diabetic rats (n = 110 for each group). The difference between these two groups was highly significant (p < 0.0001). The average whole cell capacitance was 22.3 ± 1.2 pF in the control group and 23.8 ± 2.1 pF in the diabetic group. Fig. 2A shows original current traces of TTX-R INa in DRG neurons prepared from a diabetic rat 6 weeks after the onset of diabetes compared with an age-matched control. The amplitude of outward INa was significantly larger in neurons from diabetic rats compared with controls (Fig. 2B). The mean peak current density in diabetic neurons was 39.2 ± 1.5 pA/pF (n = 12) compared with 27.8 ± 2.3 pA/pF in control neurons (n = 15) and the difference between these two values was significant (p < 0.01). As shown in Fig. 2C, the current-voltage relationship calculated for DRG neurons isolated from diabetic rats was shifted ∼8 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction compared with that calculated for controls. Peak current density was elicited by depolarizing control neurons to +0 mV or by depolarizing diabetic neurons to –10 mV. The kinetics of activation was determined by curve fitting the rising phase of the conductance using a single exponential function Boltzmann equation (Fig. 2D). The midpoint of the voltage-dependence of activation was –14.8 ± 0.4 mV in cells from diabetic rats. This value was significantly more negative than the value obtained for control neurons (–8.5 ± 0.3 mV, p < 0.001). The voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation was best fit to a modified Boltzmann function: (INa)/(INa)max = [1 + exp(V–Vh)/k]–1, where Vh is the midpoint of steady-state inactivation and k is the slope factor. The midpoints of steady-state inactivation were –29.1 ± 0.3 mV in neurons from diabetic rats and –23.8 ± 0.3 mV in control neurons. The difference between these values was significant (p < 0.05). Thus, the steady-state inactivation of TTX-R currents was also negatively shifted in small-sized DRG neurons from diabetic rats compared with controls. DRG Neurons from Diabetic Rats Demonstrate Increases in TTX-S and Total Sodium Currents—To elicit total INa, small-sized DRG neurons were depolarized by a pre-pulse to –120 mV for 50 ms and then stepped to potentials ranging from –50 mV to +50 mV in 5-mV increments every 10 s. Fig. 3A demonstrates the current-voltage relationships for the total INa of DRG neurons isolated from control and diabetic rats. The peak current density of total INa was –59.7 ± 8.0 mV in cells from control rats and –73.4 ± 5.0 mV in diabetic rats (p < 0.05, n = 11 for each cell type). Maximal currents for diabetic neurons were measured at –10 mV compared with –5 mV for control neurons. We also observed increased action potential amplitudes in DRG neurons isolated from diabetic rats compared with controls. In current clamp whole cell configuration, the membrane potential was not adjusted, and the action potential was elicited by delivery of 1.5 nA current for 0.5 ms to the patched cell through the amplifier, leaving"
https://openalex.org/W2120400290,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4 gene HCN4 is a pacemaker channel that plays a key role in automaticity of sinus node in the heart, and an HCN4 mutation was reported in a patient with sinus node dysfunction. Expression of HCN4 in the heart is, however, not confined to the sinus node cells but is found in other tissues, including cells of the conduction system. On the other hand, mutations in another cardiac ion channel gene, SCN5A, also cause sinus node dysfunction as well as other cardiac arrhythmias, including long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and progressive cardiac conduction disturbance. These observations imply that HCN4 abnormalities may be involved in the pathogenesis of various arrhythmias, similar to the SCN5A mutations. In this study, we analyzed patients suffering from sinus node dysfunction, progressive cardiac conduction disease, and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation for mutations in HCN4. A missense mutation, D553N, was found in a patient with sinus node dysfunction who showed recurrent syncope, QT prolongation in electrocardiogram, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointes. In vitro functional study of the D553N mutation showed a reduced membranous expression associated with decreased If currents because of a trafficking defect of the HCN4 channel in a dominant-negative manner. These data suggest that the loss of function of HCN4 is associated with sinus nodal dysfunction and that a consequence of pacemaker channel abnormality might underlie clinical features of QT prolongation and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia developed under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2143070830,"We recently identified mutations in the lipin gene, Lpin1, as the cause of lipodystrophy in the fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mouse. Here we identify impaired adipocyte differentiation as the basis for lipodystrophy in lipin-deficient mice and demonstrate that lipin is required for normal induction of the adipogenic gene transcription program. We found that the reduced adiposity in chow fed fld mice and resistance to obesity in fld mice fed a high-fat diet is associated with reduced adipogenic gene expression. Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from fld mice, we confirmed that lipin deficiency prevents normal lipid accumulation and induction of key adipogenic genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)α. However, our previous studies of daily gene expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes indicated that lipin expression is undetectable until about day 3 of differentiation, at a point after PPARγ and C/EBPα gene expression is established. This paradox was resolved by examining gene expression at 10-h intervals during 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, leading to detection of transient lipin expression at 10 h into the differentiation program, prior to the induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα. Consistent with a requirement for lipin expression upstream of PPARγ, differentiation of lipin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts could be rescued by ectopic expression of PPARγ. Thus, we conclude that lipin expression is required prior to PPARγ during adipocyte differentiation.

The increasing prevalence of obesity and type II diabetes in our society has focused attention on the development and function of adipose tissue. It is well established that adipose tissue performs a variety of metabolic functions, including energy partitioning and production of endocrine hormones. Studies in human and mouse models of obesity have revealed that excess adipose tissue confers increased risk for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease (1Must A. Spadano J. Coakley E.H.

Heterogeneity exists in both the genetic basis and in the potential cellular mechanisms for different forms of lipodystrophy in humans. Thus far, mutations in four genes have been identified in human congenital lipodystrophies.

Mutations in AGPAT2 (acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase), encoding an enzyme required for triglyceride synthesis, also cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy (17Agarwal A.K. Arioglu E.

Although defined mechanisms exist by which PPARG and AGPAT2 mutations might confer adipose tissue deficiency, the role of LMNA and BSCL2 mutations are not well established. It has been proposed that LMNA mutations impair adipocyte differentiation by affecting the activity of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, a transcription factor for lipogenic gene expression during adipocyte differentiation (18Lloyd D.J.

The fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mouse is unique among the lipodystrophic mouse models mentioned above in that it is the result of a spontaneous mutation in an endogenous gene. The fld mouse resembles human patients with generalized lipodystrophy, having dramatically reduced adipose tissue mass throughout the body and acquired insulin resistance and increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis (32Reue K.

Consistent with the lipodystrophic phenotype of fld mice, lipin is prominently expressed in white and brown adipose tissue and is induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Although the molecular function of lipin remains unknown, recent studies of the lipin homolog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that yeast lipin interacts with three proteins having roles in nuclear envelope structure and nucleocytoplasmic transport (34Tange Y.

This finding is consistent with our previous demonstration that lipin localizes to the nucleus (33Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, lipin has also been shown to be phosphorylated in response to insulin, an event that is dependent upon the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway (35Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying lipodystrophy in lipin-deficient fld mice. We found that the lack of adipose tissue in these animals is a direct consequence of impaired adipocyte differentiation due to a critical role for lipin in this process. Specifically, we establish that lipin is required during the initial stages of adipogenesis for the induction of key adipogenic factors, including PPARγ and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)α, such that lipin deficiency prevents maturation of adipocytes in vitro and causes lipodystrophy in vivo. Mice and Diets—BALB/cByJ+/fld mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred to produce lipin-deficient (fld/fld) and wild-type (+/+ and +/fld) mice for studies. Mice were fed a standard laboratory chow diet (Purina 5001) or high-fat diet containing 35% fat and 33% carbohydrate (Diet F3282, Bio-Serve, Frenchtown, NJ). All animal studies were performed under approved institutional protocols and according to guidelines established in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.” Adipose Tissue Measurements and Feed Conversion Efficiency—Fat pads (inguinal subcutaneous, gonadal, and retroperitoneal) were dissected and weighed after conclusion of the high-fat diet, or at 5 months of age in chow fed mice. Cell numbers in adipose tissue depots were determined by fluorometric DNA quantitation using Hoechst dye 33258 from pre-weighed inguinal adipose tissue depots (36Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). Food intake was determined over 10 days of ad libitum feeding. Feed conversion efficiency was calculated as the weight gain per effective food intake (food consumption normalized for fecal lipid output). Fecal lipid content was determined by quantitation of triglycerides and fatty acids in lipid extracts prepared from dried feces (37Carr T.P. Andresen C.J. Rudel L.L. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). RNA Quantitation—Total RNA was isolated from adipose tissue or cultured cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and treated with RNase-free DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo dT primers (Invitrogen). Real-time PCRs were performed on the iCycler iQ real-time detection system (Bio-Rad) using SYBR Green PCR Quanti-Tect reagent kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Each assay included (in triplicate): a standard curve of four serial dilution points of control cDNA (ranging from 100 ng to 100 pg), a no-template control, and 25-50 ng of each sample cDNA. The relative concentrations of the endogenous controls, TATA box binding protein (TBP) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, and genes of interest were determined by plotting the threshold cycle (Ct) versus the log of the serial dilution points, and the relative expression of the gene of interest was determined after normalizing to endogenous controls. Primers used for real-time PCR are as follows: PPARγ (ccagagcatggtgccttcgct; cagcaaccattgggtcagctc); CEBP/α (gaacagcaacgagtaccgggta; gccatggccttgaccaaggag); C/EBPβ (caagctgagcgacgagtaca; cagctgctccaccttcttct); C/EBPδ (cgcagacagtggtgagcttg; cttgcgcacagcgatgttgtt); aP2 (gaacctggaagcttgtcttcg; accagcttgtcaccatctcg); DGAT (tgctacgacgagttcttgag; ctctgccacagcattgagac); Pref-1 (ctgtgtcaatggagtctgcaag; ctacgatctcacagaagttgc); TBP (acccttcaccaatgactcctatg; atgatgactgcagcaaatcgc); and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (cacaggactagaacacctgc; gctggtgaaaaggacctct). Cell Culture—The 3T3-L1 cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine serum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from 18 day wild-type (WT) and fld embryos. Early passage cells (passage 3 or earlier) were used for differentiation and retroviral infection of primary cells. Spontaneously immortalized cell lines were developed as described (38Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar) and used after passage 15. Adipocyte differentiation was initiated after 2 days at confluence with the addition of differentiation medium as described (39Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For differentiation of MEFs and retrovirus-infected cells, adipocyte differentiation medium was supplemented with the PPARγ ligand, rosiglitazone (BRL 49653, a generous gift from Dr. Todd Leff) as described (40Alexander D.L. Ganem L.G. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F. Jefcoate C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3311-3322PubMed Google Scholar). After 2 days, differentiation mixture was removed and culture was continued in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with insulin and rosiglitazone. At day 6, cells were lysed and homogenized for RNA isolation and triglyceride determinations, or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Oil Red O (41Miki H. Yamauchi T. Suzuki R. Komeda K. Tsuchida A. Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Kamon J. Kaburagi Y. Matsui J. Akanuma Y. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2521-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate. The pBabe-PPARγ2 retroviral expression vector was obtained from Dr. Bruce Spiegelman. To produce the lipin viral vector, lipin cDNA (GenBank accession no. AF180471) was subcloned into pBabe. Retroviral infection of cells was performed essentially as described (42Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The number of mice or cell culture replicates for each study is indicated in the figure legends. Values are presented as means ± S.E. A two-tailed Student's t test was used to calculate p values. Lipin Deficiency Prevents Diet-induced Obesity and Impairs Adipose Tissue Gene Expression—The phenotype of the fld mouse revealed that lipin deficiency prevents adipose tissue accumulation under normal dietary conditions. However, it was unclear whether the effect of lipin deficiency on adipose tissue could be overcome by dietary manipulation to enhance fat accumulation. Therefore, we investigated whether fld mice could be made to gain fat by feeding a high-fat diet. After 15 weeks on the high-fat diet, WT mice increased their body weight by 27% (8.3 ± 1.8 g), whereas fld mice gained virtually no weight (0.4 ± 1.1 g) (Fig. 1a). The fld mice maintained 15-fold lower subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat pad mass compared with WT animals (Fig. 1, b and c), with no increase over the fat mass of these mice on a chow diet (32Reue K. Xu P. Wang X.P. Slavin B.G. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether reduced adipose tissue mass could result from impaired preadipocyte proliferation, we determined fat pad cellularity in mice fed chow and high-fat diets. Wild-type and fld mice had comparable cellularity on the chow diet, and both exhibited a trend toward slightly increased cellularity on the high-fat diet, indicating that lipin deficiency does not result in reduced fat pad cellularity (Fig. 1d). Nor could reduced fat in fld mice be attributed to reduced food intake or absorption. Wild-type and fld mice had identical food intake (Fig. 1e), but fld mice exhibited a 6-fold reduction in feed conversion efficiency (weight gain per food intake, normalized to food absorption; Fig. 1f). We investigated whether lipin deficiency impairs adipose tissue accumulation through altered expression of adipogenic genes. On the chow diet, fld mice exhibited ∼2-fold reductions in expression of the adipogenic transcriptional regulators, PPARγ and C/EBPα, and in the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2), a marker of adipocyte maturation and PPARγ target gene (Fig. 2). The expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), a rate-limiting enzyme of triglyceride synthesis, was reduced 3-fold in fld tissue, thus likely contributing to reduced triglyceride accumulation. Wild-type mice exhibited modest (PPARγ, C/EBPα) to substantial increases (aP2, DGAT) in gene expression levels in response to the high-fat diet. In contrast, fld expression levels were not increased by the high-fat diet. These data indicate that lipin deficiency alters basal expression of adipogenic genes in adipose tissue and impairs the response of these genes to changes typically observed with dietary manipulation, reflecting the failure of fld mice to develop increased adipose tissue mass on the high-fat diet. Lipin Is Required for Adipocyte Differentiation in Vitro—The results described above implicate impaired adipocyte differentiation as the mechanism for diminished adiposity in lipin-deficient mice. To verify that this depends upon the expression of lipin within the adipocyte, we examined the adipocyte differentiation capacity of fld MEFs. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were induced to differentiate into adipocytes by incubation in adipocyte differentiation mixture supplemented with the PPARγ ligand, rosiglitazone (40Alexander D.L. Ganem L.G. Fernandez-Salguero P. Gonzalez F. Jefcoate C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3311-3322PubMed Google Scholar). After 6 days of treatment, ∼20% of WT MEFs assumed a mature adipocyte morphology and accumulated large lipid droplets, as detected by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 3a). In contrast, less than 1% of the fld cells accumulated lipid droplets, which were sparse and small in size. Concordant with the reduced lipid staining, intracellular triglyceride content in fld MEFs was only 3.5% of WT levels (Fig. 3b). Real-time RT-PCR quantitation of mRNA for PPARγ, C/EBPα, and aP2 showed the expected induction by day 3 of differentiation in WT MEFs, but virtually no induction in fld cells (Fig. 3, c-e). Pref-1, a negative regulator of adipogenesis, which is normally expressed at high levels in preadipocytes and decreases during adipocyte differentiation (43Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), remained elevated in fld compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 3f). To confirm that the impaired adipogenesis observed in fld MEFs was a direct result of lipin deficiency, we complemented fld MEFs by infection with a retroviral vector expressing lipin, and then induced adipocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of lipin, but not vector alone, rescued the adipogenic defects in fld MEFs, leading to the development of cells that morphologically resembled adipocytes (Fig. 4a). Expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and aP2 was dramatically increased by lipin reconstitution (Fig. 4b), reaching levels similar to those observed in differentiated WT MEFs (compare with Fig. 3, c-e). These data demonstrate that reduced triglyceride accumulation and failure to induce key adipogenic genes in fld cells is a direct consequence of lipin deficiency. Lipin Acts Upstream of PPARγ during Adipogenesis—The observation that PPARγ gene expression is compromised in lipin-deficient adipocytes and adipose tissue suggested that lipin function is required at a time point preceding PPARγ induction during adipogenesis. PPARγ gene expression is induced between days 1 and 2 of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation (42Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). However, our previous studies indicated that lipin expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells is virtually undetectable at days 1 and 2, and then increases to levels observed in mature adipocytes at days 3 and 4 (33Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We wondered whether lipin expression does in fact occur at an earlier time point that we had not analyzed previously; therefore, we performed a time course to examine gene expression every 10 h for the first 40 h of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation, and at 6 days in mature adipocytes. The expression patterns we observed for known adipogenic factors were consistent with what has been reported previously (44Lane M.D. Tang Q.Q. Jiang M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 45Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 46Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3116S-3121SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Koutnikova H. Auwerx J. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, Pref-1, a negative regulator of adipogenesis was expressed at the highest levels at 0-10 h, declined as differentiation proceeded, and was undetectable in mature adipocytes (Fig. 5). In contrast, PPARγ and C/EBPα were expressed at very low levels initially and were not induced until 20 h; aP2 was not expressed at appreciable levels until after 40 h. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which are known to be transiently induced within the first day of treatment with differentiation mixture (48Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar), showed a spike in expression levels at 10 h, and returned to a lower level at 20 h. Lipin showed a strikingly similar pattern, with a transient induction at 10 h and a return to low levels at 20-40 h, followed by high levels in mature adipocytes. The early spike in lipin expression would not have been detected in our previous studies because it falls between day 0 and day 1 time points that were analyzed in that study (33Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Notably, the induction of lipin expression at 10 h preceded the induction of PPARγ expression at 20 h, which is consistent with the possibility that lipin functions upstream of PPARγ. To directly test whether lipin acts upstream of PPARγ in adipogenesis, we performed a genetic rescue of lipin-deficient cells with ectopic PPARγ expression. Infection of an fld MEF cell line with a PPARγ-expressing retrovirus followed by treatment with differentiation medium led to increased Oil Red O staining and a 9-fold increase in triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 6, a and b). Treatment with the PPARγ ligand, rosiglitazone, also produced a substantial 16-fold increase, suggesting that activation of the small amount of PPARγ present in fld cells is effective in promoting adipogenesis when provided with sufficient ligand. The combination of viral PPARγ and rosiglitazone had the greatest effect, producing triglyceride levels that approached those observed in WT MEFs differentiated in the presence of rosiglitazone (see Fig. 3b). In concert, the expression of genes induced in mature adipocytes, including aP2 and fatty acid synthase, were dramatically increased in response to ectopic PPARγ expression or rosiglitazone treatment, with the highest levels occurring when both were present (Fig. 6c). Thus, PPARγ expression or activation in fld cells can overcome the block in adipogenesis, suggesting that lipin is required for normal expression or function of this key adipogenic factor. The findings presented here establish impaired adipocyte differentiation as the basis for lipodystrophy and resistance to diet-induced obesity in fld mice. Our evidence for the role of lipin in adipocyte differentiation derives from a combination of in vivo and in vitro studies. In vivo, lipin deficiency prevents normal adipose tissue development, with dramatically reduced tissue mass and aberrant adipocyte gene expression. The requirement for lipin in adipogenesis also explains why fld mice fail to increase adipose tissue mass on a high-fat diet, even when supplied with excess substrates for lipid storage. Evidence that the differentiation defect is intrinsic to preadipocytes includes the demonstration that MEFs isolated from fld mice proliferate normally in culture but fail to differentiate, mirroring the reduced triglyceride accumulation and aberrant gene expression observed in adipose tissue from fld mice. We further determined that enhancing PPARγ expression or activity in fld MEFs overcomes the block in differentiation, indicating a requirement for lipin in attaining optimal PPARγ function during early stages of adipogenesis. The induction of lipin expression at 10 h of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation is consistent with a role for lipin in determining subsequent events in adipogenesis, such as down-regulation of the adipogenic inhibitor, Pref-1, or induction of adipogenesis-promoting factors such as PPARγ or C/EBPα. Previous studies (28Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 42Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar, 43Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) indicated that failure of any of these events is sufficient to prevent normal adipocyte differentiation. The mechanism by which lipin-deficiency attenuates adipogenic gene expression is not known, but recent studies of the fission yeast lipin homolog reveal interactions with three proteins having roles in nuclear envelope structure or nucleocytoplasmic transport (34Tange Y. Hirata A. Niwa O. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4375-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the nuclear localization of lipin (33Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and suggests that, unlike other known adipogenic factors, lipin may have a novel molecular function. The expression profile of lipin during the early stages of adipocyte differentiation is nearly identical to that of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which are also induced at high levels at 10 h after stimulation with differentiation mixture followed by a sharp decline before the onset of PPARγ and C/EBPα mRNA accumulation (48Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). The similarity in expression dynamics between lipin and these two C/EBP family members suggests that the three genes may be induced by common factors, or even be co-regulated, during early adipogenesis. The expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ genes is known to be induced directly by adipogenic stimuli, with C/EBPβ responding to dexamethasone through the glucocorticoid signaling pathway, and C/EBPδ responding to methylisobutylxanthine induction of the cAMP signaling pathway (48Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). It has also recently been shown (49Le Lay S. Lefrere I. Trautwein C. Dugail I. Krief S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35625-35634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) that C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are target genes of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c transcription factor, raising the possibility that the lipin gene may share some of these same regulatory mechanisms. It is notable that the adipogenic gene expression defect was more pronounced in isolated fld cells than in adipose tissue from fld mice. A similar situation has been observed in the comparison of gene expression in cells versus adipose tissue from double-knockout mice carrying null alleles for both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. As with lipin-deficient mice, the C/EBPβ-δ double-knockout mice exhibit profoundly reduced adipose tissue mass in vivo and failure of embryonic fibroblasts to differentiate in vitro, but adipogenic gene expression was much more strongly impaired in vitro (29Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7432-7443Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). It was proposed that this may reflect a compensatory response in vivo that does not occur in vitro. Additional support for an in vivo compensatory response in fld mice is provided by our previous observation (32Reue K. Xu P. Wang X.P. Slavin B.G. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that adipose tissue from 2-week-old fld mice exhibits pronounced PPARγ expression, perhaps corresponding to a developmental period in which lipin-independent mechanisms are active. Nevertheless, the failure to develop significant adipose tissue or mature adipocytes in fld mice indicates that compensatory mechanisms are not adequate to overcome the requirement for lipin in adipose tissue development. Our findings that lipin expression is biphasic, with a transient induction during early stages of preadipocyte differentiation, as well as high levels in mature adipocytes (33Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), suggests that lipin may have dual roles in adipocyte biology. Because lipin-deficient mice never develop mature adipocytes, additional models will be required to evaluate the role of lipin in mature adipose tissue. We have recently developed a transgenic mouse model with enhanced lipin expression driven by regulatory elements expressed specifically in mature adipocytes. 2J. Phan and K. Reue, unpublished data. Preliminary studies with this model indicate that increased lipin expression in mature adipose tissue is associated with increased adiposity, lending support to the proposal that lipin functions in mature as well as differentiating adipocytes.

Increasing HO-1 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages effectively decreased NAD(P)H oxidase activity and expression of gp91phox, its heme-containing catalytic component, because of deficient protein maturation and increased degradation. Loading cells with heme reversed the decrease in (O2˙−) production and gp91phox expression induced by HO-1 overexpression. Similar results were obtained in vivo in rat alveolar macrophages after pharmacological modulation of HO-1 expression or activity.

In these cells the superoxide anion drives the expression of numerous oxidant sensitive genes and is therefore involved in redox signaling as a second intracellular messenger that controls important functions such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, cell recruitment, and matrix turnover. Thus, it appears that understanding the mechanisms of regulation of superoxide production by the oxidase could have important physiological, pathophysiological, and, probably, clinical implications in different conditions and disease states.

This could be related to the heme content regulatory properties of HO-1. However, no data is available in the current literature concerning the effect of HO-1 on NAD(P)H oxidase activity and protein expression. Therefore, we investigated in vitro in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and in vivo in rat alveolar macrophages whether anti-oxidant properties of HO-1 could be mediated by the modulation of NAD(P)H oxidase activity and subunits expression. Reagents—RAW 264.7 macrophages were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). CoPP, heme, and SnPP were from Porphyrin Products (Frontier Scientific, London, UK). Cells were transfected with the Superfect® transfection reagent (Qiagen SA, Courtaboeuf, France). The polyclonal anti-HO-1 antibody was from StressGen (Tebu, Le-Perray-en-Yvelines, France), the monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma, and the anti-p22phox, anti-p47phox, and the anti-gp91phox antibodies were from UBI. Secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG-132 were from Calbiochem. Culture media, supplements, and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. Plastic tissue culture plates were supplied by Costar Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Reagents for Western blot were from Bi-Rad. Other reagents were from Sigma. RAW 264.7 Macrophage Culture—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics (10 mg/ml streptomycin and 10,000 IU/ml penicillin G) and amphotericin B (25 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Cells were used when reaching 80–90% confluence. Cellular Toxicity and Viability—Cellular toxicity and viability were assessed by two different methods, namely cell count and trypan blue exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase release in the medium. HO-1 pcDNA Transfection—The plasmid encoding for rat HO-1 was a kind gift from Dr. Josef Dulak (Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland). Transfection was achieved with the Superfect® transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well 24 h before transfection. The proportions used were 4 μg of DNA to 20 μl of transfection reagent per well. Cells were incubated for 3 h, and then the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% serum. Cytochrome c reduction assay and Western blot for HO-1 expression was performed 48 h after transfection. HO-1, p22phox, p47phox, and gp91phox Expression—HO-1, p22phox, p47phox, and gp91phox protein expression was measured by Western blot. Briefly, cells were seeded in 75 cm2 plates. When confluent, they were incubated with heme or the synthetic metalloporphyrins for 2 h, and then the medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was added for 24 or 48 h. The cells were scrapped in lysis buffer, sonicated for 10 min, and frozen at -80 °C until being used for Western blot analysis. Western blot was performed as described previously (17Taille C.

The concentration of the primary antibodies was 1:1000. Detection was performed by a chemiluminescence substrate. Using the same blots, the expression of the housekeeping protein β-actin was evaluated using a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody. Optical densities were measured with a Perfect Image 2.01 image analysis system (Iconix, Courtaboeuf, France). Results were expressed as the ratio of the expression of HO-1, p22phox, p47phox, or gp91phox to that of β-actin. Immunofluorescence Analysis by Confocal Microscopy—Cells were cultured in four-well slides (SonicSeal®, Nalgene Nunc International, Rochester, NY) at a density of 20,000 cells/well. Cells were treated with 20 μm CoPP for 2 h, washed with PBS, and then fresh medium was added. Twenty-four hours later the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, fixed in methanol for 10 min at room temperature, and then washed again before being incubated with anti-HO-1 and anti-gp91phox antibody (1:1000 and 1:500 dilution, respectively) for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:400 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were observed with a ZEISS LSM510 META confocal microscope using a X63/1.4 objective. Reverse Transcription PCR Amplification—Total RNA of RAW 264.7 cells were prepared with TRIzol reagent. A polymerase chain reaction was performed using the high fidelity Taq Platinium PCR Supermix (Invitrogen) and the following couples of primers: gp91phox,5′-GCA CAC CGC CAT CCA CAC AA-3′ and 5′-CCC CTC CGT CCA GTC TCC AA-3′; p22phox, 5′-TTC CTG TTG TCG GTG CCT GC-3′ and 5′-TTC TTT CGG ACC TCT GCG GG-3′; and p47phox, 5′-GTG GAG AAG AGC GAG AGC GG-3′ and 5′-GGT GGA TGC TCT GTG CGT TG-3′. DNA probes were amplified by an initial cycle at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and ending with a 5-min extension at 72 °C. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels. Extracellular Superoxide Anion Release/Cytochrome c Reduction—Ferricytochrome c reduction was measured as described previously (18Thabut G. El-Benna J. Samb A. Corda S. Megret J. Leseche G. Vicaut E. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22814-22821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in 6-well plates. Upon reaching confluence they were treated with CoPP (20 μm), heme (1, 10, and 100 μm), or SnPP (20 μm) as described for Western blot analysis. Twenty-four hours after treatment the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The medium was replaced with 1 mg/ml ferricytochrome c in Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red. Each condition was made with and without 300 units/ml superoxide dismutase. Cells were stimulated with 0.5 mg/ml opsonized zymosan for 15 min. The buffer was removed, and absorbance at 550 nm was read immediately. Superoxide anion production was calculated from the differences in the absorbances between samples with and without superoxide dismutase using an extinction coefficient of 21.1 mm-1 cm-1 for reduced ferricytochrome c. Results are expressed as nanomoles of superoxide anion produced per well during a 15-min period. Assay for Heme Content Measurement—For intracellular heme content assessment, cells were cultured in 24-well plates. After 2 h of treatment with heme or porphyrins the cells were washed twice with PBS, and then fresh medium was added until an assay was performed 24 or 48 h later. Heme content was determined according to the method of Motterlini et al. (19Motterlini R. Foresti R. Intaglietta M. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H648-H655PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and solubilized by adding 1 ml of concentrated formic acid. The heme concentration of the formic acid solution was determined spectrophotometrically at 398 nm (extinction coefficient = 1.56 105m-1 cm-1). Heme content was expressed as pmol/ml. Luminol-amplified Chemiluminescence Assay in Rat Alveolar Macrophages—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 g) were purchased from Iffa Credo (France). They were treated with CoPP (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally), SnPP (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally), or vehicle. Forty-eight hours after injection the rats were anesthetized, and the trachea was cannulated with a 22-gauge catheter through a tracheotomy. For bronchoalveolar lavage,15 ml of cold sterile 0.9% sodium chloride was injected and reaspirated five times. The bronchoalveolar lavage was centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Then the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution. For the chemiluminescence assay, 200,000 cells for each condition were incubated in 200 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution in the presence of 10 μm luminol and 5 units of horseradish peroxidase and then stimulated with opsonized zymosan (1 mg/ml) or PMA (0.5 μg/ml). Chemiluminescence was measured during a 30-min period in a Berthold chemiluminometer. The areas under the curve were compared. Results are expressed as 104 cpm. At the end of the experiment, cells (∼106) were centrifuged and resuspended in lysis buffer. They were frozen at -80 °C before being used for Western blot determination of HO-1 and gp91phox expression. Statistical Analysis—The values are given as the means ± S.E. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and the differences between the means were analyzed with Fischer's protected least significant difference multiple comparison test or non-parametric analysis when appropriate. The significance for all statistics was accepted at p < 0.05. Cellular Toxicity and Viability—No toxicity was observed with metalloporphyrins and heme at the doses used in the present study. Twenty-four hours after treatment with metalloporphyrins or heme, the percentage of increase in lactate dehydrogenase concentration in culture media ranged from 2.01 ± 0.91 to 7.12 ± 2.91 of the values for untreated cells (not significant). The percentage of positive cells with blue trypan exclusion was 2.20 ± 1.02 for untreated cells and ranged from 2.61 ± 0.91 to 5.75 ± 0.98 in cells treated with metalloporphyrins or heme (not significant as compared with untreated cells). HO-1 Induction Decreased Cellular Heme Content—We first checked with Western blot and confocal microscopy to determine whether the incubation of RAW 264.7 with 20 μm CoPP for 2 h induced a significant dose-dependent and time-dependent increase in HO-1 protein expression (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition (and as expected), the transfection with rat HO-1 cDNA induced a significant increase in HO-1 expression (Fig. 1C). HO-1 induction by CoPP induced a 30% decrease in cellular heme content at 24 h (Table I). In contrast, HO inhibition by SnPP was followed by a 385% increase in heme and a reversal of the CoPP-induced reduction in heme content.Table ICellular heme content Heme content was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” 24 h after treatment with metalloporphyrins or heme.

Incubation of cells with 20 μm CoPP significantly decreased superoxide anion production in response to 0.5 mg/ml opsonized zymosan. HO-1 overexpression by transfection induced a similar decrease (Fig. 2). In contrast, SnPP IX increased superoxide production and reversed the inhibitory effect of CoPP. Given alone, heme did not modulate the NAD(P)H oxidase activity, whereas when given with CoPP it reversed the decrease in superoxide anion production dose-dependently (Fig. 2). Similar effects were observed when the cells were stimulated with 10 μm PMA(data not shown). HO-1 Induction Impaired gp91phox and p22phox Expression through a Heme-dependent Mechanism—HO-1 induction by CoPP induced a dose-dependent decrease in gp91phox expression (Fig. 3A) that was reversed by the HO inhibitor SnPP (Fig. 3B)or by heme loading (Fig. 3C). As DeLeo et al. (20DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B. Yu L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) have described that heme depletion increases gp91phox degradation by proteasome, we checked whether two different proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin or MG-132 (21Nemeth Z.H. Wong H.R. Odoms K. Deitch E.A. Szabo C. Vizi E.S. Hasko G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), could reverse the effect of CoPP. Treatment of cells by lactacystin or MG-132 (10 μm, 30 min before CoPP) effectively inhibited the CoPP-induced decrease in gp91phox expression (Fig. 4), suggesting that heme restriction accelerated gp91phox degradation by the proteasome.Fig. 4Role of proteasome degradation in the decrease of gp91phox expression induced by HO-1. Typical Western blot aspect of gp91phox and β-actin expression 24 h after treatment with CoPP + Me2SO (20 μm) (A) with and without pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG-132 (10 μm in Me2SO, respectively).

In CoPP-treated cells, membrane localization of the protein disappeared, and the cytoplasmic signal was strongly decreased (Fig. 5B). In phagocytes, it is known that gp91phox is non-covalently associated with p22phox. As the expression of each subunit is dependent on the presence of the other subunit, we checked the effect of HO-1 induction on p22phox expression. The results of these experiments show that the expression of p22phox was decreased 48 h after incubation of the cells with CoPP (Fig. 6). Heme reversed the CoPP-induced decrease in p22phox expression. In contrast with gp91phox and p22phox, HO-1 induction did not modify protein expression of p47phox, a non-heme protein whose expression is independent of cytochrome b558. Expression of mRNA in the oxidase subunits gp91phox, p22phox, and p47phox was not modified by CoPP, suggesting a post-transcriptional alteration of the gp91phox and p22phox subunits (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Effect of HO-1 induction on gp91phox, p22phox, or p47phox mRNA expression. Cells were treated with different concentrations of CoPP for 24 h or with 20 μm CoPP for different times. Total RNA was extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures” and analyzed by reverse transcription PCR for gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and actin expressionView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) HO-1 Induction in Vivo Inhibited NAD(P)H Oxidase Activity in Alveolar Macrophages from CoPP-treated Rats—To verify the in vivo relevance of data obtained in cells, we evaluated gp91phox protein expression and superoxide anion production in alveolar macrophages from rats treated with 15 mg/kg CoPP or 30 mg/kg SnPP for 48 h. The results show that CoPP strongly induced HO-1 protein expression while decreasing gp91phox protein expression by 40% (Fig. 8A) as observed in vitro in cultured murine macrophages. Moreover, spontaneous superoxide production in animals receiving CoPP was decreased by 80% as compared with non-treated animals (Fig. 8B). Thus, superoxide release in response to PMA stimulation (Fig. 8B) or to opsonized zymozan (data not shown) was significantly decreased by 75% in these animals. In contrast, spontaneous and PMA-stimulated superoxide production was increased by 35 and 361%, respectively, in animals receiving SnPP. This study shows for the first time that HO-1 induction decreases in vitro and in vivo expression of the heme-containing protein gp91phox, a key component of the enzyme NAD(P)H oxidase, by decreasing cellular heme content. The interaction between these two enzymatic systems, one with anti-oxidant and another with pro-oxidant properties, opens a new insight into understanding some of the cytoprotective effects of HO-1. More generally, the modulation of NAD(P)H oxidase expression and function is of crucial importance given the increasingly recognized implications of this protein complex in different cellular processes such as inflammation, cell growth, cell adhesion, and migration (22Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). Heme oxygenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in heme break-down and an important regulator of cellular heme availability. Heme degradation is critical for cell homeostasis because of its potential pro-oxidant effects when it is in the free form (23Ryter S.W. Tyrell R.M. Free Radic Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Heme availability is also critical for the activity of heme-dependent enzymes such as HO-1 itself, which needs heme as its substrate (24Foresti R. Goatly H. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1976-H1984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or for the activity of heme-containing enzymes. The expression and activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (25Haider S. Olszanecki R.

Immunol. 1998; 149: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), two enzymes requiring heme in their catalytic site, are decreased after HO-1-induced heme depletion. Similarly, rats treated with CoPP exhibited a severe depletion in cellular cytochrome P450 (29Drummond G.S. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2384-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We show in the present study that HO-1 can also modulate NAD(P)H oxidase activity through a similar mechanism. Indeed, HO-1 induction by CoPP in vitro in RAW 264.7 macrophages resulted in a decrease in both gp91phox subunit protein expression and the whole NAD(P)H oxidase activity. These effects were associated in vitro with a decrease in heme content and were dose-dependently reversed by heme loading, suggesting that HO-1 controlled gp91phox protein expression and activity via control of the cellular heme pool. The heme requirement for the phagocyte NAD(P)H oxidase complex assembly and activity has been well demonstrated (20DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B. Yu L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The gp91phox subunit contains two heme molecules that presumably mediate the transfer of electrons from NAD(P)H to oxygen (30Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7993-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that heme is posttranslationally integrated to a p65 precursor of gp91phox without influencing apoprotein synthesis (31Yu L. DeLeo F.R. Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. Renee J. Nauseef W.M. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4364-4369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Heme incorporation into gp91phox is required for ensuring protein stability and the formation of an heterodimer with p22phox, the consequent translocation to the cell membrane, and the assembly for forming the flavocytochrome b558, the functional component of the oxidase (20DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B. Yu L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When heme synthesis is blocked, the formation of the heterodimer between gp91phox and p22phox is inhibited, and unassembled p65 and p22phox monomers are degraded by the cytosolic proteasome (20DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B. Yu L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our results show that HO, by modulating the cellular heme pool, controls the different steps of gp91phox maturation; HO-1 induction did not modify gp91phox mRNA expression but resulted in gp91phox protein degradation by the proteasome and an impaired translocation to the membrane. Furthermore, the CoPP-induced decrease in NAD(P)H oxidase activity is independent from the stimulus used (PMA or zymozan), suggesting that HO-1 does not affect the activation pathways of NAD(P)H oxidase. HO-1 induction also decreased p22phox protein expression, but this decrease happened later than the decrease of gp91phox (at 48 h versus 24 h, respectively) without changes at the mRNA level. This finding is probably a consequence of a reduced heterodimerization of p22phox with heme-depleted gp91phox (31Yu L. DeLeo F.R. Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. Renee J. Nauseef W.M. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4364-4369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Finally, protein and mRNA expression of p47phox, a cytosolic component of the NAD(P)H oxidase complex independent from heme metabolism, was not modified by HO-1 induction, stressing the heme dependence of the HO effect on NAD(P)H oxidase. It is noteworthy that, despite the fact that the powerful and long lasting induction of HO-1 expression and activity by CoPP is well characterized (33Kappas A. Drummond G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), uncertainties about the specificity of synthetic metalloporphyrins still remain (34Serfass L. Burstyn J.N. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Indeed, CoPP has been shown to inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of heme synthesis δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase (29Drummond G.S. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2384-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can hypothesize that the decrease in heme content induced by CoPP resulted from both a direct inhibition of heme synthesis and an increase in heme degradation due to HO-1 induction. Furthermore, CoPP may have inhibited NAD(P)H oxidase by competing with heme to gp91phox binding. Although we cannot exclude these possibilities, we are confident about the participation of HO-1 in the present results because of the following observations. 1) Overexpressing HO-1 by cell transfection induced an inhibition of the oxidase activity similar to that of CoPP. 2) No toxicity was observed with the concentrations of metalloporphyrins and heme used in the study. 3) Pharmacological inhibition of HO with SnPP induced the opposite effect and was able to reverse CoPP effects. The lack of heme availability is probably not the only mechanism through which HO-1 can interact with NAD(P)H oxidase, as was strongly suggested by the total inhibition of superoxide production by bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages, contrasting with a significant but much lower decrease in protein expression. We have previously demonstrated in airway smooth muscle that HO-1-released or exogenously added bilirubin could decrease superoxide anion production (12Samb A. Taille C. Almolki A. Megret J. Staddon J.M. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L596-L603Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Taille C. Almolki A. Benhamed M. Zedda C. Megret J. Berger P. Leseche G. Fadel E. Yamaguchi T. Marthan R. Aubier M. Boczkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27160-27168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This effect could be related to the oxidant-scavenging properties of bilirubin (14Minetti M. Mallozzi C. Di Stasi A.M. Pietraforte D. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) or to the inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activation by this molecule (35Kwak J.Y. Takeshige K. Cheung B.S. Minakami S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1076: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Carbon monoxide, another HO product, has been also suggested to inhibit NAD(P)H oxidase activity because of its high affinity for heme moiety (36Otterbein L.E. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that HO can inhibit NAD(P)H oxidase through different mechanisms. In view of the present data, one can wonder whether NAD(P)H oxidase inhibition could take part in the anti-oxidant effect of HO and its beneficial consequences that have been observed in different models of HO overexpression, especially in cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, NAD(P)H oxidase-generated superoxide anion takes part in the control of expression of redox-sensitive genes and is strongly involved in atherosclerosis, hypertension, and vascular remodeling (22Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 37Szocs K. Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Hilenski L.L. Valppu L. Couse T.L. Wilcox J.N. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HO has shown a protective role in similar animal models of cardiovascular diseases by decreasing vascular tone and limiting smooth muscle proliferation and the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules (38Tulis D.A.

Similarly, some authors have described a microsatellite polymorphism in the HO-1 promoter (a small number of GT repeats in the promoter region responsible for a higher HO activity) in humans that is associated with a reduced susceptibility to coronary disease (42Schillinger M. Exner M. Mlekusch W. Domanovits H. Huber K. Mannhalter C. Wagner O. Minar E. Thromb. Res. 2002; 106: 131-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or restenosis after angioplasty (43Exner M. Schillinger M. Minar E. Mlekusch W. Schlerka G. Haumer M. Mannhalter C. Wagner O. J. Endovasc. Ther. 2001; 8: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In these studies, the anti-oxidant role of HO has been advocated to explain its protective effect, but an interaction with the oxidase function has never been postulated. Results from the present experiments in rats show that such a mechanism can be observed in vivo, because a single injection of CoPP strongly inhibits superoxide production. Further studies would be required to elucidate this point in pathological models. This study provides evidence for an interaction between HO-1 activity and NAD(P)H oxidase expression through regulation of cellular heme content. This interaction could explain the anti-oxidant properties of the HO system and the beneficial effects observed in different conditions such as cardiovascular diseases in which involvement of the oxidase is well described. Moreover, given the wide distribution of gp91phox or its heme-containing homolog (NOX) (9Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), we can imagine that HO-1 induction could regulate the different biological functions mediated by superoxide anion, providing a new hypothesis to explain the wide protective effects of HO such those observed in sepsis, transplantation, or ischemia-reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2162432494,"STAT1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in signaling by interferons (IFNs). In this study we demonstrated that inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, butyrate, trichostatin A, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, prevented IFNγ-induced JAK1 activation, STAT1 phosphorylation, its nuclear translocation, and STAT1-dependent gene activation. Furthermore, we showed that silencing of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 through RNA interference markedly decreased IFNγ-driven gene activation and that overexpression of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 enhanced STAT1-dependent transcriptional activity. Our data therefore established the essential role of deacetylase activity in STAT1 signaling. Induction of IRF-1 by IFNγ requires functional STAT1 signaling and was abrogated by butyrate, trichostatin A, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, and STAT1 small interfering RNA. In contrast, silencing of STAT1 did not interfere with IFNγ-induced expression of STAT2 and caspase-7, and HDAC inhibitors did not preclude IFNγ-induced expression of STAT1, STAT2, and caspase-7, suggesting that HDAC inhibitors impede the expression of IFNγ target genes whose expression depends on STAT1 but do not interfere with STAT1-independent signaling by IFNγ. Finally, we showed that inhibitors of deacetylase activity sensitized colon cancer cells to IFNγ-induced apoptosis through cooperative negative regulation of Bcl-x expression, demonstrating that interruption of the balance between STAT1-dependent and STAT1-independent signaling significantly alters the biological activity of IFNγ.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Binding of IFNγ to cell surface receptors initiates signaling through transphosphorylation and activation of the Janus kinases, JAK1/JAK2, which leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (6Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). The JAK1/JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is required for STAT1 dimerization, its nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation (7Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2466-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of STAT1 is required for its full transcriptional activity (8Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), but the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727 remains to be identified. In addition to its role in mediating ligand-induced gene expression, STAT1 also supports the basal expression of several genes, such as caspase-1 (9Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), LMP2, and major histocompatibility complex class I (10Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4111-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In contrast to the inducible gene regulation, STAT1 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation are not required for the constitutive expression of these genes, demonstrating that unphosphorylated STAT1 has an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and unphosphorylated STAT1 appear to shuttle to the nucleus through independent pathways and modulate the expression of distinct sets of target genes (11Meyer T. Begitt A. Lodige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although STAT1 has been considered an obligatory transcription factor required for signaling by IFNγ, recent data demonstrated that IFNγ induces a plethora of genes independently of STAT1 activation and exerts biological activities in STAT1-deficient cells (12Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 13Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Han Y. Ransohoff R.M. Schreiber R.D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). IFNγ is known to activate several other signal transduction pathways, such as ERK1/ERK2 (15Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Mitani Y. Miyazaki T. Fujii H. Sato M. Kovarik P. Decker T. Schlessinger J. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the src family kinase Fyn (16Uddin S. Sher D.A. Alsayed Y. Pons S. Colamonici O.R. Fish E.N. White M.F. Platanias L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), AKT (17Navarro A. Anand-Apte B. Tanabe Y. Feldman G. Larner A.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and SHP-1 and SHP-2 (18You M. Zhao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23376-23381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19You M. Yu D.H. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2416-2424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, STAT1 deficiency significantly modifies the expression profile of IFN-regulated genes and thereby alters the biological activity of IFNγ. For example, IFNγ inhibits c-Myc in STAT+/+ cells and inhibits proliferation, but it activates c-Myc and accelerates proliferation in STAT1–/– cells (20Ramana C.V. Grammatikakis N. Chernov M. Nguyen H. Goh K.C. Williams B.R. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The nature of signaling by IFNγ that bypasses STAT1 and the biological consequences of STAT1-independent signaling by IFNγ are not well understood. IFNγ is secreted by lamina propria cells, and its levels are strongly up-regulated in the intestinal mucosa from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (21Breese E. Braegger C.P. Corrigan C.J. Walker-Smith J.A. MacDonald T.T. Immunology. 1993; 78: 127-131PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fais S. Capobianchi M.R. Pallone F. Di Marco P. Boirivant M. Dianzani F. Torsoli A.

Gut. 1998; 43: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, elevated levels of STAT1, as well as the other STAT family members (STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6), were detected in the colonic mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (25Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T. Kamizono S. Hoshino T. Kubo M. Yamashita A. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto S. Toyonaga A. Sata M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In addition, STAT1 has been shown to be constitutively activated in inflammatory intestinal diseases such as ulcerative colitis and pouchitis (26Schreiber S. Rosenstiel P. Hampe J. Nikolaus S.

Rosenstiel P. Campieri M. Buhr H.J. Schreiber S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2001; 123: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The expression of STAT1 has been reported to be reduced (28Abril E.

Cancer. 1995; 71: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), pointing to a complex role of STAT1 in tumorigenesis. It is noteworthy that patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are at increased risk to develop colorectal cancer (36Ullman T.A. Curr. Treat. Options Gastroenterol. 2002; 5: 163-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Biasco G. Rossini F.P. Hakim R. Brandi G. Di Battista M. Di Febo G. Calabrese C. Santucci R. Miglioli M. Dig. Liver Dis. 2002; 34: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The JAK/STAT signaling pathway therefore represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases as well as in cancer. PPARγ agonists, such as 15d-PGJ2 and rosiglitazone, recently have been shown to suppress JAK-STAT signaling via induction of SOCS1 and SOCS3, possibly underlying the anti-inflammatory activity of these agents (38Park E.J. Park S.Y. Joe E.H. Jou I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14747-14752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PPARγ ligands inhibited a subset of IFNγ-dependent genes, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and IP-10 (39Welch J.S. Ricote M. Akiyama T.E. Gonzalez F.J. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6712-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The HDAC inhibitors butyrate, TSA, and SAHA modulate the expression of several genes by inhibiting the activity of HDACs, which results in acetylation of histones and subsequent nucleosome remodeling (40Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). As a general rule condensed chromatin mediates transcriptional repression, whereas transcriptionally active genes are in the areas of open chromatin (41Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar). Inhibition of HDAC activity therefore often results in the relaxing of the heterochromatin and thereby increases the expression of several genes. However, global analysis of gene expression has clearly established that inhibition of HDAC activity results both in induction and in repression of gene expression (42Mariadason J.M. Corner G.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4561-4572PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of gene expression by HDAC inhibitors is not well understood but may be linked to the findings that several transcription factors are also regulated by acetylation/deacetylation. We recently reported that butyrate, an HDAC inhibitor and a dietary chemopreventive agent for colon cancer, inhibits signaling by IFNγ (43Klampfer L. Huang J. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Augenlicht L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 855-862PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that butyrate inhibits activation of STAT1, a transcription factor required for signaling by IFNs, through inhibition of its tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding activity and suggested that this activity underlies both the anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive activities of butyrate. HDAC1 has recently been reported to associate with both STAT1 and STAT2 (44Nusinzon I. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated that HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 are required for IFNγ-induced STAT1-dependent transcription. Consistently, we showed that HDAC inhibitors negatively regulate the expression of a subset of IFN-responsive genes and thereby alter the biological activity of IFNγ. HDAC inhibitors are promising new anticancer agents that alter gene expression and induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis (45Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 46Marks P. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). Understanding of their biological activity will help to predict the long term effects of these drugs on normal cells and to avoid potential side effects in patients. Cell Culture and Western Blot Analysis—The HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell line, its clonal derivative Hke-3 that lacks the mutant k-ras allele (47Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and HT29 cells were cultured under standard conditions in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Western blot analysis was performed using standard procedures. Briefly, 50 μg of total cell lysates were fractionated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with antibodies for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used for visualization of immune complexes. Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on chamber slides were serum-starved for 16 h and were treated with IFNγ for 30 or 60 min either alone or after a 16-h preincubation with HDAC inhibitors. Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol/acetic acid solution (95:5 (v/v)) for 20 min at –20 °C. Incubation with anti-STAT1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) was performed for 1 h at 37 °C. Slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate for 45 min at 37 °C. Samples were examined with a fluorescent microscope, and images were acquired with a SPOT CCD camera and analyzed by SPOT software. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—To examine the effect of HDAC inhibitors on STAT1-dependent transcriptional activity, we used plasmid 8×GAS-p36LUC, which was kindly provided to us by Dr. C. Glass (48Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). It contains eight GAS (gamma-activated sequence) STAT1 binding sites cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA/12-well plate using the calcium phosphate method (ProFection mammalian transfection system, Promega, Madison, WI,) as we described previously (49Lee T.H. Klampfer L. Shows T.B. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6154-6160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with pTK-Renilla (Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system, Promega). Cells were either left untreated or were treated with IFNγ (10 ng/ml) alone or in the presence of HDAC inhibitors. To determine the effect of HDACs on the STAT1-dependent transcriptional activity, the GAS-LUC reporter gene was co-transfected with increasing concentrations of plasmids expressing HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, or HDAC4 (from 0.05–0.75 μg/12-well plate). The basal and IFNγ-inducible transcriptional activity was determined 8 h after treatment. Results are expressed as the -fold induction of LUC activity, calculated from the ratio between the activity of the reporter plasmid in treated and untreated cells. The siRNAs specific for STAT1, HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were transfected into Hke-3 cells using the calcium phosphate method as described above. Apoptosis Assay—Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate) and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 4 h at 4 °C as described previously (50Zamai L. Falcieri E. Marhefka G. Vitale M. Cytometry. 1996; 23: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Samples were filtered through a nylon mesh (40-micron pore size) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle distribution and the extent of apoptosis (cells with a subG1 DNA content) were analyzed by Modfit software. The apoptotic nature of butyrate-treated cells was confirmed with annexin V staining (Molecular Probes) (51van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate was added to 100 μl of cell suspension, and samples were analyzed by flow cytometry 15 min after incubation at room temperature. HDAC Inhibitors Impede IFNγ-induced Phosphorylation of STAT1 on Tyrosine and Serine—We recently demonstrated that the short chain fatty acid butyrate interferes with nuclear translocation and subsequent DNA binding of STAT1 through inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine residues (43Klampfer L. Huang J. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Augenlicht L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 855-862PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of HDAC activity represents an important biological activity of butyrate (52Davie J.R. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 2485S-2493SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). To define the significance of HDAC activity in signaling by IFNγ, we first examined whether two additional HDAC inhibitors, TSA and SAHA, also inhibit STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment of cells with each of the three inhibitors of HDAC activity induced dose-dependent acetylation of histone H3 and histone H4 in these cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). In subsequent experiments we used concentrations of HDAC inhibitors that were effective in inducing acetylation of histones. Hke-3 cells were treated with IFNγ for 15 min alone or after a 16-h preincubation with butyrate (3 mm), TSA (1 μm), or SAHA (2 μm). Cell lysates were examined by immunoblotting for the expression of total STAT1 and for the activation of STAT1, the latter assessed by its phosphorylation on tyrosine 701. Untreated Hke-3 cells had no detectable levels of STAT1 phosphorylated on tyrosine. As expected, IFNγ induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig. 1A). Although the levels of total STAT1 were not modulated by the treatment of cells with butyrate, SAHA, or TSA (Fig. 1A), IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was completely prevented by each of the three inhibitors of HDAC activity. The estimated EC50 was 1 mm for butyrate, 5 μm for TSA, and 3 μm for SAHA. We demonstrated that butyrate inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Supplemental Fig. 2, A, B, and C). Although we did not detect the inhibitory effect of HDAC inhibitors on STAT phosphorylation 1 h after treatment, pretreatment of cells with HDAC inhibitor for 4 h was sufficient to significantly inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation (Supplemental Fig. 2). This suggests that the effect of HDAC inhibitors on STAT1 phosphorylation is not direct but may involve activation of an inhibitor of STAT1 phosphorylation or inhibition of the factor required for STAT1 phosphorylation. JAK1 and JAK2 are the upstream kinases responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (53Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that butyrate inhibits STAT1 signaling through inhibition of JAK2 activation (43Klampfer L. Huang J. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Augenlicht L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 855-862PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we examined whether JAK1 is also a target of HDAC inhibitors. Cells were treated with IFNγ for 5 or 15 min alone or after preincubation with HDAC inhibitors as indicated in Fig. 1B. This experiment demonstrated that butyrate, TSA, and SAHA strongly inhibited IFNγ-induced activation of JAK1 (Fig. 1B) indicating that HDAC inhibitors negatively regulate STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation through inhibition of JAK1 activation. The levels of total JAK1 and JAK2 were not modulated by HDAC inhibitors at the mRNA (42Mariadason J.M. Corner G.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4561-4572PubMed Google Scholar) nor at the protein levels (Supplemental Fig. 3). In addition to inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, IFNγ is known to induce serine phosphorylation of STAT1, and both modifications appear to be required for the optimal transcriptional activity of STAT1 (8Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of HDAC inhibitors on STAT1 serine phosphorylation by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for STAT1 phosphorylated on Ser-727 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). As reported earlier, we consistently detected low basal phosphorylation of STAT1 on serine 727 in resting Hke-3 cells (43Klampfer L. Huang J. Sasazuki T. Shirasawa S. Augenlicht L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 855-862PubMed Google Scholar), and treatment of cells with IFNγ for 30 min further increased serine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig. 1C). The HDAC inhibitors butyrate, TSA, and SAHA did not modulate the basal serine phosphorylation of STAT1 but clearly inhibited the IFNγ-induced increase in serine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig. 1C). These data therefore demonstrate that inhibition of HDAC activity negatively regulates STAT1 activity through the inhibition of its tyrosine and serine phosphorylation. To rule out the possibility that HDAC inhibitors interfere with IFN/STAT signaling through the inhibition of the expression of IFNγ receptors, we examined the effect of butyrate, TSA, and SAHA on the expression of both subunits of the IFNγ receptor. Analysis of cell lysates by immunoblotting revealed that HDAC inhibitors did not regulate the expression of the IFNγ receptor α or β chains (data not shown), excluding the possibility that these agents interfere with IFNγ signaling through inhibition of the expression of IFNγ receptors. HDAC Inhibitors Restrain IFNγ-induced STAT1 Nuclear Translocation—To determine whether inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation by HDAC inhibitors results in impaired STAT1 nuclear translocation, we examined the effect of HDAC inhibitors on the subcellular localization of STAT1. Hke-3 cells were cultured on chamber slides, were serum-starved overnight, and were treated with IFNγ (10 ng/ml) for 30 min alone or after a 16-h preincubation of the cells with 3 mm butyrate, 5 μm TSA, or 2 μm SAHA. Treatment of cells with HDAC inhibitors did not induce substantial apoptosis as assessed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (Fig. 2). The cells were stained with STAT1 antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” STAT1 was localized to both the cytoplasm and the nuclei in untreated cells, confirming a constitutive nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of STAT1, which results in partial nuclear localization of unphosphorylated STAT1 in the absence of IFNγ stimulation (54Meyer T. Gavenis K. Vinkemeier U. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with IFNγ for 30 min altered the equilibrium between the nuclear and cytoplasmic STAT1 and induced a complete nuclear translocation of STAT1 (Fig. 2). Although treatment of cells with HDAC inhibitors alone did not alter the subcellular localization of STAT1, it prevented IFNγ-induced nuclear translocation of STAT1 (Fig. 2). Our data therefore demonstrate that inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation by inhibitors of HDAC activity results in abrogated nuclear translocation of STAT1 upon treatment of cells with IFNγ. HDAC Inhibitors Interfere with STAT1-dependent Transcriptional Activity—Phosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine and serine residues is required for its full transcriptional activity (8Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Because we demonstrated that both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 are inhibited by HDAC inhibitors, this raised the possibility that these agents act as inhibitors of STAT1-dependent transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis we utilized a construct containing eight GAS cloned upstream of the LUC gene and tested whether HDAC inhibitors interfere with IFNγ-driven transcriptional activity. Hke-3 cells were transiently transfected with the 8×GAS-LUC plasmid. The cells were then either left untreated (CTRL) or treated with IFNγ, butyrate, TSA, or SAHA alone or with the combination of IFNγ and HDAC inhibitors as indicated in Fig. 3. The activity of the reporter construct was low in unstimulated cells, and treatment of cells with IFNγ induced STAT1-dependent gene activation ∼150-fold (Fig. 3). Butyrate, SAHA, and TSA inhibited the basal transcriptional activity (not shown) and reduced IFNγ-induced activation of the STAT1-driven reporter gene by more than 90% (Fig. 3). In contrast, inhibitors of HDAC activity have been shown to activate promoter activity of several genes, such as p21 (55Archer S.Y. Meng S. Shei A. Hodin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) and gelsolin, 2L. Klampfer, manuscript in preparation. demonstrating that HDAC inhibitors can both activate or repress gene activation. These data suggested that deacetylase activity is required for optimal STAT1-dependent transcription. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of elevated expression of HDACs on IFNγ-induced STAT1-dependent transcription. Hke-3 cells were transiently transfected with the 8×GAS reporter gene together with an empty vector (Fig. 4, 0) or increasing concentrations of expression vectors that encode HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, or HDAC4 (Fig. 4). 16 h posttransfection, cells either were left untreated (Fig. 4, CTRL) or were treated with IFNγ (10 ng/ml), Na-Bu (3 mm), or the combination of IFN and butyrate for 7 h. We demonstrated that exogenous expression of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 enhanced IFNγ-induced stimulation of STAT1-dependent transcription (Fig. 4). In contrast, HDAC4 inhibited IFNγ-induced STAT1-dependent transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner. These data demonstrated that STAT1-dependent transcriptional activity is regulated positively by class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3) but negatively by a class II member, HDAC4. However, despite their ability to positively regulate STAT1-driven transcription, HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 alone were not sufficient to rescue butyrate-mediated inhibition of STAT1-dependent transcription (Fig. 4). Butyrate is a broad inhibitor of HDAC activity (52Davie J.R. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 2485S-2493SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore overexpression of HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC3 alone may not be sufficient to relieve the inhibition of STAT1-dependent transcription by butyrate. HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 Are Required for STAT1-dependent Gene Activation—To confirm the requirement of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 for the optimal responsiveness to IFNs, we silenced HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 through RNA interference. We transiently transfected Hke-3 cells with 50 nm"

Here, we demonstrate that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, which is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor, is modified by SUMO-1. Sumoylation of PPARγ mainly occurs at a lysine residue within the activation function 1 domain. Furthermore, we show that the PIAS family proteins, PIAS1 and PIASxβ, function as E3 ligases (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase) for PPARγ. PPARγ interacts directly with PIASxβ in a ligand-independent manner. Analysis using a PPARγ mutant with a disrupted sumoylation site shows that modification of PPARγ by SUMO-1 represses its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, PIASxβ and Ubc9 enhance the transcriptional activity of PPARγ independent of PPARγ sumoylation. Furthermore, PPARγ ligand-induced apoptosis in a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, is significantly enhanced by ectopic production of the sumoylation-mutant PPARγ. These results suggest that the PPARγ-dependent transactivation pathway seems to be modulated by SUMO-1 modification and may serve as a novel target for apoptosis-induction therapy in cancer cells.

PPARγ2, which contains an additional 30 amino acid residues at the amino terminus compared with PPARγ1, is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, whereas PPARγ1 is widely expressed (6Tontonoz P.

The use of PPARγ ligands in the treatment of cancer is a potentially promising nontoxic and selective chemotherapeutic approach, and consequently, increased understanding of the mechanisms of PPARγ in tumor suppression is needed. Post-translational modifications regulate the function of many proteins. In the case of PPARγ, transcriptional activity is reduced by mitogen-activated protein kinase-induced phosphorylation of serine residue 112 (14Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol.

Recently, a number of ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) have been identified that are covalently linked to lysine residues in target proteins (18Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev.

One Ubl, SUMO-1, also known as PIC1, UBL1, sentrin, GMP1, and SMT3, is an 11-kDa protein that is structurally homologous to ubiquitin (20Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Initially, the ATP-dependent formation of a thioester bond between SUMO-1 and the E1 enzyme complex (SAE1·Uba2) is formed, and SUMO-1 is then transferred to the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. Finally, SUMO-1 is conjugated from Ubc9 directly to a lysine residue of target proteins in vitro. The E3 ligase that conjugates SUMO-1 to target molecules in vitro and in vivo has only recently been identified (27Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A.

To understand the molecular mechanisms of PPARγ transcriptional function through post-translational modifications, we explored the possible modification of PPARγ by SUMO-1. In this paper we demonstrate that PPARγ is a target for SUMO-1 modification, and PIAS proteins function as E3 ligases for SUMO-1 modification. The main sumoylation site of PPARγ was mapped to a lysine residue at position 107, located in close proximity to the regulatory Ser-112. Sumoylation at this lysine residue reduced PPARγ-dependent transcriptional activation significantly. However, reporter gene assays suggested that PIAS proteins enhanced the transcriptional activity of PPARγ by a mechanism independent of PPARγ sumoylation. We also observed that a PPARγ sumoylation mutant displayed enhanced ligand-induced apoptosis in a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, which suggests a possible new target for cancer therapy. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity derived from co-transfected pRL-CMV-Luc (Promega). All reporter assays were performed in triplicate, and S.E. are denoted by bars in the figures. Antibodies and Reagents—Rat anti-HA (3F10; Roche Applied Science), mouse and rabbit anti-FLAG (Sigma), and mouse anti-GFP (Clontech) antibodies were purchased commercially. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat antibodies to rat IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat antibodies to mouse or rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Rosiglitazone was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. Plasmid Construction—Plasmids producing GST fusion proteins and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen)-based plasmids expressing epitope-tagged human SUMO-1, human UBC9, and mouse PIAS families have been described previously (36Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50833-50842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A luciferase reporter plasmid, p4xPPRE-Luc, was constructed by inserting four copies of the PPAR response element (PPRE) (5′-TTGACCTTTGACCTTTGACCTTTGACCTTAGATC-3′) into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2 (Promega). The mouse PPARγ2 gene containing the entire coding region was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from 3T3-L1 cells and subcloned into epitope-tagged pcDNA3 to generate pcDNA3-FLAG-PPARγ2, -HA-PPARγ2. The cDNAs for mutant PPARγ2 with substitution of Lys-107 to Arg, PPARγ2(K/R1), and Lys-159 to Arg, PPARγ2(K/R2), were created using site-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into expression vectors to obtain pcDNA3-FLAG-PPARγ2(K/R1) and -PPARγ2(K/R2). The expression vector for PPARγ1 was obtained using PCR from PPARγ2 as a template. Expression plasmids of PPARγ-GAL4 DNA-binding fusion proteins were generated by inserting these genes into pM (Clontech). pSG5-mRXRα, encoding mouse RAR, was kindly provided by P. Chambon of the Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS/INSERM/ULP/College de France, and S. Kato at the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo. GST Pull-down Analysis—GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). PPARγ2 protein was metabolically labeled in the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) with T7 RNA polymerase and [35S]methionine. GST pull-down analysis was carried out as described previously (37Ohshima T. Nakajima T. Oishi T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Fukamizu A. Yagami K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations—HEK-293T cells (1 × 105 per 6-cm-diameter dish) were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 200 μm indole-3-acetic acid, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) for sumoylation analysis or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet) for co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min. Lysates were first cleared with protein G beads for 30 min followed by incubation with antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, the antibody complexes were captured with protein G beads for 1 h. Beads were washed four times with the same buffer, and immunoprecipitates were eluted and analyzed by Western blot. Detection and Measurement of Apoptosis and Indirect Immunofluoresence Observation—HepG2 cells were grown to subconfluency on 8-well Lab-Tec Chamber (NUNC) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with 500 ng of pcDNA3-FLAG-PPARγ1 or -PPARγ1(K/R1) expression vectors. Forty-eight hours after transfection, rosiglitazone was added to culture medium to a final concentration at 1 μm for 24 h. Cells were fixed at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde for 3 min and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with anti-HA antibody for 1 h at 37 °C and stained with Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rat secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Apoptotic cells were detected by using the in situ cell death detection kit, Fluorescein, following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The ratio of apoptotic cells was quantitated by analysis of DNA fragmentation using the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). PPARγ Is a Substrate for SUMO-1 Modification—SUMO-1 modification of certain transcription factors including nuclear hormone receptors is known to affect transcriptional activity, and consequently, we wished to address whether PPARγ was a substrate for SUMO-1 modification. We first examined whether PPARγ is modified by SUMO-1 in cells transiently expressing FLAG-PPARγ2 and HA-SUMO-1. Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody revealed the presence of FLAG-tagged PPARγ2 in all cells transfected with the plasmid expressing FLAG-PPARγ2. When HA-SUMO-1 was co-expressed, additional slower migrating bands were detected by the FLAG antibody (Fig. 1A, left panel, lane 3). Moreover, to determine whether these slower migrating bands represent PPARγ2 conjugated to SUMO-1, the membrane was re-probed with anti-HA antibody, which detects proteins conjugated to HA-SUMO-1. The result showed that the slower migrating forms of PPARγ2, about 90 and 130 kDa, were indeed sumoylated (Fig. 1A, right panel, lane 6). These data suggest that PPARγ is modified by SUMO-1 at least two sites. We next examined whether a specific PPARγ ligand, rosiglitazone, affected PPARγ sumoylation. As shown in Fig. 1B, SUMO-1-conjugated PPARγ2 was detected in cells co-producing SUMO-1. In lysates prepared from cells treated with rosiglitazone, the amount of SUMO-1-conjugated PPARγ2 was lower than in mock-treated cells (lane 2 and 4), suggesting that PPARγ ligand negatively regulates SUMO-1 conjugation to PPARγ. Two lysine residues, Lys-107 and Lys-347, in the AF1 and AF2 domains, respectively, of PPARγ2 conform to the proposed consensus motif ψKX(D/E) (where ψ is a hydrophobic amino acid residue, X represents any residue, and D or E is an acidic residue) for SUMO-1-conjugating sites (18Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 20Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). To determine whether these lysine residues are targets for sumoylation, mutants with lysine to arginine substitutions, K107R (K/R1) and K347R (K/R2) as shown in Fig. 1C, were generated and analyzed for sumoylation. Two bands migrating slower than the original band were detected with almost the same intensity as cells producing both wild type PPARγ1, PPARγ2, and the mutant PPARγ2(K/R2) (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the slowest band disappeared in cells producing the mutant PPARγ2(K/R1), and moreover, the amount of the slower migrating band was also reduced in the cells expressing the mutant PPARγ2(K/R1) (Fig. 1D, lane 2). These results imply that Lys-107 is the major site for sumoylation, and this site may function as the master switch of sumoylation because mutation of this lysine residue greatly impaired sumoylation for PPARγ. The fact that mutation of lysine residue at 347 did not affect the efficiency of sumoylation suggests the presence of lysine residues other than those not in the consensus motif for SUMO-1 modification in PPARγ. PIAS Family Proteins Act as E3 Ligases for PPARγ Sumoylation—Recent studies indicated that members of the PIAS family enhanced sumoylation of many proteins including nuclear receptors (25Muller S. Ledl A. Schmidt D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1998-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 34Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, we investigated whether PIAS family proteins function as E3 ligases for PPARγ. We generated a mutant of PIASxβ, PIASxβ(C/S), in which the conserved cysteine residue at position 353 within the RING finger domain was changed to serine. This mutant was not able to interact with Ubc9 (data not shown) and completely lacked E3 ligase function (36Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol.

SUMO-1 conjugation to PPARγ2 was analyzed in cells producing either wild-type PIASxβ, PIASxβ(C/S), or PIAS1. Small amounts of SUMO-1-conjugated PPARγ2 were detected in cells expressing only HA-SUMO-1 ectopically (Fig. 2, lane 2). PPARγ2 sumoylation was enhanced by exogenous expression of PIAS1 and PIASxβ but not PIASxβ(C/S) (lanes 3-5). These findings indicate that PIAS family proteins function as E3 ligases for PPARγ2. Next, to investigate the association of PPARγ2 with PIASxβ, we employed a GST pull-down analysis. Full-length PIASxβ expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein was coupled to glutathione S-Sepharose beads, and this complex was incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled PPARγ2 in buffer with or without rosiglitazone, a specific ligand for PPARγ. As shown Fig. 3A, PPARγ2 interacted both in the presence and absence of rosiglitazone with GST-PIASxβ but not with GST alone. To analyze the physical interaction of PPARγ2 with PIASxβ in cells, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was conducted using extracts from HEK-293T cells co-expressing HAPPARγ2 and FLAG-PIASxβ treated with or without rosiglitazone. Proteins precipitated with anti-HA antibody were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-FLAG was conducted. A FLAG-reactive species was detectable in the complex precipitated with the anti-HA antibody. The PIASxβ in the immunocomplex was increased in cells treated with rosiglitazone, indicating that the binding efficiency of PPARγ2 and PIASxβ was significantly enhanced by treatment with this ligand (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). SUMO-1 Conjugation to PPARγ Represses the Transcriptional Activity of PPARγ—To evaluate the effect of PPARγ sumoylation on its transcriptional function, we analyzed the effects of PPARγ sumoylation on expression of the p4xPPRELuc reporter gene in which the luciferase gene is driven by a PPAR-responsive promoter. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids expressing wild-type PPARγ1, wild-type PPARγ2, PPARγ1(K/R1), PPARγ2(K/R2), and mRXRα, a component of a heterodimeric complex with PPARγ, together with p4xPPRE-Luc. Cells were then treated with or without rosiglitazone. Additional production of mRXRα in cells enhanced reporter activity by PPARγ. Reporter activity was enhanced by treatment with rosiglitazone, and this was highest in cell lysates containing PPARγ2(K/R1) (Fig. 4A). The fact that transcriptional activity of PPARγ2 was higher than that of PPARγ1 was in good agreement with a previous report (38Mueller E. Drori S. Aiyer A. Yie J. Sarraf P. Chen H. Hauser S. Rosen E.D. Ge K. Roeder R.G. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41925-41930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Next, to analyze the direct effect of the SUMO-1 conjugation-dependent transcriptional activity of PPARγ, we utilized PPARγ fused with GAL4 to analyze gene expression from pGL2-Luc containing five GAL4 binding sites in the promoter region. GAL4-PPARγ1(K/R1) and -PPARγ2(K/R1) showed about 5-fold higher luciferase activities than the activity observed by GAL4-wild-type-PPARγ1 and GAL4-wild-type-PPARγ2, respectively, in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data suggest that sumoylation of PPARγ represses the transcriptional activity of PPARγ itself. Both Ubc9 and PIASxβ Enhance PPARγ-dependent Transactivation—To further investigate the transcriptional role of sumoylated PPARγ, we examined the effects of Ubc9, an essential factor for sumoylation, on PPARγ-dependent transcription. GAL4-fused wild-type PPARγ2 and -PPARγ2(K/R1) were expressed in HEK-293T cells with increasing amounts of Ubc9 (Fig. 5A). Co-production of Ubc9 enhanced transcription by PPARγ2 and PPARγ2(K/R1) in a dose-dependent fashion. We next examined the effects of PIASxβ and PIASxβ(C/S) on the transcriptional activation of PPARγ2. Luciferase activities were significantly enhanced by the co-production of PIASxβ. However, co-production of PIASxβ(C/S) only slightly enhanced the activity (Fig. 5B). Similar results were also observed for PPARγ1 (data not shown). These data suggest that the SUMO-1 conjugation activity of Ubc9 and PIAS positively regulates PPARγ-mediated transactivation. The observation that the transcriptional activity of PPARγ2(K/R1) was not only significantly enhanced by co-production of Ubc9 but also by PIASxβ suggests that Ubc9 and PIAS proteins function as positive regulators for PPARγ-dependent transcription possibly through SUMO-1 conjugation of a factor(s) other than PPARγ involved in transcriptional regulation. Ligand-induced Apoptosis by PPARγ Is Enhanced in Cells Producing PPARγ(K/R1)—Recent studies have demonstrated that specific ligands for PPARγ inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in several human cancer cells (2Tsubouchi Y.

Gastroenterol. 2003; 9: 1220-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PPARγ activation seems to be important for inducing apoptosis in some cells. However, the molecular mechanisms of PPARγ-dependent apoptosis, particularly the relationship between the transcriptional activity of PPARγ and apoptosis, remain unclear. To investigate the effect of sumoylation on PPARγ-dependent apoptosis, we compared the apoptotic potential of wild-type PPARγ1 to that of PPARγ1(K/R1) in HepG2 cells. Plasmids expressing FLAG-PPARγ1 or -PPARγ1(K/R1) were transfected into HepG2 cells, and 48 h after transfection cells were treated with 1 μm rosiglitazone for 24 h. PPARγ expression in cells and apoptotic cells were detected by immunostaining and terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay, respectively. Approximately 5% of PPARγ1-transduced cells became terminal dUTP nick-end label-positive, which stained strongly by the anti-FLAG antibody. In contrast, ∼40% of PPARγ1(K/R1)-transduced cells became terminal dUTP nick-end label-positive, and almost all cells expressed high levels of PPARγ1(K/R1) (Fig. 6A). The numbers of apoptotic cells producing PPARγ1 or PPARγ1(K/R1) were verified by measurement of the accumulation of fragmented nucleosomes. Ligand-induced apoptosis is significantly enhanced when PPARγ1(K/R1) was produced in cells (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that transcriptional activation of PPARγ is involved in enhancing ligand-mediated apoptosis. In this study we showed that sumoylation of PPARγ significantly affected its transcriptional activity. PPARγ was predominantly modified by SUMO-1 at Lys-107 within the AF1 domain. Our result suggest that there is a lysine residue(s) in addition to Lys-107 targeted for sumoylation that is likely to lie in a non-consensus SUMO-1 conjugation motif, because mutational analysis of the lysine residues lying in other consensus SUMO-1 conjugation motifs in this protein did not affect SUMO-1 conjugation (Fig. 1D). Because mutation of Lys-107 reduced SUMO-1 conjugation of PPARγ severely, Lys-107 is the primary site for modification. Similar observations of the presence of hierarchic lysine residues for SUMO-1 conjugation were reported in other proteins such as promyelocytic leukaemia protein (39Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P.

Yasugi T. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7913-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PIAS1 and PIASxβ acted as E3 ligase factors for SUMO-1 conjugation to PPARγ (Fig. 2). We also showed that PIASxβ associated with PPARγ2 in vitro and in vivo in a ligand-independent manner, but the association was enhanced by the presence of the ligand in vivo (Fig. 3). Interestingly, ligand treatment led to a reduction in the amount of SUMO-1 conjugated to PPARγ2 (Fig. 1B). Because of conformational alteration of nuclear receptors, association of co-activator complexes with nuclear receptor seems to be regulated by specific ligands. Thus, it is likely that PPARγ sumoylation is suppressed by the association of the co-activator complex with the ligated PPARγ, in which the sumoylation sites of PPARγ may be masked, and/or the E3 ligase activity of PIAS proteins may be blocked. Using a reporter gene assay, we demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of PPARγ was negatively regulated by sumoylation. It has been reported that phosphorylation of Ser-112, adjacent to the sumoylation site, as revealed by this work, on PPARγ by mitogen-activated protein kinase significantly inhibited both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by PPARγ (15Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Mutation analysis of the phosphorylation site revealed that this phosphorylation-mediated transcriptional repression was not due to a reduced capacity to make PPARγ·RXRα complexes or the impairment of recognition of its DNA binding site (14Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). An AF-1 domain of PPARγ may be negatively regulated by phosphorylation and sumoylation. Alternatively, SUMO-1-conjugated PPARγ may recruit the transcriptional repressor complex by providing a novel interaction site. Recently it has been shown that sumoylation of the ETS domain transcription factor, Elk-1, results in the recruitment of histone deacetylase activity to promoters (43Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Similarly, SUMO-1-conjugated PPARγ may recruit additional cellular factors that repress PPARγ-dependent transcription. Our data clearly showed that Ubc9 enhanced the transcriptional activities of both PPARγ and PPARγ(K/R1), possibly by a mechanism independent of SUMO-1 conjugation to PPARγ. PIASxβ also enhanced PPARγ activity through a RING finger domain-dependent mechanism. Thus, it seems that ectopically produced PIASxβ regulates PPARγ-mediated transactivation through not only sumoylation of PPARγ itself but also in the conjugation of SUMO-1 to another cellular factor(s) involved in transcriptional regulation. In agreement with our observations, key molecules in the SUMO-1 conjugation system, including SUMO-1, Ubc9, and PIAS, have been shown to modulate the transcriptional activities of p53 (44Schmidt D. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), androgen receptor (40Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) even when these target molecules lacked a major sumoylation site(s) by mutation. Moreover, it has been shown that Ubc9 modulates the transcriptional activity of ETS-1- and TEL-independent of its E2 enzymatic activity (45Hahn S.L. Wasylyk B. Criqui-Filipe P. Criqui P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 46Chakrabarti S.R. Sood R. Ganguly S. Bohlander S. Shen Z. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7467-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In view of these reports, a mechanism(s) other than the direct SUMO-1 conjugation to PPARγ by Ubc9 and PIASxβ seem to be important for the regulation of transactivation of PPARγ. Further studies to clarify the molecular basis of the transcriptional activation of PPARγ-dependent transcription by Ubc9 and PIAS should provide significant insight. A role for PPARγ in adipogenesis is well characterized. In addition, a novel function of PPARγ in tumor pathogenesis has been reported recently, which includes PPARγ ligand-dependent growth inhibition and/or apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells (2Tsubouchi Y. Sano H. Kawahito Y. Mukai S. Yamada R. Kohno M. Inoue K. Hla T. Kondo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 11Eibl G. Wente M.N. Reber H.A.

Gastroenterol. 2003; 9: 1220-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that induction of apoptosis was accompanied by the up-regulation of several pro-apoptotic genes, Bax and caspase-3 and -9, and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 (47Michael M.S. Badr M.Z. Badawi A.F. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 11: 733-736PubMed Google Scholar, 48Yoshizawa K. Cioca D.P. Kawa S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Cancer. 2002; 95: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that transactivation of PPARγ is likely to regulate expression of apoptosis modulators at the transcriptional level and contribute as an important modulator of tumor suppression. In this study we demonstrated that the trans-activation function of PPARγ was up-regulated by mutation of Lys-107, the major target for sumoylation in PPARγ. BecauseHepG2 cells expressing this mutant form of PPARγ displayed enhanced PPARγ ligand-dependent apoptosis, the increased transactivation function of PPARγ seems to play an important role in inducing apoptosis. Sumoylation regulates the transacting function of PAPRγ, which could play a role in the regulation of apoptosis. We suggest here that the sumoylation of PPARγ may be a good target for a novel therapeutic agent in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996162026,"The environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin (TCDD) causes a wide range of toxic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects. TCDD is a ligand for the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor believed to be the primary mediator of these effects. Activation of the AHR by TCDD also elicits a variety of effects on cell cycle progression, ranging from proliferation to arrest. In this report, we have characterized further the role of the activated AHR in cell cycle regulation. In human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 and mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells, TCDD treatment decreased the number of cells in S phase and caused the accumulation of cells in G<sub>1</sub>. In Hepa-1 cells, this effect correlated with the transcriptional repression of several E2F-regulated genes required for S phase progression. AHR-mediated gene repression was dependent on its interaction with retinoblastoma protein but was independent of its transactivation function because AHR mutants lacking DNA binding or transactivation domains repressed E2F-dependent expression as effectively as wild type AHR. Overexpression of p300 suppressed retinoblastoma protein-dependent gene repression, and this effect was reversed by TCDD. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that TCDD treatment caused the recruitment of AHR to E2F-dependent promoters and the concurrent displacement of p300. These results delineate a novel mechanism whereby the AHR, a known transcriptional activator, also mediates gene repression by pathways involving combinatorial interactions at E2F-responsive promoters, leading to the repression of E2F-dependent, S phase-specific genes. The AHR seems to act as an environmental checkpoint that senses exposure to environmental toxicants and responds by signaling cell cycle inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2068994981,"The cellular response to stress involves a rapid inhibition of cap-dependent translation via multiple mechanisms, yet some translation persists. This residual translation may include proteins critical to the cellular stress response. BCL-2 is a key inhibitor of intrinsic apoptotic signaling. Its primary transcript contains a 1.45-kb 5′-untranslated region (UTR) including 10 upstream AUGs that may restrict translation initiation via cap-dependent ribosome scanning. Thus, we hypothesized that this 5′-UTR may contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that facilitates BCL-2 translation, particularly during cell stress. Here we show that the BCL-2 5′-UTR demonstrated IRES activity both when translated in vitro and also when m7G-capped and polyadenylated mRNA was transiently transfected into 293T cells. The activity of this IRES in unstressed cells was ∼6% the strength of the hepatitis C virus IRES but was induced 3–6-fold in a dose-dependent manner following short term treatment with either etoposide or sodium arsenite. Thus, the IRES-mediated translation of BCL-2 may enable the cell to replenish levels of this critical protein during cell stress, when cap-dependent translation is repressed, thereby maintaining the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members in the cell and preventing unwarranted induction of apoptosis.

The BCL-2 protein is the prototype member of a conserved superfamily of proteins that regulate the cellular response to various intrinsic stresses, including damage to DNA, the endoplasmic reticulum, or Golgi apparatus (1Borner C. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 615-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). BCL-2 prevents apoptosis in response to these stresses through a variety of mechanisms, many of which are now clearly defined. Its predominant isoform (BCL-2α) contains a C-terminal transmembrane domain and localizes to membranes of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear envelope (2Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family, including BCL-2, all contain highly homologous regions (BH domains 1–3), which together form a hydrophobic groove required for anti-apoptotic functionality (3Hanada M.

BCL-2 forms heterodimers with a variety of pro-apoptotic proteins, thereby sequestering these proteins to prevent the onset of apoptosis (5Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W.

Additional findings suggest that the anti-apoptotic role of BCL-2 extends further than simply protecting mitochondrial integrity. BCL-2 appears to regulate the cell cycle (11Greider C. Chattopadhyay A. Parkhurst C. Yang E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7765-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and reportedly prevents a constitutive pro-apoptotic signal from p53 by directly binding this transcription factor (12Jiang M.

With such diverse roles in regulating apoptosis, it is not surprising that the expression of BCL-2 is regulated at multiple levels. First, the transcription of BCL-2 mRNA is transcribed from two different promoters, and its mRNA stability is regulated by an AU-rich element in the 3′-UTR 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; ORF, open reading frame; uORF, upstream ORF; RNAi, RNA interference; RT, reverse transcriptase; Na Ars, sodium arsenite; Etopo, etoposide; HCV, hepatitis C virus; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Rluc, Renilla luciferase; FLuc, firefly luciferase; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysates.

This 5′-UTR contains a 219-bp alternatively spliced intron that spans the region from 286 to 505 bases upstream from the translation start site. The splicing frequency of this intron varies among B-cell lines, although both spliced and un-spliced forms are often simultaneously expressed (25Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The BCL-2 5′-UTR region is highly conserved between human, mouse, rat, and even chicken, suggesting a potential regulatory role for this region (30Eguchi Y. Ewert D.L. Tsujimoto Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4187-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Negrini M. Silini E. Kozak C. Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M.

The vast majority of cellular mRNAs initiate translation via m7G cap-dependent recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the 5′ end of a mRNA, followed by linear 5′–3′ scanning to the first AUG codon in proper context (33Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, during induced cellular stress this cap-dependent translation is rapidly inhibited by multiple mechanisms (34Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 35Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Even so, a portion of cellular translation persists that is thought to occur via a cap-independent recruitment of ribosomes directly onto certain mRNAs containing internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements (35Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 36Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). IRES-mediated translational initiation was initially described as a mechanism that enables certain viruses to translate effectively viral proteins despite an inhibition of cap-dependent translation in the infected cell (37Jang S.K. Krausslich H.G. Nicklin M.J. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, IRES-mediated translation initiation has been most often observed for mRNAs that possess unusually long and thermodynamically stable 5′-UTRs with multiple potential uORFs, features that can dramatically inhibit scanning-dependent translation initiation (36Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The predominant mRNA transcript coding for BCL-2 possesses both of these characteristics, containing a 1.45-kb 5′-UTR with 10 upstream AUGs. Thus, we examined the 5′-UTR of BCL-2 for its ability to mediate translational initiation via an unconventional, cap-independent mechanism. Through transfection of m7G-capped and polyadenylated reporter mRNAs, we demonstrate that BCL-2 expression is regulated via a stress-inducible IRES located within its 5′-UTR. This IRES mediated little reporter gene translation in unstressed cells, yet was induced 3–6-fold during stress induced by treatment with either sodium arsenite or the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Thus, IRES-mediated translation of BCL-2 may enable the cell to replenish levels of this critical protein during periods of cell stress, when little cap-dependent translation occurs. Materials—Radiolabeled nucleotides [α-32P]CTP and [35S]Met-Cys (Tran35S-label) were from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). Oligonucleotide primer synthesis was by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Cell Culture—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan UT). Growth was at 37 °C in 5.0% CO2 at 95% relative humidity, and cells were thinned 1:5 every 2–3 days at <85% confluency. Construct Assembly—pRL-HL was a gift from S. Lemon (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX), and its construction was described previously (39Honda M. Kaneko S. Matsushita E. Kobayashi K. Abell G.A. Lemon S.M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 152-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A unique SacII site was introduced into pRL-HL upstream from FLuc to facilitate insertion of sequences between NotI and SacII sites, and the construct was named pRL-HCV-FL. The BCL-2 5′-UTR was amplified via RT-PCR from total RNA of HeLa S3 cells. Gene-specific primers amplified a region from bases –1146 to +3 of the BCL-2 cDNA (relative to the translational start site) and added NotI (5′ end) and SacII (3′ end) sites. This fragment was inserted into a NotI/SacII-digested pRL-HCV-FL backbone to form pRL-BCL2-FL. The original BCL-2 start codon was retained and inserted in-frame with FLuc, creating a FLuc ORF with six extra N-terminal codons. pRL-FL was created by removing the HCV IRES region between NotI and SacII sites. pRL-revH-FL was constructed via PCR of the HCV sequence utilizing primers that swapped the NotI and SacII sites. This fragment was then ligated into the NotI/SacII-cut backbone of pRL-HCV-FL. phpRL-BCL-2-FL included a 143-bp region that forms a stable RNA hairpin (ΔG = –60 kcal/mol) inserted at a unique NheI site located immediately upstream from RLuc. p(ΔCMV)RL-BCL-2-FL was created using long distance PCR and the 5′-phosphorylated primers 5′-cagccgcggagaactagtggatcccccggg-3′ and 5′-ctagcggccgcttggtgttacgtttggtttttctttg-3′, which allowed amplification of all but the CMV promoter region. The PCR product was then blunt-ligated with T4 ligase. pBCL-2-FL was similarly constructed using the primers 5′-gacatccactttgcctttctctcca-3′ and 5′-gtgggttacatcgaactggatctca-3′. Construction of phpB-CL-2-FL utilized primers 5′-cgttgagcgagttctcaaaagtgaacaataattctagagcgg-3 and 5′-ggtggctagcttataaaagcagtgg-3′. All clones were verified by both restriction digest and sequencing. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Constructs were linearized with either AgeI or XhoI (pRL-revH-FL and pRL-HCV-FL). In vitro transcription was performed using purified T7 polymerase in a typical 100-μl reaction. m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analog (m7G) (Ambion, Austin, TX) was included at a ratio of 4:1 versus rGTP. Translations were performed in typical fashion using nuclease-treated RRL (Promega) and 10 μCi of Tran35S-Label Met/Cys (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Reactions were resolved via 12% SDS-PAGE, dried, and then exposed to Kodak Biomax film (Rochester, NY). RNAi Directed against RLuc—The RNAi vector pBS-RLi was utilized to elicit a small interfering RNA response targeting the RLuc coding region. This vector contains a 50-bp RNA hairpin downstream from the murine U6 promoter, and its construction has been described previously (40Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 720-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). pBS-RLi was transiently co-transfected into cells along with dicistronic reporter constructs at a 1:1 ratio (0.5 μg each) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The empty vector pBS-ApaI was used as control. 293T cells were plated at 4.0 × 105 cells/well on 12-well plates 16 h prior to transfection. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) on a Sirius model luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). RT-PCR of Transfected BCL-2 DNA Constructs—Total RNA was Trizol-extracted (Sigma) from 293T cells that had been transiently transfected with dicistronic DNA test constructs. RNA was DNase I-treated for 15 min at room temperature, and RT-PCR was then performed by using an upstream primer just downstream from the CMV promoter translation initiation site, 5′-cagatcactagaagctttattgcg-3′, and a downstream primer just inside the FLuc ORF, 5′-tctcttcatagccttatgcagttgc-3′. Control PCRs using DNA as template were not DNase I-treated. Transient Transfection of DNA and mRNA—DNA constructs were transiently transfected into cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were plated in 12-well plates at 1.25 × 105 cells/well 16 h prior to transfection. The ratio of FuGENE/DNA was 6 μl:2 μg, and transfections were performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were lysed 8 h post-transfection and assayed for both RLuc and FLuc activities. Transient transfection of in vitro transcribed mRNA was achieved by first cloning a 35-bp poly(A)-containing sequence into all reporter constructs at the unique ApaI site immediately downstream from FLuc. This sequence included a unique AgeI site at its 3′ end. Each construct was linearized by digesting with AgeI (except for pRL-HCV-FL and pRL-revH-FL, which were linearized with XhoI), followed by phenol/CHCL3/isoamyl extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Transcription was performed as described above. Cells were plated at 1.25 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates and attached overnight. Transfection proceeded using 1.5 μg/well mRNA with 8 μl of DMRIE C reagent (Invitrogen). pSV40-Bgal DNA was co-transfected with monocistronic RNAs at 0.1 μg/well to control for transfection efficiency. Serum was re-added 3 h post-transfection. Luciferase analysis was as described above. β-Galactosidase was quantified using the Beta-Glo™ Assay Reagent (Promega). Treatment with various stress-inducing agents was maintained during transfection. Etopo and Na Ars were both obtained from Sigma. RNA Analysis—For in vivo assays, additional wells were simultaneously transfected and treated identically for analysis of post-transfection reporter mRNA integrity. Six hours post-transfection, total RNA was harvested with 300 μl of Trizol reagent (Sigma). Purified total RNA was denatured using established glyoxal/Me2SO methodology and 2.5 μg of RNA/well run in a 1% NaHPO4-buffered gel. RNA was then transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT™ film. Northern analysis to assess in vivo expression of pRL-BCL2-FL was performed by transferring RNA to nylon (as described above) and then pre-hybridized with 10 ml of Ultra Hyb™ solution for 1 h (Ambion). A 489-bp FLuc-specific riboprobe was transcribed in vitro using SP6 polymerase, along with 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP. 1 × 106 cpm of riboprobe was hybridized for 12 h at 68 °C, followed by washing in 2× SCC and autoradiography. Immunoblotting for BCL2—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and 40 μg of total protein was mixed 1:1 with 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled 5 min, and then resolved via 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, blocked 1 h in TBST + 3% milk, then probed with 1:1000 anti-BCL-2 monoclonal antibody (clone SC-7382, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary F(ab′)2 fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Normalization for total protein loading was accomplished by using a monoclonal antibody specific for α-tubulin (Sigma). The predominant BCL-2 promoter (P1) produces a 5′-UTR of 1.45 kb that contains numerous structural features that likely regulate BCL-2 translation. For example, an extremely stable secondary structure (ΔG = –530 kcal/mol) as well as multiple potential uORFs would be expected to largely inhibit conventional ribosomal scanning (Fig. 1A) (41Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10315) Google Scholar). Indeed, a uORF that spans –119 to –84 bp upstream from the start codon has been reported to inhibit significantly BCL-2 translation, presumably by causing a fraction of scanning ribosomes to translate the uORF, and then disengage from the mRNA (29Harigai M. Miyashita T. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1369-1374PubMed Google Scholar). The region of the BCL-2 5′-UTR that was examined for this study extended 1146 bp upstream from the start codon and included the alternatively spliced 219-bp intron (Fig. 1B). This sequence was inserted into several reporter constructs in order to assess potential IRES activity, including a dicistronic construct that placed the BCL-2 5′-UTR between an upstream RLuc reporter gene and a downstream FLuc gene (Fig. 2A). The upstream RLuc cistron was immediately followed by two “inframe” stop codons that inhibit ribosomal reinitiation. This dicistronic DNA reporter assay is commonly utilized to assess potential IRES activity because cap-dependent translation of RLuc not only restricts cap-dependent translation of the downstream FLuc but also acts as an internal control to measure relative increases in FLuc expression. A positive control for IRES activity included a 426-bp region containing the HCV IRES between the reporter genes (pRL-HCV-FL), whereas the negative control contained the HCV IRES in an inverted orientation (pRL-revH-FL). For in vitro assays, the negative control (pRL-FL) contained a 27-bp spacer sequence between the cistrons. The 5′-UTR of BCL-2 Functions as an IRES in Vitro—As an initial test for IRES activity, test constructs containing the 5′-UTR of BCL-2 were transcribed in vitro in the presence of 7-methyl-G(5′)ppp(5′)guanosine cap analog (m7G). Equimolar amounts of transcripts were then used to program translation in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) (Fig. 2B). The empty vector control (Fig. 2B, pRL-FL, lane 1) efficiently translated the upstream RLuc cistron, yet little translation of the second cistron (Fluc) was observed. Similar to previous reports, insertion of the HCV IRES (Fig. 2B, pRL-HCV-FL, lane 2) stimulated expression of downstream FLuc, indicative of IRES-mediated translation. Likewise, expression of FLuc also increased downstream from the BCL-2 5′-UTR (pRL-BCL2-FL, lane 5), suggesting that this region supports cap-independent translation, and may contain an IRES. Insertion of a sequence that forms a stable RNA hairpin structure (ΔG = –60 kcal/mol) upstream of RLuc (Fig. 2B, phpRL-BCL2-FL, lane 6) inhibited cap-dependent translation by ∼98%, yet significant expression of the second cistron (FLuc) persisted. This indicated that increased translation of FLuc mediated by the BCL-2 5′-UTR was not due to an increase in ribosomal re-initiation. Similar results were obtained by using monocistronic RNAs. Translation of the monocistronic pBCL2-FL (Fig. 2B, lane 3) demonstrated that the BCL-2 5′-UTR supported ample translation of FLuc, although at a significantly lower level than constructs containing RLuc preceded by only a short leader sequence (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 2, and 5) or FLuc alone (data not shown). Insertion of the stable RNA hairpin structure in front of the BCL-2 5′-UTR (Fig. 2B, phpBCL2-FL, lane 4) inhibited its ability to mediate FLuc translation by ∼65% but far less than the 98% inhibition of RLuc translation observed when this hairpin was inserted into phpRL-BCL2-FL. Together, these data strongly indicated that the 5′-UTR of BCL-2 could support cap-independent translation, possibly through IRES-mediated recruitment. In Vivo Assessment of BCL-2 IRES Function in Cells Transfected with DNA Constructs—We sought to confirm our in vitro results by transfecting DNA constructs containing the BCL-2 5′-UTR into 293T kidney cells. Following transfection, a similar increase in FLuc:RLuc ratio above background was observed for both pRL-BCL2-FL and pRL-HCV-FL (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the BCL-2 5′-UTR contained an IRES of comparable strength to the HCV IRES. HeLa S3 and HepG2 cells were likewise transfected with these constructs, and similar results were obtained (results not shown). To test whether this apparent BCL-2 IRES activity was the result of monocistronic transcripts being generated from a promoter within the BCL-2 5′-UTR, a DNA construct lacking the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was created [p(ΔCMV)RL-BCL2-FL]. Upon its transfection into 293T cells, no RLuc or FLuc activity was detected, demonstrating negligible promoter activity (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). Next, we utilized several procedures to rigorously evaluate the transcripts produced from pRL-BCL2-FL in vivo. First, we used a new RNAi method to test for spliced transcripts derived from the dicistronic vector (54Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1886-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). An RNAi vector targeted against RLuc was transfected into cells, resulting in silencing of RLuc expression by ∼80% (results not shown), in accordance with previous observations (40Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 720-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). RLuc-directed RNAi in the cells containing pRL-HCV-FL resulted in equal inhibition of RLuc and FLuc, suggesting the presence of only a single dicistronic transcript (Fig. 3B). However, aberrantly spliced monocistronic transcripts coding only for FLuc would not be subject to the same RLuc-specific RNAi silencing. When the RNAi vector was co-transfected with pRL-BCL2-FL, FLuc translation decreased but was 2.3-fold greater than RLuc, suggesting the presence of monocistronic FLuc transcripts (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained using a construct containing the XIAP IRES (pRL-XIAP-FL), which was recently demonstrated to contain a splice acceptor (Fig. 3B) (40Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 720-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To confirm potential splicing, nonquantitative RT-PCR was performed on total RNA isolated from 293T cells that had been transiently transfected with pRL-BCL2-FL (Fig. 3C). PCR primers were selected to amplify the region between the transcription start site of the CMV promoter to the FLuc ORF, such that control DNA PCR fragments for pRL-HCV-FL (1.9 kb) and pRL-BCL2-FL (2.4 kb) were expected (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 5). RT-PCR products were anticipated to be ∼200 bp smaller due to splicing of the chimeric intron (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 6). pRL-HCV-FL-transfected cells produced an RT-PCR product of 1.7 kb, indicating an intact dicistronic transcript. However, cells transfected with pRL-BCL2-FL produced not only a 2.2-kb PCR product representing a dicistronic transcript (visible only upon overexposure, data not shown), but also a smaller product of 350 bp (Fig. 3C). Sequencing showed that the smaller 350-bp product represented a monocistronic FLuc transcript with a 290-bp 5′-UTR. Finally, Northern analysis confirmed the presence of both transcripts (Fig. 3D). Although the dicistronic transcript (∼4.7 kb) was the predominant species, a significant portion of FLuc expression had resulted from the production of the smaller, monocistronic transcript. Therefore, these data showed that pRL-BCL2-FL generated monocistronic transcripts containing only FLuc in vivo, and thus IRES function within the BCL-2 5′-UTR could not be accurately quantified via DNA transfection. Although Northern analysis confirmed the presence of two different transcripts in this instance, the more sensitive techniques described here can detect low level aberrant splicing that is below the sensitivity threshold of Northern blotting (40Van Eden M.E. Byrd M.P. Sherrill K.W. Lloyd R.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 720-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The BCL-2 5′-UTR Functions as an IRES in Vivo—We chose to assess potential BCL-2 IRES activity by directly transfecting RNA. All DNA constructs were modified such that in vitro transcription would create transcripts containing a 35-bp poly(A) tail (see “Experimental Procedures”). These constructs (Fig. 4A) were transcribed in vitro in the presence of the m7G cap analog, and the resulting trans"

In gastric epithelia, AE2 is particularly abundant in parietal cells, where it may be the predominant mechanism for HCO3− efflux and Cl- influx across the basolateral membrane that is needed for acid secretion. To investigate the hypothesis that AE2 is critical for parietal cell function and to assess its importance in other tissues, homozygous null mutant (AE2-/-) mice were prepared by targeted disruption of the AE2 (Slc4a2) gene. AE2-/- mice were emaciated, edentulous (toothless), and exhibited severe growth retardation, and most of them died around the time of weaning. AE2-/- mice exhibited achlorhydria, and histological studies revealed abnormalities of the gastric epithelium, including moderate dilation of the gastric gland lumens and a reduction in the number of parietal cells. There was little evidence, however, that parietal cell viability was impaired. Ultrastructural analysis of AE2-/- gastric mucosa revealed abnormal parietal cell structure, with severely impaired development of secretory canaliculi and few tubulovesicles but normal apical microvilli.

For the AE2 Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, alternative promoters in the Slc4a2 gene give rise to mRNAs encoding four NH2-terminal protein variants (1Medina J.F. Lecanda J. Acin A. Ciesielczyk P. Prieto J.

The ubiquitous distribution of AE2a and the tissue- and cell type-specific expression of the other NH2-terminal variants suggest that AE2 serves both housekeeping and tissue-specific functions.One of the most striking examples of a tissue-specific physiological process that requires high levels of Cl−/HCO3− exchange is gastric acid secretion. During acid secretion, the combined activities of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase, a Cl- channel, and a K+ channel at the apical and canalicular membranes of parietal cells mediate the secretion of HCl and KCl (6Allen A. Flemstrom G. Garner A. Kivilaakso E. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 823-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Along with the generation of H+ for secretion, intracellular carbonic anhydrase activity produces HCO3− ions, which are extruded across the basolateral membrane by the activity of one or more Cl−/HCO3− exchangers (7Parkkila S. Parkkila A.K. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1996; 31: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Flemstrom G. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Cl−/HCO3− exchange also serves as a Cl- uptake pathway across the basolateral membrane to support Cl- secretion through the apical membrane Cl- channels (8Flemstrom G. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar, 9Paradiso A.M. Townsley M.C. Wenzl E. Machen T.E. Am. J.

Although it has been suggested that the NKCC1 Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter may provide a Cl- uptake pathway that is essential for acid secretion (16Soybel D.I. Gullans S.R. Maxwell F. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C242-C249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), studies using NKCC1 null mutant mice showed that the loss of NKCC1 did not reduce gastric acid secretion (17Flagella M. Clarke L.L. Miller M.L. Erway L.C. Giannella R.A. Andringa A. Gawenis L.R. Kramer J. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Yamoah E.N. Cardell E.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26946-26955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).Together, these observations support the hypothesis that basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchange mediated by AE2 is critical for HCl secretion. However, recent studies have shown that two Cl−/HCO3− exchangers of the Slc26a family, Slc26a6 (also termed PAT-1 or CFEX (Ref. 18Jiang Z. Grichtchenko I.I. Boron W.F. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33963-33967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)) and Slc26a7, are expressed in parietal cells (19Petrovic S. Wang Z. Ma L. Seidler U. Forte J.G. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1207-G1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1093-G1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the Slc26a6 Cl−/HCO3− exchanger is present in tubulovesicles (19Petrovic S. Wang Z. Ma L. Seidler U. Forte J.G. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1207-G1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and therefore cannot mediate basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchange, Slc26a7 has been localized to the basolateral membrane (20Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H. Kere J. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1093-G1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether AE2 alone mediates the basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchange that is thought to be essential for acid secretion, or whether the activity of Slc26a7 can support a significant level of acid secretion. To understand the role of AE2 in gastric acid secretion, we developed a mouse model carrying a targeted disruption of the Slc4a2 gene. Analyses of AE2 null mutant mice demonstrated that they were achlorhydric and that their gastric parietal cells failed to develop an extensive secretory canalicular membrane system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Targeting Construct and Generation of Mutant Mice— The targeting construct was prepared using the pMJKO vector (21Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and PCR-generated fragments of the mouse AE2 gene. A 2.8-kb genomic fragment spanning exons 8–14 (beginning at codon 352 of the AE2a transcription unit and ending at codon 702) was inserted into a cloning site 5′ to the promoter of the neo gene, and a 2.0-kb fragment spanning exons 17–23 (beginning at codon 859 and ending 13 nucleotides beyond codon 1237) was inserted between the 3′ end of the neo gene and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Targeting of ES cells, derived from 129S6/SvEv Tac (Taconic, Germantown, NY) mice, was performed as previously described (21Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). ES cells in which homologous recombination had occurred were identified by Southern blot analysis of BamHI-digested DNA using a 5′ probe spanning genomic sequences from exon 7 to exon 8 and then confirmed using a 3′ probe spanning genomic sequences from exon 17 to exon 21. Chimeric mice carrying the targeted ES cells were bred with wild-type Black Swiss females (Taconic), and studies were performed using mice of the mixed 129S6/SvEv and Black Swiss background.Measurement of Gastric pH and Acid/Base Equivalents—Gastric pH and the acid-base content of the gastric secretions were measured as previously described (21Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 min following subcutaneous injection of histamine (2 μg/g of body weight), mice were euthanized and the intact stomach was exposed via a midline laparotomy and clamped at the pyloric and gastroesophageal junctions prior to removal. The stomachs were immersed in 5 ml of oxygen-saturated normal saline solution at room temperature, opened along the lesser curvature, everted, and rinsed of their contents. The gastric contents were pelleted by centrifugation, and the pH and acid-base equivalents of the gastric secretions were determined. Data for the acid-base content of the gastric secretions were reported as microequivalents (μmol of H+ or OH−/HCO3− ions)/g wet stomach weight.Immunofluorescence—Stomachs from 18-day-old mice were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut and then deparaffinized and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanols for use with the anti-gastric H+,K+-ATPase antibody. For the anti-AE2 antibody, cryosections were prepared from stomach tissues following perfusion fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde. Slides were stained overnight at 4 °C with either rabbit anti-α-subunit of the porcine gastric H+,K+-ATPase (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse AE2 antibody (raised against amino acids 1224–1237, which are found in all variants). Tissues stained with the anti-H+,K+-ATPase antibody were incubated with secondary donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to Texas red fluorophore and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (22Spicer Z.

Tissues stained with the anti-AE2 antibody were incubated with secondary donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to Cy3 fluorophore (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) and analyzed by confocal laser immunofluorescence microscopy.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from tissues of 18-day-old mice using TRI Reagent according to the directions from the manufacturer (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). RNA (10 μg) was denatured with glyoxal, fractionated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Blots were analyzed using 32P-labeled cDNA probes specific for AE2 5′ of the neo insertion site (codons 461–765), AE2 3′ of the neo insertion site (codons 861–1237), gastric H+,K+-ATPase α and β subunits, Slc26A7 Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, intrinsic factor, pepsinogen, the neo gene product, and the L32 ribosomal subunit protein (as a loading control) (22Spicer Z.

Following autoradiography, bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager and densitometric analysis carried out using ImageQuant software version 5.1 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Band densities were normalized to the band density of L32 for each sample to control for differences in loading and the -fold change in expression relative to wild type determined.Western Blot Analysis of Gastric H+,K+-ATPase—Because of the small size of the stomach samples, whole tissue homogenates were used for Western blot analysis. Samples were powdered in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA,1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors (NaF, 50 mm; cantharidin, 20 ng/ml; Na3VO4, 0.1 mm) were added to the buffer just prior to use. Protein samples (20 μg/lane) were resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with both a mouse anti-gastric H+,K+-ATPase α subunit antibody (23Smolka A.J. Larsen K.A. Hammond C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) that recognizes Asp682–Leu688 (1:4000 dilution) and an anti-actin antibody (1:4000 dilution; Sigma), and then probed with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody. Chemiluminescence was developed using the SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). Autoradiography was performed and densitometric analysis was carried out using an HP scanner and ImageQuant software (version 5.1).Histology, Electron Microscopy, and Morphometry—Stomachs were fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin, and hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections were examined by light microscopy. For electron microscopy, stomachs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, embedded in Spurr's resin, and sectioned. Morphometric analysis of the gastric glandular epithelium was performed as previously described (21Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M.C. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Spicer Z. Miller M.L. Andringa A. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T.

The criteria for enteroendocrine cells were cells with a visible nucleus and a small amount of very pale cytoplasm. Chief cells were identified as having a profile of nucleus, basophilic cytoplasm (rough endoplasmic reticulum), and a minimum of three birefringent granules, which differed from previous studies that used a minimum of six birefringent granules (22Spicer Z.

The criteria for parietal cells were cells containing a nuclear profile and less dense cytoplasm that were predominantly large and exhibited well organized mitochondria distributed around canaliculi and tubulovesicles. Mucous cells were defined as cells with a nuclear profile, and either a cap of mucous granules or apical granules. Cells not fulfilling the criteria of any of these categories were classified as “other.”Statistics—Data from two treatment groups were compared using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test assuming equal variances. Data from more than two treatment groups were compared using a one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey's t test. Morphometric data were analyzed using the General Linear Model of SAS (version 8; SAS, Cary, NC). A probability value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All values are reported as the mean ± S.E.RESULTSGeneration of AE2 Null Mutant Mice—The targeting procedure replaced sequences from exons 14 to 17, which are present in the transcripts of all known AE2 variants, with the neomycin resistance (neo) gene (Fig. 1A). Chimeric male mice generated using the targeted ES cells were bred to wild-type females to produce AE2 heterozygous mutant mice, and breeding of AE2+/- mice resulted in live offspring of all three genotypes (Fig. 1B). Because the neo gene was inserted in the same orientation as the AE2 transcription units, we anticipated that any transcripts from the mutant allele would utilize the neo gene polyadenylation site, thereby eliminating codons 703–1237, which encode the transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis using an AE2 cDNA probe consisting of sequences 3′ to the neo gene insertion site demonstrated that the wild-type AE2 mRNAs were ablated in AE2-/- mice (Fig. 1C, top panel). However, an AE2 probe derived from sequences 5′ to the insertion site of the neo gene identified an mRNA in AE2-/- tissues that was consistent in size with that of AE2a and AE2b mRNAs (Fig. 1C, second panel); also, a transcript similar in size to that of the stomach-specific AE2c mRNA was observed at trace levels. This suggested that mutant transcripts consisting of the 5′ end of the AE2 mRNA and the neo gene were being expressed. Hybridization analysis confirmed that the mutant AE2 mRNAs do contain the neo gene (Fig. 1C, third panel).Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the mutant mRNAs lacked sequences encoding the transmembrane-spanning regions of the protein, which are required for anion transport activity. To confirm the absence of AE2 protein in the AE2-/- gastric mucosa, immunofluorescence studies were performed using an antibody that recognizes the AE2 carboxyl terminus, which is present in all AE2 protein variants. In contrast to the robust staining of basolateral membranes in AE2+/+ parietal cells, AE2 expression was not detected in the knockout (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Immunostaining of AE2 in gastric mucosa of AE2+/+ and AE2-/- mice.

Among 697 pups, there were 213 wild-type (30.5%), 409 heterozygous (58.5%), and 75 knockout (11%) mice. Among the null mutant mice observed at birth, there was no substantial alteration in the percentage of males (45%) or females (55%). On the day of birth, ∼20% of the AE2-/- pups were found dead and ∼25% of the live AE2-/- mice were notably smaller than their AE2+/+ and AE2+/- littermates. During the first 10 days of life, the remaining AE2-/- mice exhibited little evidence of a disease phenotype other than mild growth retardation, and fed well, as indicated by milk in the stomach. Between 10 and 15 days of age, AE2-/- mice exhibited a progressive decline relative to AE2+/+ and AE2+/- littermates. During this period, AE2-/- mice stopped feeding well, exhibited severe growth retardation (Fig. 3A), became emaciated, and showed evidence of dehydration (skin tenting). AE2-/- mice also became mildly ataxic and exhibited a failure of both molar and incisor tooth eruption (Fig. 3B). After 15 days of age, AE2-/- mice exhibited high morbidity and mortality, with the oldest AE2-/- mouse surviving to only 40 days of age (Fig. 3C). In addition to these defects, the mutants had a severe hearing loss and defective development of bone. 2L. R. Gawenis, M. L. Miller, and G. E. Shull, unpublished observations. Providing powdered rodent chow to the toothless AE2-/- mice did not improve their growth or survival.Fig. 3Gross phenotype of AE2 null mutant mice.

B, in contrast to gender-matched AE2+/+ littermates, AE2-/- mice lack incisor tooth eruption. C, survival curve for AE2+/+ (n = 126) and AE2-/- (n = 33) mice. The percentage of surviving mice was plotted against age in days, with day 0 being the day of birth.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Gastric Achlorhydria in AE2 Null Mutant Mice—To test the hypothesis that AE2 is necessary for gastric acid secretion, the pH and acid-base content of gastric secretions were analyzed in AE2+/+, AE2+/-, and AE2-/- mice following treatment with histamine to stimulate acid secretion. Because of the poor survival, these studies and the histological studies described below were performed using 18–19-day-old mice. The pH of gastric secretions was 7.83 ± 0.11 in AE2-/- mice, 3.73 ± 0.38 in AE2+/- mice, and 3.73 ± 0.14 in AE2+/+ mice (Fig. 4A). The amount of net acid or base in the gastric secretions of the same animals was quantified by titrating the pH of the gastric contents using HCl or NaOH (Fig. 4B). The amount of base was 8.8 ± 1.6 μeq/g wet weight in AE2-/- stomachs; the amount of acid was 68.9 ± 4.5 μeq/g wet weight in AE2+/- stomachs and 62.1 ± 5.0 μeq/g wet weight in AE2+/+ stomachs.Fig. 4Gastric pH and acid-base microequivalents in AE2+/+, AE2+/-, and AE2-/- stomachs.

O'Neill L.A.J. Science's STKE. 2003; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/171/re3)Google Scholar). A total of 10 TLRs have been identified from the human genome. They recognize conserved molecular patterns in pathogenic microbial organisms, and this recognition is indispensable for the activation of the innate immune systems as well as the adaptive immune systems in vertebrates (2Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Google Scholar, 3Anderson K.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 13-19Google Scholar). Ten different IL-1Rs are present in the human genome. IL-1R type I (IL-1RI) and IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) mediate the pleiotropic effects of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1, whereas IL-18R and AcPL function as receptors for the IL-18 cytokine (4Sims J.E.

As their names imply, IL-1RI and IL-18R have high affinities for their ligands, whereas the accessory proteins (IL-1RAcP and AcPL) cannot bind the ligand directly. The TLRs and IL-1Rs have entirely different extracellular domains. The TLRs contain many copies of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR), whereas the IL-1Rs contain three copies of the Ig-like domains. However, these two families of receptors share a conserved intracellular domain, known as the Toll/interleu-kin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. This domain is also present in several cytoplasmic molecules, such as MyD88, TIRAP/MAL, TRIF/TICAM, and TIRP/TRAM, which function as signal adapters for these receptors (5O'Neill L.A.J. Fitzgerald K.A. Bowie A.G. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 286-289Google Scholar). TIR domains contain 150–200 amino acid residues, and their sequences are weakly conserved among the TLRs, IL-1Rs, and the adapter molecules (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequence identity between any pair of TIR domains is generally about 25%. The authenticity and integrity of this domain is crucial for the functions of these receptors. For example, a single-site mutation (Pro-712 → His, also known as the Lpsd mutation) in the TIR domain of TLR4 renders mice unresponsive to lipopolysac-charide, the cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria (6Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Google Scholar). This Pro residue is conserved in many of the TIR domains (Fig. 1), and the mutation of this residue to His in these other proteins generally produces dominant negative molecules. IL-1RAPL (IL-1R accessory protein-like) was identified from patients suffering from nonspecific X-linked mental retardation (MRX) (7Carrie A. Jun L. Bienvenu T. Vinet M.-C. McDonell N. Couvert P. Zemni R. Cardona A. Buggenhout G.V. Frints S. Hamel B. Moraine C. Ropers H.H. Strom T. Howell G.R. Whittaker A. Ross M.T. Kahn A. Fryns J.-P. Beldjord C. Marynen P. Chelly J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 25-31Google Scholar). Non-overlapping deletions as well as a nonsense mutation in the intracellular domain of this receptor are found in MRX patients. The exact function of this receptor is currently not known. It is highly expressed in postnatal brain structures that are important for memory and learning. IL-1RAPL was independently characterized from homology searches in the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base, which also found TIGIRR (three immunoglobulin domain-containing IL-1 receptor-related) as its close homolog (8Born T.L. Smith D.E. Garka K.E. Renshaw B.R. Bertles J.S. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29946-29954Google Scholar). The TIR domains of IL-RAPL and TIGIRR share 72% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1). Like the other IL-1Rs, these two receptors contain a TIR domain in their intracellular region. However, they also contain a 130-residue segment C-terminal to the TIR domain, which is absent in most of the other TLRs and IL-1Rs. Recent studies suggest that residues in this C-terminal segment of IL-1RAPL may interact with neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), and IL-1RAPL may have a role in regulating exocytosis of secretory and neurotransmitter substances (9Bahi N. Friocourt G. Carrie A. Graham M.E. Weiss J.L. Chafey P. Fauchereau F. Burgoyne R.D. Chelly J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1415-1425Google Scholar). NCS-1 is up-regulated in schizophrenic and bipolar patients (10Koh P.O. Undie A.S. Kabbani N. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Lidow M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 313-317Google Scholar). We have recently reported the crystal structures of the TIR domains of human TLR1 and TLR2 (11Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Google Scholar, 12Tao X. Xu Y. Zheng Y. Beg A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 216-221Google Scholar). The structures contain a central five-stranded fully parallel β-sheet, which is surrounded by α-helices on both faces. A loop in the structure, known as the BB loop, forms a prominent feature on the surface of the domain and corresponds to a region of significant sequence conservation among the TIR domains (Fig. 1). The Lpsd mutation of TLR4 is located at the very tip of this loop, confirming the functional importance of the BB loop. The TIR domains of TLR1 and TLR2 share 50% sequence identity, but there are clear structural differences between them. The sequences of the TIR domains of the IL-1Rs are significantly more divergent from those of TLR1 and TLR2 (Fig. 1). We report here the crystal structure of the TIR domain of human IL-1RAPL at 2.3-Å resolution, the first structure from the IL-1R superfamily. The TIR domain has the same overall fold, but there are significant differences to the structures of the TIR domain of the TLRs. The crystal structure also reveals a dimeric association of TIR domains, which may be important for the functions of this receptor. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The TIR domain of human IL-1RAPL (residues 403–563) was subcloned into the pET26b vector (Novagen) and overexpressed in Escherichia coli at 20 °C. The recombinant protein contains a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus. After cell lysis, the soluble protein was purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography and anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol and stored at -80 °C. The C-terminal His tag was not removed for crystallization. For the production of selenomethionyl proteins, the expression construct was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli DL41(DE3) cells. Bacterial growth was carried out in defined LeMaster media (13Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Google Scholar), and the protein was purified using the same protocol as for the wild-type protein. Protein Crystallization—Crystals of the TIR domain were prepared by the vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. Initial crystallization conditions for the protein were identified by sparse matrix screening with commercial kits (Hampton Research). The reservoir solution contained 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The crystals were cryo-protected with the reservoir solution supplemented with 35% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid propane for data collection at 100 K. Data Collection and Processing—A selenomethionyl multiwave-length anomalous diffraction (MAD) data set to 2.3-Å resolution was collected on an ADSC CCD at the X4A beamline at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Three wavelengths were used: 0.9793 Å (edge), 0.9792 Å (peak), and 0.9200 Å (high energy remote). The diffraction images were processed and scaled with the HKL package (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the space group P212121, with unit cell parameters of a = 52.0 Å, b = 53.3 Å, and c = 183.2 Å. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, giving a Vmax of 3.1 Å3/dalton. The data processing statistics are summarized in Table I.Table ISummary of crystallographic informationMaximum resolution (Å)2.3Number of observations150,158Rmerge (%)aRmerge = Σh Σi |Ihi - 〈Ih〉|/Σh Σi Ihi.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1872-1877Google Scholar), which also phased all the reflections up to 2.3-Å resolution. After phase improvement by solvent flattening, automatic chain tracing located 70% of the residues in the two molecules. Additional residues were manually built into the electron density with the program O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The structure refinement was carried out with the program CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The statistics on the structure refinement are summarized in Table I. Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293 were seeded (105 cells/ml) onto 96-well plates 24 h before transfection with 80 ng of Gal-luciferase (Path-Detect trans-reporting system, Stratagene), 40 ng of Renilla luciferase, 2 ng of c-jun, and the indicated amount of IL-1RAPL- or TIGIRR-expressing plasmid (220 ng total) using Genejuice (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The amount of DNA transfected was kept constant by the addition of various amounts of the appropriate empty vector plasmid. 16 h post-transfection, cells were lysed for 15 min at room temperature with 50 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). After this, 50% of the supernatant was used to determine firefly luciferase activity, and an equivalent amount was used for Renilla luciferase activity. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was assayed using standard protocols. Levels of firefly luciferase expression were normalized against Renilla activity as a control for transfection efficiency and expressed as -fold stimulation over the unstimulated empty vector control. The deletion mutants of IL-1RAPL were created by introducing stop codons at desired positions in the gene with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The Structure Determination—The crystal structure of the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain of human IL-1RAPL has been determined at 2.3-Å resolution by the selenomethionyl MAD method (Table I) (18Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Google Scholar). The positions of the selenium atoms as well as the phases of all observed reflections were determined with the MAD data (15Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1872-1877Google Scholar), which allowed the automatic placement of roughly 70% of the residues of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The current atomic model has good agreement with the observed x-ray diffraction data, with an R factor of 22.9%. The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation in bond lengths is 0.006 Å, and that in bond angles is 1.2°. A total of 89.6% of the residues is in the most favored regions, and the remaining 10.4% of the residues is in the additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The expression construct covers residues 403–563 of IL-1RAPL, which misses the first 20 residues of the intracellular region of the receptor as well as the 130-residue segment at the C terminus that is present in this receptor and TIGIRR. The current atomic model contains residues 403–415, residues 423–561 for one molecule, and residues 403–414 and 423–561 for the other molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The atomic coordinates have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1T3G). Large Conformational Differences to the Structures of TLR TIR Domains—This is the first structure of a TIR domain from the IL-1R superfamily of receptors. The structure of the TIR domain of human IL-1RAPL contains a central five-stranded fully parallel β-sheet, which is surrounded by helices on both sides (Fig. 2A). The overall backbone fold of this structure is the same as that of the TIR domain of human TLR1 and TLR2 that we reported earlier (11Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Google Scholar). The r.m.s. distance for 99 equivalent C-α atoms between the TIR domains of IL-1RAPL and TLR1 is 1.4 Å, with the residues in the β-sheet having the highest structural conservation (Fig. 2B). However, there are significant differences in the conformations of the TIR domains of TLR1 and IL-1RAPL. This supports the idea that the TIR domains have large degrees of conformational variability, which may be important for ensuring specificity in signal transduction by these receptors (11Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Google Scholar). For the β-sheet, strand βE in IL-1RAPL is longer at the N-terminal end than strand βE in TLR1 (Fig. 2B). The largest differences between the two structures are seen in some of their helices. On one face of the β-sheet, the axis of helix αD in IL-1RAPL is oriented almost perpendicularly to that of the αD helix in TLR1 and TLR2 (Fig. 2B). On the other face of the β-sheet, the beginning of the αA helix has different conformations in the two structures. This may be related to the fact that IL-1RAPL has an insertion between βA and αA (Fig. 1). Although most of the residues in this inserted segment are disordered in the current structure, they may have affected the positioning of the beginning of the αA helix. Structural differences are also observed for the CD and EE loops between the two TIR domains (Fig. 2B). Another structural difference between IL-1RAPL and TLR1 is in the crossover from βC to βD. In the TIR domain of TLR1 and TLR2, two short helices (αC and αC′) were observed, followed by a highly disordered region. In IL-1RAPL, however, the two short helices are followed by a third, well ordered helix (αC′) (Fig. 2A). The conformations of the αC and αC′ helices are also different between IL-1RAPL and TLR1 (Fig. 2B). The observed structural differences may affect how these TIR domains form homo- or hetero-oligomers during signal transduction (see below). The TIR domains from the IL-1Rs contain a highly conserved DGK motif at its N terminus (Fig. 1), with the Lys residue corresponding to the first residue (403) in our expression construct for IL-1RAPL. This Lys residue is fully exposed to the solvent and has weak electron density in our structure. To determine the conformation of this entire segment, we produced additional IL-1RAPL constructs, extending the N terminus. One of these constructs (covering residues 395–584) produced soluble protein, which enabled the preparation of small, weakly diffracting crystals. An x-ray diffraction data set to 2.3-Å resolution was collected, and the subsequent crystallo-graphic analysis showed that the DGK motif at the N terminus is disordered in this longer construct. This construct also contains 20 additional residues at the C terminus, but they are disordered in the structure as well. Conformational Differences in the BB Loop—The BB loop contains about 10 residues and links strand βB and helix αB in the structures of TIR domains (11Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Google Scholar). Several residues in this loop are highly conserved among the TIR domains, including an Arg residue at the third position (the BB3 residue), Asp at BB4, Pro at BB7 (the Lpsd mutation site), and Gly at BB8. These residues are in a motif RDΦΦPG, where Φ is generally a hydrophobic residue in the TIR domains. The structures of the TIR domains of TLR1 and TLR2 showed that the Arg residue at the BB3 position is involved in an ion pair interaction with a conserved Glu residue near the end of helix αA(αA13 residue). This interaction is also observed in the TIR domain of IL-1RAPL, and the BB4 Asp residue also pairs ions with the BB3 Arg residue (Fig. 3). Farther down the BB loop, large differences are observed both in the positions of the main chain and the conformations of the side chain between the TIR domains of IL-1RAPL and TLR1 (Fig. 3). The position of helix αB is also different between the two structures. The side chain of the BB5 residue is pointed into the solvent in the TLR1 TIR domain, whereas it is buried in the IL-1RAPL structure. The positions of the BB7 residues in the two structures are separated by a distance of about 5 Å. At the BB8 position, IL-1RAPL has a Thr residue, whereas most other TIR domains have a Gly (Fig. 1). The side chain of this Thr residue lies on the surface of the domain, hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of the Thr residue at the BB10 position (Fig. 3), which is unique to IL-1RAPL and TIGIRR (Fig. 1). A Dimer of the TIR Domain of IL-1RAPL in the Crystal— Biological studies suggest that TIR domains may function through homotypic interactions. Upon receptor activation the TIR domains of the receptors may form a complex that can in turn recruit the downstream adapter molecules (MyD88, MAL, and TRIF) through interactions among their TIR domains. Our studies with purified TIR domains, however, showed that the intrinsic affinity of the TIR domains for self-association is generally rather low. Most of the TIR domains that we have purified behave as monomers in solution, even at 1 mg/ml (50 μm) concentration. Gel filtration and light scattering studies showed that the TIR domain of IL-1RAPL is also monomeric in solution. 2J. A. Khan and L. Tong, unpublished data. In the crystal of the TIR domain of IL-1RAPL, there are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by a non-crystallo-graphic 2-fold symmetry axis (Fig. 4A). Unexpectedly, the two monomers share an extensive contact interface in this dimer, with each monomer contributing about 1000 Å2 of surface area. The two monomers are arranged such that the helices on one face of the β-sheet (αB, αC, αC′, αC′, and αD) in one monomer interact with their equivalents in the other monomer, whereas helices on the other face (αA and αE) are not involved in this interface (Fig. 1). At the interior of this interface is the contact among helices αC, αC′, and αC′ in one monomer with their equivalents in the other (Fig. 4B). Leu-492 in helix αC′ is completely shielded from the solvent by this contact, contributing 125 Å2 of buried surface area. The side chain of this residue is pointed toward the αD helix in the other monomer, interacting with Ala-526′ and Thr-530′ (primed residue numbers indicate the other monomer), as well as Trp-487′ in the loop between helices αC and αC′. Three Arg residues, 484, 485, and 497, are located next to the 2-fold axis of the dimer and contribute 195 Å2 total to the surface area burial. In addition, Arg-485 and Arg-497 are involved in ion pair interactions with residues Glu-523 and Glu-491, respectively, from the same monomer of the dimer. The BB loops of the two monomers are located at the edges of the dimer interface. Together with residues in helix αB, they contact the αD helix of the other monomer, contributing 165 Å2 total to the surface area burial. This TIR Domain Dimer May Be Unique to IL-1RAPL—The detailed interactions between the two monomers in the dimer of IL-1RAPL appear to be unique to this receptor and possibly its close homolog TIGIRR, as many of the residues in this interface are conserved only in these two receptors (Fig. 1). For example, none of the three Arg residues (484, 485, 497) in the IL-1RAPL dimer interface is conserved in the other TIR domains (Fig. 1). In addition Glu-523, the ion pair partner for Arg-485, is not conserved. This unique dimer interface is consistent with the distinct functional properties of these two receptors (see below) (8Born T.L. Smith D.E. Garka K.E. Renshaw B.R. Bertles J.S. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29946-29954Google Scholar). At the center of the dimer interface is the Ser-488 residue in helix αC′ (Fig. 4A). It is situated right next to the 2-fold axis of the dimer such that it forms a tight hydrogen bond with its equivalent, Ser-488′, in the other monomer. Interestingly, a close contact for the equivalent residue of Ser-488 in TLR1, Cys-707, was observed in the crystal structure of that TIR domain (11Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, Cys-707 forms a disulfide bond with Cys-707′ in the other monomer of a dimer (Fig. 5). As a result of this disulfide link, the observed dimer interface in the TIR domain of TLR1 was thought to be biologically irrelevant (11Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Google Scholar, 12Tao X. Xu Y. Zheng Y. Beg A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 216-221Google Scholar). However, the current structure of the IL-1RAPL TIR domain suggests that close contact of this residue in the dimer interface could be functionally relevant. This is supported by our observation that mutation of the equivalent Cys residue in TLR2 abolished receptor function (12Tao X. Xu Y. Zheng Y. Beg A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 216-221Google Scholar). The dimers of the TIR domains of IL-1RAPL and TLR1 are rather different. This is likely due in large part to the significant change in the conformation of the αD helix between the two TIR domains. The dimer association observed for IL-1RAPL is impossible for the TLR1 TIR domain as it would cause steric clashes for the αD helix. A smaller surface area, about 600 Å2 for each monomer, is buried by the dimer of the TIR domain of TLR1 (Fig. 5). Functional Studies with IL-1RAPL—To assess the biological relevance of the structural information, we attempted functional studies with the IL-1RAPL receptor. Of special interest is the functional role of the dimer that is observed in the crystal. This can only be assessed using IL-1RAPL and possibly its close homolog TIGIRR as the dimer may not be present for the other receptors. Earlier studies have shown that IL-1RAPL and TIGIRR cannot activate the NFκB transcription factor (8Born T.L. Smith D.E. Garka K.E. Renshaw B.R. Bertles J.S. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29946-29954Google Scholar). Recent studies with another IL-1R family member, T1/ST2, showed that it can activate the MAP kinases ERK, p38, and JNK, even though it cannot activate NFκB (19Brint E.K. Fitzgerald K.A. Smith P. Coyle A.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.-C. Fallon P.G. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49205-49211Google Scholar). This led us to examine whether IL-1RAPL can also activate the MAP kinases. Our experimental data showed that this receptor can activate JNK (Fig. 6) but not the ERK and p38 MAP kinases, and our data also confirm that IL-1RAPL cannot activate NFκB under the conditions used (data not shown). It is possible that in the system studied here, a co-receptor not expressed in these cells may be needed for IL-1RAPL to activate NFκB. Further studies of this activation by IL-1RAPL suggest that it is independent of the TIR domain. Truncation mutants missing part of or even the entire TIR domain were found to be able to activate JNK to the same extent as the full-length receptor (Fig. 6). It is unlikely that this activation is an artifact, as TIGIRR cannot activate this signal, despite the strong sequence conservation. Moreover, the -fold stimulation by IL-1RAPL is more than twice that produced by MEKK (Fig. 6). IL-1RAPL may be able to activate JNK by recruiting other molecules through its extracellular domain where the sequence homology with TIGIRR is weaker. All the deletion mutants studied here contain a small intracellular segment just prior to the TIR domain (residues 379–403). However, it is probably unlikely for this segment to mediate the activation of JNK, as it shares significant homology with TIGIRR. Further studies are needed to assess the physiological relevance of this JNK activation by IL-1RAPL. In summary, we have determined the crystal structure of the TIR domain of human IL-1RAPL at 2.3-Å resolution. As the first structure of the TIR domain from the IL-1R superfamily of receptors, it shows significant differences to the structures of the TIR domains of TLR1 and TLR2 that we reported earlier. This is consistent with the idea that sequence and structural diversity among these domains is important for specificity in the signal transduction process. The unique structural features of the TIR domain in IL-1RAPL when compared with TLR1 and TLR2 may be the molecular basis for its inability to activate NFκB. The structural analyses reveal the presence of a dimer with a rather extensive interface in the crystals of this domain. The detailed interactions in this dimer appear to be unique to IL-1RAPL and possibly its close homolog TIGIRR, and therefore they cannot be studied using IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP. The assessment of the functional relevance of the observed dimer will have to await the development of a reporter assay for these two receptors. Structural observations of the TIR domains of IL-1RAPL and TLR1 suggest that residues in the αC′ helix, especially Ser-488/Cys-707, might be important for the function of TIR domains. This is supported by our studies showing that mutation of the equivalent Cys-713 residue in TLR2, even to Ser, abolished the function of the receptor (12Tao X. Xu Y. Zheng Y. Beg A. Tong L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 216-221Google Scholar). Sequence comparison among the TIR domains show that this residue is almost strictly conserved as Cys among the mammalian TLRs, but it is not conserved among the IL-1Rs and the adapter TIR domains (Fig. 1). The molecular mechanism of the functional requirement of a Cys residue at this position in the TLRs remains to be established. We thank Randy Abramowitz and Xiaochun Yang for setting up the X4A beamline, Gerwald Jogl, Hailong Zhang, and Xiao Tao for help with data collection at the synchrotron, and John Sims for providing the IL-1RAPL and TIGIRR plasmids and for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1974203897,"The activation and phosphorylation of Met, the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for hepatocyte growth factor, initiates the recruitment of multiple signaling proteins, one of which is c-Cbl, a ubiquitin-protein ligase. c-Cbl promotes ubiquitination and enhances the down-modulation of the Met receptor and other RTKs, targeting them for lysosomal sorting and subsequent degradation. The ubiquitination of Met by c-Cbl requires the direct interaction of the c-Cbl tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain with tyrosine 1003 in the Met juxtamembrane domain. Although a consensus for c-Cbl TKB domain binding has been established ((D/N)XpYXX(D/E0φ), this motif is not present in Met, suggesting that other c-Cbl TKB domain binding motifs may exist. By alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we have identified a DpYR motif including Tyr1003 as being important for the direct recruitment of the c-Cbl TKB domain and for ubiquitination of the Met receptor. The substitution of Tyr1003 with phenylalanine or substitution of either aspartate or arginine residues with alanine impairs c-Cbl-recruitment and ubiquitination of Met and results in the oncogenic activation of the Met receptor. We demonstrate that the TKB domain of Cbl-b, but not Cbl-3, binds to the Met receptor and requires an intact DpYR motif. Modeling studies suggest the presence of a salt bridge between the aspartate and arginine residues that would position pTyr1003 for binding to the c-Cbl TKB domain. The DpYR motif is conserved in other members of the Met RTK family but is not present in previously identified c-Cbl-binding proteins, identifying DpYR as a new binding motif for c-Cbl and Cbl-b.

The DpYR motif is conserved in other members of the Met RTK family but is not present in previously identified c-Cbl-binding proteins, identifying DpYR as a new binding motif for c-Cbl and Cbl-b. The Cbl family of proteins have been identified recently as ubiquitin-protein ligases that are involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; p, phospho; 4H, four-helix bundle; CSF, colony-stimulating factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SH2, Src homology 2; TKB, tyrosine kinase binding; WT, wild type; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.1The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; p, phospho; 4H, four-helix bundle; CSF, colony-stimulating factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SH2, Src homology 2; TKB, tyrosine kinase binding; WT, wild type; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.

The c-Cbl and Cbl-b genes are expressed ubiquitously with the highest levels of expression in hematopoietic tissues (3Langdon W.Y. Hyland C.D. Grumont R.J. Morse III, H.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5420-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Keane M.M. Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Mitchell J.A. Robbins K.C. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Cbl-3 mRNA is expressed mainly in organs rich in epithelium such as pancreas, liver, small intestine, colon, and placenta and is expressed at low levels in hematopoietic tissues (5Kim M. Tezuka T. Suziki Y. Sugano S. Hirai M. Yamamoto T. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Banerjee P. Cuello M. Penninger J. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3365-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Despite the lower levels of c-Cbl and Cbl-b proteins in epithelial tissues, the c-Cbl-deficient mice, in addition to having hematopoietic defects, develop mammary hyperplasias (7Murphy M.A. Schnall R.G.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4882Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar), signifying that c-Cbl is important for growth regulation of mammary epithelia.The conserved amino-terminal domain of Cbl proteins is composed of a tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and a RING finger domain, which are both required for ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. The TKB domain mediates the recruitment of Cbl proteins to the tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate, whereas the RING finger domain associates with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UbcH7) (8Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The presence of several binding sites for SH2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins within their carboxyl-terminal end confers to c-Cbl and Cbl-b the ability to function as adaptor proteins.The Cbl TKB domain interacts with phosphotyrosine residues located in protein tyrosine kinases such as ZAP-70, Syk, and Src and with residues located in RTKs such as EGFR, Met, and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor (1Tsygankov A.Y.

It is composed of a four-helix (4H) bundle, an EF-hand calcium binding domain, and a variant SH2 domain that together are able to bind to phosphotyrosine residues (11Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the c-Cbl TKB domain complexed to its binding site on ZAP-70 kinase reveals that a medium-sized hydrophobic residue (φ) at position pTyr+4 and an acid residue (Asp/Glu) at position pTyr+3 would constitute the primary and specific determining interactions (11Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition, an aspartate residue at position pTyr-2 forms a hydrogen bond. This is in accordance with a degenerate phosphopeptide library screen using the c-Cbl TKB domain as a bait, which revealed a preference for an aspartate or an asparagine residue at position pTyr-2 (12Lupher Jr., M.L.

The (D/N)XpYXX(D/E)φ sequence is found not only in the ZAP-70 kinase but also in other c-Cbl-binding proteins including the Syk kinase, the EGFR, and Sprouty adaptor proteins (12Lupher Jr., M.L.

The Met receptor is expressed primarily in epithelial and endothelial cells, and its activation leads to the loss of cell-cell adhesion and enhances cell migration and proliferation (17Furge K.A. Zhang Y.W. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5582-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The chronic activation of the Met receptor is associated with the genesis and the progression of multiple types of tumors including carcinomas, melanomas, and sarcomas (18Jeffers M. Rong S. Woude G.F. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The stimulation of the Met receptor with its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor, induces tyrosine phosphorylation and polyubiquitination and, ultimately, the degradation of the receptor (19Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.F.

Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that the c-Cbl ubiquitin-protein ligase is recruited to the Met receptor by two distinct mechanisms. The carboxyl-terminal region of c-Cbl can be recruited indirectly to Tyr1356 in the Met receptor via the Grb2 adaptor protein, whereas the TKB domain of c-Cbl associates directly to the juxtamembrane Tyr1003 in the Met receptor (10Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The latter interaction is required for full ubiquitination of the Met receptor. A Met receptor lacking the c-Cbl TKB domain binding site (Y1003F) has a prolonged half-life and is oncogenic in cell culture, identifying c-Cbl and ubiquitination as important negative regulators for this receptor (10Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Here, we have performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of amino acids surrounding Tyr1003 and have identified a DpYR motif as being essential for the recruitment of the c-Cbl/Cbl-b TKB domain to the Met receptor as well as receptor ubiquitination and down-regulation. Based on the c-Cbl·ZAP-70 complex crystal structure, we also propose a structural mechanism for the association of the Cbl TKB domain to the DpYR motif in the Met receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—Antibodies raised in rabbit against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of human Met were used (22Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Met pTyr1003 and pTyr1234-1235 phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Nivelles, Belgium). HA antibody was from BABCO (Richmond, CA). Anti-pTyr (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-c-Cbl (sc-170) and anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The HA-ubiquitin expression plasmid is described by Treier et al. (23Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar).Cell Culture, DNA Transfections, and Transformation Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. For transformation assays in Rat-1 fibroblasts, 4 × 105 cells were seeded in 60-mm plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS and transfected the next day with 2 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate method. After 12 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 2 days. The cells then were maintained in DMEM containing 5% FBS with the medium being changed every 3-4 days until the appearance of foci. For the generation of Rat-1 stable cell lines, the foci were obtained in the presence of 25 ng/ml CSF-1, picked, and expended in DMEM containing 10% FBS.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using CSF-Met (24Zhu H. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 359-366PubMed Google Scholar) in pMX-139 as a template. Asn998 was converted to Ala using the 5′-GAAATGGTTTCAGCTGAATCTGTAGAC-3′ primer.

Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and Dr. Vincent Ollendorff (26Courbard J.R.

The coupling of GST fusion proteins to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was performed at 4 °C for 1 h. The complexes were washed three times with TGH lysis buffer (50 mm. HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm. NaCl, 1.5 mm. MgCl2, 1 mm. EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing 1 mm. phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm. sodium vanadate and then incubated with cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C, washed four times with TGH lysis buffer, and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer.Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—293T cells were serum-starved in 0.1% FBS overnight and harvested in TGH lysis buffer. Lysates were incubated with the indicated antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Proteins collected on either protein A- or protein G-Sepharose were washed three times in TGH lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (27Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Maroun C.R. Lupher M. Band H. Langdon W. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3397-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To detect CSF-Met receptor ubiquitination in Rat-1 cell lines, cells were stimulated for 5 min with 500 μg/ml CSF-1 and lysed immediately in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.05% SDS, 50 mm. Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm. NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 25 mm. N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma), 1 mm. phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm. sodium vanadate.Far-Western Blotting—For far-Western analysis, the CSF-Met receptor was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of 293T whole cell lysates, resolved on an 8% SDS-page gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight in 20 mm. Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm. NaCl, and 1 mm. Na3VO4 containing 10% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 2, and then probed for 1 h at room temperature with 40 μg/ml of purified GST-Cbl-N proteins previously coupled to 1 μg of horseradish peroxidase-glutathione (g-6400, Sigma-Aldrich) (30 min, room temperature) in TBST (10 mm. Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm. NaCl, 2.5 mm. EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20). After four washes of 5 min each with TBST, the bound proteins were detected with an ECL detection kit (28Nollau P. Mayer B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).RESULTSMapping of the c-Cbl TKB Domain Binding Site in Met—By far-Western analysis and peptide competition experiments, we have shown that the c-Cbl TKB domain binds directly to the phosphorylated Tyr1003 in the Met receptor (10Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The sequence surrounding Tyr1003 differs from the identified c-Cbl TKB domain binding site in the ZAP-70, Syk kinase, and EGFR (Fig. 1A). To establish the molecular requirements for the association of the c-Cbl TKB domain to Tyr1003 in the Met receptor, we performed an alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the amino acid residues surrounding Tyr1003 (Asn998-Pro1008) (Fig. 1B). The mutant Met receptors were expressed to similar levels and, with the exception of Met Y1003F, were phosphorylated on Tyr1003 to similar levels as the WT Met receptor as detected using anti-phosphotyrosine 1003 serum. In addition, the mutant receptors all were phosphorylated comparably on the conserved twin tyrosine residues (Tyr1234-1235) located in the activation loop (Fig. 1C). These tyrosines are required for full activation of the Met kinase (29Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2019-2027PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the activation of the Met kinase and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr1003 are not altered detectably in the alanine substitution mutants.A DpYR Motif Is Required for Recruitment of the c-Cbl TKB Domain—To define the c-Cbl TKB domain binding site, the ability of each mutant to co-immunoprecipitate with an HA-tagged c-Cbl TKB domain protein was assessed following transient co-expression. As shown previously (10Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), the substitution of tyrosine 1003 in the Met receptor with a non-phosphorylatable phenylalanine residue abrogates the co-immunoprecipitation of Met with the c-Cbl TKB domain protein (Fig. 2A). In addition, the substitution of both Asp1002 and Arg1004 with alanine residues significantly reduces the ability of the c-Cbl TKB domain protein to co-immunoprecipitate with these mutant Met receptors (Fig. 2A), even if Tyr1003 is present and phosphorylated to similar levels as the WT Met receptor (Fig. 1C). All of the other Met alanine substitution mutants tested co-immunoprecipitate with the c-Cbl TKB domain protein to levels similar to the WT Met receptor (Fig. 2A). This indicates that Asp1002 and Arg1004 are required independently for co-immunoprecipitation with the c-Cbl TKB domain.Fig. 2Asp1002, Tyr1003, and Arg1004 residues are required for the direct binding of the c-Cbl TKB domain to the Met receptor. A, protein lysates from 293T cells transiently co-transfected with plasmids expressing HA-Cbl-TKB and CSF-Met WT (wt) or mutants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with HA antibodies. Membranes were immunoblotted with Met antibodies, stripped, and reprobed with HA antibodies. Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with Met antibodies. B, CSF-Met receptors were immunoprecipitated from 293T cells transfected with CSF-Met WT and mutants, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was immunoblotted then with purified GST-Cbl-TKB proteins conjugated to horseradish peroxidase-glutathione. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with Met antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To establish whether there is a requirement for residues Asp and Arg for the direct binding of the c-Cbl TKB domain, we performed a far-Western analysis using a GST-c-Cbl TKB domain fusion protein. Probing with GST-c-Cbl TKB conjugated to glutathione-horseradish peroxidase revealed the direct binding of the GST-c-Cbl TKB fusion protein to WT Met receptor and to Met alanine-scanning mutants with the exception of the D1002A, Y1003F, and R1004A Met receptor mutants (Fig. 2B). This finding indicates that, in addition to Tyr1003, the Asp and Arg residues also are required independently for the direct association of the Met receptor with the c-Cbl TKB domain, and together, these data demonstrate that the DpYR residues of the Met receptor form an alternative binding motif for the c-Cbl TKB domain.The DpYR Motif Is Required for the Recruitment of the Cbl-b TKB Domain—The TKB domain is well conserved throughout the Cbl protein family (2Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ability of the Cbl-b and Cbl-3 TKB domains to interact with the Met receptor. We performed in vitro binding assays using GST-TKB fusion proteins. When compared with the GST-c-Cbl TKB fusion protein, the GST-Cbl-b TKB fusion protein bound to levels similar to the Met receptor (Fig. 3A). Moreover, as observed for the c-Cbl TKB domain, the substitution of the aspartate or the arginine residue impairs the association of the Cbl-b TKB domain with the Met receptor (Fig. 3C). We did not detect the association of the GST-Cbl-3 TKB domain to the Met receptor under the same conditions (Fig. 3A), even though similar levels of GST fusion proteins were used (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3An intact DpYR motif in the Met receptor is required for its association with the Cbl-b TKB domain. A, protein lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected with vector alone or plasmids expressing CSF-Met WT (wt) or Y1003F were subjected to in vitro binding assays with GST, GST-c-Cbl-TKB, GST-Cbl-b-TKB, or GST-Cbl-3-TKB. The membrane was immunoblotted with Met antibodies. B, the amount of GST-Cbl-TKB fusion proteins used for the in vitro binding assays was determined by Coomassie Blue staining. C, 293T cells were transfected transiently with plasmids expressing CSF-Met WT or mutants. Cell lysates were subjected to in vitro binding assays with GST-c-Cbl-TKB and GST-Cbl-b-TKB followed by immunoblotting with Met antibodies. Whole cell lysates were resolved separately and immunoblotted with Met antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)An Intact DpYR Motif Is Required for Met Receptor Ubiquitination and Suppression of Transformation—We have demonstrated previously that the uncoupling of the c-Cbl TKB domain from the Met receptor by the Y1003F mutation strongly impairs the ubiquitination of the receptor and converts the receptor into a transforming protein (10Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the D1002A and R1004A mutations, which uncouple the c-Cbl TKB domain from the Met receptor, affect receptor ubiquitination and transforming activity. When co-expressed with c-Cbl, the D1002A and R1004A receptor mutants, similar to the Met Y1003F receptor mutant, are ubiquitinated to levels significantly less than the WT Met receptor and other alanine-scanning mutant receptors (Fig. 4A). The biological activity of the alanine-scanning mutant Met receptors was tested by examining their ability to induce the foci of transformed cells on confluent monolayers of Rat-1 fibroblasts. Consistent with their inability to recruit the c-Cbl TKB domain and their reduced ubiquitination, both the D1002A and R1004A mutants are able to transform Rat-1 fibroblast cells (Fig. 4, B and C), although the transforming activity of the Asp1002 receptor mutant was consistently less than that of the Y1003F or R1004A receptor mutants. In three independent experiments, the WT Met receptor and other alanine-scanning mutant receptors failed to induce foci (Fig. 4C). This finding demonstrates that, in addition to Tyr1003, the Asp1002 and Arg1004 residues are essential to suppress the transforming activity of the Met receptor.Fig. 4Mutation of the DpYR motif prevents Cbl-mediated Met receptor ubiquitination and promotes receptor-oncogenic activation. A, lysates from 293T cells co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin, c-Cbl, and CSF-Met WT (wt) or mutants were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with Met antibodies and immunoblotted with HA antibodies. The membrane then was stripped and reprobed with Met antibodies. Whole cell lysates (WCL) were immunoblotted with c-Cbl antibodies. B, Rat-1 fibroblast cells were transfected with either CSF-Met WT or mutants (2 μg of DNA/60-mm Petri dish) and grown in DMEM containing 5% FBS in the absence of ligand until there was an appearance of the foci (∼2 weeks). C, the graph represents the relative number of foci per dish from four different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further examine the role of the DpYR motif in Met receptor regulation, we established Rat-1 fibroblast cell lines expressing the WT Met receptor as well as V1001A, D1002A, Y1003F, and R1004A Met receptor mutants.

The steady-state protein levels of the D1002A, Y1003F, and R1004A Met receptor mutants were consistently higher than those of WT Met and Met V1001A receptors, and we were unable to generate cell lines with equal protein levels (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the base-line and ligand-induced phosphorylation of each mutant receptor reflects their protein levels and is elevated in D1002A, Y1003F, and R1004A receptor mutants (Fig. 5A). Ligand stimulation provokes robust ubiquitination of Met WT and Met V1001A, whereas ligand-induced ubiquitination of Met D1002A, Y1003F, and R1004A receptors was low or not detectable (Fig. 5, A and B). The low levels of ubiquitination in response to stimulation correlate with the higher transforming activity of the Y1003F and R1004A Met receptor mutants when compared with the Met D1002A receptor mutant (Figs. 4 and 5).Fig. 5Mutation of the DpYR motif abrogates ligand-induced ubiquitination of the Met receptor in stable cell lines. A, Rat-1 fibroblast cell lines expressing either Met WT (wt) or Met mutant receptors were stimulated for 5 min with CSF-1 and lysed immediately. The CSF-Met receptor proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP), resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred, to a nitrocellulose membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1969057315,"Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is the prototypical member of the genus Tombusvirus in the family Tombusviridae. The (+)-strand RNA genome of TBSV lacks both a 5′ cap and a 3′ poly(A) tail and instead contains a 3′-terminal RNA sequence that acts as a cap-independent translational enhancer (3′ CITE). In this study, we have determined the RNA secondary structure of the translation-specific central segment of the 3′ CITE, termed region 3.5 (R3.5). MFOLD structural modeling combined with solution structure mapping and comparative sequence analysis indicate that R3.5 adopts a branched structure that contains three major helices. Deletion and substitution studies revealed that two of these extended stem-loop (SL) structures are essential for 3′ CITE activity in vivo. In particular, the terminal loop of one of these SLs, SL-B, was found to be critical for translation. Compensatory mutational analysis showed that SL-B functions by base pairing with another SL, SL3, in the 5′ untranslated region of the TBSV genome. Thus, efficient translation of TBSV mRNA in vivo requires a 5′-3′ RNA-RNA interaction that effectively circularizes the message. Similar types of interactions are also predicted to occur in TBSV subgenomic mRNAs between their 5′ untranslated regions and the 3′ CITE, and both genomic and subgenomic 5′-3′ interactions are well conserved in all members of the genus Tombusvirus. In addition, a survey of other genera in Tombusviridae revealed the potential for similar 5′-3′ RNA-RNA-based interactions in their viral mRNAs, suggesting that this mechanism extends throughout this large virus family.

In addition, a survey of other genera in Tombusviridae revealed the potential for similar 5′-3′ RNA-RNA-based interactions in their viral mRNAs, suggesting that this mechanism extends throughout this large virus family. One of the earliest steps in the reproductive cycle of (+)-strand RNA viruses is translation of their encoded proteins by the translational machinery of the host (1Bushell M. Sarnow P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 2Schneider R.J. Mohr I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 130-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, most cellular mRNAs contain both a 5′ cap and a 3′ poly(A) tail, and these terminal structures act synergistically to stimulate translation (3Bailey-Serres J. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 142-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Kawaguchi R. Bailey-Serres J. Curr. Opin.

This translational enhancement depends on a protein bridge formed between these two structures by eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding to the 5′ cap, poly(A)-binding protein binding to the poly(A) tail, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G binding simultaneously to both of these proteins (6Gallie D.R. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 949-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Assembly of this complex results in the formation of a closed loop (5Gallie D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and there is growing evidence that message circularization is a fundamental requirement for efficient translation of eukaryotic mRNAs (7Ling J.

Eukaryotic (+)-strand RNA viruses must either possess a 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tail or adopt alternative strategies that allow for efficient translation of their encoded viral proteins (1Bushell M.

In this regard, translationally active viral RNA genomes have been identified that do not contain one or both of these terminal mRNAs structures. Examples of the latter case include (+)-strand RNA genomes in the families Tombusviridae (11Russo M. Burgyan J. Martelli G.P. Adv.

For BYDV and STNV, it has been proposed that their TEs function to recruit the translational machinery of the host (25Guo L. Allen E. Miller W.A. RNA (N.Y.). 2000; 6: 1808-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26van Lipzig R. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Meulewaeter F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, the TEs of BYDV and STNV have been reported to interact in vitro with canonical translation initiation factors (10Guo L. Allen E.M. Miller W.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Gazo B.M. Murphy P.A. Gatchel J.R. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13584-13592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The recruitment of translation factors to a 3′-proximal TE would then require their subsequent delivery to the 5′ end of the viral mRNA, where initiation of translation occurs (10Guo L. Allen E.M. Miller W.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been shown that a 5′-3′ RNA-RNA interaction is required for efficient translation of BYDV mRNA, but not for STNV mRNA (10Guo L. Allen E.M. Miller W.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 28Meulewaeter F. Danthinne X. Van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Plant J. 1998; 14: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The BYDV interaction is formed by a kissing-loop structure involving an RNA hairpin in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome and another hairpin in the 3′ TE (10Guo L. Allen E.M. Miller W.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This interaction acts to circularize the message, as occurs in cellular mRNAs, and could potentially deliver translation factors to the 5′ end of the viral message (10Guo L. Allen E.M. Miller W.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is the prototypical member of the genus Tombusvirus in the family Tombusviridae (11Russo M. Burgyan J. Martelli G.P. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 44: 381-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Its 4.8-kb long (+)-strand RNA genome lacks both a 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tail and encodes five functional proteins (11Russo M. Burgyan J. Martelli G.P. Adv. Virus Res. 1994; 44: 381-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Hearne P.Q. Knorr D.A. Hillman B.I. Morris T.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The 5′-proximal p33 and its read through product p92 are translated directly from the genome and both are essential for viral RNA synthesis (20Oster S.K. Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 72: 5845-5851Crossref Google Scholar, 30Scholthof K.B. Scholthof H.B. Jackson A.O. Virology. 1995; 208: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The larger p92 is the viral RdRp, whereas p33 is a critical accessory replication protein. The more 3′-proximal ORFs, designated p41, p22, and p19, are translated from two subgenomic mRNAs that are 3′-coterminal with the genome and are transcribed during infections (Fig. 1) (31Zhang G. Slowinski V. White K.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Choi I.R. Ostrovsky M. Zhang G. White K.A. J. Biol.

Virology. 1990; 177: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), movement protein (34Scholthof H.B. Scholthof K.B. Kikkert M. Jackson A.O. Virology. 1995; 213: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the suppressor of gene silencing (35Qu F. Morris T.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Qiu W. Park J.W. Scholthof H.B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), respectively. Previously, we have shown that efficient cap- and poly(A) tail-independent translation of TBSV RNAs requires a 3′-terminal RNA sequence referred to as the 3′ cap-independent translational enhancer (3′ CITE) (20Oster S.K. Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 72: 5845-5851Crossref Google Scholar, 21Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8982-8988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′ CITE encompasses three contiguous regions (termed RIII, R3.5, and RIV) that correspond to ∼400 nucleotides (nt) of the 3′ end of the genome (Fig. 1). Interestingly, RIII and RIV are also important and essential, respectively, for viral RNA replication and are always present in TBSV-derived subviral replicons, termed defective interfering (DI) RNAs (37Ray D. White K.A. Virology. 1999; 256: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 38Ray D. White K.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Panavas T. Nagy P.D. J.

Fabian M.R. White K.A. Nagy P.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5602-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In contrast, the central R3.5 is dispensable for replication but essential for translation (20Oster S.K. Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 72: 5845-5851Crossref Google Scholar, 42White K.A. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 14-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Thus, R3.5 represents a translation-specific RNA element that requires flanking RIII and RIV for efficient activity in vivo (21Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8982-8988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we focused our attention on the translation-specific R3.5 in TBSV. Our results revealed that this region forms a well defined RNA secondary structure that is also conserved in other tombusviruses. Interestingly, R3.5-mediated translation of TBSV mRNAs was found to require a long distance RNA-RNA base pairing interaction between R3.5 and the 5′ UTR of the genome. This type of RNA-based mechanism may also be used by other genera in the family Tombusviridae. Plasmid Construction—Construction of a full-length TBSV genome, T-100, HS175, DI-83ΔII, and DI-72 have been described previously (20Oster S.K. Wu B. White K.A. J.

All mutant constructs described below were generated using DI-83ΔII and PCR-based oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis in combination with standard recombinant DNA cloning techniques. Each construct was sequenced across its entire PCR-derived segment. Mutant LB-UUCG construction involved replacement of a SalI/SphI fragment (4501–4766) in DI-83ΔII with the SalI/SphI-digested PCR product generated with primer pairs PMFr3.5LB-UUCG (5′-GGATGACGAGTCGACTCGGGCTCCGCACTAGGTTTCGGCCTAGAGGATGG) and P9 (5′-GGCGGCCCGCATGCCC-GGGCTGCATTTCTGCAATGTTCC). Mutant LC-UUCG was generated by replacing the BspEI/SphI fragment (994–4766) in DI-83ΔII with the BspEI-digested PCR product amplified with primer pairs 5′-BspEI (5′-GGCGCCGCGTCCGGATGGAGTGGAGGAGTCGGC) and PMF47 (5′-TTTCCATATCTCCATCCCCT) and the SphI-digested PCR product generated with primer pairs PMFr3.5LC-UUCG (5′-GGGTCTCGTGTGGTATCAGTCGGTCTTCGGACGCGCTTCC) and P9. Mutant ΔSL-B construction involved replacement of a BspEI/SphI fragment (994–4766) in DI-83ΔII with the BspEI-digested PCR product generated with primer pairs 5′-BspEI and PMF49 (5′-AGTCGACTCGTCATCCTAAC) and the SphI-digested PCR product generated with primer pairs PMF50 (5′-GGAAAGGGTCTCGTGTGGTA) and P9. Mutant ΔSL-C was generated by replacing the BspEI/SphI fragment (994–4766) in DI-83ΔII with the BspEI-digested PCR product amplified with primer pairs 5′-BspEI and PMF47 and the SphI-digested PCR product generated with primer pairs PMF48 (5′-GGTCGGATAAGTCTTAGCAA) and P9. Mutant ΔSL2/3 construction involved replacement of a BstXI/MfeI fragment (1–263) in DI-83ΔII with the BstXI/MfeI-digested PCR product generated with primer pairs PMFrIdSL2/3 (5′-CGCGCGCGCCAGTGAATTGGGCCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAAATTCTCCAGGTGACTTGCGC) and P46 (5′-CAGCACAATCAGTTTTGAGTAATTC). Mutant SL3-UUCG construction involved replacement of a BstXI/MfeI fragment (1–263) in DI-83ΔII with the BstXI/MfeI-digested PCR product generated with primer pairs PMFrImutSL3 (5′-CGCGCGCGCCAGTGAATTGGGCCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAAATTCTCCAGGATTTCTCGATTCGTCGTTTATCTGGTG) and P46. Mutant 5a was generated by replacing the BstXI/MfeI fragment (1–263) in DI-83ΔII with the BstXI/MfeI-digested PCR product amplified with primer pairs PMF5′-3′5A (5′-CGCGCGCGCCAGTGAATTGGGCCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAAATTCTCCAGGATTTCTCGATTTAGTTCGTTTATCTGGTG) and P46. Mutant 5b construction involved replacement of a SalI/SphI fragment (4501–4766) in DI-83ΔII with the SalI/SphI-digested PCR product generated with primer pairs PMF5′-3′5B (5′-GCGCGTCGACTCGGGCTCCGCACTAGGTTTAATCGCCTAGAGG) and P9. Mutant 5c construction involved replacement of the SalI/SphI fragment (4501–4766) of 5a with the SalI/SphI-digested fragment of 5b. Mutants PMa, PMb, and PMc construction were carried out as described above for the 5-series clones except that generation of PMa and PMb used primer pairs PMF5′-3′PMV/TBSV5′ (5′-CGCGCGCGCCAGTGAATTGGGCCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAAATTCTCCAGGATTTCTCGACTGCAATCGTTTATCTGGTG) and P46, and PMF5′-3′PMV/TBSV3′ (5′-GGATGACGAGTCGACTCGGGCTCCGCACTAGGTTTGCAGGCCTAGAGGATGG) and P9, respectively. Similarly, mutant Va, Vb, and Vc constructions were carried out as described above except that generation of Va and Vb used primer pairs vGOF#5 (5′-CGCGCGCGCCAGTGAATTGGGCCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAAATTCTCCAGGATTTCTCGAGGTTTGGTCGCCTCGTTTATCTGGTG) and P46, and pUC19-GOF#6 (5′-GGATGACGAGTCGACTCGGGCTCCGCACTACGACCTAGTTCGTAGGGGATGG) and P9, respectively. Computer-aided Analysis of Viral RNA—The nucleotide sequences for TBSV (NC_001554), TBSVs (AJ249740), TBSVp (U80935), AMCV (X62493), CBLV (AY163842), cymbidium ringspot virus (X15511), cucumber necrosis virus (M25270), carnation Italian ringspot virus (X85215), pear latent virus (AY100482), pelargonium necrotic spot virus (NC_005285), lettuce necrotic stunt virus (AJ288944), pothos latent virus (X87115), oat chlorotic stunt virus (NC_003633), pea stem necrosis virus (NC_004995), maize chlorotic mottle virus (NC_003627), TNV (M33002), PMV (NC_002598), SPMV (M17182), and RCNMV RNA-1 (NC_003756) were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank™ genetic sequence data base. RNA alignments were carried out using ClustalW (44Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56001) Google Scholar) and RNA secondary structures were predicted at 37 °C by using MFOLD version 3.1 (45Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M.

NATO ASI Series, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 11-43Crossref Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription—Viral RNA transcripts were generated in vitro using an AmpliScribe T7 transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies) with SmaI-digested DNA constructs as templates as described previously (42White K.A. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 14-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcript concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically and their integrity was confirmed via ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA Secondary Structure Probing—For in vitro analysis of RNA secondary structure, transcripts of DI-83ΔII (3 μg) were added with yeast RNA (3 μg) to modification buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA), equilibrated (95 °C for 2 min, 60 °C for 10 min, and 37 °C for 10 min), treated with RNA structure probing chemicals diethyl pyrocarbonate and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide or enzymes RNase V1 and RNase T1, and analyzed by primer extension using primers PMF37S (5′-GTATTGCTAAGACTTATCCG) and PMF38S (5′-GATCTCTATAGCCCCCCCGAAGGG) as described previously (47Wu B. Vanti W.B. White K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Isolation and Transfection of Protoplasts—Protoplasts were prepared from 6–8-day-old cucumber cotyledons (var. Straight 8) as described previously (42White K.A. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 14-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification was carried out by bright field microscopy using a hemacytometer. Purified protoplasts (∼3 × 105) were inoculated as described (42White K.A. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 14-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with viral RNA transcripts (1 μg for DI-72 transcripts and 5 μg each for HS175 and DI-83ΔII) and were incubated in a growth chamber under fluorescent lighting at 22 °C for the periods of time specified. Analysis of Viral RNA—Total nucleic acids were harvested from protoplasts as described previously (42White K.A. Morris T.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 14-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of the total nucleic acid were separated in 1.2% agarose gel. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and examined to ensure that the samples were not degraded and were loaded evenly. Viral RNAs were detected by electrophoretic transfer to nylon membrane followed by Northern blot analysis using a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to the 3′ terminus of the TBSV genome (P9). Quantification of the bound viral RNAs was performed by radioanalytical scanning of the blot using an InstantImager (Packard Instrument Co.). Stability assays were carried out as described above except that samples were harvested at different time intervals and the levels of DI-83ΔII or its mutant derivatives were quantified. RNA Secondary Structure of R3.5—The 3′ CITE is composed of three contiguous regions that were defined on the basis of their presence (RIII and RIV) or absence (R3.5) in prototypical TBSV DI RNAs (Fig. 1) (20Oster S.K. Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 72: 5845-5851Crossref Google Scholar). The RNA secondary structures of RIII and RIV have been defined previously, but that for R3.5 has not (38Ray D. White K.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 40Fabian M.R. Na H. Ray D. White K.A. Virology. 2003; 313: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the structure of R3.5, solution structure probing in vitro was performed and the results were plotted on the most stable MFOLD-predicted RNA secondary structure (45Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar, 46Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology. NATO ASI Series, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 11-43Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). There was a strong correlation between the reactivity of three different single-strand specific reagents (1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide, diethyl pyrocarbonate, and RNase T1) and residues predicted to be unpaired (Fig. 2B). Also, RNase V1, which has a substrate preference for base paired and stacked residues, cleaved within several of the predicted helical portions of R3.5. These data support the presence of three extended stems, termed S-A, SL-B, and SL-C, centered on a 3-helix junction (Fig. 2B). Results from comparative sequence analysis that included nine additional tombusvirus genomes were consistent with the secondary structure proposed (Fig. 3). With the exception of CBLV (which contained only SL-B), all maintained the basic Y-shaped structure defined for TBSV (Fig. 2B) and contained numerous mono- and covarying base pairs in each of the three major stems (Fig. 3). The terminal loop sequence of SL-B, 5′-UUGGUC, was also well conserved, except for CBLV, which had a 1-nt substitution in this sequence and pear latent virus that had an extra adenylate on either side (Fig. 3B). The SL-C-terminal loop, an ultra stable tetraloop 5′-GAAA in TBSV, was conserved in all but lettuce necrotic stunt virus, where it was replaced by a different ultra stable tetraloop, 5′-UUCG (48Molinaro M. Tinoco Jr., I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3056-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). Overall, these comparative data sets support the RNA secondary structure model proposed for TBSV R3.5 in which it adopts a well defined Y-shaped domain that includes two conserved terminal loops (Fig. 2B). SL-B and SL-C were of special interest as they could extend out from R3.5 and potentially interact with other factors. In particular, GNRA-type tetraloops (where N is any nucleotide and R is a purine), as found in SL-C, can interact with specific RNA receptors (49Jucker F.M. Heus H.A. Yip P.F. Moors E.H. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Similarly, terminal loops containing a U-turn motif (YUNR, where Y is a pyrimidine), such as that in SL-B, are commonly found in the terminal loops of regulatory RNAs that function by base pairing with their RNA targets (50Franch T. Gerdes K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the presence of these two motifs, both terminal loops represented good candidates for mediating functionally relevant RNA-RNA interactions. Sequences in R3.5 and the 5′ UTR Are Required for Efficient Translation in Vivo—To determine whether SL-B and/or SL-C were relevant to translation we used a trans-complementation translational assay system developed previously (Fig. 4A) (20Oster S.K. Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 72: 5845-5851Crossref Google Scholar, 21Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8982-8988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the viral mRNAs used in this system are uncapped and non-polyadenylated. In the assay the “test” mRNA, DI-83ΔII, contains the p33 ORF bordered by the TBSV 5′ UTR and 3′ CITE (Fig. 4A). This message is non-replicative (as it lacks RII, an essential replication element) and thus acts solely as an mRNA for p33 (21Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8982-8988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, use of this viral-based test message offers the advantage of limiting the possibility of mRNA misfolding, which is a concern when reporter mRNAs containing nonviral ORFs are used. In assays, DI-83ΔII (with either WT or modified 5′ UTRs and/or 3′ CITEs) is co-transfected into protoplasts along with the non-replicating HS175 mRNA (encoding the viral RdRp, p92) and a reporter DI RNA replicon, DI-72 (Fig. 4A). Both p33 and p92 are necessary for replication of DI-72 and the efficiency of p33 translation from the DI-83ΔII-based message modulates the accumulation of DI-72 (21Wu B. White K.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8982-8988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of DI-72 thus provides a sensitive and biologically relevant measure of the translational activity of DI-83ΔII-based mRNAs. As an initial step to investigate the structural features of R3.5 important for translation, targeted deletions and substitutions were introduced into SL-B or SL-C in DI-83ΔII (Fig. 4B). Following their co-transfection into cucumber protoplasts along with HS175 and DI-72, the accumulation of DI-72 was quantified by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4C). Complete deletion of either SL in mutants ΔSL-B and ΔSL-C resulted in extremely low levels of reporter DI RNA accumulation, indicating significant impairment of p33 translation (Fig. 4, B and C). Next, to investigate whether the terminal loops on these SLs were important, each was substituted with a UUCG tetraloop (Fig. 4B). In mutant LB-UUCG, the substitution greatly reduced reporter DI RNA accumulation (∼6% compared with WT), whereas in mutant LC-UUCG the modification led to notably increased levels (∼225%) (Fig. 4, B and C). The ability of SL-C to tolerate a terminal loop substitution is consistent with the sequence variation observed in lettuce necrotic stunt virus (Fig. 3C), whereas the critical nature of the terminal loop of SL-B is in agreement with its essentially invariant presence in all tombusviruses (Fig. 3B). Additionally, the result with LC-UUCG demonstrates that our assay system (using WT DI-83ΔII as the standard) is not “saturated” and is also capable of detecting increases in translational activity. These results indicate that SL-B and SL-C are critical for efficient translation of p33 and that their terminal loops contribute to their activities. The clear importance of the terminal loop of SL-B, along with the presence of a U-turn motif within this loop, prompted us to searc"

Full-Text PDF Open Access Liver is important for glucose and lipid metabolism, and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism are known to be mainly regulated by insulin. The typical action of insulin in liver is to increase glycolysis, glycogenesis, and lipogenesis. When glucose is delivered to the liver in large quantities it is converted to glycogen and stored. If the hepatic glycogen stores are repleted, glucose enters the glycolysis pathway to produce pyruvate for de novo lipogenesis, and the lipid is exported as very low density lipoprotein and stored as triacylglycerol in adipose tissue. Thus, the regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism is important in glucose homeostasis. Glucose is phosphorylated by glucokinase (GK) 1The abbreviations used are: GK, glucokinase; SRE, sterol regulatory element; SREBP, SRE-binding protein; ChIP assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. (ATP: d-hexose 6-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.1.1) to produce glucose-6-phosphate, which enters the glycolysis and glycogenesis pathway (1Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. Frontiers in Diabetes: Molecular Pathogenesis of MODYs. 15. Karger, Basel, Switzerland2000: 99-165Google Scholar). Because the Km of GK is considerably higher than that of normal blood concentrations and because GK is not subjected to allosteric regulation by the product, the rate of glucose phosphorylation is proportional to the blood glucose level. Therefore, GK is thought to be essential for the liver in sensing glucose and maintaining the metabolic function (2Ferre T. Riu E. Bosch F. Valera A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 3Niswender K.D. Shiota M. Postic C. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22570-22575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). GK is mainly expressed in liver, pancreatic β cells, and neuroendocrine cells of brain and gut. Two alternate promoters regulate the tissue-specific expression of GK in liver and pancreatic β cells (4Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream promoter regulates β cell-specific GK expression, and the downstream promoter controls liver-specific GK (LGK) expression. In the liver, GK expression is regulated in response to fasting and refeeding (5Iynedjian P.B. Pilot P.R. Nouspikel T. Milburn J.L. Quaade C. Hughes S. Ucla C. Newgard C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7838-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), with insulin and glucagon serving as the mediators of this response. Hepatic GK expression is reduced in the diabetic animal models with insulin deficiency and insulin resistance (6Iynedjian P.B. Gjinovci A. Renold A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 740-744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Michael M.D. Kulkarni R.N. Postic C. Previs S.F. Shulman G.I. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulates GK expression in primary hepatocytes regardless of glucose concentration, and glucagon inhibits GK expression (8Iynedjian P.B. Jotterand D. Nouspikel T. Asfari M. Pilot P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21824-21829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Magnuson M.A. Andreone T.L. Printz R.L. Koch S. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results indicate that insulin is a major activator of GK transcription. However, the cis-element in the LGK promoter that is responsible for insulin responsiveness has not yet been identified. Besides transcriptional regulation, hepatic GK activity can be regulated by the GK regulatory protein. At low glucose concentrations, the GK regulatory protein is associated with GK in the nucleus (10Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Acute glucose challenge induces dissociation of the GK-GK regulatory protein complex, and GK is then translocated into cytoplasm, resulting in increased GK activity (11Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Van Schaftingen E. Detheux M. Veiga da Cunha M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), also known as adipocyte determination and differentiation dependent factor 1 (ADD1), is a member of the SREBP family that regulates the transcription of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis (13Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3835) Google Scholar, 14Foufelle F. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). SREBPs are synthesized in a precursor form bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear membrane. After proteolytic cleavage, mature SREBPs enter the nucleus and activate the transcription of the target genes by binding to sterol response element (SRE) or E-box-like sequences. Three isoforms of SREBPs from two genes have been identified. SREBP-1a and -1c are encoded from a single gene but are different in their first exon due to alternative usage of the promoter. Because two isoforms of SREBP-1 have the same DNA binding domain, they recognize the same DNA element. However, transcriptional activity of SREBP-1a is stronger than that of SREBP-1c, because SREBP-1a has a longer acidic transactivation domain (15Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a is a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, whereas the roles of SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 are more restricted in that SREBP-1c preferentially activates genes required for fatty acid synthesis, and SREBP-2 activates genes for cholesterol synthesis. Among three isoforms of SREBPs, SREBP-1c is mainly expressed in liver and is regulated by nutritional status. Recently, SREBP-1c was suggested to be a transcription factor that mediates the action of insulin on GK transcription in liver (23Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 24Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism used by SREBP-1c to induce hepatic GK expression in response to insulin is not well characterized. Here, we identify SREs in the rat LGK promoter and present evidence that insulin increases the binding of SREBP-1c on the LGK promoter resulting in the increase of the LGK transcription. These results indicate that SREBP-1c is a transcription factor mediating the effects of insulin on the regulation of LGK gene expression. Plasmids—The luciferase reporter construct under the control of the rat LGK promoter pRGL-1448 was described earlier (16Kim H.I. Cha J.Y. Kim S.Y. Kim J.W. Roh K.J. Seong J.K. Lee N.T. Choi K.Y. Kim K.S. Ahn Y.H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 676-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). pRGL-593, pRGL-238, pRGL-161, pRGL-76, pRGL+4, and pRGL+55 were constructed by amplifying the rat LGK promoter regions of -593/+127, -238/+127, -161/+127, -76/+127, +4/+127, and +55/+127 and subcloning them into pGL3 basic vector, respectively. pRGL-1448ma, pRGL-1448mb, and pRGL-1448mab were produced by introducing a substitution mutation into pRGL-1448 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The SRE-truncated mutant pRGLΔab, the -210/-167 region of which was truncated from pRGL-1448, was constructed by PCR using a SRE-truncation primer (sense, 5′-TTCTTTAACCAGTCTCTCTCCACAGCAAGT-3′; antisense, 5′-ACTTGCTGTGGAGAGAGACTGGTTAAAGAA-3′). The expression plasmid of SREBP-2 (pCS2) and the preparation of recombinant SREBP-1 were described previously (17Moon Y.A. Lee J.J. Park S.W. Ahn Y.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30280-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids of SREBP-1c and the dominant negative mutant of SREBP-1c (SREBP-1cDN) were a kind gift from Drs. B. M. Spiegelman and J. B. Kim (18Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We subcloned SREBP-1c into pcDNA3 for experimental purposes. Animals and Diet—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were used for the experiments. Rats were fasted for 24 h and refed a fat-free high carbohydrate diet containing 82% (w/w) carbohydrates (74% starch, 8% sucrose), 18% (w/w) casein, 1% vitamin mix, and 4% (w/w) mineral mix. All components for the diet were purchased from Harlan Teklad Co. (Madison, WI). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assay—Alexander cells (American Type Culture Collection number CRL-8024) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (19Kim H.I. Kim J.W. Kim S.H. Cha J.Y. Kim K.S. Ahn Y.H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, Alexander cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish. On the following day, 500 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid and 50 ng of overexpression plasmid were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). To transfect a constant amount of DNA, sample DNAs were supplemented with control vector pcDNA3. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. Luciferase activities were normalized by protein concentration to adjust transfection efficiency. Normalized luciferase activities were shown as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments in triplicate and were expressed as fold increase relative to the basal activity of the reporters in the absence of overexpression vectors. Isolation of Total RNA, Northern Blot Analysis, and Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was extracted from liver and primary hepatocytes using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (19Kim H.I. Kim J.W. Kim S.H. Cha J.Y. Kim K.S. Ahn Y.H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was separated on 1% agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary transfer in 20× SSC and UV-crosslinked. The 500-bp fragment representing exon 2 to exon 4 of the rat GK gene, the 500-bp fragment of exon 2 to exon 4 of the rat SREBP-1 gene, and the 500-bp fragment of exon 2 to exon 4 of the rat SREBP-2 gene were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and used as cDNA probes. The membrane was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) at 65 °C for 4 h. After hybridization, the membrane was washed with 2× SSC 0.1% SDS followed by 0.2× SSC 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray film at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. For reverse transcription PCR, first strand cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl volume using random hexamer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). One microliter of the reverse transcription reaction mixture was amplified with primers specific for rat LGK and β-actin in a total volume of 50 μl. Linearity of the PCR was tested by amplifying 100 ng of total RNA in the amplification cycles between 20 and 50. According to the amplification profile, samples were amplified for 30 cycles using the parameters 92 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. β-actin was used as an internal control for the quality and quantity of RNA. The identity of PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel, and the quantities of PCR products were analyzed by Molecular Analyst II (Bio-Rad). The PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Primers used in PCR were as follows: LGK-sense, 5′-CAGACAGTCCTCACCTGCAA-3′; LGK-antisense, 5′-TGACCAGCATCACTCTGAAG-3′; SREBP-1a-sense, 5′-ACACAGCGGTTTTGAACGACATC-3′; SREB-P-1a-antisense, 5′-ACGGACGGGTACATCTTTACAG-3′; SREBP-1c-sense, 5′-GGAGCCATGGATTGCACATT-3′; SREBP-1c-antisense, 5′-AGGAAGGCTTCCAGAGAGGA-3′; β-actin-sense, 5′-TTGTAACCAACTGGGACGATATGG-3′; and β-actin-antisense, 5′-CGACCAGAGGCATACAGGGACAAC-3′. DNase I Footprinting Assay—A DNase footprinting assay was performed as described previously (20Cha J.Y. Kim H. Kim K.S. Hur M.W. Ahn Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18358-18365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). DNA fragments covering from -320 to -69 of the LGK gene were labeled in sense strand and purified as follows. The promoter region was amplified by PCR, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of the pBluescript SK+ vector. The promoter fragments were isolated by double digestion with KpnI and EcoRI to obtain 5′-overhanging ends and 3′-overhanging ends. The fragments were labeled using a Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP and then purified from PAGE. DNA protein binding reactions were performed using 50,000 cpm (∼1 ng) of probe per reaction in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 7% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and the indicated amount of purified recombinant SREBP-1. After a 20-min incubation on ice, 5 μl of DNase I freshly diluted in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 7% glycerol was added to the reaction and kept at room temperature for 2 min. Dilution folds of DNase I were ranged from 1:200 to 1:2000 of stock (10 units/μl), depending on the amount of protein in the reaction. Digestion reactions were stopped by adding 80 μl of a stop solution containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 20 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 4 μg of yeast tRNA, and 10 μg of proteinase K. The samples were resolved in 6% polyacrylamide and 7 m urea sequencing gel. The protected regions were mapped with reference to the migration of Maxam-Gilbert sequencing products. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The oligonucleotide probes P-216/-187 (for SREa), P-216/-187ma, P-188/-159 (for SREb), and P-188/-159mb were labeled as described previously (19Kim H.I. Kim J.W. Kim S.H. Cha J.Y. Kim K.S. Ahn Y.H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ten picomoles of single-stranded sense oligonucleotide were labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) and annealed with a 5 m excess of antisense oligonucleotide. 32P-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides were purified with Sephadex G50 (Amersham Biosciences) spin columns. P-225/-150, P-225/-150ma, P-225/-150mb, and P-225/-150mab were generated by PCR using pRGL-1448, pRGL-1448ma, pRGL-1448mb, and pRGL-1448mab as templates. 32P-labeled sense oligonucleotides (5′-TTCTTTAACCAGTCTGAAGG-3′) and unlabeled antisense oligonucleotides (5′-GGACTTGCTGTGGAGAGGTT-3′) were used to amplify the probes. The labeled probes were purified by PAGE. 50,000 cpm (∼0.02 pmol) of probes were incubated with a recombinant SREBP-1 protein for 20 min on ice in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. One μg of poly(dI-dC) was added to each reaction to suppress nonspecific binding. For competition assays, excessive unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture. Two microliters of anti-SREBP-1 serum was added to the reaction for a supershift assay. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved from free probe by PAGE at 4 °C on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼150 g) had free access to Purina chow and were divided into fasting and refeeding groups. The fasting group fasted for 24 h. The refeeding group had free access to high carbohydrate diet for 24 h after fasting. The liver was perfused with serum-free DMEM for 5 min and cross-linked with 5% formaldehyde in serum-free DMEM for 5 min. The livers were homogenized, pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). The lysate was sonicated on ice for 3 min with a 2.5 mm in diameter sonicator tip at 30% amplitude and a 0.5 cycle (UP400S; Dr. Hielscher GmbH, Teltow, Germany) and sheared to 100–600 bp. To provide a positive control (input) for each condition, one undiluted aliquot was retained for further processing in parallel with all other samples at the reversal of the cross-linking step. To reduce nonspecific background, each chromatin sample (1 ml) was precleared using 60 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), supplemented with 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene), and the beads were pelleted. Chromatin complexes in the supernatant were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using 30 μg of anti-SREBP-1 serum or preimmune serum or without serum. Immune complexes were collected with 60 μl of protein A/G-agarose and 200μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Chromatin complexes were eluted from the beads and used for subsequent PCR analysis. LGK promoter-specific primers were 5′-ATCCCACGAGGTACCCCCACTATTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GACTTGCTGTGGAGAGGTTA-3′ (antisense). Preparation of Recombinant Adenovirus—The cDNA encoding SREBP-1c or SREBP-1cDN was cloned into the pAd-YC2 shuttle vector, which has the cytomegalovirus promoter and multiple cloning sites, including the bGHp(A) sequence (21Choi Y.K. Kim Y.J. Park H.S. Choi K. Paik S.G. Lee Y.I. Park J.G. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For homologous recombination, a shuttle vector, pAd-YC2 (5 μg), and a rescue vector, pJM17 (5 μg), were cotransfected into 293 cells, which had been cultured in a 24-well plate the day before transfection. After 12–15 days, recombinants were screened by PCR using upstream primers derived from the cytomegalovirus promoter and downstream primers from the bGHp(A) sequence. Then, the recombinants were amplified in 293 cells and purified and isolated using CsCl2 (Sigma). The preparations were collected and desalted, and titers were determined by the measurement of plaque counts. Isolation of Primary Hepatocytes and Treatment of Recombinant Adenovirus—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from normal Sprague-Dawley rats (∼150 g) as described previously (22Kim J.W. Ahn Y.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The primary hepatocytes were incubated for 2 h with an adenovirus containing DMEM at a titer of 15 plaque-forming units per cell for 2 h at 37 °C. Then, culture medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The infected cells were harvested for RNA isolation 24 h after viral infection. Statistical Analysis—All transfection studies were performed in triplicates and repeated 3–5 times. The data were represented as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). SREBP-1c Activates LGK Promoter—To determine the response of the LGK promoter to SREBPs, a luciferase reporter construct under the control of the LGK promoter pRGL-1448, which contained the -1448/+127 region of the rat LGK gene, was prepared and transfected into Alexander cells with or without expression of SREBPs. As shown in Fig. 1, SREBP-1c activated the LGK promoter, whereas SREBP-2 did not. We also observed that SREBP-1a activated the promoter construct (data not shown). This result suggested the presence of SRE in the LGK promoter and the preference of the SRE to SREBP-1, which was observed in many promoters of many lipogenic genes. Localization of SRE in the LGK Promoter—To localize the region responsible for the activation by SREBP-1, we prepared 5′ deletion constructs and tested their responsiveness to SREBP-1c in Alexander cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, pRGL-1448, pRGL-593, and pRGL-238 were activated by SREBP-1c. But pRGL-161 was slightly activated by SREBP-1c. This sight activation did not disappear even in the reporter without promoter. This marginal activation of reporter without promoter might be due to the presence of an E-box in front of the multiple cloning site of the pGL3basic plasmid. Thus, we assumed that -238/-161 region was necessary for the activation of the LGK promoter by SREBP-1c. To localize SREBP-1c binding sites in the LGK promoter, a DNase I footprinting assay was performed using a recombinant human SREBP-1 protein (17Moon Y.A. Lee J.J. Park S.W. Ahn Y.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30280-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, the region from -210 to -167 of the LGK promoter was protected from DNase I digestion by SREBP-1 protein, which suggested the binding of SREBP-1 to this region. However, the protected region was wider than expected, and sequence analysis revealed the presence of two SRE consensus sequences (YCAYNYCAY) in the -210/-167 region. An EMSA was performed using the probe P-225/-150, which covered the -225/-150 region of LGK promoter, to confirm the binding of SREBP-1 to the region. Fig. 2C shows two shifted bands by SREBP-1. Because recombinant SREBP-1 protein was used in EMSA, these results suggested that two distinct and closely located SREBP-1 binding sites exist in the -210/-167 region. Identification of Two Distinct SREs in the LGK Promoter—We designated two putative SREs as SREa and SREb, respectively, and produced probes P-216/-187 and P-188/-159, which contained SREa and SREb, respectively (Fig. 3A). An EMSA using P-216/-187 and P-188/-159 probes showed the binding of SREBP-1 to each SRE (Fig. 3B). But SREBP-1 could not bind to mutant probes P-216/-187ma and P-188/-159mb, which had mutations in SREa and SREb, respectively. In addition, we observed that the intensity of the shifted band of P-216/-187 was stronger than that of P-188/-159. To test the specificity of SREBP-1 binding, we performed competition assay and supershift assay using P-216/-187 (Fig. 3C). We employed P-216/-187, P-188/-159, P-216/-187ma, and P-188/-159mb as unlabeled competitors. An unlabeled self-competitor, P-216/-187, could completely compete the binding of SREBP-1 to the probe P-216/-187 (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4). However, unlabeled P-188/-159 competed the probe P-216/-187 less efficiently than did the self-competitor (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6). SRE-mutated P-216/-187ma and P-188/-159mb did not compete the probe (Fig. 3C, lanes 7–10). In addition, the anti-SREBP-1 antibody completely blocked the binding of SREBP-1 to the probe (Fig. 3C, lane 12). We also performed the same experiment using P-188/-159 to confirm the specificity of SREBP-1 binding to SREb (data not shown). From these results, it was concluded that SREBP-1 could bind to both SREa and SREb and that the binding affinity of SREa was stronger than that of SREb. To know the functional property of the two SREs, we constructed mutant version of promoter-luciferase reporter constructs and observed the response to SREBP-1c (Fig. 4A). The internal deletion of the -210/-167 region from the LGK promoter (pRGL-1448Δab) resulted in the complete loss of activation by SREBP-1c. Based on an EMSA experiment, we introduced mutations of two nucleotides into SREa and/or SREb named pRGL-1448ma, pRGL-1448mb, and pRGL-1448mab, respectively. Mutations of SREa (pRGL-1448ma) resulted in 80% loss of SREBP-1c-dependent activation, and mutations of SREb (pRGL-1448mb) resulted in a 70% loss of activation. SREBP-1c could not activate the promoter-containing double mutations of SREa and SREb (pRGL-1448mab). These results indicated that the two functional SREs were closely related and necessary for the complete activation of the LGK promoter by SREBP-1c. To know whether the binding of SREBP-1 to one SRE could affect the binding to the other SRE, we performed EMSA using the probe covering the -225/-150 region of the LGK promoter. We used the P-225/-150, P-225/-150ma, P-225/-150mb, and P-225/-150mab as probes (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C showed the change of the SREBP-1 binding pattern as a result of the mutations of SREs. The wild type probe, P-225/-150, showed two shifted bands of which the upper band was a DNA-protein complex containing two molecules of SREBP-1, whereas the lower band suggested one molecule of SREBP-1 binding. When SREa or SREb was mutated, the intensity of the lower band was moderately decreased, whereas the upper band almost disappeared. The binding of SREBP-1 to P-225/-150mb was stronger than that to P-225/-150ma. Double mutations in SREa and SREb resulted in a complete loss of SREBP-1 binding. These results suggested that SREBP-1 could bind to both SREa and SREb and that the bindings to these SREs were independent. High Carbohydrate Diet Increased the Binding of SREBP-1c on LGK Promoter in Liver—In the liver the expression of LGK and SREBP-1c were known to be changed by nutritional status. Thus, we performed a ChIP assay to confirm the functionality of SREs in vivo and to determine whether the binding of SREBP-1c to the LGK promoter could be changed by nutritional status. As shown in Fig. 5A, a high carbohydrate diet dramatically increased the transcription of the GK and SREBP-1 in rat liver, but SREBP-2 transcription was not changed by nutritional status. In this state we performed a ChIP assay to find out whether a high carbohydrate diet could increase the binding of SREBP-1 on the LGK promoter. As shown in Fig. 5B, a high carbohydrate diet increased the binding of SREBP-1 to the -221/-169 region of the LGK promoter containing SREa and SREb. These results indicated that SREa and SREb were functional SREBP-1c binding sites in vivo and that a high carbohydrate diet increased SREBP-1 expression, thereby activating LGK expression in the liver. SREBP-1c Mediated the Transcriptional Activation of LGK by Insulin—It was reported that insulin regulates LGK gene expression and SREBP-1c mediates the action of insulin on LGK gene expression (23Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 24Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). To determine whether insulin could activate the LGK promoter, we transfected LGK promoter luciferase reporter constructs into Alexander cells in the presence or absence of insulin. As shown in Fig. 6A, insulin increased the LGK promoter activity by 2.5-fold. However insulin did not activate the promoters lacking the SREs (pRGL-1448Δab and pRGL-161). These results suggested that SREa and SREb might be responsible for the insulin-dependent activation of the LGK promoter. Thus, we isolated primary hepatocytes from the liver of normal Sprague-Dawley rats and treated them with insulin to delineate the relationship between insulin, SREBP-1c, and GK. Fig. 6B shows the transcription of LGK and SREBP-1. Insulin selectively stimulated the transcription of LGK and SREBP-1c without changing the expression of SREBP-1a. A ChIP assay using the primary hepatocytes cultured in the presence or absence of insulin revealed that the binding of SREBP-1c to the -221/-169 region of the LGK promoter was increased by insulin (Fig. 6C). Despite these results, it is still possible that SREBP-1c may indirectly participate in the insulin-dependent activation of LGK. To find out whether SREBP-1c may directly mediate insulin-dependent LGK expression, we transduced an adenovirus containing SREBP-1c or SREBP-1cDN into the primary hepatocytes in the presence or absence of insulin. As shown in Fig. 6D, LGK expression is increased by adenoviral expression of SREBP-1c in the absence of insulin, which is blocked by SREBP-1cDN. In addition, adenoviral expression of SREBP-1cDN could block the insulin-dependent stimulation of LGK gene expression. These results strongly suggested that SREa and SREb are responsible for the SREBP-1c-mediated activation of LGK gene expression by insulin. Recently, SREBP-1c has been suggested to mediate the insulin action on hepatic GK transcription. SREBP-1c expression is decreased in liver during fasting, which suppresses insulin and increases glucagon levels and is increased by refeeding (15Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H.

The expression of lipogenic genes are not increased by high-carbohydrate diet in SREBP-1 knock-out mice (27Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y.

Adenoviral expression of SREBP-1c in the liver of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice increased lipogenic gene expression, mimicking the effects of insulin (28Becard D. Hainault I.

Overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of SREBP-1c blocked the insulin-dependent activation of GK and lipogenic gene expression in the liver (24Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F.

In isolated rat hepatocytes, insulin treatment increased the amount of mRNA for SREBP-1c in parallel with the mRNAs of lipogenic genes, and glucagons can antagonize insulin action (23Shimomura I.

In addition, SRE has been identified in many promoters of lipogenic genes such as fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP citrate-lyase, and S14, and insulin-responsive regions of fatty acid synthase and S14 genes are colocalized with functional SREBP-1c binding sites (17Moon Y.A.

However, neither the insulin-responsive region nor the SREBP response element has been identified in the LGK promoter. In the present study, we identified two functional SREBP-1c response elements, SREa and SREb, in the rat LGK promoter. SREBP-1c binds to these SREs and activates the LGK promoter. In an EMSA, the binding of SREBP-1 to SREa or SREb was not mutually exclusive. SREa showed a stronger affinity to SREBP-1 compared with SREb. However, these in vitro binding assay data were not in parallel with the transfection assay. Transient transfection assay showed that both SREa and SREb were necessary for the transactivation of LGK promoter by SREBP-1c, and the physical interaction between the protein and SREs of the LGK promoter in vivo was confirmed by ChIP assay. A high carbohydrate diet increased the expression of SREBP-1 and GK in rat liver and the binding of SREBP-1 to the LGK promoter. Given that SREBP-1c was a major form of SREBP-1 and that the expression of SREBP-1c was known to be regulated by insulin in liver, the increased GK expression by high carbohydrate feeding might be due to the increased binding of SREBP-1c to the LGK promoter. We also showed evidence supporting this hypothesis using primary hepatocytes. Insulin selectively increased SREBP-1c and LGK expression in primary cultured hepatocytes, which was blocked by adenoviral expression of the dominant negative mutant of SREBP-1c. A ChIP assay using primary hepatocytes showed the increased binding of SREBP-1 to SREs of LGK promoter. From these results, we could conclude that the binding of SREBP-1c to SREa and SREb is responsible for insulin-dependent LGK expression. In this study, it was not possible to explain the detailed relationship between SREa and SREb in SREBP-1c-mediated activation of LGK by insulin. There may be some unknown or additional mediators that play important roles in SRE-mediated transactivation of the LGK gene. We thought that there might be something more than SREBP-1c linking SREa and SREb in the regulation of LGK promoter by SREBP-1c. When pRGL-1448 was transfected into Alexander cells or primary hepatocytes, the promoter showed only 2.5-fold activation by insulin, which is much smaller than the activation of LGK promoter by SREBP-1c. This marginal activation suggested that other regions outside the -1448/+127 region or other factors that are lacking in these experimental conditions might involve the increase of SREBP-1c binding to SREa and SREb by insulin in vivo. In conclusion, we identified functional SREs in the rat LGK promoter and demonstrated that SREBP-1c is the transcription factor mediating insulin action on LGK expression. Although the mutual interaction of these two cis-elements in activating LGK gene expression remains elusive, the tandem array of SREa and SREb may provide a fine control for regulating glucose homeostasis by LGK."

Our previous study indicates that digoxin, one member in digitalis, decreases the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, Ca2+ proved to be an important factor in digoxin-triggered prostate cancer cell death. Because cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)5 and p35 cleavage (p25 formation) have been reported to be targets of intracellular Ca2+, and subsequently correlated to apoptosis, we not only demonstrated first that Cdk5, p35, and p25 proteins were all expressed in prostate cancer cells (including lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) and DU-145 cells), but also showed where p25 formation and Cdk5 kinase activity were affected by treatment with digoxin. The inhibitor of p35 cleavage (calpeptin) was used to reduce p25 formation, and the result suggested that p25 accumulation might be the major cause of digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death. Butyrolactone-I and roscovitine, two Cdk5 kinase inhibitors, were also found to prevent digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death. In addition, treatment of siRNA-Cdk5 diminished digoxin-triggered cell death, as compared with the treatments of siRNA-Cdk1 or siRNA-Cdk2, which implies the specific involvement of Cdk5 in digoxin-triggered cell death. Caspase inhibitor set and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay were used to demonstrate that digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell apoptosis through Cdk5 activation. These results suggest that Cdk5/p35 and p25 are novel players in digoxin-triggered prostate cancer cell apoptosis and, therefore, become potential therapeutic targets.

Prostate cancer is a common malignancy and age-related cancer in men (1Rhim J.S. Kung H.F. Crit. Rev. Oncogene. 1997; 8: 305-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although the cancer marker prostate-specific antigen helps to identify prostate cancer, the lethality is still very high. Traditionally, before prostate cancer becomes androgen-independent, the therapy is gonadectomy. Once prostate cancer has become androgen-independent, definitive radio- or chemotherapies are used.Digoxin, a purified digitalis preparation derived from the leaves of Digitalis lanata (foxglove), plays a vital role in the therapy of congestive heart failure (2Demers C.

Epidemiological studies have shown the anti-cancer effects of digitalis (4Stenkvist B. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 493-496PubMed Google Scholar). Breast cancer patients treated with digitalis have been found to have a lower death rate than non-treated patients (4Stenkvist B. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 493-496PubMed Google Scholar). Five years after mastectomy, cancer recurrence rates in control patients who were not given digitalis increased by 9.6-fold, as compared with patients who were treated with digitalis (5Stenkvist B.

Although most Cdks are involved in cell-cycle regulation, Cdk5 has connections in neuronal apoptosis and degeneration (7Tang D. Lee K.Y. Qi Z. Matsuura I. Wang J.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The physiological roles for Cdk5 are regulating neuronal cytoskeleton, axon guidance, membrane transport, synaptic function, dopamine signaling, and drug addiction. Like other Cdks, Cdk5 shows no kinase activity and requires association with a regulatory partner, such as p35, for activation and maintains a normal physiology of neurons (8Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). In the Alzheimer's model, Cdk5 seems to be activated and leads to neuronal death under oxidative stress from various sources, such as amyloid β peptides and the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+ (9Alvarez A.

The p25, a Ca2+-dependent p35 cleavage product, is believed to be a highly regulating Cdk5 kinase activity and plays an important role in Alzheimer's pathology (10Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Recently, Cdk5/p35 was reported to distribute in cells of several reproductive glands, such as Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and the prostate gland, and wherever Cdk5 kinase is active (11Musa F.R.

In those cells, Cdk5 kinase activity is regulated by luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, the trophic hormones for the secretion of androgen (12Musa F.R. Takenaka I. Konishi R. Tokuda M. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 392-402PubMed Google Scholar), and contributes to the growth of the prostate gland. Moreover, it was reported recently (15Zapata-Torres G. Opazo F. Salgado C. Munoz J.P. Krautwurst H. Mascayano C. Sepulveda-Boza S. Maccioni R.B. Cassels B.K. J. Nat. Prod. 2004; 67: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that Cdk5 kinase activity is affected by flavonoids, prominent plant secondary metabolites, which reveals the connections between Cdk5 and plant extracts. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether Cdk5 is involved in digoxin-caused prostate cancer cell toxicity. Our results indicate that digoxin-triggered prostate cancer cell apoptosis resulted primarily from p25-dependent activation of Cdk5.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection of siRNA—Prostate cancer cell lines, lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) and DU-145 (BCRC 60088 and BCRC 60348) were provided from Culture Collection and Research Center, Food Industry Research and Development Institute, Taiwan, Republic of China. LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.-Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °Cin a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. DU-145 cells were cultured in MEM medium (Sigma) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin (Biochrom AG) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. siRNA-Cdk5, siRNA-Cdk1, siRNA-Cdk2, and nonspecific control of siRNA were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Dharmacon) which are SMARTpool™ containing four pooled SMARTselected siRNA duplexes. Introduction of siRNAs into LNCaP cells was performed by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with 50 pmol siRNA/105 cells 2 days before treatment with digoxin.Cell Viability Assay—The modified colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-zolium bromide (MTT) assay was manipulated to quantify the viability of LNCaP cancer cells (16Yeh J.Y. Huang W.J. Kan S.F. Wang P.S. Prostate. 2003; 54: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Yellow MTT compound (Sigma) was converted by living cells to form blue formazen, which is soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The intensity of blue staining in culture medium proportionally represented the number of living cells and was measured by optical density reader (SpectroMAX plus, Molecular Devices) at 570 nm (background = 630 nm).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysate was produced in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or extract buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture) for Cdk5 immunoprecipitation. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted. Immunoprecipitates were collected by binding to protein G PLUS/protein A-agarose (Oncogene Research Products). Proteins were analyzed by direct Western blotting (30 μg/lane) or blotting after immunoprecipitation (1–2 mg per immunoprecipitation). Antibodies used included anti-Cdk5 antibody, anti-Cdk1 antibody, anti-Cdk2 (all Upstate Biotechnology), anti-p35 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin (MAB1501, Chemicon), and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory). ECL detection reagent (NEN) was used to detect the immunoreactive proteins.Cdk5 Kinase Assay—Kinase assay was performed by washing immunoprecipitates three times with kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The protein G PLUS/protein A-agarose beads with target proteins were incubated with kinase reaction buffer containing 2 μg of substrate (histone H1, Upstate Biotechnology) and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP in a final volume of 40 μl at 30 °C for 30 min.Staining—LNCaP cells that were cultured on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature after washing with PBS twice. Fixed cells were then washed once again with PBS. The buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS was then added and mixed for 2 min at room temperature. After discarding the buffer, PBS-washing and subsequent 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS blocking were done for another 15 min at room temperature. The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was carried out using the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science). The slides were incubated in the TUNEL reaction mixture (including FITC-conjugated modified nucleotides and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) for 1 h at 37 °C. Phase images and TUNEL signals of cells were visualized directly under Nikon microscopy with an fluorescein isothiocyanate filter.Statistics—All values are given as the means ± S.E. In some cases, means were tested for homogeneity by two-way analysis of variance, and the difference between specific means were tested for significance by Duncan's multiple-range test (17Steel R.D. Torrie J.H. Principles and Procedures of Statistics. McGraw-Hill, New York1960Google Scholar). In all other cases, a Student's t test was used. A difference between two means was considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSDigoxin Triggers Ca2+-dependent Prostate Cancer Cell Death and p25-dependent Cdk5 Activation—Our previous study reports that digoxin-induced toxicity of prostate cancer cells is accompanied by the increase of intracellular Ca2+ (6Yeh J.Y. Huang W.J. Kan S.F. Wang P.S. J. Urol. 2001; 166: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is believed to be a key factor in apoptosis (18Hajnoczky G. Davies E. Madesh M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Thus, we chelated Ca2+ from culture medium by EGTA (0.5 mm for 2 days) and found that digoxin-triggered (10 μm for 2 days) cell death was significantly prevented (Figs. 1A and 2A), although there were slight decreases of cell numbers in EGTA-only groups. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay, as described under “Materials and Methods” (16Yeh J.Y. Huang W.J. Kan S.F. Wang P.S. Prostate. 2003; 54: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The prostate cancer cell lines tested included LNCaP cells and DU-145 cells (see Figs. 1 and 2, respectively). In the Alzheimer's model, Cdk5 is activated by various signals such as β-amyloid peptide and leads to neuronal death; much evidence indicates that Ca2+ accumulation and subsequent p35 cleavage are correlated to Cdk5 activation (10Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). In addition to the presence of Cdk5/p35 complex in reproductive tissues (11Musa F.R. Tokuda M. Kuwata Y. Ogawa T. Tomizawa K. Konishi R. Takenaka I. Hatase O. J. Androl. 1998; 19: 657-666PubMed Google Scholar, 12Musa F.R. Takenaka I. Konishi R. Tokuda M. J. Androl. 2000; 21: 392-402PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rosales J.L. Lee B.C. Modarressi M. Sarker K.

Biol. 1997; 183: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to explore the protein expressions of Cdk5/p35 and p25 in prostate cancer cells. Immunoblotting assay was used to detect protein expressions such as anti-Cdk5 (Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-p35/p25 (C-terminal, sc-820, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Direct in vitro Cdk5 kinase assay using histone-H1 as substrate after immunoprecipitation of Cdk5 was also performed. The results showed that p25 formation and Cdk5 kinase activity were both stimulated by digoxin (Figs. 1B and 2B, lane 2), whereas actin and Cdk5 protein expressions were not affected. Treatment of EGTA diminished digoxin-induced p25 formation and Cdk5 activation. This result suggests that digoxin stimulates Cdk5 activity through Ca2+-dependent cleavage of p35 into p25 (Figs. 1B and 2B, lane 3).Fig. 2Digoxin triggers Ca2+-dependent DU-145 cell death and p25-dependent Cdk5 activation. DU-145 cells were treated as follows: control, digoxin (Dg, 10 μm), digoxin + EGTA, and EGTA (0.5 mm) for 2 days. A, cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described under “Materials and Methods” (n = 4). Control value = 100%; **, p < 0.01 versus control group; ++, p < 0.01 versus digoxin group. B, in p35 cleavage study, cell lysates were directly immunoblotted by anti-p35 antibody (C-terminal) and anti-actin. In Cdk5 kinase assay, cell lysates were subjected to Cdk5 immunoprecipitation followed by anti-Cdk5 immunoblotting and in vitro [32P]ATP kinase assay using histone H1 as the substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)p25 Formation Is Vital in Digoxin-triggered LNCaP Cell Death—In previous results, we found that digoxin might activate Cdk5 through p35 cleavage in prostate cancer cells. Thus, it was interesting to examine whether inhibition of p25 formation could affect digoxin-triggered cell death. Inhibitor of p35 cleavage, calpeptin (Calbiochem), was used in the study by Lee et al. (21Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) and was found able to significantly prevent digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Treatment of digoxin with calpeptin (15 μm) caused a 12% drop in cell number versus control group, as compared with a 62% drop by the digoxin group (Fig. 3A). In Fig. 3B, Cdk5 kinase activity certainly dropped by the inhibition of p35 cleavage under treatment of digoxin, whereas the protein expressions of actin and Cdk5 were not affected. These results suggest that p25 formation plays an important role in digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death.Fig. 3p35 cleavage is important to digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death. A, different dosages of p35 cleavage inhibitor (calpeptin, 0 ∼ 30 μm) were added in LNCaP cell culture medium with or without digoxin (10 μm) for 2 days. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described under “Materials and Methods” (n = 4). Control value = 100%; **, p < 0.01 versus control group; +, p < 0.05 and ++, p < 0.01, versus digoxin group. B, LNCaP cells were treated with 15 μm calpeptin for 2 days to investigate the effects of p25 formation on digoxin-triggered Cdk5 activation. Cell lysates were directly immunoblotted by anti-p35 antibody (C-terminal) and anti-actin. In Cdk5 kinase assay, cell lysates were subjected to Cdk5 immunoprecipitation followed by anti-Cdk5 immunoblotting and in vitro [32P]ATP kinase assay using histone H1 as the substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cdk5 Kinase Activity Correlates to Digoxin-triggered LNCaP Cell Death—To understand the effects of Cdk5 kinase activity directly upon digoxin-triggered cell death, two commonly used Cdk5 kinase inhibitors (butyrolactone-1 (BL-I) and roscovitine (RV), Calbiochem) were co-treated with digoxin, and cell viability was monitored. BL-I and RV are both relatively specific for inhibiting Cdk5 kinase activity and are frequently applied in Cdk5-related studies (19Alvarez A. Munoz J.P. Maccioni R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 166-174Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Wei W. Wang X. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3023-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The data indicated that both inhibitors prevented digoxin-triggered cell death in a dose-dependent manner, but the two results were slightly different from each other (Fig. 4, left panels). Two treatments with 10 μm inhibitor were used as the efficient dosage to inhibit Cdk5 kinase activity, which was confirmed by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4, right panels). Consequently, butyrolactone-1 was suggested as a better inhibitor for further investigation of Cdk5-related experiments.Fig. 4Cdk5 kinase activity correlates to digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death. Dose-dependent effects of BL-I (A) and RV (B) on digoxin-affected LNCaP cell viability and Cdk5 activation were monitored after 2-day treatment. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described under “Materials and Methods” (n = 4). Control value = 100%; **, p < 0.01 versus control group; ++, p < 0.01 versus digoxin group. Cell lysates were subjected to Cdk5 immunoprecipitation followed by anti-Cdk5 immunoblotting and in vitro [32P]ATP kinase assay using histone H1 as the substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Digoxin-triggered Cell Death Is Cdk5 Protein-dependent—On the basis of digoxin-triggered cell death caused by Cdk5 kinase activity, elimination of Cdk5 protein has become another quick way to demonstrate how Cdk5 gets involved in digoxin-triggered cell death. Cdk5 protein expression was knocked-down by siRNA (Fig. 5A, white bars), whereas siRNA-Cdk1 (Fig. 5A, hatched bars) and siRNA-Cdk2 (Fig. 5A, gray bars) were also performed. The data indicated that reduction of Cdk5 protein expression mitigated LNCaP cell death caused by digoxin (Fig. 5A, compare bars 4 and 2), although cell viability was affected by treatment of siRNA-Cdk5 alone (Fig. 5A, compare bars 3 and 1). The black bars in Fig. 5A were control groups of siRNA treatment, which was transfected with nonspecific siRNA (Upstate Biotechnology). There was no significant difference in cell viability between the nonspecific siRNA group and the non-transfected group (data not shown). The groups treated with siRNA-Cdk1 and siRNA-Cdk2 showed no significant change in cell death with or without the treatment of digoxin (Fig. 5A, bars 5-8). Fig. 5B indicates the efficacies of the three treatments of siRNA by immunoblotting LNCaP cell lysates in which Cdk5 kinase assay was also performed. Taken together, these results illustrate that Cdk5 protein plays an important role in digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death.Fig. 5Digoxin-triggered cell death is Cdk5 protein-dependent. Effects of Cdk5 protein knock-down on digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death were evaluated after 2-day treatment. A, cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described under “Materials and Methods” (n = 4). Digoxin was added in culture medium after transfection of siRNA for 24 h. Black columns represent nonspecific siRNA-treated group; white columns represent siRNA-Cdk5-treated group; hatched columns represent siRNA-Cdk1-treated group; gray columns represent siRNA-Cdk2-treated group. Control value = 100%; **, p < 0.01 versus nonspecific siRNA-control group; , p < 0.01 versus nonspecific siRNA-control group; ##, p < 0.01 versus nonspecific siRNA-digoxin group. B, cell lysates were subjected to Cdk5 immunoprecipitation followed by anti-Cdk5 immunoblotting and in vitro [32P]ATP kinase assay using histone H1 as the substrate. Cdk1 and Cdk2 protein expressions were also detected by immunoblotting as efficiencies of siRNAs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Digoxin-triggered LNCaP Cell Death Is Cdk5-related Apoptosis—Based upon our previous results, digoxin triggers Cdk5 protein/activity-dependent cell death. In accordance with the direct link between Cdk5 and apoptosis (23Weishaupt J.H. Neusch C. Bahr M. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 312: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Cruz J.C. Tseng H.C. Goldman J.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), we continued to verify whether digoxin could cause LNCaP cell apoptosis by affecting Cdk5. Caspase-family inhibitor set (1:1000 dilution, Chemicon) was used to test the cytotoxicity of digoxin by direct addition to culture medium. The effects of synthetic peptide inhibitors of caspases which irreversibly inhibit the activity of each caspase-family proteases are indicated in Fig. 6A. The data reveal that at least caspase 8, 3, and 6 were involved in digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death (Fig. 6B). In addition, staining by TUNEL (Roche Applied Science) was used to demonstrate digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell apoptosis. In Fig. 6C, treatment of digoxin resulted in LNCaP cell apoptosis (Fig. 6C, green signals in right panels). In contrast, digoxin-triggered cell apoptosis was significantly decreased by co-treatment with BL-I. The quantified data of the TUNEL results are shown in Fig. 6D. Treatment of siRNA-Cdk5 was also shown to reduce digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell apoptosis, although knock-down of Cdk5 expression itself could induce a slight apoptosis (data not shown). As a result, our data show that digoxin triggers Cdk5-related apoptosis in LNCaP cells.Fig. 6Digoxin-triggered LNCaP cell death is Cdk5-related apoptosis. A, caspase inhibitor set (1:1000 dilution, Chemicon) was used to treat LNCaP cells with or without digoxin (10 μm) for 2 days. B, cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described under “Materials and Methods” (n = 4). Control value = 100%; **, p < 0.01 versus control group; ++, p < 0.01 versus digoxin group. C, TUNEL staining (Roche Applied Science) of LNCaP cells was done after treatment with digoxin or digoxin + BL-I for 2 days. Right panels, green signals show apoptotic cells as compared with the phase image in left panel. Magnification, 80×.

Although early diagnosis contributes to the potential cure of localized prostate cancer, metastasis still occurs in many patients. Because the prostate is an androgen-dependent organ, androgen ablation is a priority for treatment. There are many ways of androgen ablation for metastatic prostate cancer, including surgical castration, oral estrogen therapy, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue depot injection, and other anti-androgen therapies. Besides hormone manipulation, chemotherapy and/or combined therapies were also clinically applied; however, prostate cancer has gradually become androgen-independent and refractory to hormonal therapy (25Hsieh T.C. Wu J.M. Prostate. 1997; 33: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, exploring the novel molecular therapeutic targets by taking the approach of prostate cancer biology is an important issue.Digoxin is a traditional medicine used for cardiac failure disease. Digitalis, including digoxin, has been considered to be a drug for breast cancer therapy (4Stenkvist B. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 493-496PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stenkvist B. Pengtsson E. Dahlqvist B. Eriksson O. Jarkrans T. Nordin B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1982; 306: 484Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our lab followed the trail of digitalis and identified its effects upon reproductive endocrinology and prostate cancer cells (6Yeh J.Y. Huang W.J. Kan S.F. Wang P.S. J.

Our previous results suggest that digoxin not only specifically inhibits testosterone biosynthesis through the reduction of cAMP production and cytochrome P450scc activity (26Lin H. Wang S.W. Tsai S.C. Chen J.J. Chiao Y.C. Lu C.C. Huang W.J. Wang G.J. Chen C.F. Wang P.S. Br. J.

Urol. 2001; 166: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results imply the dual effects of digoxin upon the reduction of prostate cancer development. In addition, McConkey et al. also addressed the involvement of digoxin in prostate cancer cell death (29McConkey D.J. Lin Y. Nutt L.K. Ozel H.Z. Newman R.A.

Therefore, the detailed mechanisms of digoxin in prostate cancer cell death become interesting subjects to be investigated further for potential cancer therapy.Cdk5, a non-cell-cycle-related cyclin-dependent kinase, is believed to function in the central nervous system along with its regulator, p35 (30Tang D.

We have therefore determined the role of FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 861 in the oncogenic transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 861 was increased in both constitutively H-Ras-transformed and H-Ras-inducible NIH3T3 cells, in parallel with cell transformation. However, H-Ras-inducible cells transfected with the nonphosphorylatable mutant FAK Y861F showed decreased migration/invasion, focus forming activity and anchorage-independent growth, compared with either wild-type or kinase-defective FAK. In contrast to unaltered FAK/Src activity, the association of FAK and p130CAS was decreased in FAK Y861F-transfected cells, and FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 861 enhanced this association in vitro. Consistently, FAK Y861F-transfected cells were defective in activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and in expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 during transformation.

FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 397 results in its direct interaction with Src, which contributes to the transformation of fibroblasts (12Schaller M.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Subsequent recruitment to the complex of proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, including Grb2 and c-Crk, is likely to trigger adhesion-induced cellular responses, including changes to the actin cytoskeleton and activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (14Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 15Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). p130CAS docking protein was initially identified as a major phosphotyrosine-containing protein in cells transformed by the v-src and v-crk oncogenes (16Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In addition, p130CAS may be a substrate of v-Src kinase and a binding target for the SH2 domain of v-Crk (17Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) during retroviral transformation. Indeed, transfection of antisense p130CAS mRNA into ras- and v-src-transformed cells led to their reversion (18Auvinen M. Paasinen-Sohns A. Hirai H. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6513-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p130CAS were resistant to Src-induced transformation (19Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). p130CAS-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts also showed impaired actin bundling and cell migration, and these properties were restored after re-expression of p130CAS (19Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), further indicating that this protein is essential in signal transduction during cell migration and transformation. Phosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine 861 (FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation) is especially interesting, because it is known to regulate migration of prostate carcinoma cells with increasing metastatic potential (20Slack J.K. Adams R.B. Rovin J.D. Bissonette E.A. Stoker C.E. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), as well as the migration and survival of vascular endothelial cells (21Abu-Ghazaleh R. Kabir J. Jia H. Lobo M. Zachary I. Biochem. J. 2001; 15: 255-264Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation is increased in metastatic breast cancer cells (22Vadlamudi R.K. Sahin A.A. Adam L. Wang R.A. Kumar R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 22: 76-80Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and ras-transformed fibroblasts (23Lim Y. Han I. Kwon H.J. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12735-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and decreased in detransformed cells by trichostatin A (23Lim Y. Han I. Kwon H.J. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12735-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation may regulate transforming activity in transformed/cancer cells. Here we report that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation is crucial for H-Ras-induced transformation by regulating the association between FAK and p130CAS. Reagents and Antibodies—Doxycyclin and puromycin were purchased from Sigma, and fibronectin was purchased from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to phosphotyrosine (4G10) and p130CAS (8G4-E8) were purchased from UBI (Hauppauge, NY), mAb to HA (12CA5) was purchased from Roche Applied Science, mAbs to H-Ras (F235), GST (B-14), phospho-specific ERK (E-4), and ERK2 (K-23) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and mAbs to JNK and phospho-specific JNK (pT183/pY185) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse mAb to FAK and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylation site-specific FAK[PY397] and FAK[PY861] were purchased from BioSource Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Morgan Hill, CA). Establishment of a Doxycyclin-regulated H-Ras NIH3T3 Cell Line— Mouse wild-type H-Ras cDNA in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) was a generous gift from Dr. Zea Young Ryoo of the Catholic University of Korea. The full-length H-Ras (G12R) cDNA was enzymatically excised and subcloned, using the GeneTailer site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen), into the BamHI site of the tetracycline-inducible vector, pTRE-IRES-EGFP, a generous gift from Dr Hong Jian Zhu of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (Melbourne, Australia). To obtain NIH3T3 cells with doxycyclin-induced (a tetracycline derivative) H-Ras (G12R) expression, pTRE-H-Ras-IRES-EGFP and pEFpurop-Tet-on (the generous gift of Dr. Hong Jian Zhu) were cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), and the cells were selected with puromycin. Positive clones were those that expressed H-Ras in the presence of doxycyclin, as shown by Western analysis using anti H-Ras antibody (F235 clone; Santa Cruz). These H-Ras NIH3T3 cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 60 mg/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Puromycin (2 μg/ml) was added to the medium for H-Ras expression clones. Construction of Mutant FAK Mammalian Expression Vectors—Site-directed mutagenesis of full-length cDNA encoding FAK in the pRC/CMV vector was performed using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The synthetic oligonucleotide, CCA ACA CAT CTT TCA GCC TGT GGG G (Tyr861 → Phe), was used to change tyrosine to phenylalanine. cDNAs encoding FAK and its mutant Y861F were inserted into pRC/CMV at the NotI/XbaI cloning sites, which generated in-frame fusions of a sequence encoding three HA epitopes (YPYDVPDYA) at the 3′ end of the FAK coding sequences. Expression vectors encoding epitope-tagged WT FAK (pKH3-FAK) and kinase-defective FAK (pKH3-kdFAK) were kindly provided by Dr. Jun-Lin Guan of Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). Transfections—Transient transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen), as described by the manufacturer. In brief, NIH3T3 and H-Ras-inducible NIH3T3 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and grown to ∼80% confluency. To each culture was added 5 ml of a mixture of 15 μl of LipofectAMINE and 4 μg of plasmid DNA, and the cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °Cina5%CO2, 95% air incubator. To each was added 5 ml of DMEM containing 20% FBS, and the cells were further incubated for 24 h. The medium was then aspirated and replaced with 5 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, denatured with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitations, each sample, containing 200–1,000 μg of total protein, was incubated with the relevant antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), which were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies, followed by species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The signals were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Focus Forming and Soft Agar Growth Assays—In the focus forming assay, 5 × 104 H-Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells were plated and incubated for 10–14 days, fixed in 99% methanol, and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. For analysis of colony formation in soft agar, 1 × 105 cells in 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 μg/ml puromycin, and 0.3% agarose were seeded in 6-mm plates containing a 0.6% agarose underlay. The cultures were fed every 4 days, and the formation of colonies was scored after 3 weeks. Tumor Cell Migration and Invasion Assay—Fibronectin (10 μg/μl in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well of a Transwell plate (Costar; 8-μm pore size), and the membranes were allowed to dry for 1 h at 25 °C. The Transwell plates were assembled in a 24-well plate, and the lower chambers were filled with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells (5 × 104) were added to each upper chamber, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h. The cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filters were stained with 0.6% hematoxylin and 0.5% eosin and counted. For invasion assays, 24-well Transwell plates (Costar; 8-μm pore size) were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/μl) on the lower side of the membrane and with Matrigel (30 μg/μl) on the upper side. In Vitro FAK/Src Kinase Assays—FAK immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1× RIPA buffer and once with 10 mm Tris buffer. The pellets were dissolved in 20 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100), and the reactions were started by adding 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm cold ATP, and GST-paxillin and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. For the Src kinase assay, Src immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 20 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2) and preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C. To each sample was added 2 μg of acid-denatured enolase as exogenous substrate, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Cell Adhesion and Spreading Assays—Cell adhesion and spreading assays were performed on fibronectin coated tissue plates essentially as described (24Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibronectin was diluted in serum-free medium, added to tissue culture plates (2 μg/cm2) and incubated at 25 °C for at least 1 h to allow its adsorption. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the plates were blocked by incubating them with 0.2% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin for 1 h and then washed with serum-free medium (2 × 10 min). The cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA, suspended in serum-free medium containing 0.25 mg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor, harvested, resuspended in serum-free medium, plated onto fibronectin-coated plates, and incubated for various periods of time at 37 °C. GST Pull-down Assays—Three cDNA constructs encoding proline-rich domains of FAK, PR1PR2 (amino acids 711–877), PR1PR2F (amino acids 711–877, Tyr861 → Phe), and FAK PR2 (amino acids 811–877), were generated by PCR amplification. The PCR products were cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site of the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns, phosphorylated in vitro with purified Src (23Lim Y. Han I. Kwon H.J. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12735-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Eliceiri B.P. Puente X.S. Hood J.D. Stupack D.G. Schlaepfer D.D. Huang X.Z. Sheppard D. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and mixed with H-Ras-inducible NIH3T3 cell lysates. After incubation at 4 °C on a rotator for 2 h, the precipitated complex was eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and used as templates for reverse transcriptase. Aliquots of cDNA were amplified using primers for MMP-2 (5′-AATACCTGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGGGGAACTTGCAGT-3′ (reverse)); MMP-9 (5′-GCTTTGCTGCCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAAAGGCGTGTGCCAG-3′ (reverse)); and rat β-actin (5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′ (reverse)). The amplification protocol consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C (MMP-9 and β-actin) or 55 °C (MMP-2) for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The PCR products (545 bp for MMP-2, 544 bp for MMP-9, and 349 bp for β-actin) were cloned and sequenced to confirm their identity. Gelatinase Activity—Conditioned culture media from 5 × 106 cells were subjected to nonreduced SDS-PAGE containing 1 mg/ml of gelatin. The gels were washed three times with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min each at 25 °C and three times with water for 10 min each, incubated at 37 °C overnight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 10 mm CaCl2, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and destained. Protease activity was visualized as a clear zone against a blue background. FAK Phosphorylation at Tyrosine 861 Is Increased in H-Ras-transformed Cells—To investigate the potential role of FAK phosphorylation in Ras-induced transformation, we assayed FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation in two different ras-transformed cells. We found that, in contrast to FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation, FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation was dramatically higher in H-Ras transformed NIH3T3 and K-ras transformed rat2 cells than in their respective untransformed cells (Fig. 1A). To further examine the correlation of FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation with transformation, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a tetracycline-inducible H-Ras expression vector. In response to 2 μg/ml doxycyclin, these cells gradually expressed H-Ras (Fig. 1C) and exhibited a spindle-like morphology with small round cell bodies (Fig. 1B). In addition, FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation was increased in a time-dependent manner over 96 h (Fig. 1C). In contrast, when these transformed cells were removed from doxycyclin containing medium and cultured in the absence of doxycyclin, H-Ras expression was decreased, cell morphology reverted to a normal phenotype (Fig. 1, B and D), and FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation was decreased (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that increased FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation is correlated with the transformation of NIH3T3 cells. FAK Tyrosine Phosphorylation at 861 Is Required for H-Ras Transformation of NIH3T3 Cells—To investigate the role of FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to replace tyrosine 861 with nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine residues (Y861F) and transfected HA-tagged Y861F into NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A). Compared with control cells, proliferations of wild-type FAK (wtFAK), kinase-defective FAK (kdFAK), and Y861F-transfected cells were not much altered, but cell migration was markedly increased in wtFAK-transfected cells and decreased in kdFAK- and Y861F-transfected cells (Fig. 2, B and C), implying that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation contributes to cell transformation through the regulation of migration rather than proliferation. Consistently, H-Ras-inducible NIH3T3 cells transfected with the Y861F mutant showed decreased migration, invasion, focus forming activity and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (Fig. 3), indicating that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation is critical for H-Ras transformation of NIH3T3 cells.Fig. 3FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 861 is essential for transforming activities in H-Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. H-Ras-inducible NIH3T3 cells transfected with vector, wtFAK, kdFAK, or Y861F mutant of FAK cDNA were treated with 2 g/ml of doxycyclin for the indicated periods of time. A, cells (5 × 104) were trypsinized and allowed to migrate on fibronectin-coated (10 μg/ml) Transwell plates for 2 h as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The percentages of cells migrating, relative to that of vector, are shown. B, cells (5 × 104) were loaded onto the upper compartments of Matrigel-coated Transwell plates and incubated for 13 h, and the number of invasive cells was counted. The percentages of invasive cells, relative to that of vector, are shown. C, cells were replated and incubated for 14 days, and transformed foci were visualized by Wright-Giemsa staining and counted. This experiment was repeated three times with nearly identical results. D, cells (1 × 105/dish) were seeded in soft agar and allowed to grow 21 days, and the number of viable colonies was counted. All of the results represent the averages of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) FAK Phosphorylation at Tyrosine 861 of FAK Regulates Its Interaction with p130CAS—Because FAK-mediated signaling involves interactions with the Src family kinases, FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation may affect the activity of Src kinase. The in vitro kinase assay, however, showed that transfection of FAK Y861F mutant had no effect on the activity of Src (Fig. 4A). Similarly, FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation had no effect on the activity of FAK (Fig. 4B), making it unlikely that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation regulates H-Ras transformation via the regulation of enzymatic activity. p130CAS has been shown to play a central role in transformation mediated by the v-src and H-Ras oncogenes (26Auvinen M. Paasinen-Sohns A. Hirai H. Andersson L. Holtta E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6513-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as being essential for FAK-mediated (27Wei L. Yang Y. Zhang X. Yu Q. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) cancer cell survival and migration (28Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.A. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7079-7090PubMed Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of Y861F, but neither wtFAK nor kdFAK, caused a decreased interaction between p130CAS and FAK in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5A). The interaction of p130CAS with FAK was increased in H-Ras-transformed cells but decreased in cells overexpressing Y861F (Fig. 5B), supporting the importance of the interaction of p130CAS with FAK in transformation. Interestingly, the total phosphorylation of FAK was decreased in Y861F-transfected cells, but there was no detectable change in p130CAS phosphorylation (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Mutation of tyrosine 861 to phenylalanine leads to reduced interaction with p130CAS. A, NIH3T3 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibody to FAK (left panel) or p130CAS (right panel), and the amount of protein in each immunoprecipitate was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies to FAK, p130CAS, HA, and phosphotyrosine (PY). B, H-Ras-inducible NIH3T3 cell lysates, FAK immunoprecipitates, and p130CAS immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The levels of FAK and p130CAS protein in each were assayed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. C, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated plates for the indicated periods of time. FAK and p130CAS immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The level of protein in each immunoprecipitate was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies to FAK and p130CAS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the integrin pathways are involved in the phosphorylation of FAK, the recruitment of adaptor proteins, and the subsequent activation of downstream effecter molecules, we assayed the interaction between p130CAS and FAK after plating the cells on fibronectin. Again, both the interaction of p130CAS with FAK and the phosphorylation of FAK were decreased in Y861F-transfected cells during spreading (Fig. 5C). The proline-rich domain1 (PR1) of FAK is required for its interaction with the SH3 domain of p130CAS (8Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Because FAK Tyr861 is located between PR1 and PR2, FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation may affect the interaction of this protein with p130CAS. We therefore performed a GST pull-down assay using three GST-FAK recombinants (PR1PR2, PR1PR2F, and PR2) and H-Ras-inducible NIH3T3 whole cell lysate. We found that in vitro phosphorylation of GST-PR1PR2 (23Lim Y. Han I. Kwon H.J. Oh E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12735-12740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Eliceiri B.P. Puente X.S. Hood J.D. Stupack D.G. Schlaepfer D.D. Huang X.Z. Sheppard D. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) caused a dramatic increase in the amount of p130CAS bound to GST-PR1PR2 (Fig. 6, compare the second and third lanes with the fifth and sixth lanes), whereas we were unable to detect p130CAS bound to in vitro phosphorylated GST-PR2. These results strongly suggest that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation regulates the interaction of FAK with p130CAS. A Mutation in FAK Tyrosine 861 Results in Decreased JNK Activation and Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Expression—The FAK/p130CAS complex has been observed to regulate cell transformation through JNK-mediated transcriptional regulation (29Shibata K. Kikkawa F. Nawa A. Thant A.A. Naruse K. Mizutani S. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 900-903PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the activation of JNK was consistently defective in H-Ras-inducible NIH3T3 transfected with the Y861F mutant (Fig. 7A). We also observed consistent decreases in the expression of MMP-9 mRNA (Fig. 7B), and gelatin zymography of cell conditioned media showed decreased expression of MMP-9 (Fig. 7C). These results confirmed that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation regulates the interaction of FAK with p130CAS, resulting in the activation of JNK and the secretion of MMP-9. Although the relationship between FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation and transformation and/or tumorigenesis has been noted (20Slack J.K. Adams R.B. Rovin J.D. Bissonette E.A. Stoker C.E. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Abu-Ghazaleh R. Kabir J. Jia H. Lobo M. Zachary I. Biochem. J. 2001; 15: 255-264Crossref Google Scholar, 22Vadlamudi R.K.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which this phosphorylation affects cell phenotype has not been directly addressed. The results shown here indicate that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation regulates H-Ras-induced transformation of fibroblasts by regulating the interaction between FAK and p130CAS. We observed a clear correlation between FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation and the transformed morphology and activity in these cells. The ability of FAK to integrate signals requires the integrity of tyrosine 397, a major autophosphorylation site that mediates the SH2-dependent binding of Src family kinases, which are crucial regulators of cell transformation. We therefore thought it likely that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation might regulate cell transformation by regulating FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 397. We found, however, that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation did not affect FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation or the phosphorylation of the endogenous FAK substrate, paxillin. Elevated Src activity has been shown to correlate with increased FAK phosphorylation in tumor cells, and a stable complex between FAK and activated Src has been described in Src-transformed cells (31Hauck C.R. Hsia D.A. Puente X.S. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6289-6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting that increased Src activity/interaction could potentially contribute to transformation (4Hecker T.P. Grammer J.R. Gillespie G.Y. Stewart J. Gladson C.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2699-2707PubMed Google Scholar, 33Guan J.-L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). We found, however, that Src activity was not much different in cells transfected with FAK Y861F mutant compared with those transfected with vector and that the interaction of FAK with Src was not affected by this mutation (data not shown). Taken together, these findings indicate that it is unlikely that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation regulates cell transformation through FAK/Src complex activity. p130CAS has been considered a putative substrate of the v-Src kinase and a binding target for the SH2 domain of v-Crk during retroviral transformation (17Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Recently, p130CAS phosphorylation and the interaction of p130CAS with FAK have been reported as important in cell transformation (8Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 35Burnham M.R. Harte M.T. Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Bouton A.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2467-2472PubMed Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated that the association of FAK with p130CAS was decreased in FAK Y861F-transfected cells and that, in vitro, FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation enhanced this association. In addition, the interaction of p130CAS with FAK was decreased during cell transformation in H-Ras-inducible NIH3T3 cells expressing the Y861F mutant. These results strongly suggest that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation regulates cell transformation through regulation of the interaction between FAK and p130CAS. Interestingly, although total FAK phosphorylation was decreased in Y861F-transfected cells, there was no detectable change of p130CAS phosphorylation, which is an important event leading to cell transformation and consistent with the unchanged Src and FAK activity observed in these cells. The signal downstream of the FAK/p130CAS complex may affect ras transformation of fibroblasts in several ways. The activation of p130CAS creates binding sites for adaptor proteins such as Crk, which is critical for cell transformation (32Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J. Hanafusa H. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar). Rac-mediated JNK activation downstream of the p130CAS-Crk complex is essential for cell invasion (34Hsia D.A. Mitra S.K. Hauck C.R. Streblow D.N. Nelson J.A. Ilic D. Huang S. Li E. Nemerow G.R. Leng J. Spencer K.S. Cheresh D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and acts to alter the transcriptional regulation of cell invasion-associated gene targets, including MMP-9 (29Shibata K. Kikkawa F. Nawa A. Thant A.A. Naruse K. Mizutani S. Hamaguchi M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 900-903PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, FAK promotes cell motility and focal contact remodeling events, in part through the regulation of MMP-9 secretion (28Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.A. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7079-7090PubMed Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated that both the activation of JNK and the secretion of MMP-9 were defective in the FAK Y861F mutant. These findings strongly support the notion that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation is crucial for FAK/p130CAS-mediated cell transformation. Because in vitro phosphorylated tyrosine 861 clearly enhanced the interaction of FAK with p130CAS, it is likely that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation regulates this interaction. This result was somewhat unexpected, because this interaction is through the SH3 domain of p130CAS and the PR1 domain of FAK, in which tyrosine 861 is not present. It is possible, however, that FAK Tyr861 phosphorylation serves to stabilize pre-existing interactions by creating an additional SH2-binding site. We are currently attempting to identify another adaptor molecule that contains an SH2 domain and binds to FAK in a Tyr861 phosphorylation-dependent manner."

In response to genotoxic stresses, E2F1 is stabilized by signals that include ATM-dependent phosphorylation. We recently demonstrated that DNA damage induces also E2F1 acetylation, which is required for its recruitment onto apoptotic gene promoters. Here we show that E2F1 is stabilized in response to doxorubicin and cisplatin treatments even in the absence of either ATM-dependent phosphorylation or p53 and cAbl, two major transducers of DNA damage signaling. We found that acetylation of E2F1 is, instead, required to stabilize the protein in response to doxorubicin. Finally, we report that the formation of E2F1-p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (P/CAF) complexes is preferentially induced in doxorubicin-treated cells, and that P/CAF acetyltransferase (HAT), but not p300 HAT activity, is required for a significant E2F1 stabilization and accumulation. Our results unveil a differential role of P/CAF and p300 in acetylation-induced stabilization of E2F1, thus supporting a specific role for P/CAF HAT activity in E2F1-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

E2F1 belongs to the E2F family of transcription factors. Seven different E2F members (E2F1 through E2F7) (1Di Stefano L. Jensen M.R. Helin K.

As a heterodimeric complex with the DP-1 protein, E2F1 binds to promoters containing E2F-responsive elements and activates transcription through its C-terminal activation domain. Initial studies implicated E2F1 in the control of cell-cycle progression, because many E2F1 target genes encode S-phase regulatory proteins as well as proteins regulating cell-cycle progression and DNA synthesis. However, transcriptional activation of cell-cycle-related genes is only one facet of E2F1 activity. Recent data obtained both from mouse and cellular models and from microarray analysis demonstrate that E2F1 has important roles also in modulating antiproliferative processes such as senescence and apoptosis (5Ginsberg D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). E2F1 activity is regulated at different levels. First, the transactivation potential of E2F1 is negatively affected by the interaction with the retinoblastoma gene product pRb. The E2F1-bound Rb inhibits transcription actively by contact with promoter-bound proteins (6Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 7Zhang H.S. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The E2F1-Rb interaction is limited by Rb phosphorylation, which is mainly mediated by the cyclin D/cyclin-dependent kinase-4 at the G1/S transition (11Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). A second level of control of E2F1 activity concerns the regulation of its DNA-binding ability. Indeed, E2F1 interacts directly with cyclin A, which results in phosphorylation of DP-1 in S phase, causing down-regulation of E2F binding to DNA (12Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 161-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 13Krek W. Xu G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A final level of regulation of E2F1 relates to the control of its abundance by a number of mechanisms. After mitogenic stimuli, one or more E2F species activate(s) the E2F1 promoter in late G1, resulting in an increase in E2F1 RNA and protein synthesis. Conversely, transcription of the E2F1 gene decreases in late S, because of the negative regulation of the DNA-binding activity of E2F1–3 by cyclin A/cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (14Hateboer G. Kerkhoven R.M. Shvarts A. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2960-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 15Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). E2F1 protein levels are also regulated by the ubiquitination-dependent proteasome degradation. The epitope recognized by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is located in the carboxyl terminus, near the acidic activation domain of E2F1 (16Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E5-E7Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Both post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) kinase and protein-protein interactions with pRb have been shown to increase E2F1 stability through the inhibition of the ubiquitination process (18Vandel L. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4280-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Distinct modalities of E2F1 regulation might be responsible for opposite outcomes of its activation, cell-cycle progression, or apoptosis. A prompt response to genotoxic stresses has been reported to induce stabilization of E2F1 through its phosphorylation by the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, the ATM and RAD3-related (ATR) kinase (19Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar) and the checkpoint kinase 2 (20Stevens C. Smith L. La Thangue N.B. Nat.

We recently demonstrated that DNA damage also causes the acetylation-dependent activation of E2F1 apoptotic potential by boosting E2F1-driven transcription of the proapoptotic target gene p73 (22Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although E2F1 can be acetylated by both p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor (P/CAF) and CREB-binding protein/P300 acetylases in vitro at the same lysine residues (23Marzio G. Wagener C.

Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), the relationship between this post-translational modification and the stabilization of E2F1 in response to DNA damage has not been explored. We describe here a specific role for P/CAF in the acetylation-induced accumulation of E2F1 in response to DNA damage. Cell Culture and Transfections—Human fibroblast cell lines AT-TERT and HFF-TERT, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) 3T3 ABL-/-, 3T3 P53-/-, and 3T3 E2F1-/-, U2OS and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum. Human glioblastoma cell line T98G was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. MEFs 3T3 ABL-/- and 3T3 P53-/- were kindly provided by Dr. J. Y. J. Wang. AT-TERT and HFF-TERT were kindly provided by Dr. J. Y. J. Wang and Dr. L. Wood. MEFs 3T3 E2F1 -/- were kindly provided by Dr. L. Yamasaki. Transfections were performed either with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions or with the standard CaPO4 method. Plasmids—The wild-type E2F1 expression vector was generated by subcloning the PCR-generated full-length E2F1 cDNA into the HApCDNA3 vector. The expression vectors pCDNA-HA-E2F1-S31/A (HA-E2F1-S/A) and pCDNA-HA-E2F1-K117,12,125R (HA-E2F1-R) were generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing. The PMCV E2F1, the wild-type and ΔHAT (Δ 579–608) PCI P/CAF and the wild type and ΔHAT (LY-RR) PCI p300 expression vectors were kindly provided by V. Sartorelli and P. L. Puri (25Sartorelli V.

Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: anti-E2F1 (C-20), anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal (F-7) and polyclonal (Y-11), anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (FL), anti-actin (I-19), and the agarose-conjugate anti-HA monoclonal (F7). Monoclonal anti-acetyl-lysines were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS), and the insoluble pellet was discarded after centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Extracts were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and protein A/G plus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Pulse-chase—Subconfluent T98G cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 4 μg of either HA-E2F1-WT or with HA-E2F1-R. 12 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated to normalize for the efficiency of transfection. 24 h after transfection, cells were starved for 1 h in methionine-cysteine-free medium and subsequently incubated with 200 μCi/ml of Promix (containing [35S]methionine-cysteine, Promix-Amersham) for 30 min. Medium with an excess of unlabelled methionine-cysteine (1 mg/ml) with or without doxorubicin 2 μm (Sigma) was then added, and cells were collected at the indicated times. The 35S-labeled HA-E2F1 in the anti-HA immunoprecipitate from each time point was quantified by PhosphorImager and normalized to that of the zero time point. Cycloheximide Chase—Transfected U2OS cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes. Two days after transfection, cells were treated with 2 μm doxorubicin for 8 h, and then Me2SO-solubilized cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for the indicated times. E2F1 Is Induced in Response to DNA Damage in the AT-Tert Human ATM-defective Cell Line—Genotoxic stress has been shown to induce both phosphorylation and acetylation of E2F1 protein (19Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To investigate the relative contribution of these two post-translational events in E2F1 stabilization induced by genotoxic stresses, we first assessed the role of the ATM/ATR pathway in E2F1 activation in response to DNA damage. To this purpose, we analyzed ATM-defective primary fibroblasts derived from a patient affected with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and immortalized by the stable expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (AT-TERT) (26Wood L.D. Halvorsen T.L. Dhar S. Baur J.A. Pandita R.K. Wright W.E. Hande M.P. Calaf G. Hei T.K. Levine F. Shay J.W. Wang J.J. Pandita T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of AT-TERT cells with doxorubicin still leads to stabilization of the E2F1 protein, although to a lesser extent and with a delayed kinetics, with respect to control HFF-TERT cells (Fig. 1a). To rule out the hypothesis that the ATM and RAD3-related kinase ATR might be responsible for the delayed accumulation of E2F1 observed in our cells, we compared the kinetics of stabilization of wild-type E2F1 versus the E2F1 mutant (HA-E2F1-S/A) that cannot be phosphorylated by both ATM and ATR. We observed that exogenously expressed wild-type E2F1 was already accumulated after 1 h of doxorubicin treatment, whereas induction of the exogenously expressed HA-E2F1-S/A mutant still occurred, although it was delayed (Fig. 1b). Taken together, our data imply that additional post-translational events, other than ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation, might contribute to E2F1 stabilization in cells exposed to the DNA-damaging drug doxorubicin. E2F1 Stabilization in Response to DNA-damaging Drugs Is Independent of P53 and cAbl—Searching for additional pathways involved in DNA-damage-dependent stabilization of E2F1, we analyzed the role of p53. Indeed, increasing evidence suggests that the integrity of the Rb pathway could influence the activity of p53 and vice versa. E2F1 cooperates with p53 to induce apoptosis by increasing ARF transcription and thereby blocking murine double minute 2 (MDM2)-mediated p53 degradation (27Zhu J.W. DeRyckere D. Li F.X. Wan Y.Y. DeGregori J. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 829-838PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that p53 interacts directly with the E2F1/DP1 complex through the cyclin A-binding domain located in the N terminus of E2F1. Cyclin A inhibits E2F1 binding to p53 in vitro and abrogates the ability of E2F1 to cooperate with p53 to induce apoptosis in vivo in response to DNA damage (28Hsieh J.K. Yap D. O'Connor D.J. Fogal V. Fallis L. Chan F. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 78-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 lies upstream of E2F1 in the apoptotic pathway induced by UV treatment in mouse keratinocytes (29Wikonkal N.M. Remenyik E. Knezevic D. Zhang W. Liu M. Zhao H. Berton T.R. Johnson D.G. Brash D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2a, endogenous E2F1 accumulates to a very similar extent in p53-/- MEFs as compared with wild-type MEFs exposed to either cisplatin or doxorubicin, thus ruling out the requirement of p53 protein in this context. Next we analyzed the requirement of the cAbl tyrosine kinase for E2F1 stabilization in response to DNA damage. cAbl is involved in multiple DNA damage signaling pathways. In response to IR treatment, cAbl induces the phosphorylation of the proapoptotic p73 protein and controls its accumulation and apoptotic activity in response to cisplatin and doxorubicin (30Gong J.G.

Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2b, endogenous E2F1 protein accumulates in response to both treatments in cAbl-/- MEFs, thus excluding a role for this kinase in this context. E2F1 Acetylation Is Required for Its Stabilization in Response to DNA Damage—E2F1 can be acetylated in vitro at lysine residues 117, 120, and 125 by P/CAF and, to a lesser extent, p300 acetyltransferases (23Marzio G. Wagener C. Gutierrez M.I. Cartwright P. Helin K. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10887-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Acetylation of these residues leads to increased DNA-binding affinity, induction of its transcriptional activity, and accumulation of the protein. Because doxorubicin treatment leads to the accumulation of acetylated E2F1 protein species (Fig. 3a; Ref. 22Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that DNA damage-induced acetylation might be responsible for the E2F1 stabilization we observed in the absence of ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation. To assess whether E2F1 acetylation is required for its stabilization after genotoxic stress, we first analyzed the behavior of a non-acetylatable E2F1 mutant protein (HA-E2F1-R) (24Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3b, exogenously expressed wild-type E2F1 is clearly accumulated 5 h after doxorubicin treatment, whereas the HA-E2F1-R mutant is not accumulated at all at the time points investigated. Doxorubicin treatment does not change cellular levels of E2F1 mRNA (data not shown; Refs. 24Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34Blattner C. Sparks A. Lane D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether acetylation might affect protein half-life in cells exposed to DNA-damaging drugs. The levels of exogenously expressed wild-type E2F1 and HA-E2F1-R proteins were monitored in a pulse-chase experiment, either in the presence or the absence of doxorubicin. Fig. 3c shows that HA-E2F1-WT half-life is significantly prolonged in response to doxorubicin treatment, whereas the half-life of the HA-E2F1-R mutant remains unaffected. Altogether, these results indicate that acetylation of E2F1 is required to stabilize the protein in response to DNA damage. Different Role for P/CAF and P300 in E2F1 Stabilization after DNA Damage—In vitro studies indicate that P/CAF is more efficient in acetylating E2F1 with respect to p300. However, the relative role of the two acetyltransferases in influencing E2F1 stability following genotoxic stress was not determined. To address this issue, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to investigate the ability of P/CAF and p300 to form complexes with E2F1 in response to DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 4a, immunoprecipitation of exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged P/CAF in E2F1-/- MEFs treated with doxorubicin results in increased levels of co-immunoprecipitated exogenous HA-E2F1 (lanes 1–2). Likewise, exogenously expressed HA-E2F1 co-immunoprecipitates FLAG-P/CAF only in treated cells (Fig. 4a, lanes 3–4). Unlike P/CAF, p300 complex formation with E2F1 is not modulated by doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 4a, lanes 5–6). To investigate the relative contributions of P/CAF and p300, and, specifically, of their HAT activity in E2F1 stabilization in response to DNA damage, we performed a cycloheximide chase on transfected U2OS cells treated with doxorubicin. As shown in Fig. 4b, exogenously expressed P/CAF (lanes 4–6, row a) and p300 (lanes 10–12, row a) do not alter E2F1 half-life in untreated cells. Conversely, in doxorubicin-treated cells, the half-life of E2F1 is significantly prolonged in the presence of P/CAF (compare lanes 4–6 to lanes 1–3, row c). Stabilization of E2F1 is likely due to the activation of the P/CAF acetyltransferase activity, because the P/CAF-ΔHAT mutant (lanes 7–9 versus lanes 1–3, row c), deleted of the acetyltransferase domain, is unable to stabilize E2F1, when compared with wild-type P/CAF. On the other hand, p300 (lanes 10–12 versus lanes 1–3, row c) only slightly increased E2F1 half-life in the presence of doxorubicin, whereas its HAT-defective mutant (lanes 13–15 versus lanes 1–3, row c) showed behavior similar to the control empty vector both in treated and untreated cells. Many transcription factors have been identified as substrates for P/CAF and p300/CREB-binding protein (35Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Particularly, acetylation regulates the transcriptional activity of p73 and p53 in response to genotoxic stress (36Xu Y. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that DNA damage induces E2F1 apoptotic potential (22Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This is achieved by the selective relocalization of E2F1 from cell-cycle progression genes to the promoter of the proapoptotic p73 gene, where E2F1 accumulates into transcriptionally active complexes that include the acetyltransferase coactivator P/CAF. We found that E2F1 acetylation is required in this context (22Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Here we report that in addition to specifying its transcriptional potential, DNA damage-induced acetylation of E2F1 is also important for its accumulation. Indeed, the finding that E2F1 is stabilized in the ATM-defective cell line AT-TERT strongly suggests that additional pathways, other than ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation, are required to stabilize E2F1 in response to genotoxic stress. We ruled out a role for p53 and cAbl, two of the major transducers of DNA-damage signaling, in inducing E2F1 accumulation in this context. We found that DNA damage-induced acetylation of E2F1 is the major determinant of its accumulation. We further assessed the relative role of the two acetyltransferases P/CAF and p300, both previously reported to be involved in E2F1 acetylation. Although E2F1 binding to p300 is unaffected by DNA damage, the affinity between P/CAF and E2F1 is strongly increased in doxorubicin-treated cells. Accordingly, only the HAT activity of P/CAF, and not that of p300, is required to induce a prolongation of E2F1 half-life in the presence of genotoxic stress. The mechanisms that lead to the increased stability of the acetylated E2F1 protein still remain elusive. Acetylation of p53 has also been reported to induce its stabilization by preventing its MDM2-dependent ubiquitination (37Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Similarly to p53, E2F1 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Phosphorylation at the Ser-403 in S phase by the TFIIH kinase targets E2F1 for its rapid ubiquitination and degradation (18Vandel L. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4280-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One mechanism might be that acetylation of E2F1 competes with the TFIIH-dependent phosphorylation, thus subtracting the fraction of E2F1 targeted for elimination. Furthermore, binding to Rb also protects E2F1 from its ubiquitination (14Hateboer G. Kerkhoven R.M. Shvarts A. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2960-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 15Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A differential interaction of E2F1 with Rb in response to DNA damage may impart distinct fates to the protein. This possibility is also suggested by the recent identification of an additional binding site for E2F1 on Rb, which putatively controls E2F1-apoptotic functions and is regulated by DNA damage (38Dick F.A. Dyson N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 639-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These observations and the results we reported here, together with the fact that Rb functions are regulated by acetylation as well (39Chan H.M. Krstic-Demonacos M. Smith L. Demonacos C. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), suggest that acetylation might coordinately control Rb/E2F1 interaction in response to DNA damage and, in this way, E2F1 stability and apoptotic activity. In conclusion, the findings reported here support previous observations (22Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), indicating that E2F1 acetylation plays a pivotal role in the recruitment of its apoptotic potential and are consistent with a two-step model of E2F1-driven apoptotic response to DNA-damaging agents. In this model, DNA damage first enhances P/CAF-dependent acetylation of E2F1, resulting in its stabilization and formation of stable protein complexes with P/CAF. The increased levels of acetylated E2F1 are then available for its selective recruitment onto the p73 gene promoter to trigger the apoptotic response. Whether this mechanism is impaired in human cancers, frequently associated to genetic impairments of the Rb/E2F1 pathway, or might be exploited to improve the therapeutic index of genotoxic anticancer drugs, will represent the goal of our future investigations.

We investigated Jak1 localization using subcellular fractionation techniques and fluorescence microscopy (immunofluorescence and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged Jaks). In the different experimental approaches we found Jak1 (as well as Jak2 and Tyk2) predominantly located at membranes. In contrast to previous reports we did not observe Jak proteins in significant amounts within the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization observed for the Jak1 mutant L80A/Y81A, which is unable to associate with cytokine receptors, indicates that Jak1 does not have a strong intrinsic membrane binding potential and that only receptor binding is crucial for the membrane recruitment. Finally we show that Jak1 remains a membrane-localized protein after cytokine stimulation.

The Janus kinase family of protein-tyrosine kinases comprises four mammalian members. Three, Jak1, 1The abbreviations used are: Jak, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; JH, Jak homology; FERM, four-point-one ezrin radixin moesin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; IFN, interferon; OSM, oncostatin M; IL-6, interleukin-6; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: Jak, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; JH, Jak homology; FERM, four-point-one ezrin radixin moesin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; IFN, interferon; OSM, oncostatin M; IL-6, interleukin-6; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; WT, wild type. Jak2, and Tyk2, are expressed in a wide variety of tissues, whereas Jak3 expression is restricted to cells of the hematopoietic system. Janus kinases non-covalently associate with the cytoplasmic parts of cytokine receptors and play a crucial role in the initial steps of cytokine signaling (1Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Upon cytokine-induced receptor dimerization the Jaks are thought to transphosphorylate and thereby autoactivate themselves. The kinases subsequently phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor cytoplasmic tail providing docking sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing signaling proteins. These include transcription factors of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family. Upon phosphorylation, STATs translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of their target genes.Based on sequence similarities between the Jaks (molecular masses of 120–140 kDa) seven Jak homology (JH) regions have been defined (2Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Kurban R.R. Ralph S.J. Zurcher G. Ziemiecki A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, the JH domains match the functional domains only partially. The JH1 domain, at the C terminus, a classical tyrosine kinase domain, is flanked by a pseudokinase domain (JH2) that may play a regulatory role (3Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell.

FERM domains are composed of three subdomains: F1 with a ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold, F2 with an acyl-coenzyme A-binding protein-like fold, and F3, which shares the fold of phosphotyrosine binding or pleckstrin homology domains. F1, F2, and F3 together form a compact clover-shaped structure (12Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A.

Jak binding to at least some cytokine receptors is crucial for receptor surface expression (26Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G. Richter M.F. Uzé G. Ling L. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

However, Jak functions may not be restricted to cell surface receptors. In a recent study Jak2 has been identified as the kinase that associates with p97, a member of the AAA family (ATPases associated with different cellular activities), which is involved in membrane fusion and assembly of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum (31Lavoie C. Chevet E. Roy L. Tonks N.K. Fazel A. Posner B.I. Paiement J. Bergeron J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13637-13642Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional data imply a localization of Jaks at cellular membranes, at the cell surface, and at the endoplasmic reticulum. However, previous reports investigating Jak localization describe a predominant nuclear localization of Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 (32Sorenson R.L. Stout L.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 33Lobie P.E. Ronsin B. Silvennoinen O. Haldosen L.A. Norstedt G. Morel G.

The significance of nuclear Janus kinases is not clear given that all functional features of Jak proteins point to their involvement in events occurring at the cell surface or at intracellular membranes.Therefore we reinvestigated the localization of Jak1 using cell fractionation techniques and fluorescence microscopy and always using Jak-deficient cells as controls. The subcellular distribution of fluorescent Jak1 fusion proteins was monitored in living cells. We found the Janus kinases were located mainly at membranes. Virtually no Jak1 seems to be present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Cytokine stimulation did not change the localization of Jak1. However, a Jak1 mutant unable to associate with cytokine receptors due to point mutations in the FERM subdomain F1 was distributed evenly in the cytoplasm indicating that receptor binding is crucial for the observed membrane localization.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells (human embryonic kidney cells obtained from DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany); 2C4, U4C, γ2A, 2fTGH, and U1A cells (human fibrosarcoma cells kindly provided by Dr. I. Kerr, Cancer Research UK, London); HeLa cells (cervix carcinoma cells obtained from DSMZ), and Chinese hamster ovary cells obtained from DSMZ were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). A375 cells (human melanoma cells obtained from ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). HepG2 cells (human hepatoma cells obtained from DSMZ) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Nutrient Mix F-12 medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were maintained in C-22010 endothelial cell growth medium with the supplement mixture C-39215 (Promo cell). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. G418 (400 μg/ml) was added to the medium of 2C4, U4C, and γ2A cells, while 2fTGH and U1A cells were supplemented with 250 μg/ml hygromycin. The U4C-Jak1, U4C-Jak1-YFP, U4C-Jak1-L80A/Y81A, and U4C-Jak1-L80A/Y81A-YFP cells were cultured with 500 μg/ml hygromycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere at 5% CO2.Transient transfection of HEK293T and γ2A cells was carried out using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) and Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. U4C cells stably expressing Jak1, Jak1-L80A/Y81A, Jak1-YFP, and Jak1-L80A/Y81A-YFP were generated using the Flp-In™ T-Rex™ system from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's recommendation. IFN-γ and OSM were obtained from Peprotech. Recombinant IL-6 was prepared as described previously (36Arcone R. Pucci P. Zappacosta F. Fontaine V. Malorni A. Marino G. Ciliberto G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Plasmids—The fluorescent protein cDNA derived from pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) was inserted into the pSVL-Jak1-wt-MCS using the NotI/ApaI sites introduced by PCR resulting in the plasmid pSVL-Jak1-YFP. The construct pEF-Jak2-YFP was generated by inserting the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) cDNA using AgeI/BsrGI sites and the Jak2 cDNA via the restriction sites SalI/NheI. The construct pSVL-Jak1-L80A/Y81A-YFP was generated by restricting pSVL-Jak1-L80A/Y81A (10Haan C. Is'harc H. Hermanns H.M. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. Behrmann I. J.

The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing using the ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The plasmids pcDNA5/FRT/Jak1-YFP and pcDNA5/FRT/Jak1-L80A/Y81A-YFP were generated by inserting the Jak1-YFP and Jak1-L80A/Y81A cDNA from the pSVL constructs as a NotI/EcoRV fragment into pcDNA5/FRT/TO©.Cell Fractionation—All fractionation and centrifugation steps were performed at 4 °C using ice-cold buffers. Two 75-mm2 cell culture dishes of cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were removed by two 15-min centrifugation steps at 500 rpm. The supernatant was centrifuged at 12,500 × g using a 5415D centrifuge from Eppendorf to yield the crude cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) and the membrane pellet comprising mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the plasma membrane (pellet). The crude cytoplasmic fraction was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to yield the pure cytoplasmic fraction. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 1% Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) to solubilize the membranes and the embedded or associated proteins. After a 30-min lysis the insoluble material was pelleted at 12,500 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant constituted the membrane fraction containing the solubilized membrane proteins and those associated with them. Nuclear fractions were prepared as described by Buckley (37Buckley A.R. Crowe P.D. Russell D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8649-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The crude nuclear pellet obtained as described above (centrifugation of Dounce-homogenized cell homogenate at 500 rpm) was resuspended in 1 ml of nuclear isolation buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40 (IGEPAL CA630 from ICN Biomedicals Inc.), 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 5 min to solubilize the membrane contaminations, and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 rpm. This procedure was repeated once. The purified nuclei were lysed using 1 ml of 2% Triton-containing nuclear lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 280 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 10 min. The insoluble structures were solubilized in 1 ml of Laemmli buffer by heating and vigorous mixing for 10 min at 85 °C.Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed on the dish with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Brij 96 or 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm EDTA. After incubation of the cleared lysates with antibodies, the immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A-Sepharose (1 h at 4 °C), washed three times with lysis buffer, and analyzed further by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with the respective antibodies. Anti-Jak1 (J24320, Transduction Laboratories), anti-Tyk2 (T20220, Transduction Laboratories), anti-lamin A/C (636, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-calnexin (610523, Transduction Laboratories), anti-flotillin (610820, Transduction Laboratories), anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-STAT3 (610189, Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705) (9131, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-STAT1 (S21120, Transduction Laboratories), and anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701) (9171, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) were used for detection. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako. Signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Studies—The different cell types were seeded on 18-mm coverslips coated with collagen and cultivated in 12-well plates. Cells were fixed using 4% formaldehyde in PBS2+ (1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2 in PBS) for 10 min, 2% formaldehyde + 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS2+ for 10 min, or acetone/methanol (1:1) or methanol for 15 min at –20 °C. After fixation the cells were washed twice with PBS2+, permeabilized, and blocked with PBS2+ containing 0.05% saponin and 3% BSA for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody at a dilution of 1:200–1:1000 in PBS2+ for 60 min. After washing four times with PBS2+ containing 0.05% saponin and 3% BSA, the fixed cells were incubated with the appropriate fluorescently labeled secondary antibody at a 1:100 dilution in PBS2+ containing 0.05% saponin and 3% BSA for 30 min. After further washing with PBS2+ containing 0.05% saponin and 3% BSA the slides were mounted using a Mowiol-containing mounting medium (10% (w/v) Mowiol (Calbiochem), 25% (w/v) glycerin, 25% (v/v) water, 45% (v/v) 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5). Substituting saponin for 0.1% Triton or leaving out BSA from the incubation and washing buffers led to no improvement of the staining pattern that was observed with the protocol above. In addition the protocols recommended by the providers of the respective antibodies were also tested. The monoclonal antibody against lamin A/C (636, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used in all experiments as positive control. Another positive control was the FITC-conjugated β-tubulin antibody TUB2.1 (F2043, Sigma). For the detection of Jak1 proteins the following antibodies were tested: a polyclonal serum (kindly provided by A. Ziemiecki), the polyclonal antibody HR785 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), the polyclonal antibody 06-272 (Upstate Biotechnology), the monoclonal antibody MAB3700 (Chemicon), and the monoclonal antibody J24320 (Transduction Laboratories). The Jak2 antibodies were a polyclonal serum (kindly provided by A. Ziemiecki) and the polyclonal antibody 06-255 (Upstate Biotechnology). For immunofluorescence staining of Tyk2 we used the monoclonal anti-Tyk2 antibody T20220 (Transduction Laboratories). The Cy3-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (715-165-150) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (711-165-152) secondary antibodies were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Imaging of the cells was carried out on the Axiovert 100M fluorescence microscope from Zeiss (Jena, Germany) equipped with an Axiocam color digital camera using a water-corrected Plan-Apochromat (63×) objective. FITC fluorescence was detected using a 50-watt mercury lamp and filter set 09 from Zeiss (BP 450–490 nm for excitation; LP > 551 for detection). Cy3 fluorescence was detected using a 50-watt mercury lamp and filter set 15 from Zeiss (band-pass filter, 446–458 nm for excitation; long pass filter > 590 for detection).Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal imaging of living cells was carried out on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a water-corrected Plan-Apochromat (63×) objective. The LSM 510 is equipped with an argon ion laser (λ = 458 nm, λ = 488 nm, and λ = 514 nm) and a helium/neon laser (λ = 543 nm) (Zeiss). The laser was modulated by an acousto-optical modulator. The beam path of YFP contained excitation at 514 nm, a main dichroic mirror of 514 nm, and a long pass filter of >530 nm. Transfected cells were grown on 18-mm glass coverslips. 48 h after transfection the coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber that allowed a constant flow with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. To maintain a temperature of 37 °C during all image acquisition, the perfusion chamber and the objective were thermostated. For qualitative cell imaging, a laser power of 35% of 25 milliwatts was used. The transmission and detector gains were set to achieve best signal to noise ratios.Flow Cytometry—Cells were resuspended in cold PBS supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide (PBS/azide). 5 × 105–1 × 106 cells in 100 μl of PBS/azide were incubated with 1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-MHC-I (W6/32, Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with cold PBS/azide. To visualize the bound antibodies, the cells were subsequently incubated in darkness with a 1:50 dilution of a R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Fab (Dianova) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were again washed with cold PBS/azide, and then 104 cells per sample were analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 488 nm argon laser.RESULTSIn Cell Fractionation Experiments Jak1 Is Exclusively Found in Membrane Fractions but Not in the Cytoplasm or the Nucleus—We investigated the localization of endogenous Jak1 and Tyk2 in a number of cell lines and primary HUVECs by using cell fractionation techniques. The cells were fractionated as described under “Materials and Methods,” and Jak1 and Tyk2 were detected by Western blot analysis. The blots were counterstained with antibodies against marker proteins of the different subcellular fractions. Calnexin or flotillin were used as membrane fraction markers, and lamin A and C were used as nuclear marker proteins. Cytoplasmic proteins have been defined as those soluble after 1-h ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. A predominant membrane localization of Jak1 and Tyk2 was found in the hepatoma cell line HepG2, in the cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa, in the melanoma cell line A375, in HUVECs, in 2C4 and 2fTGH fibrosarcoma cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 17, and 23), and in Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). Jak1 and Tyk2 were, however, not found in significant amounts in the cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions (Fig. 1A). In all experiments Jak1 detection in cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions could be related to membrane contamination. In the case of HepG2 and HeLa cells, a weak Jak1 and Tyk2 band in the nucleus correlates with a weak flotillin band in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 6). For HUVECs, membrane contamination of the cytoplasmic fraction is probably the cause for the weak Jak1 signal (Fig. 1A, lane 10). To prove the identity of the Western blot bands of Jak1 and Tyk2 we fractionated human fibrosarcoma cells (2C4 and 2fTGH) and cells derived from those that are deficient in Jak1 (U4C) or Tyk2 (U1A) (38Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). For an overview of the Jak-deficient cell lines see Table I. 2C4 and 2fTGH cells showed the same membrane distribution of Jak1 and Tyk2 already observed in the other cell types. In U4C cells no Jak1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 13–15) and in U1A cells virtually no Tyk2 (Fig. 1A, lanes 19–21) could be detected, thus the respective antibodies we used are specific for Jak1 or Tyk2 and can be used to detect these proteins in this assay. However, the results with the Tyk2 antibody are not entirely satisfactory since it detected a slight unspecific band in the cytoplasmic fraction that has a mobility similar to Tyk2. (In fact Jak2 was excluded from the fractionation study because strong unspecific bands in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions interfered with an unambiguous detection of the endogenous Jak2.)Table IOverview of the Jak-defective cell lines usedParental cellDerived deficient cell2C4U4C (Jak1-deficient)γ2A (Jak2-deficient)2fTGHU1A (Tyk2-deficient) Open table in a new tab Interestingly the membrane fraction contains only approximately half of the total Jak1 (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2 and 4). This is due to the fact that a significant amount of plasma membrane and internal membranes are pelleted with the nuclei during the fractionation procedure. To solubilize these membranes the nuclei were washed twice with Nonidet P40-containing buffer. The first Nonidet P40 wash fraction of the nuclei contains the other half of the membranes as shown by the presence of calnexin and Jaks in this fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 4, labeled 1. wash). In the second wash fraction almost no membrane markers and Jaks were found (data not shown). Thus, the amount of membrane-associated Jaks is even higher in comparison with the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as it appears from the Western blots of membrane fractions. Importantly no lysis of the nuclei occurs upon incubation with Nonidet P-40-containing buffer as shown by the lack of lamin A/C in this fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 4). The small amount of cytoplasmic Jak1 separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel consisted of two bands of different mobility (Fig. 1B, lane 1 (long exp.)). The lower band of increased mobility might represent a Jak1 lacking posttranslational modifications or an intermediate degradation product.All Tested Jak Antibodies Were Not Suited for Immunofluorescence—We intended to use immunofluorescence as a second independent method to investigate Jak subcellular localization. To identify Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 antibodies suited for immunofluorescence we tested a number of Jak antibodies in human fibrosarcoma cells (2C4 and 2fTGH) and cells derived from those that are deficient in Jak1 (U4C), Jak2 (γ2A), or Tyk2 (U1A) (see Table I). In the case of Jak1, we also tested the polyclonal antibodies in mouse embryonal fibroblasts from Jak1 knock-out mice or normal mice (data not shown). The cells were grown on collagen-coated coverslips, fixed, and stained using different protocols (see “Materials and Methods”). The antibodies recommended for immunofluorescence were also tested using the protocols provided by the manufacturers.Surprisingly a specific Jak1, Jak2, or Tyk2 staining could not be achieved with any of the tested antibodies.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism whereby high glucose enhances degradation of connexin 43 (Cx43), thus contributing to a decrease in GJIC. The levels of Cx43 in bovine retinal endothelial cells exposed to high glucose (25 mm) decreased about 50% as compared with controls (5.5 mm glucose). Consistently, the half-life of the protein decreased from 2.3 to 1.9 h. The proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin prevented the loss of Cx43 induced by high glucose and extended Cx43 half-life. The amount of phosphorylated Cx43 increased in high glucose and after proteasome inhibition. Scrape-loading dye transfer experiments show that high glucose is associated to a decrease of 40% in GJIC. Significantly, this reduction can be reversed by proteasome inhibitors. The decrease in GJIC in cells exposed to high glucose is associated with a loss of Cx43 from the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and biotinylation of cell-surface proteins. Results indicate that increased phosphorylation of Cx43 under high glucose is the mechanism targeting Cx43 for degradation by a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Increased degradation of Cx43 and reduction of GJIC in high glucose may be of physiological importance by contributing to endothelial cell dysfunction associated with the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier in diabetic retinopathy.

Increased degradation of Cx43 and reduction of GJIC in high glucose may be of physiological importance by contributing to endothelial cell dysfunction associated with the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier in diabetic retinopathy. Hyperglycemia and the consequent exposure of the intracellular milieu of the retinal capillary endothelial cells to elevated blood glucose concentrations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular complications in diabetes, including the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (1Winegrad A.I. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 2King G.L. Kunisaki M. Nishio Y. Inoguchi T. Shiba T. Xia P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: S105-S108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact biochemical and molecular mechanisms that transduce chronic hyperglycemia into micro- and macrovascular complications of the retina are not clear. However, it has been suggested that several mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy; those include increased nonenzymatic glycation (3Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L.

(5Koya D. King G.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Despite the nature of such mechanisms, early cell dysfunction related to diabetic vascular complications is often associated with abnormalities in cell-cell communication and maintenance of cell homeostasis. Gap junctions are intercellular-channels that permit the passage of small molecules such as small metabolites, ions, and second messengers (6Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). These channels consist of two hemi-channels, called connexons, that are located in the plasma membrane of two adjacent cells. Each connexon is composed of six subunits of the protein connexin. Gap junctions have an important role in a variety of cellular processes including homeostasis, morphogenesis, cell differentiation, and growth control (7Simon A.M. Goodenough D.A. Trends Cell. 1998; 8: 477-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Three connexin subtypes are expressed in the endothelium of the blood vessels: Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 (8Yeh H.I. Rothery S. Dupont E. Coppen S.R. Severs N.J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1248-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells rely on a network of gap junctions for intercellular communication (9Little T.L. Beyer E.C. Duling B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H729-H739PubMed Google Scholar, 10Larson D.M. Wrobleski M.J. Sagar G.D. Westphale E.M. Beyer E.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C405-C415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that intercellular communication in endothelial cells is reduced under conditions of hyperglycemia (11Sato T. Haimovici R. Kao R. Li A.F. Roy S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1565-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Such a decrease in intercellular communication is most likely due to a reduction of the abundance of connexin 43 (Cx43) in endothelial cells. One of the most remarkable aspects of gap junction biosynthesis is the exceptional metabolic lability of connexins. Although the half-life of the great majority of plasma membrane proteins exceeds 24 h, connexins present a rapid turnover rate, with half-lives of only 1.5–5 h (12Fallon R.F. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 13Beardslee M. Lerner D. Tadros P. Laing J. Beyer E. Yamada K. Kleber A. Schuessler R. Saffitz J. Circ.

Until the present time, two proteolytic pathways have been implicated in connexin turnover, the lysosome (14Musil L.S. Le A.C. Van Slyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol.

The mechanisms and upstream events that lead to the choice of one degradation pathway over the other are largely unknown. It has, however, been shown that both pathways coexist and are active in a number of cell types and in a variety of experimental and pathological conditions (18Fuertes G. Martin De Llano J.J. Villarroya A. Rivett A.J. Knecht E. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Qin H. Shao Q. Igdoura S.A. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Laird D.W. J. Biol.

For example, we have previously shown that in response to specific stimuli, proteasome is involved in the degradation of phosphorylated Cx43 in lens epithelial cells (LEC) (17Girao H. Pereira P. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 24-30PubMed Google Scholar). It has been widely shown that phosphorylation of Cx43 results in decreased intercellular communication through gap junctions (GJIC), probably because of a reduction in abundance at the plasma membrane (21Matesic D. Rupp H. Bonney W. Ruch R. Trosko J. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 10: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 22TenBroek E. Louis C. Jonhson R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Lampe P.D. TenBroek E.M. Burt J.M. Kurata W.E. Johnson R.G. Lau A.F. J.

For example, it was shown that in smooth muscle cells, high glucose induced the inhibition of GJIC activity through hyperphosphorylation of Cx43 by PKC (25Kuroki T. Inoguchi T. Umeda F. Ueda F. Nawata H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a recent study has shown that high glucose inhibited GJIC activity by down-regulating Cx43 synthesis in rat microvascular endothelial cells (11Sato T. Haimovici R. Kao R. Li A.F. Roy S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1565-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We have shown before that Cx43 is remarkably labile and that the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is involved in the degradation of Cx43 in LEC (17Girao H. Pereira P. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 24-30PubMed Google Scholar). Further, we have suggested that the combined action of phosphorylation and protein degradation by the proteasome pathway acts as a mechanism of decreasing intercellular communication in the LEC (17Girao H. Pereira P. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 24-30PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, it is thus conceivable that a similar mechanism may occur in retinal endothelial cells. To investigate the mechanism whereby hyperglycemia leads to decreased intercellular communication in endothelial cells, we have hypothesized that hyperglycemia may create the conditions that favor increased degradation of Cx43, presumably involving increased phosphorylation of the protein. A reduction in Cx43 half-life and a decreased abundance of Cx43 at the plasma membrane would thus account for the reduced intercellular communication observed under conditions of hyperglycemia. Cell Cultures—Bovine retinas were the source of capillaries used to isolate cells for primary culture. Cow eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Primary bovine retinal endothelial cells (BREC) cultures were established from fresh calf eyes. Under sterile conditions, the retinas were isolated and washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and pieces of adherent retinal pigment epithelial cells were removed. The retinas were transferred to an enzyme solution containing Pronase (100 μg/ml), collagenase (500 μg/ml), and DNase (70 μg/ml) and incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 20 min. After incubation, the retinal digest was passed through 210- and 50-μm nylon mesh, and the microvessels trapped on top of the 50-μm mesh were collected in DMEM by centrifugation. The fragments were resuspended in DMEM with 15% fetal calf serum, 20 μg/ml endothelial growth supplement (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), heparin (100 μg/ml), and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Sigma), plated, and grown on fibronectin-coated dishes in low glucose DMEM at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cultures were passaged every 7 to 10 days. For all experiments, cultures from passages three to five were used. To determine the effect of high glucose on Cx43 expression and GJIC activity, BREC were grown in low (5.5 mm) or high (25 mm) d-glucose medium for 8 days to confluence. Antibodies and Reagents—The rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-Cx43 antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The mouse anti-Cx43 monoclonal antibody was raised against a peptide sequence that represents amino acid residues 360–376 of Cx43. Unless otherwise noted, all other reagents were from Sigma, except MG132, which was obtained from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and MG132 were dissolved in Me2SO. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Cells exposed to normal and high-glucose medium were washed, collected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution by centrifugation, and cell pellets were frozen at -80 °C until use. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm NaF, 500 μm Na3VO4. The lysates were sonicated six times for 3 s to completely disrupt all cells and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were used to determine the protein concentration by BCA reagent (Pierce) and then were denatured with Laemmli buffer. For studies involving total cell lysates, electrophoresis was performed on 50-μg aliquots of each sample on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies against connexin 43. The signals were detected by ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Films were scanned and the optical densities of the bands were measured with appropriate software. All results are representative of at least three independent experiments. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—For metabolic labeling with 35S, cells were rinsed with methionine-free medium prior to incubation with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) 100 μCi/ml for 1 h. The cells were then chased in DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mm unlabelled methionine in the presence or absence of MG132 for 1, 2, or 4 h. The samples were resuspended in lysis buffer (190 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 6 mm EDTA, 2.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, pH 8.3) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), protein phosphatase inhibitor set II (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 50 mm NaF, 500 μm Na3VO4. Cells were lysed by sonication, and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation using polyclonal antibodies directed against Cx43. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatants were incubated with antibodies directed against Cx43 for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. The samples were then centrifuged, and the protein A-Sepharose sediments were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and denatured at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and autoradiographed. Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analyses—RNA extracted from BREC grown in low and high glucose medium was simultaneously determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using the forward primer 5′-TTAAGGATCGTGTGAAGGGAAAGAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTAGATCTCTAGGTCATCAGGCCG-3′ for amplification of Cx43, and the forward primer 5′-AAGGAGAAGCTGTGCTACGTCGCCCTGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GATCTTGATCTTCATTGTGCTGGGTGCC-3′ for amplification of actin. For simultaneous amplification of Cx43 and β-actin, cDNAs were generated in the same RT reaction. To confirm that amplification was in the linear region, separate tubes containing increasing volumes of the RT reaction were used. Amplification products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Densitometry was performed at nonsaturating exposures, and the Cx43/β-actin ratios were determined. Biotinylation of Cell-surface Proteins—The cell-surface proteins of BREC were biotinylated. Dishes of confluent BREC cells (10-cm diameter) were rinsed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2, followed by the addition of 3 ml of the same cold solution containing 1 mg/ml freshly added Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce). After 30 min at 4 °C, the medium was removed, and the plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm glycine. The cells were scraped in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA containing 1% Triton, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm NaF, and 500 μm Na3VO4; pH 7.5). After 10–20 min on ice the cells were sonicated, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 16000 × g for 10 min. The protein content of the supernatants was determined, and the same quantity of protein was transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf microfuge tubes containing 200 μl of Neutravidin (Pierce). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C with agitation, the beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The beads were pelleted, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and blotted against Cx43 antibodies. Immunofluorescence—BREC grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The samples were then washed with PBS, permeabilized with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with goat serum (1:10) for 20 min prior to incubation with primary mouse monoclonal antibody against connexin (1:25) for 1 h at room temperature. The specimens were rinsed in PBS and mounted with Glycergel (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). All solutions were made up in 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) containing 0.02% sodium azide (Sigma) in PBS. For controls, primary antibodies were omitted. For alkaline phosphatase treatment, the dephosphorylation reactions were carried out in lysis buffer after overnight incubation at 37 °C in the presence of alkaline phosphatase (5 units) from Escherichia coli (Sigma). Cell-cell Communication Assay—BREC grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were assessed for gap junction-mediated intercellular coupling as described by Musil et al. (14Musil L.S. Le A.C. Van Slyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, the culture medium from confluent cells was removed and saved. The cells were rinsed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, after which a 27-gauge needle was used to create multiple scrapes through the cell monolayer in the presence of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% rhodamine-dextran and 0.5% Lucifer yellow. After 3 min of incubation at room temperature, the culture was rinsed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated for an additional 8 min in the saved culture medium to allow the loaded dye to transfer to adjoining cells. The cells were then rinsed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and viewed using a fluorescence microscope with a UV light source. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. or S.E. Comparison between groups was performed with a Student's t test. High Glucose Leads to a Decrease in the Amount of Cx43 by a Proteasome-dependent Mechanism—It has previously been shown that hyperglycemia leads to a decrease in total Cx43 in various cell types (11Sato T. Haimovici R. Kao R. Li A.F. Roy S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1565-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Kuroki T. Inoguchi T. Umeda F. Ueda F. Nawata H.

Biol. 2001; 181: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms whereby high glucose leads to decreased Cx43 in BREC, the amount of total Cx43 was determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). The levels of Cx43 decreased about 50% in cells exposed to 25 mm glucose for 8 days, as compared with controls (cells incubated in 5.5 mm glucose; see Fig. 1B). Because the proteasome was reported to be involved in Cx43 degradation (13Beardslee M. Lerner D. Tadros P. Laing J. Beyer E. Yamada K. Kleber A. Schuessler R. Saffitz J. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 14Musil L.S. Le A.C. Van Slyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol.

Vis. 2003; 9: 24-30PubMed Google Scholar), we further evaluated the participation of the proteasome on Cx43 degradation in high glucose by treating BREC with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 (Fig. 1, A and B) or lactacystin (data not shown). Data shown in Fig. 1 clearly indicate that proteasome inhibitors prevent, to a significant extent, the loss of Cx43 induced by high glucose. In fact, the levels of Cx43 in cells exposed to high glucose were restored to about 85% of the initial levels by proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 1B). Cx43 Is Stabilized by Proteasome Inhibitors under High Glucose—Because RT-PCR experiments suggest that the levels of mRNA for Cx43 are not remarkably altered after exposure of BREC to high glucose (data not shown), the decreased amounts of Cx43 observed under high glucose are likely to be related to an increased turnover of the protein. To determine the half-life of Cx43, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h and then chased for 1, 2, or 4 h. The data presented in Fig. 2 shows that the half-life of Cx43 in cells exposed to high glucose decreased from 2.3 h, in control cells, to 1.9 h. To further determine whether the increased turnover of Cx43 in high glucose was associated with increased degradation of the protein by a proteasome-dependent mechanism, proteins in cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h and chased with unlabelled medium in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Data shows that Cx43 degradation under high glucose is, at least in part, prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2) and by the more specific inhibitor lactacystin (data not shown). The half-life of Cx43 in cells grown in high glucose increased from 1.9 h to 3.4 h when the proteasome was inhibited. The fact that proteasome inhibitors extended Cx43 half-life beyond the half-life of the protein in controls indicates that proteasome has a role in constitutive degradation of Cx43 and that high glucose may create the conditions that favor increased degradation of the protein by a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Increased Degradation of Cx43 under High Glucose Is Associated with Increased Phosphorylation of the Protein—High glucose was shown to induce PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43, which in turn may stimulate protein degradation (11Sato T. Haimovici R. Kao R. Li A.F. Roy S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1565-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Kuroki T. Inoguchi T. Umeda F. Ueda F. Nawata H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Malfait M. Gomez P. van Veen T.A. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Vereecke J. Himpens B. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 181: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The effect of high glucose on phosphorylation of Cx43 induced by PKC was confirmed by incubating cells with staurosporine, an inhibitor of PKC. The decrease in the levels of Cx43 in cells exposed to high glucose was prevented, at least in part, by incubating cells with staurosporine (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistently, incubation with TPA, an activator of PKC, resulted in a decrease of about 85% in the content of Cx43 (Fig. 3B). These results show that high glucose may activate PKC, which, in turn, may hyperphosphorylate Cx43, leading to its increased degradation. Results obtained in our laboratory showed that the phosphorylated forms of Cx43 are preferentially degraded by a mechanism that involves the proteasome (17Girao H. Pereira P. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 24-30PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether proteasome is the mechanism leading to increased degradation of phosphorylated Cx43 under high glucose, Cx43 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells incubated under high glucose in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes that were probed with antibodies directed against the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues (Fig. 4A) or polyclonal antibodies directed against Cx43 (Fig. 4B). The ratio of phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated (P/NP) Cx43 was calculated and plotted in a graph (Fig. 4D). The results show that the ratio P/NP Cx43 increased 2-fold in cells incubated under high glucose and, more importantly, inhibition of the proteasome led to a 3-fold increase in the ratio of P/NP Cx43, as compared with control cells incubated under low glucose. On the other hand, the ratio of P/NP Cx43 was not significantly altered when the PKC inhibitor staurosporine was added to cells exposed to high glucose. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Cx43 in cells exposed to high glucose may act as a signal for degradation of the protein by a proteasome-dependent mechanism.Fig. 4Effect of the proteasome inhibitors on phosphorylation of Cx43. Cx43 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of BREC incubated with MG132 or staurosporine using polyclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with antibodies directed against phosphorylated residues of serine/threonine (A) or polyclonal antibodies to Cx43 (B). C, enzymatic dephosphorylation of Cx43. Cell lysates were incubated in the absence or presence of alkaline phosphatase (AP) from E. coli at 37 °C overnight.

The intercellular communication was quantified as the distance traveled by the Lucifer yellow dye after scrape-loading (Fig. 5A). The GJIC decreased about 40% in cells exposed to high glucose (Fig. 5B). Conversely, but not surprisingly, proteasome inhibitors had the opposite effect in GJIC, leading to an increase of about 20% in the distance traveled by the dye (Fig. 5B). However, under high glucose, proteasome inhibitors not only restored the GJIC to control levels, but also increased intercellular communication 2-fold, as compared with controls incubated under low glucose. Taken together, these results suggest that high glucose has a direct impact in GJIC by a mechanism that involves increased degradation of Cx43 in a proteasome-dependent manner. Treatment of BREC, grown in high glucose with the PKC inhibitor staurosporine, resulted in an increase of GJIC of about 36%. On the other hand, and as predicted, treatment with TPA resulted in a dramatic inhibition (about 80%) of GJIC. Inhibition of GJIC Is the Direct Result of Decreased Abundance of Cx43 at the Plasma Membrane—Intercellular communication is usually associated with the abundance of functional gap junction plaques, at cell-cell interfaces. Thus, an alteration of intercellular communication is either associated with changes in gap junction activity or with the levels of Cx43 at the plasma membrane available to form gap junctions. To investigate whether the decrease of GJIC in high glucose is related to alterations in the subcellular distribution of Cx43, BREC were immunostained with antibodies directed against Cx43 and imaged by confocal microscopy.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations in the srf-3 locus confer resistance to infection by Microbacterium nematophilum, and they also prevent biofilm formation by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a close relative of the bubonic plague agent Yersinia pestis. We cloned srf-3 and found that it encodes a multitransmembrane hydrophobic protein resembling nucleotide sugar transporters of the Golgi apparatus membrane. srf-3 is exclusively expressed in secretory cells, consistent with its proposed function in cuticle/surface modification. We demonstrate that SRF-3 can function as a nucleotide sugar transporter in heterologous in vitro and in vivo systems. UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine are substrates for SRF-3. We propose that the inability of Yersinia biofilms and M. nematophilum to adhere to the nematode cuticle is due to an altered glycoconjugate surface composition of the srf-3 mutant.

To counteract infections, all higher organisms have evolved sophisticated immunological defenses. Although adaptive immunity is specific to vertebrates, the mechanisms of innate immunity are ancient in evolutionary terms and have been highly conserved during evolution (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). This suggests that studying their role in diverse species may yield key insights into the evolutionary origins and molecular mechanisms of the mammalian innate immune system. Therefore, vertebrate as well as invertebrate model systems have been established to understand the underlying mechanisms of innate immunity. The use of Caenorhabditis elegans as a host model system for innate immunity was first demonstrated for the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2Mahajan-Miklos S. Tan M.W. Rahme L.G. Ausubel F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In the short time since then, C. elegans has been established as a model system for studying infection by a wide variety of pathogens (3Alegado R.A. Campbell M.C. Chen W.C. Slutz S.S. Tan M.W. Cell Microbiol. 2003; 5: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Unlike P. aeruginosa, Yersinia pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis do not colonize the intestinal tissues of C. elegans but instead generate a sticky biofilm on the exterior of the animal's head that impairs feeding, leading to growth delay or larval arrest (4Darby C. Hsu J.W. Ghori N. Falkow S. Nature. 2002; 417: 243-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is a model for bubonic plague transmission, because biofilm formation by Y. pestis requires putative polysaccharide biosynthetic genes that are also required for flea infection and transmission of the pathogen by flea bites (5Hinnebusch B.J. Perry R.D. Schwan T.G. Science. 1996; 273: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). A biofilm is defined as a community of bacteria enclosed in a self-produced exopolysaccharide matrix that adheres to a biotic or abiotic surface. Biofilm formation by pathogens is of great clinical importance, because bacteria embedded in biofilms have been shown to be more resistant to antibiotics, to components of the host immune system, and to removal by mechanical forces (6Costerton J.W. Stewart P.S. Greenberg E.P. Science. 1999; 284: 1318-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (8939) Google Scholar). A novel C. elegans pathogen has been described recently (7Hodgkin J. Kuwabara P.E. Corneliussen B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Microbacterium nematophilum adheres to the rectum of wild type animals, inducing a localized nonlethal response and causing a swelling of the underlying hypodermal tissue (deformed anal region (Dar) 1The abbreviations used are: Dar, deformed anal region; NST, nucleotide sugar transporter; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; RT, reverse transcriptase; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LPG, lipophosphoglycan; GFP, green fluorescent protein. phenotype). In the same study, several mutants with altered surface antigenicity (srf mutants) were found to be resistant to infection by M. nematophilum. Altering surface antigenicity is an important mechanism by which parasitic nematodes can evade the host immune system, and C. elegans has been used as a model to understand the factors required for changing the surface composition (8Blaxter M. Page A.P. Rudin W. Maizels R.M. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 243-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Politz S.M. Philipp M. Parasitol. Today. 1992; 8: 6-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). srf-1 was identified as a surface polymorphism in variants of C. elegans that failed to bind a polyclonal antiserum raised against the adult cuticle of wild type N2 worms (10Politz S.M. Chin K.J. Herman D.L. Genetics. 1987; 117: 467-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional srf mutations were identified in a screen for mutants showing altered surface binding of antisera. It has been proposed that srf-3 animals have lost surface components, thereby exposing antigenic determinants that are hidden in wild-type animals (11Politz S.M. Philipp M. Estevez M. O'Brien P.J. Chin K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2901-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). srf mutants were also found in a screen for ectopic binding by wheat germ agglutinin (12Link C.D. Silverman M.A. Breen M. Watt K.E. Dames S.A. Genetics. 1992; 131: 867-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). srf-4, srf-8, and srf-9 have extensive pleiotropic defects and show no resistance to infection by M. nematophilum, suggesting that the mutations are involved in biological processes distinct from that of other srf genes. In contrast, srf-2, srf-3, and srf-5, which all show no visible alterations in morphology or behavior, are resistant to infection by M. nematophilum (7Hodgkin J. Kuwabara P.E. Corneliussen B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here we show that the resistance of srf-3 animals to infection by M. nematophilum and to biofilm formation by Y. pseudotuberculosis is due to the failure of the bacteria or their secreted products to adhere to the animals' cuticle. We cloned srf-3 and found that it codes for a nucleotide sugar transporter (NST) capable of translocating UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine into the Golgi apparatus lumen. Furthermore, the observed expression pattern supports a function of SRF-3 in cuticle and surface modification. The results presented here should facilitate further study of the mechanisms and the genetic network underlying pathogen resistance of srf mutants. Strain Maintenance and Genetics—All C. elegans strains were grown as described (13Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Transgenic animals were constructed as described (14Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). Injection of dsRNA was done as described (15Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C.

Genetics. 1988; 119: 345-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following yeast strains were used: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PRY225 (ura3–52, lys2–801am, ade2–1020c, his3, leu2, trp1Δ1); Kluyveromyces lactis, KL3 (Mat a, uraA, mnn2–2, arg–K+, pKD1+). Mapping of srf-3 was carried out as follows. From unc-31(e169) srf-3(yj10) +/++ lev-1(e211) parents, 13 Lev Srf Unc and three Lev Unc recombinants were isolated. From unc-31(e169) srf-3(yj10) lev-1(e211)/+ + + parents, zero Lev Srf non-Unc and seven Lev non-Srf non-Unc recombinants were isolated. This placed srf-3 0.24 map units to the right of unc-31. The srf-3 alleles br6, e2680, e2689, e2789, and e2797 were identified first by assignment to linkage group IV and then by complementation tests. All alleles except br6 were tested for complementation of the reference allele srf-3(yj10), using both the visible Bus phenotype and the Srf phenotype as judged by FITC-wheat germ agglutinin (Vector Laboratories) binding (12Link C.D. Silverman M.A. Breen M. Watt K.E. Dames S.A. Genetics. 1992; 131: 867-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). srf-3(br6) was tested for complementation of yj10 in the Yersinia biofilm formation assay. For cloning srf-3 by rescue, we injected srf-3(e2789) unc-30(e191)/+ animals with cosmids or subclones, using co-injected pBY1153 (sel-12::egfp) at a concentration of 25 ng/μl as a transformation marker. The progeny of transgenic Unc animals were grown and tested for the Dar phenotype on plates that had been seeded with a mixture of 99.9% Escherichia coli OP 50 and 0.1% M. nematophilum CBX102. All injection mixes were supplemented to a DNA concentration of 100 ng/μl with Bluescript II SK-(Stratagene). Biofilm formation was assayed as follows. Five adult worms per plate were allowed to lay eggs for 2–4 h on plates containing Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII. After removing the worms, the plates were incubated at 20 °C for 2 days or 15 °C for 4 days, and the number of L4 larvae was compared with the number of total worms. Because the biofilm blocks feeding and causes larval arrest or growth delay, this assay serves as an indirect measurement of biofilm attachment. Plasmid Construction—To identify the open reading frame sufficient to provide srf-3 activity, the rescuing cosmid M02B1 (line 1 at the top of Fig. 3B) was digested with PacI, and the 27-kb backbone was religated, creating the plasmid pBY1453 (line 6). A 4.6-kb (line 2) and a 7-kb (line 3) PstI fragment of M02B1 were ligated into BluescriptII SK-(Stratagene), generating the plasmids pBY1451 and pBY1452, respectively. A 13-kb AatII fragment derived from M02B1 was ligated into Litmus28 (New England Biolabs), creating the plasmid pBY1454 (line 4). pBY1508 was constructed by deleting 3.2 kb with Eco52I, which removes the ORF M02B1.1 in pBY1454 (line 7). pBY1454 was digested with SapI to generate pBY1509, which carries a 4.2-kb deletion in the ORF ZK896.9 (line 8). To tag SRF-3 at the N terminus with GFP, 2.5-kb of srf-3 promoter sequence was PCR-amplified with primers that introduced a SalI site upstream and an EcoRV immediately downstream of the ATG. This PCR product was inserted into pPD118.15 (SalI- and Acc65I-blunted), creating the plasmid pBY1603. The SRF-3 coding region plus 1.7-kb of untranslated sequence were PCR-amplified and cloned via NheI and AatII into pBY1603, resulting in the plasmid pBY1605. To tag SRF-3 at the C terminus with β-galactosidase carrying a nuclear localization signal, the srf-3 genomic region, including 2.5-kb of promoter sequence, was PCR-amplified. The primers were designed so that the stop codon was removed, and SalI sites were introduced at both ends of the PCR product. The PCR product was inserted into pPD95.57, creating pBY1907. For heterologous expression of srf-3, the cDNA was fused by PCR mutagenesis with a sequence encoding an 11-amino acid VSV-G tag and cloned into BluescriptII SK-, creating the plasmid pBY1820 (VSV tag at the N terminus, VSVSRF-3). From pBY1820 the cDNA was cloned via XbaI to pcDNA3.1, creating pBY1823 (VSVSRF-3). To ligate VSVSRF-3 to p426GPD, pBY1820 was digested with XbaI, and p426GPD was digested with SpeI; fragments were ligated to create pBY1822 (VSVSRF-3). For generating constructs allowing expression in K. lactis, SRF-3 was fused with a VSV-G tag at the C terminus by PCR mutagenesis and cloned into BluescriptII SK-(pBY1819). SRF-3VSV was PCR-amplified with primers introducing SalI sites immediately upstream of the ATG and downstream of the stop codon. The PCR product was ligated to XhoI-digested pE4 vector, resulting in the plasmid pBY1866 (SRF-3VSV). The co-injection marker pBY1153 was cloned as follows. The sel-12 cDNA in pBY895 (22Wittenburg N. Eimer S. Lakowski B. Rohrig S. Rudolph C. Baumeister R. Nature. 2000; 406: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was replaced with EGFP coding sequence on a SmaI/NotI fragment from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The resulting construct, pBY1153 (sel-12::egfp), drives expression of egfp under the control of the sel-12 promoter. To express the srf-3 cDNA under the control of the srf-3 regulatory sequences, the 3′-untranslated region was amplified with PCR using the primers 5′-GATCTCGAGATTCTCGTCTGTATATTATAGTGACGCT-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCGAGTGTGGCCTGGAAATTGGAGG-3′ and cloned with XhoI into BluescriptII SK-. The srf-3 promoter without an ATG was amplified with the primers 5′-GATCTCTAGAATTTCCTTTTGATTGTGAAGATTC-3′ and 5′-GATCGAGCTCGCTTTCCCCAAACATTTTTAG-3′ and then cloned with XbaI/SacI to the construct containing the 3′-untranslated region, resulting in plasmid pBY1818. The srf-3 cDNA obtained from the RT-PCR was ligated to pBY1818 with HindIII, generating pBY1865. Cloning of the srf-3 cDNA—To confirm the exon-intron boundaries of srf-3, three independent reverse transcription reactions (primer RT1, AAATTATAAAAGCAGCAGA; RT2, TGATAATAAATCACAGATTC; RT3, GCATTTTTTAAGCGTCACTA) were performed on RNA prepared from a population of mixed staged N2 animals. PCR was performed using the primers 5′-GACTAAGCTTATGAAGACGGCAATTTTGAT-3′ and 5′-GATCAAGCTTTTACAGACAAAACGCCTCTT-3′, and the cDNAs were cloned and sequenced. RNA preparation was done with the Qiagen RNAeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. SL1 and SL2 splicing was tested by PCR using specific primers 5′-ACGTGGATCCGGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG and ACGTGGATCCGGTTTTAACCCAGTTACTCAAG, respectively. Molecular Biology—DNA sequences of srf-3 alleles were determined directly from PCR-amplified DNA. The site of the Tc1 insertion in the e2789 allele was identified by the DNA sequence of a PCR product obtained with Tc1-specific primers combined with SRF-3-specific primers. For the analysis of SRF-3 localization, 5 ng/μl pBY1605 was co-injected with 50 ng/μl pDP#MM016B (unc-119 rescuing plasmid (18Maduro M. Pilgrim D.

For each injection, three independent lines were analyzed for GFP expression or β-galactosidase staining, respectively. For heterologous expression of SRF-3, the cDNA was fused in frame with a single VSV-G tag coding sequence by PCR mutagenesis and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cell lines, into pG426 (23Mumberg D.

Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were done using the LiAc/PEG method (26Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). For detection of the VSV-tagged SRF-3, an anti-VSV antibody from Roche Applied Science was used. Syto13 staining of worms was carried out as previously described (7Hodgkin J. Kuwabara P.E. Corneliussen B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), using dye purchased from Molecular Labs (Leiden, The Netherlands). Nucleotide Sugar Transport Assay—The theoretical basis for the translocation assay of nucleotide sugars into Golgi apparatus enriched vesicles has been described previously (27Perez M.

Radionucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and American Radiolabelled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Generation of Stable Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) RCAr Transfectants and Determination of Ricin Resistance—MDCK RCAr cells were transfected in OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) medium with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) for 6 h and then grown for 72 h in complete medium (minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics). Cells were trypsinized and plated at low density in complete medium containing Geneticin (G418; 0.4 mg/ml). Surviving cells were cloned and grown at 30 °C at variable concentrations of ricin (RCA II (E. Y. Laboratories Inc., San Mateo, CA)) in microtiter plates to determine resistance. Cell survival was determined by staining with methylene blue in 50% methanol. Stained plates were photographed with white light illumination. Cell Surface Labeling of K. lactis—K. lactis cells transformed with pE4-srf-3vsv or vector alone were grown at 30 °C in SCM-URA medium and then washed three times with 0.9% NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2. Approximately 5 A600 of cells was resuspended in 100 μl of 0.5 mg/ml GSII-FITC (EY Laboratories) in 0.9% NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with shaking. Samples were washed three times and resuspended in 0.9% NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2. Fluorescence at 535 nm was measured with a Tecan microplate reader. Sequences of primers used for cloning of the constructs presented in this study can be obtained upon request. srf-3 Animals Are Resistant to Infection by M. nematophilum and to Biofilm Formation by Y. pseudotuberculosis—Wild-type worms grown on plates containing M. nematophilum CBX102 become constipated due to a postanal swelling and, as a consequence, feed less. This results in a 20% slower growth rate compared with a resistant srf-2 mutant grown under the same conditions (7Hodgkin J. Kuwabara P.E. Corneliussen B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). When grown on M. nematophilum, srf-3(yj10) animals were also found to be resistant to infection. The tails of the srf-3 animals grown on this pathogen were indistinguishable from tails of animals grown on E. coli OP50, the normal food, indicating that srf-3 mutants strongly suppressed the Dar phenotype (Fig. 1). This resistance was not allele-specific, since additional srf-3 alleles were isolated in mut-7 and ethylmethanesulfonate screens for mutants resistant to M. nematophilum infection (Bus, bacterial unswollen). 2M. J. Gravato-Nobre, unpublished data. With the notable exception of e2797, all srf-3 alleles tested did not exhibit a Dar phenotype when grown under standard conditions (20 °C) on plates containing M. nematophilum (Table I and Fig. 1). At 15 and 20 °C, srf-3(e2797) animals showed a Dar phenotype that was weaker than that exhibited by wild-type animals, but at 25 °C, animals were indistinguishable from other srf-3 alleles. Thus, the Bus phenotype of e2797 is temperature-sensitive.Table IPenetrance of Dar phenotype in N2 and srf-3 animals on plates containing M. nematophilumTWild type (N2)yj10e2789e2680e2797e2689br6%%%%%%%25 °C10000(n = 322)(n = 238)(n = 279)20 °C1000001900(n = 403)(n = 543)(n = 464)(n = 395)(n = 243)(n = 460)(n = 135)15 °C100022(n = 183)(n = 253)(n = 385) Open table in a new tab We also examined the progeny of wild type and various srf-3 alleles on plates containing M. nematophilum (Table II). When grown on a lawn of E. coli OP50, the number of progeny of all tested srf-3 alleles was in the range of or slightly lower than that of wild type. In contrast, on plates containing 0.1% M. nematophilum, the brood size of srf-3 mutants was unaffected, whereas the number of progeny produced by wild type worms was reduced by 50% (Table II).Table IIFecundity of N2 and different srf-3 alleles on plates containing standard OP50 as food source and on plates containing M. nematophilumStrainE. coli OP50E. coli OP50 + 0.1% M. nematophilumN2310 ± 05 (n = 15)144 ± 09 (n = 16)srf-3(yj10)285 ± 09 (n = 20)260 ± 07 (n = 20)srf-3(e2798)248 ± 09 (n = 18)259 ± 06 (n = 20)srf-3(e2680)262 ± 20 (n = 17)241 ± 19 (n = 20)srf-3(e2797)272 ± 08 (n = 18)231 ± 13 (n = 20)srf-3(e2689)253 ± 12 (n = 18)295 ± 08 (n = 20) Open table in a new tab All srf-3 alleles were also resistant to biofilm formation by Y. pseudotuberculosis. When we grew wild-type animals on a lawn of Y. pseudotuberculosis, a close relative of the plague agent Y. pestis, the heads of the animals became surrounded by a biofilm (Fig. 1), which blocks feeding and inhibits larval development (4Darby C. Hsu J.W. Ghori N. Falkow S. Nature. 2002; 417: 243-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 29Joshua G.W. Karlyshev A.V. Smith M.P. Isherwood K.E. Titball R.W. Wren B.W. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3221-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). No bacteria could be detected in the intestine or in other interior tissues, suggesting that biofilm production represents the only sign of infection by this bacterial species. In contrast, all srf-3 alleles were resistant to Yersinia biofilm formation (Fig. 1 and Table III), including e2797 which, as with M. nematophilum, displayed a temperature-sensitive phenotype. A novel srf-3 allele, br6, was identified in a direct screen for animals resistant to Yersinia biofilm formation. 3C.

First, adherence to the cuticle surface could be inhibited in the mutant, preventing colonization by M. nematophilum and biofilm formation by Yersinia. Second, bacterial adherence might not be prevented, but alteration of secondary (signaling) mechanisms could prevent anal swelling or the generation of a biofilm. For example, it was recently shown that inactivation of a MAPKK pathway can alter the C. elegans immune response (30Kim D.H. Feinbaum R. Alloing G. Emerson F.E. Garsin D.A. Inoue H. Tanaka-Hino M. Hisamoto N. Matsumoto K. Tan M.W. Ausubel F.M. Science. 2002; 297: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities for M. nematophilum, srf-3 mutants and wild-type worms were grown on plates containing the pathogen and subsequently incubated with the dye Syto13, a nucleic acid vital stain, under conditions that stain bacteria preferentially. In wild-type C. elegans, fluorescent M. nematophilum that have infected the anal region are clearly visible. In contrast, srf-3 mutants do not show any staining, indicating that M. nematophilum is not able to adhere to the cuticle of srf-3 mutants (Fig. 2). In the case of Yersinia, bacteria do not adhere directly even to wild-type animals; adherence is always mediated by biofilm polysaccharide (4Darby C. Hsu J.W. Ghori N. Falkow S. Nature. 2002; 417: 243-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). There is also no evidence for signaling between Yersinia and C. elegans. 4Tan, L., and Darby, C. (2004) J. Bacteriol. 186, in press. In summary, resistance against two unrelated bacterial strains that use different pathogenic strategies can be conferred by mutations in a single factor, srf-3. Molecular Identification of srf-3—In order to identify the mechanism that confers resistance against bacterial infection, we cloned srf-3. Initial mapping placed srf-3 on chromosome IV to the right of unc-22 (11Politz S.M. Philipp M. Estevez M. O'Brien P.J. Chin K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2901-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Three-factor crosses mapped srf-3 between unc-31 and lev-1, near unc-31 (Fig. 3A). Injection of cosmids from this region into srf-3 mutants revealed that M02B1 rescued the resistance to infection in transgenic off-spring of injected worms (data not shown; see also “Experimental Procedures”). A subclone with only one open reading frame, M02B1.1, was sufficient to rescue susceptibility to infection by M. nematophilum and biofilm formation of Y. pseudotuberculosis in all srf-3 alleles tested (see Fig. 3B). RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing identified a 987-bp srf-3 cDNA (Fig. 4 for exon-intron boundaries; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In C. elegans, the 5′-end of many mRNAs begins with a 22-nucleotide splice leader sequence added by trans splicing (31Blumenthal T. Steward K. Riddle D.L. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 117-146Google Scholar). The srf-3 transcript we found was exclusively splice leader sequence 1 (SL-1)-spliced and therefore most likely includes the true 5′-end of the mRNA. Injection of double-stranded RNA prepared from this cDNA into rrf-3(pk1426), a strain with increased sensitivity to RNA interference, rendered the progeny resistant to infection by M. nematophilum. Furthermore, expression of the srf-3 cDNA under the control of 2.5 kb of 5′ and 3′ genomic elements restored M. nematophilum infection in srf-3 animals (data not shown), indicating that the isolated cDNA codes for a functional protein and suggesting that the construct contains the entire regulatory region of the gene. We subsequently sequenced all six srf-3 alleles. All of them carried mutations in the open reading frame (Fig. 4). The mutations observed in yj10, br6, e2789, and e2689 would lead to a severe truncation of the encoded protein and are most likely null alleles. This is supported by the fact that, when srf-3(e2789) was placed over a deficiency, the srf-3(e2789)/sDf22 phenotype was not more severe than that of the homozygous srf-3(e2789) mutant. srf-3 encodes a 328-amino acid type III transmembrane protein that, as shown in an alignment with proteins from Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Fig. 4B), is similar to NSTs. These proteins function as antiporters, exchanging a nucleotide sugar for the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the Golgi apparatus. Transport of nucleotide sugars into the Golgi apparatus lumen provides the donor substrate for glycosyltransferases and is therefore necessary for the subsequent addition of sugars to proteins, lipids, and glycosaminoglycans (32Hirschberg C.B.

The CXC chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1α interacts with its receptor CXCR4 to induce the migration of a number of different cell types. Although an understanding of the physiological functions of this chemokine is emerging, the mechanism by which it regulates T cell migration is still unclear. We show here that the Tec family kinase ITK is activated rapidly following CXCL12/SDF-1α stimulation, and this requires Src and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activities. ITK regulates the ability of CXCL12/SDF-1α to induce T cell migration as overexpression of wild-type ITK-enhanced migration, and T cells lacking ITK exhibit reduced migration as well as adhesion in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α. Further analysis suggests that ITK may regulate CXCR4-mediated migration and adhesion by altering the actin cytoskeleton, as ITK null T cells were significantly defective in CXCL12/SDF-1a-mediated actin polymerization. Our data suggest that ITK may regulate the ability of CXCR4 to induce T cell migration. Chemokines are critical in controlling lymphocyte traffic and migration.

Our data suggest that ITK may regulate the ability of CXCR4 to induce T cell migration. Lymphocyte trafficking is critical for proper migration to areas of inflammation and for the ability of these cells to perform their immunosurveillance roles. This trafficking is controlled in part by chemokines binding to their receptors expressed on specific cells. Understanding the signaling pathways that regulate chemokine signaling will be essential for a proper understanding of the mechanisms by which chemokines coordinate lymphocyte trafficking and the inflammatory response (1Johnston B. Butcher E. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).

Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The only known receptor for CXCL12/SDF1-α, CXCR4, is a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (5Loetscher M. Geiser T. O'Reilly T. Zwahlen R. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 232-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bleul C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T. Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Human Jurkat T cells also express this chemokine receptor and migrate in a dose-dependent manner to its ligand, CXCL12/SDF-1α. CXCR4 is most notably recognized as a coreceptor for the binding of T-tropic human immunodeficiency virus strains (6Bleul C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T. Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 7Moore J.P. Trkola A. Dragic T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Recent studies using the ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat T cell line P116 have identified a role for ZAP-70 in CXCR4 signaling and migration, where ZAP-70 deficiency results in decreased migration levels to SDF-1α (8Ottoson N. Pribila J. Chan A. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although the signaling events downstream of ZAP-70 that regulate T cell migration are presently unclear, ZAP-70 deficiency results in the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Slp-76 in response to CXCR4 signaling, and although a Slp-76-deficient line of Jurkat cells are defective in CXCR4-mediated migration, this was not rescued by re-expression of exogenous Slp-76 (8Ottoson N. Pribila J. Chan A. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CXCR4 is coupled to the small G protein, Gi, which can lead to the activation of PI3K and the accumulation of D-3 phosphoinositol lipids in Jurkat cells (9Sotsios Y. Whittaker G. Westwick J. Ward S.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5954-5963PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dutt P. Wang J. Groopman J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3652-3658PubMed Google Scholar). PI3K signaling may be required for CXCL12/SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis by orienting the cell toward the chemokine source. Localization of these PI3K D-3 lipid products is essential for targeting the pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins to the leading edge of the cell and thereby directing chemotaxis. The Tec family kinase ITK lies downstream of Zap-70 in the T cell receptor signaling pathway as well as the PI3K pathway (11Shan X. Wange R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29323-29330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the adaptor protein Slp-76 is a prominent substrate and interaction partner for ITK (14Bunnell S. Diehn M. Yaffe M. Findell P. Cantley L. Berg L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2219-2230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15Su Y. Zhang Y. Schweikert J. Koretzky G. Reth M. Wienands J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We have tested whether the ITK is involved in regulating CXCL12/SDF-1α signaling and migration and now report that CXCL12/SDF-1α treatment resulted in the activation of ITK. This required the activity of Src family kinases as well as PI3K, two upstream regulators of ITK. ITK also regulated CXCR4-mediated migration as overexpression of WT ITK in the Jurkat T cell line results in increased chemotaxis, and T cells from mice lacking ITK exhibit reduced migration in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α, which accompanied reduced actin polymerization. These data suggest that ITK is involved in CXCR4 signaling and regulates T cell migration probably via its role in regulating actin polymerization. Animals and Miscellaneous Reagents—ITK-/- mice (16Liao X. Littman D. Immunity. 1995; 3: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) were a kind gift of Dr. D. Littman (New York University School of Medicine) and were backcrossed onto the C57Bl/6 background for >10 generations. Wild-type (WT) mice were from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). 6-8-week-old mice were used for these experiments. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Pennsylvania State University. Antibodies against ITK have been published previously (17Gibson S. Leung B. Squire J. Hill M. Arima N. Goss P. Hogg D. Mills G. Blood. 1993; 82: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) against phosphotyrosine (RC20) from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and against actin from Sigma. PP1 and LY294002 were from Calbiochem. The vector pIREShyg was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Cell Culture and Transfections—The human leukemic Jurkat T cell line, clone E6-1, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For stable transfections, 7.5 × 106 cells were electroporated with 15 μg of plasmid DNA (either pIREShyg alone or containing the hemagglutinin-tagged WT ITK) (18Hao S. August A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using a T820 square wave electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA), stable lines were derived by selection in 1.0 mg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen), and expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Cell Stimulation, Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblots—Jurkat cells were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated as indicated in the figure legends. Aliquots of 20 × 106 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml CXCL12/SDF-1α or carrier in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed at the indicated times by the addition of lysis buffer, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated as described by Hao and August (18Hao S. August A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall Gelman), and probed with anti-ITK or anti-hemagglutinin antibodies. Chemotaxis Assay—Migration assays were performed using blind well chemotaxis chambers (Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). 1.5 × 106 Jurkat T cells and derivatives were added to the upper chamber and incubated for 2 h or 4 × 106 primary murine thymocytes for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were allowed to migrate through 0.5-μm polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filters (Osmometrics) into a lower chamber containing migration buffer with or without 50 ng/ml CXCL12/SDF-1α (100 ng/ml for primary cells). The cells in the lower chamber were collected, and the percentage of migration was determined from the original cell input. Adhesion Assay—Adhesion assays were performed as described previously (19Woods M. Kivens W. Adelsman M. Qiu Y. August A. Shimizu Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1232-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 × 106 primary murine thymocytes were stimulated with 50 ng/ml CXCL12/SDF-1α for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in plates coated with 0.3 μg/ml fibronectin. Nonadherent cells were then removed by washing, adherent cells were collected and counted, and the percentage of input cells was determined. In Vivo Migration Assay—WT or ITK null mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane, and 100 ng of CXCL12/SDF-1α was delivered intranasally in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. After 1 h, the mice were sacrificed and their lungs isolated, and mononuclear cells were isolated as described previously (20Mueller C. August A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5056-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The number of T cells were then determined by staining with anti-CD3 antibodies and flow cytometry, gating on the lymphocyte population as defined by forward and side scatter characteristics. Total lymphocyte numbers were determined using an Advia 1200 hematology system (Bayer, Norwood, MA) and used to determine the number of T cells in the lung. Migration was expressed as fold increase in these numbers. Flow Cytometry—Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies against CD3 (conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine), CD4 (conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate), CD8 (conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine) (BD Biosciences), or CXCR4 (rabbit anti-CXCR4, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and detected using goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate. Actin Polymerization Assay—Primary murine thymocytes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml CXCL12/SDF-1α for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed, fixed with fresh paraformaldehyde, stained with Alex Fluor-486 conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 min, washed again, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Statistics—Results were compared using Student's t test, with p values < 0.05 taken as significant. Activation of ITK by CXCR4 via an Src and PI3K Pathway—To determine whether ITK is involved in CXCL12/SDF-1α stimulation, Jurkat E6-1 cells were serum-starved and stimulated with CXCL12/SDF-1α for the indicated times (Fig. 1). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a specific anti-ITK antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, CXCL12/SDF-1α stimulation induced a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of ITK starting at 90 s, with maximum tyrosine phosphorylation detected at 5 min after the addition of 50 ng/ml SDF-1α. This time frame of ITK activation via CXCR4 was similar to what we have observed previously for TcR-induced activation of ITK (21Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar). CXCR4 signaling leads to activation of Src kinases as well as PI3K, two upstream activators of ITK. To investigate the roles of Src kinases and PI3K on ITK phosphorylation during CXCL12/SDF-1α stimulation, Jurkat T cells were pretreated with the Src kinase inhibitor, PP1, or the PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, followed by stimulation with CXCL12/SDF-1α for 5 min. Fig. 2 demonstrates that both Src and PI3K activity were required for CXCL12/SDF-1α-mediated ITK activation. These data indicate that ITK plays a role in CXCR4 signaling and requires Src and PI3K activity for its activation by CXCL12/SDF-1α. Regulation of CXCR4-mediated Chemotaxis by ITK—Our analysis of CXCR4 signaling indicates that ITK is activated by this chemokine receptor. To find out whether ITK regulates migration induced by CXCR4, we tested the effect of overexpressing WT ITK in Jurkat cells on CXCL12/SDF-1α-induced migration. We established stable Jurkat cells overexpressing WT ITK by transfecting Jurkat cells with an expression vector carrying hemagglutinin-tagged ITK (Fig. 3A). This exogenous ITK was also responsive to CXCL12/SDF-1α stimulation, similar to what we observed for the endogenous ITK (data not shown). We then compared the responses of these cells with the parental Jurkat cell line for their migratory response to CXCL12/SDF-1α. As reported previously (8Ottoson N. Pribila J. Chan A. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), CXCL12/SDF-1α induced cell migration in the parental Jurkat cell line (Fig. 3B). In the unstimulated state, the ITK overexpressing Jurkat cells exhibited increased migration, and stimulating these cells with CXCL12/SDF-1α under the same conditions led to increased migration, although the fold increase in adhesion in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α was actually lower than that observed in the parental cell line perhaps because of the increased basal migration in these cells (Fig. 3B). Both cell lines had equivalent levels of CXCR4 expression as analyzed by flow cytometry (data not shown). These data suggest that ITK can control the ability of CXCR4 to induce migration. To determine whether the absence of ITK would affect the ability of cells to migrate, we took advantage of mice lacking ITK (16Liao X. Littman D. Immunity. 1995; 3: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We compared the ability of CXCL12/SDF-1α to induce migration of WT or ITK null thymocytes (on a C57Bl/6 background) and found that the absence of ITK resulted in a significant inhibition of migration in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α (Fig. 4A). Since the lack of ITK alters T cell development such that the ratio of CD4+:CD8+ thymocytes is reduced, we examined the migrating cells to determine whether the migration of particular populations of ITK null thymocytes was preferentially altered. The CD4 and CD8 patterns of expression of the WT and ITK null thymocytes were examined prior to and after CXCL12/SDF-1α-induced migration. We found that in both populations, there seemed to be preferential migration of double positive thymocytes and less migration of double negative cells after CXCL12/SDF-1α-induced migration (Fig. 4B; note that we recovered fewer cells from the ITK null populations). We have shown previously that ITK is involved in regulating TcR-induced adhesion (19Woods M. Kivens W. Adelsman M. Qiu Y. August A. Shimizu Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1232-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether ITK is also involved in the ability of thymocytes to adhere to fibronectin in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α, we performed adhesion assays, stimulating cells with CXCL12/SDF-1α and examining adhesion to dishes coated with fibronectin. We found that, similar to the results observed with migration, ITK also affected the ability of these thymocytes to adhere to fibronectin in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α stimulation (Fig. 4C). It was also possible that ITK null thymocytes expressed lower levels of CXCR4, the receptor for CXCL12/SDF-1α. However, analysis of CXCR4 expression indicated that both WT and ITK null populations expressed equivalent levels of CXCR4 (Fig. 4D). Finally, we determined whether ITK could affect the ability of T cells to migrate in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α stimulation in vivo. For these experiments, we delivered CXCL12/SDF-1α intranasally and determined the ability of T cells to migrate to the lung in response to this stimulus, which requires adhesion and migratory properties. These experiments confirmed the in vitro experiments, showing that although the number of WT T cells increased in the lung following CXCL12/SDF-1α stimulation, the number of ITK null T cells did not and actually decreased instead (Fig. 4E). This was similar to what we have observed previously in a murine model of allergic asthma, in that ITK null T cells were defective in getting into the lung following allergic challenge (20Mueller C. August A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5056-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data indicate that ITK regulates the ability of T cells and thymocytes to adhere and migrate in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α.Fig. 4ITK null T cells exhibit reduced migration and adhesion in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α A, WT (open bars) or ITK-/- (filled bars) thymocytes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml CXCL12/SDF-1α in a migration assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ITK-/- thymocytes exhibited decreased migration compared with WT thymocytes. *, p < 0.05.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1619-1624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have recently reported that ITK can regulate the ability of the TcR to induce actin polymerization. As chemokine-induced migration is dependent on signal-induced changes in the actin super-structure (23Nishita M. Aizawa H. Mizuno K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we asked whether actin polymerization in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α was affected in ITK null thymocytes. We stimulated WT or ITK null thymocytes with CXCL12/SDF-1α and measured the level of actin polymerization using Alexa Fluor-468-labeled phalloidin and flow cytometry. We found that, although CXCL12/SDF-1α induced WT thymocytes to increase F-actin levels ∼2-fold, the absence of ITK resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of CXCL12/SDF-1α to induce actin polymerization (Fig. 5). These data suggest that ITK may regulate the ability of CXCL12/SDF-1α to induce actin polymerization and therefore the ability of cells to migrate in response to CXCL12/SDF-1α. The requirements for Zap-70, Slp-76, and PI3K in regulating CXCR4 signaling suggest that signaling between these molecules is important for this pathway (8Ottoson N. Pribila J. Chan A. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Vicente-Manzanares M. Rey M. Jones D. Sancho D. Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J. del Pozo M. Yanez-Mo M. de Ana A. Martinez A.-C. Merida I. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4001-4012PubMed Google Scholar). In the TcR pathway, Zap-70 is required for ITK activation, and ITK requires PI3K for efficient activation (11Shan X. Wange R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29323-29330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, Slp-76 is a binding partner for ITK, and ITK can phosphorylate Slp-76, which may lead to the assembly of critical components of this pathway leading to migration, including the molecule ADAP/Fyb/Slap-130 (15Su Y. Zhang Y. Schweikert J. Koretzky G. Reth M. Wienands J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 25Hunter A. Ottoson N. Boerth N. Koretzky G. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus ITK may play a critical role in the proper assembly of these components, leading to altered actin rearrangement and migration. Indeed, ITK is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton downstream of the TcR (22Grasis J. Browne C. Tsoukas C. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Woods M. Shimizu Y. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 874-880PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lano C.M. Lewis C.M. You D. Leung D.W.

Interestingly, CXCR4 is involved in regulating T cell migration to lymph nodes, and although we have not observed any difference in the percentages of T cells in the lymph nodes of ITK null mice under steady state conditions (other than an overall decrease in total T cell numbers, reported previously (16Liao X. Littman D. Immunity. 1995; 3: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar)), we have observed altered recruitment of ITK null T cells to the lung during the induction of allergic asthma in ITK-/- mice (20Mueller C. August A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5056-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It will be of considerable interest to determine whether T cells from ITK null mice exhibit altered homing of the lymph node under stimulated conditions and whether ITK or other Tec family kinases also regulate other chemokine responses.

https://openalex.org/W1965408498,"The leptin receptor is mainly localized in intracellular compartments in target tissues. To study the mechanisms leading to this intracellular localization, two main isoforms of leptin receptors, OB-Ra and OB-Rb, were expressed in HeLa cells. Both isoforms were localized at steady state in the trans-Golgi network, in endosomes, and to a lesser extent, at the cell surface. They turned over with a half-life of less than 2 h. Both isoforms of leptin receptors were constitutively endocytosed in a ligand-independent manner and degraded in lysosomes with no evidence of recycling to the cell surface or to the trans-Golgi network. The endocytosis was inhibited by the deletion of the cytoplasmic domain. Newly synthesized leptin receptors were partially retained in the Golgi complex or in a post-Golgi intracellular compartment. The transmembrane domain was found to be important for this intracellular retention in the biosynthetic pathway, whereas the cytoplasmic domain was not involved. The data suggest that the low levels of expression of leptin receptors at the cell surface results from partial retention in the biosynthetic pathway, coupled to constitutive removal from the plasma membrane via ligand-independent, constitutive endocytosis.

Leptin is a polypeptide hormone secreted by adipocytes, which plays a major role in the regulation of food intake, energy expenditure, and neuroendocrine functions (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4840) Google Scholar). Leptin action is mediated by receptors that are located in the hypothalamus and in many peripheral tissues. Leptin receptors (OB-R) 1The abbreviations used are: OB-R, leptin receptor; EEA-1, early endosome antigen-1; Endo-H, endo-β-N-glucosaminidase H; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TCID50, tissue culture infectious dose 50; TGN, trans-Golgi network; TM, transmembrane; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 1The abbreviations used are: OB-R, leptin receptor; EEA-1, early endosome antigen-1; Endo-H, endo-β-N-glucosaminidase H; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TCID50, tissue culture infectious dose 50; TGN, trans-Golgi network; TM, transmembrane; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. are type I membrane glycoproteins structurally related to class I cytokine receptors (3Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6093-6096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Different OB-R isoforms have been described, including OB-Ra and OB-Rb. OB-Rb is often referred to as the long isoform of the leptin receptor. OB-Ra, a short isoform, is the major form of leptin receptor found in most peripheral tissues. Both OB-Ra and OB-Rb are co-expressed in a large number of tissues. All known OB-R isoforms originate from a single gene by alternative splicing of the transcript and only differ in their C termini. OB-Ra and OB-Rb share identical N-terminal leptin binding domains, single spanning transmembrane (TM) domains, and the 29 proximal residues of their cytoplasmic domains. They diverge in the C-terminal part of their cytoplasmic domains. OB-Ra has a unique 5-residue long C-terminal extension, which is changed in OB-Rb for a 273-residue long extension (3Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6093-6096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). OB-Rb has been shown to activate various signal transduction pathways. The best characterized leptin-induced transduction pathway triggered by OB-Rb is Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2)-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (4Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 5Ghilardi N. Skoda R.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). OB-Rb was also found to activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (6Niswender K.D. Morton G.J. Stearns W.H. Rhodes C.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Schwartz M.W. Nature. 2001; 413: 794-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase (7Bjørbæk C. Buchholz R.M. Davis S.M. Bates S.H. Pierroz D.D.

Kim Y.B. Peroni O.D. Fryer L.G. Müller C. Carling D. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) pathways in response to leptin. In contrast, the function of OB-Ra remains undefined. It has been shown that OB-Ra could bind to and activate JAK2 in vitro (9Bjørbæk C. Uotani S. da Silva B. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32686-32695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 10Couturier C. Jockers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26604-26611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but there is no evidence that OB-Ra actually has a signal transduction activity in vivo (4Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that OB-Ra and other short isoforms could function as transcytotic receptors for leptin to cross the blood-brain barrier or as clearance receptors. Mutations in either the leptin or OB-R genes cause extreme obesity in mice (11Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M.

Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These mutations are however rare, and most obese humans have a decreased sensitivity to leptin coupled to high levels of circulating leptin, a state known as leptin resistance (1Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4492) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4840) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for leptin resistance is not yet understood. Mechanisms for leptin resistance have been hypothesized as defects in leptin signaling and/or defects in transport of leptin across the blood-brain barrier (14Halaas J.L. Boozer C. Blair-West J. Fidahusein N. Denton D.A. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8878-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Potential mechanisms for leptin resistance should also include defects in intracellular trafficking that could lead to an altered OB-R cell surface expression. This latter hypothesis, which has thus far been overlooked, is however supported by several reports showing that in neuronal cell bodies of the hypothalamus, as well as in other cell types, most of the leptin receptor-immunoreactive protein is found in the cytoplasm, rather than at the cell surface (15Baskin D.G. Schwartz M.W. Seeley R.J. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Breininger J.F. Jonak Z. Schaefer J. Krouse M. Burghardt C. Campfield L.A. Burn P. Kochan J.P. J. Histochem.

Neuroendocrinology. 1998; 68: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This suggests that OB-Rs turn over rapidly, and/or that the levels of OB-R cell surface expression are subject to an unusual kind of regulation. In vitro studies with transfected leptin receptors have confirmed the existence of a large intracellular OB-R pool (10Couturier C. Jockers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26604-26611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Barr V.A. Lane K. Taylor S.I. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1499: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The functional meaning of this distribution, and the relationship between the intracellular pools of receptor and the cell surface, where the interaction with leptin occurs, have not yet been investigated, and very little is known about its intracellular traffic. However, defining the dynamics of its trafficking clearly is a critical step toward understanding the regulation of its residence time at the cell surface, and therefore of leptin sensitivity. To determine the cellular mechanisms that underlie this intracellular retention, we have studied the intracellular traffic of OB-Ra and OB-Rb, with special interest in their expression at the cell surface. Our results show that both OB-R isoforms are short-lived membrane proteins, and that they both follow very similar intracellular routes, despite the functional and structural differences of their cytoplasmic domains. For both isoforms, receptors are constitutively endocytosed in a ligand-independent manner. We also present evidence that a fraction of neosynthesized leptin receptor is retained inside the cell and that this retention is mediated by the TM domain. Construction of Expression Vectors Encoding HA-tagged Leptin and Transferrin Receptors—The cDNA encoding the mouse leptin receptors OB-Ra and OB-Rb were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR from mouse brain total RNA. For both amplifications, the 5′ PCR primer was 5′-CTAGCTAGCGCCACCATGATGTGTCAGAAATTCTATGTG-3′. The 3′ PCR primers were 5′-ACGCGTCGACTCAAAGAGTGTCCGTTCTCTTT-3′ (for OB-Ra) or 5′-ACGCGTCGACTTACACAGTTAAGTCACACATC-3′ (for OB-Rb). The PCR products were gel-purified, digested with NheI and SalI (underlined sites in the primer sequences), and subcloned into the pCIneo expression vector (Promega) digested with the same restriction enzymes. OB-Rs were tagged by PCR-based insertion of a sequence encoding the peptide YDVPDYA between Pro27 and Ile28 residues of the mouse receptor precursor. In this fashion, the peptide is inserted just after Tyr26 and Pro27 residues of the receptor precursor sequence, and in the resulting constructs a HA epitope YPYDVPDYA is reconstituted. The tag is located five residues after the putative signal peptide cleavage site (21Haniu M. Arakawa T. Bures E.J. Young Y. Hui J.O. Rohde M.F. Welcher A.A. Horan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28691-28699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and is therefore located close to the N terminus of the mature OB-R. In order to facilitate mutagenesis in the TM and cytoplasmic domains, a unique BamHI site was introduced in place of an EcoRI site by mutating the codons of Arg785 and Ile786 from AGA ATT (C) to AGG ATC (C). The mutants containing the TM domain of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G) were assembled by PCR-based amplification using a set of primers in which the corresponding sequences of OB-Ra and VSV-G had been introduced as translational fusions. In the resulting constructs (OB-Ra/tm and OB-RΔ1/tm), OB-R residues Leu840 to Ser861 were replaced by residues Ser463 to Leu481 from VSV-G (GenBank™ accession number M11048). For the construction of the mutants with a truncation in the cytoplasmic domain (OB-RΔ1 and OB-RΔ1/tm), the reverse primer contained a stop codon and a SalI site after the codon of Arg864. In the double mutant OB-RΔ1/tm, the TM domain of VSV-G is followed by the sequence His-Gln-Arg, corresponding to the short piece of OB-R cytoplasmic domain, that is present in the OB-RΔ1 mutant. The resulting PCR fragments were gel-purified, digested with BamHI and SalI, and subcloned into the same sites in the HA-tagged OB-Ra vector. To construct an expression vector encoding the transferrin receptor HA-tagged in the luminal/extracellular domain, the human transferrin receptor coding sequence was amplified by PCR with the primers GGAATTCCTTCAGAATGATGGATCAAGCTAGA and GCTCTAGAAAACTCATTGTCAATGTCCCAAAC. The PCR products were gel-purified, digested with EcoRI and XbaI (underlined in the primer sequences), and subcloned into the pCDNA3-HA expression vector digested with the same restriction enzymes. The pCDNA3-HA vector was derived from pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) by inserting the coding seqence of the HA tag after the ApaI site of the polylinker. The resulting construct expresses the human transferrin receptor with a C-terminal extension of SRGPYPYDVPDYASL, containing an HA tag (underlined). All constructs were sequenced to ensure the lack of mutation, using an ABI PRISM 377 automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with T7, T3, and internal primers. Recombinant defective adenovirus vectors expressing HA-tagged OB-Ra or OB-Rb were generated by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli, as described (22Chartier C. Degryse E. Gantzer M. Dieterlé A. Pavirani A. Mehtali M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4805-4810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral stocks were generated, and amplified in HER-911 cells (23Fallaux F.J. Kranenburg O. Cramer S.J. Houweling A. Van Ormondt H. Hoeben R.C. Van Der Eb A.J. Hum. Genet. Ther. 1996; 7: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and titered in the same cells by the TCID50 method. Each stock was functionally tested in HeLa cells by infecting with serial dilutions in order to normalize expression levels and avoid overexpression of leptin receptors. Cell Lines—HeLa cells were grown in α-minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamax, 10% fetal bovine serum, and gentamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK-293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamax, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 16B12, and rat mAb 3F10 (anti-HA) were from BabCo and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Mouse anti-EEA-1, anti-GM-130, and anti-LAMP-1 mAbs were purchased from BD Pharmingen, and mouse anti-transferrin receptor mAb from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Rabbit anti-RAB-11-immunopurified polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Jean Salamero (Institut Curie, Paris). Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rat and anti-mouse IgG and Alexa-546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit were purchased from Molecular Probes. Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were diluted with an equal volume of 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for about 10 min at 95 °C, and run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.45 μm, Schleicher and Schuell). Blocking and antibody incubations were carried out in PBS containing 5% dried skim milk and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoreactive bands were identified using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and detection was carried out using chemiluminescence (Renaissance kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Binding of 125I-Leptin—OB-Ra was expressed in HeLa cells by transient transfection using the FuGENE 6 reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Leptin binding was performed on cells grown in 6-well plates. Cells were washed with cold PBS, and incubated with 15 pm125I-leptin (138 μCi/μg, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), in the presence or absence of an excess of cold mouse leptin (100 nm, Calbiochem) for 2.5 h on ice in a final volume of 1 ml of binding buffer (HEPES-buffered bicarbonate-free d-MEM containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma)). At the end of incubation, unbound 125I-leptin was removed by three cold PBS washes. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold solution containing 1 n NaOH, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, and radioactivity in lysate was measured using a γ counter. Luciferase Reporter Assay—HEK-293T cells grown in 24-well plates were co-transfected with 100 ng of OB-R expression vector (or control plasmid pCIneo), 100 ng of pSTAT3-TA-luc (BD Biosciences), and 10 ng of pRL-TK (Promega), with the ExGen500 reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer (Euromedex, Strasbourg, France). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed and replaced with serum-free medium for 16 h, and leptin was added to a final concentration of 100 nm. After 6 h, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity measured using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Transfected or infected HeLa cells were grown onto glass cover slips in 24-well plates. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized by a 3-min incubation in 0.1% Triton X-100. Both primary and secondary antibody incubations were carried out in PBS containing 10% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. OB-Rs were detected using the anti-HA mouse mAb 16B12 (BabCo) and Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Cover slips were mounted on slides using immunofluor mounting medium (ICN). Images were obtained with an Axiophot 2 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device Micromax (Princeton), and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. For antibody uptake experiments, cells were washed with prewarmed α-MEM and overlaid with 200 μl of complete α-MEM, in which the mAb 16B12 had been diluted to 2 μg/ml. After 1 h of incubation, the internalization medium was removed, and the cells were immediately fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. For co-localization experiments, dual labeling was carried out with a mixture of anti-HA rat mAb 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) and various mouse mAbs. The primary antibodies were visualized with Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Alternatively, cells were decorated with anti-HA mouse Mab 16B12, and an anti-RAB-11-immunopurified rabbit polyclonal antibody, followed by Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa-546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. Confocal microscopy was performed with an SP2 laser-scanning microscope (Leica) using a 100×/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens. Double label immunofluorescence signals were sequentially collected using single fluorescence excitation and acquisition settings to avoid crossover. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells expressing the tagged OB-Rs were grown in 6-well plates. They were starved for 20 min in serum-free medium lacking methionine and cysteine, labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling mix (100 μCi/ml; Promix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min, quickly washed with PBS, and chased in a medium containing 1 mm methionine and 1 mm cysteine. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates were precleared by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the beads were removed by centrifugation. Antibodies were added (1 μg for 0.5 ml of lysate), and the formation of immune complexes was allowed at 4 °C during an overnight incubation. The immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, twice with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, once in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated at 95 °C for about 10 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography, and quantified with a Phosphorimager. For Endo-H digestion, the immunoprecipitated material (30 μl) was diluted to 400 μl with 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer pH 5.5, and divided in two aliquots of equal volume. Endo-H (1000 units, New England Biolabs) was added to one aliquot, and both were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid before loading on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Endocytosis Assay—HeLa cells expressing OB-Ra or OB-Rb were preincubated for 2 h in serum-free medium at 37 °C. To label cell surface proteins, the cells were incubated with the cleavable, EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (0.3 mg/ml) (Pierce) in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C, and the biotinylation solution was renewed for another 15-min incubation. Unreacted biotin was quenched with 50 mm glycine in PBS. After washing, the cells were quickly warmed up at 37 °C in a water bath, and incubated for up to 15 min in HEPES-buffered, bicarbonate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented or not with 100 nm mouse leptin. Cells were rapidly rinsed with cold PBS to block any further internalization, and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min with the impermeant reducing agent glutathione (50 mm) in 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, 10% fetal calf serum to cleave the biotin bound to non-endocytosed proteins. This procedure was repeated twice, and the cells were then incubated twice for 15 min in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 50 mm iodoacetamide to quench free SH groups. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and biotinylated proteins recovered using streptavidin-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing, the bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Assay of Transport to the Cell Surface—To quantitate the extent of OB-R transport to the cell surface, the cells were metabolically labeled for 30 min, and chased in the presence the anti-HA mAb 16B12 in the chase medium (10 μg/ml), in order to bind HA-tagged OB-Rs as they get access to the cell surface. After 0.5–4 h, cells were washed in cold PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer. Protein G-Sepharose was then added directly to cell lysates, and binding was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C. To obtain a quantitative precipitation of the immune complexes, a second incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads was carried out. OB-R molecules that did not bind the antibody during the chase (and presumably did not reach the cell surface) were then immunoprecipitated from the supernatants of the protein G-Sepharose purification by addition of 1 μg of mAb 16B12 and two rounds of protein G-Sepharose pull-downs. The beads were washed as described above, and both bead pellets of each immunoprecipitation were pooled. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography and quantified with a phosphorimager. Statistical Analysis—The data on cell surface expression of OB-R mutants are expressed as the means ± S.D. from at least four independent experiments. Mutants were compared with OB-Ra using a paired Student's t test. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Characterization of HA-tagged Leptin Receptors—To characterize leptin receptors tagged with an HA epitope at the N terminus (Fig. 1A), HeLa cells were transfected, and the expression of OB-Ra and OB-Rb was analyzed by immunoblotting. Anti-HA antibodies revealed a single band migrating close to molecular mass markers of 220 and 135 kDa for OB-Rb and OB-Ra, respectively (Fig. 1B), in agreement with results previously obtained by other groups (21Haniu M.

The relative levels of OB-Rb expression, as measured by immunoblotting, were consistently lower than that of OB-Ra, even when the synthesis of both isoforms, estimated by pulse labeling and immunoprecipitation, were similar. This suggests that OB-Ra and OB-Rb might have different half-lives, or alternatively that the detection of OB-Rb by immunoblotting might be incomplete. To test the functionality of HA-tagged leptin receptors, transfected HeLa cells were incubated with 125I-leptin. OB-Ra-expressing cells specifically bound 125I-leptin (Fig. 1C). The functionality of tagged OB-R was further assessed by luciferase reporter assay. In cells expressing non-tagged OB-Rb, and in cells expressing HA-tagged OB-Rb, a significant leptin-induced activation of STAT3 was detected (Fig. 1D), whereas control cells and cells expressing OB-Ra failed to show any significant leptin-induced STAT3 activation. These data show that the insertion of an HA tag at the N terminus of the extracellular domain does not prevent leptin binding and intracellular signaling. Subcellular Distribution of the Leptin Receptors—The subcellular distribution of OB-Ra and OB-Rb was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Both isoforms were observed at three localizations corresponding to a perinuclear compartment, a peripheral punctuate compartment, and the plasma membrane. The cell surface staining was generally weak, and could not always be detected in cells expressing lower levels of leptin receptors. Confocal microscopy showed that in the perinuclear area, OB-R staining overlapped with the TGN marker GFP-ciMPR (Fig 2, A–C). GFP-ciMPR is a chimeric protein, containing a luminal GFP domain linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the human cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which is localized in the TGN (27Waguri S. Dewitte F. Le Borgne R. Rouillé Y. Uchiyama Y. Dubremetz J.F. Hoflack B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 142-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The perinuclear OB-R containing compartment was also found to overlap with γ-adaptin, a subunit of AP-1 adaptor complex, which is mainly localized in the TGN (data not shown). Comparison of the perinuclear OB-R staining with GM-130, a Golgi marker, indicated a partial colocalization, but most of the staining was seen in adjacent compartments (Fig. 2, D–F). These data suggest that most of the perinuclear pool of leptin receptor is localized in the TGN, with lower amounts in the Golgi. The punctuate staining partially co-localized with EEA-1, a marker of early endosomes (Fig. 2, G–I). Leptin receptor staining did not significantly co-localize with transferrin receptor (Fig. 2, J–L) and RAB-11 (Fig. 2, M–O), two markers of recycling compartments, nor with LAMP-1, a lysosomal marker (Fig. 2, P–R). Taken together, these results indicate that leptin receptors are localized at steady state in the TGN, in endosomes, and to a lesser extent, at the cell surface. Similar results were obtained for both OB-R isoforms following either a transient transfection or an adenoviral infection. Relationships between Intracellular Pools of Leptin Receptors and the Cell Surface—To characterize the dynamics of leptin receptors between intracellular compartments and the cell surface, we carried out antibody uptake experiments. After internalization, anti-HA antibodies could be observed in endosomes, but were never detected in the Golgi/TGN area, even after longer uptakes (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that the cell surface receptors do not recycle to the TGN after endocytosis, and therefore that the perinuclear staining observed at steady state was most probably made of newly synthesized receptors en route to"
https://openalex.org/W2088603460,"In this study we have investigated hyaluronan (HA)-CD44 interaction with protein kinase N-γ (PKNγ), a small GTPase (Rac1)-activated serine/threonine kinase in human keratinocytes. By using a variety of biochemical and molecular biological techniques, we have determined that CD44 and PKNγ kinase (molecular mass ∼120 kDa) are physically linked in vivo. The binding of HA to keratinocytes promotes PKNγ kinase recruitment into a complex with CD44 and subsequently stimulates Rac1-mediated PKNγ kinase activity. The Rac1-activated PKNγ in turn increases threonine (but not serine) phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC) γ1 and up-regulates PLCγ1 activity leading to the onset of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. HA/CD44-activated Rac1-PKNγ also phosphorylates the cytoskeletal protein, cortactin, at serine/threonine residues. The phosphorylation of cortactin by Rac1-PKNγ attenuates its ability to cross-link filamentous actin in vitro. Further analyses indicate that the N-terminal antiparallel coiled-coil (ACC) domains of PKNγ interact directly with Rac1 in a GTP-dependent manner. The binding of HA to CD44 induces PKNγ association with endogenous Rac1 and its activity in keratinocytes. Transfection of keratinocytes with PKNγ-ACCcDNA reduces HA-mediated recruitment of endogenous Rac1 to PKNγ and blocks PKNγ activity. These findings suggest that the PKNγ-ACC fragment acts as a potent competitive inhibitor of endogenous Rac1 binding to PKNγ in vivo. Most important, the PKNγ-ACC fragment functions as a strong dominant-negative mutant that effectively inhibits HA/CD44-mediated PKNγ phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and cortactin as well as keratinocyte signaling (e.g. Ca2+ mobilization and cortactin-actin binding) and cellular functioning (e.g. cell-cell adhesion and differentiation). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that hyaluronan-CD44 interaction with Rac1-PKNγ plays a pivotal role in PLCγ1-regulated Ca2+ signaling and cortactin-cytoskeleton function required for keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion and differentiation.

The most common form, CD44s (CD44 standard form), contains exons 1-5 (N-terminal 150 amino acids), exons 15 and 16 (membrane proximal 85 amino acids), exon 17 (transmembrane domain), and a portion of exons 17 and 19 (cytoplasmic tail, 70 amino acids) (5Screaton G.R.

Consequently, both post-translational modifications and/or alternative splicing within the CD44 molecule appear to determine the functional outcome of this important molecule. The binding of HA to CD44 causes cells to adhere to extracellular matrix (ECM) components and has also been implicated in the stimulation of several different biological activities (16Bourguignon L.Y.W.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 is known to be tightly coupled with c-Src kinase, which promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (a filamentous actin (F-actin)-associated protein) and cytoskeleton function resulting in specific structural changes in the plasma membrane and cell migration (18Bourguignon L.Y.W.

These findings strongly suggest that the CD44 molecule provides a direct linkage between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. RhoGTPases (small molecular weight GTPases (e.g. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42)) act as molecular switches that alternate between GTP- and GDP-bound states. The “activated” GTP-bound enzymes preferentially interact with downstream effector molecules and modulate the activities of the effectors (25Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). Previous work has indicated that HA also promotes the interaction between CD44 and several Rac1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (e.g. Tiam1 (22Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Shao L. Chen Y.W.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In keratinocytes, Rac1 has been shown to be co-localized with E-cadherin in cell-cell adhesion sites (27Akhtar N. Hudson K.R. Hotchin N.A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 2000; 7: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Activation of Rho signaling is also involved in cytoskeleton-associated lamellipodia formation in keratinocytes (28Koivisto L. Hakkinen L. Matsumoto K. McCulloch C.A. Yamada K.M. Larjava H. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several enzymes have been identified as possible downstream targets for Rac1 signaling. One such enzyme is protein kinase N-γ (PKNγ) (also called PRK2), which belongs to a family of serine-threonine kinases known to interact with Rac1 in a GTP-dependent manner, and it shares a great deal of sequence homology with protein kinase C in the C-terminal region (29Mukai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell.

Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28772-28776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of PKN contains three homologous stretches of ∼70 amino acids (relatively rich in charged residues) and forms an antiparallel coiled-coil fold (ACC domain) (29Mukai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This ACC domain has been shown to interact with RhoGTPases such as RhoA and Rac1 (and to a lesser extent with Cdc42) (29Mukai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31Quilliam L.A.

The C-terminal region contains the C2-like region, which functions as an auto-inhibitory domain (32Yoshinaga C. Mukai H. Toshimori M. Miyamoto M. Ono Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The ACC and the C2-like domains, together with the catalytic domain, are conserved among the PKN family members (29Mukai H. J.

(Tokyo). 1999; 126: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In keratinocytes, RhoA-activated PKNγ has been found to be involved in Fyn/Src kinase-regulated cell-cell adhesion during Ca2+-induced differentiation (33Calautti E. Grossi M. Mammucari C. Aoyama Y. Pirro M. Ono Y. Li J. Dotto G.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The question of whether HA/CD44-induced Rac1 activation and PKNγ-targeted downstream effectors are involved in regulating keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion and differentiation has not been clearly addressed. HA binding to CD44-expressing cells also stimulates intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, which is a prerequisite for the onset of a variety of biological activities (34Bourguignon L.Y.W. Lokeshwar V.B. Chen X. Kerrick W.G.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6634-6644PubMed Google Scholar, 35Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil.

Although the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in HA/CD44-mediated Ca2+ signaling are currently not well understood, one of the likely pathways involves the phosphatidylinositol cascade that leads to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (37Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar). In response to different stimuli (including HA), phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cs (PLCs) hydrolyze phosphatidyl-4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (35Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 53: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). IP3, as a second messenger, binds to the IP3 receptor and induces the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (34Bourguignon L.Y.W. Lokeshwar V.B. Chen X. Kerrick W.G.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6634-6644PubMed Google Scholar, 35Singleton P.A. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 53: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Singleton P.A.

At least four major PLC families exist, PLC-β, PLC-γ, PLC-δ, and PLC-ϵ, and each family type has a number of subtypes (38Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 39Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized PLCs in keratinocytes is PLC-γ1, which is involved in inositol lipid signaling and keratinocyte differentiation (40Xie Z. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20421-20424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 41Li L. Tucker R. Hennings H. Yuspa S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Specifically, Xie and Bikle (40Xie Z. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20421-20424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have shown that blockage of PLC-γ1 expression with antisense PLC-γ1cDNA or down-regulation of PLC-γ1 activity with a specific inhibitor (41Li L. Tucker R. Hennings H. Yuspa S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) can effectively impair Ca2+-induced keratinocyte differentiation. These findings suggest that intracellular PLC-γ1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization plays a critical role in regulating keratinocyte differentiation. Although RacGTPase has been closely associated with remodeling of cortical actin (in particular, cortactin-cytoskeleton interaction) (28Koivisto L. Hakkinen L. Matsumoto K. McCulloch C.A. Yamada K.M.

In this study we have investigated HA/CD44-mediated Rac1-PKNγ kinase signaling and its downstream effector function (PLC-γ1-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and cortactin-actin interaction) during human keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion and differentiation. Cell Culture Model Systems—Normal human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal human foreskins and grown in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM, Clonetics, San Diego, CA) as described previously (45Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Hincenbergs M. Elias P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocytes were isolated from newborn human foreskins by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, 4 °C, overnight), and primary cultures were established in KGM containing 0.07 mm calcium. After the first and second passages, keratinocytes were incubated with KGM containing 0.03 mm calcium and used in the experiments described below. Antibodies and Reagents—Monoclonal rat anti-human CD44 antibody (clone, 020; isotype, IgG2b; obtained from CMB-TECH, Inc., San Francisco) used in this study recognizes a common determinant of the CD44 class of glycoproteins including CD44s (the standard form), CD44 variant isoforms, and CD443-10 (Epican). Rabbit anti-phosphothreonine antibody and rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Polyclonal mouse anti-involucrin and polyclonal mouse anti-transglutaminase were purchased from Covance Inc. (Princeton, NJ) and Neomarkers (Fremont, CA), respectively. Rabbit anti-PKNγ, rabbit anti-PLCγ1, mouse anti-RhoA, and mouse anti-Rac1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse anti-His and mouse anti-cortactin antibody (clone 4F11) were purchased from Invitrogen and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), respectively.

We report here that both p35 and p39 were expressed in insulin-secreting β-cells, where they exhibited individual subcellular distributions and associated with membranous organelles of different densities.

There are a series of discrete biochemical steps leading to trans-SNARE complex formation and vesicular fusion. The vesicles need to be transported and targeted to the cell surface where they are docked, primed, and finally fused with the plasma membrane. Munc18-1, a member of the sec1/Munc18 protein family has emerged as a critical regulator of exocytosis (12Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 13Gallwitz D. Jahn R. Trends Biochem.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Indeed, Munc18-1 is shown to be important for vesicle trafficking and essential for synaptic transmission since both synaptic transmission and spontaneous neurotransmitter release is abolished in neocortical neurons from Munc18-1-null mouse mutants (15Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Südhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Albeit essential for regulated exocytosis, it has been demonstrated both in pancreatic β-cells and in neuronal systems, that Munc18-1 may also serve as a negative regulator of secretion (11Zhang W. Efanov A. Yang S.N. Fried G. Kolare S. Brown H. Zaitsev S. Berggren P.O. Meister B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41521-41527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 16Schulze K.L. Littleton J.T. Salzberg A. Halachmi N. Stern M. Lev Z. Bellen H.J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2923-2932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Munc18-1 binds to syntaxin 1 and might thus negatively regulate syntaxin 1 function if the expression levels of these two proteins are not coordinated (18Wu M.N. Littleton J.T. Bhat M.A. Prokop A. Bellen H.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). One of the proposed functions of Munc18-1 is to hold syntaxin 1 in a closed conformation, thereby preventing syntaxin 1 to participate in trans-SNARE formation (19Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms regulating the transition of syntaxin 1 from a closed to an open conformation, thus releasing it from the donor Munc18-1, prior SNARE complex formation with SNAP-25 and VAMP are not fully elucidated. Alternative mechanisms for disassembly of the syntaxin 1/Munc18-1 complex have been proposed and phosphorylations of both Munc18-1 and syntaxin 1 by different kinases are known to modulate their binding properties. For example, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylation of Munc18-1 in vitro disrupts the complex and phosphorylation of syntaxin 1A by death-associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase) significantly reduces its binding affinity to Munc18-1 (20Fletcher A.I.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26265-26274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Munc18-1 is also phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC). However, once Munc18-1 is associated with syntaxin-1 the PKC phosphorylation sites are no longer accessible (22Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kotani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Munc18-interacting proteins like Munc13 and RIM (Rab3-interacting molecule) have also been suggested to mediate the release of syntaxin (reviewed in Ref. 12Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Cdk5 is a proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase. In contrast to other Cdks and their cyclins, the important regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle, Cdk5 activity is mainly associated with postmitotic neurons where the non-cyclin regulatory subunits p35 and p39 are expressed (23Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 24Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26897-26903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The function of Cdk5/p35 has been far more studied than that of Cdk5/p39, but it is known that during neurodevelopment p35 and p39 have distinct but also redundant functions (26Ko J. Humbert S. Bronson R.T. Takahashi S. Kulkarni A.B. Li E. Tsai L.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6758-6771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdk5 phosphorylates numerous proteins and therefore many signaling pathways and cellular functions are influenced by Cdk5 activity (27Smith D.S. Greer P.L. Tsai L.H. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 277-283PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 29Smith D.S. Tsai L.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 28-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For example, Cdk5 has an impact on the organization of actin filaments during promotion of neurite outgrowth and cell migration, and it modulates other cytoskeletal components by phosphorylating neurofilaments and tau. Furthermore, several lines of research have suggested that some synaptic proteins, such as Munc18-1 and synapsin 1 are substrates for Cdk5 (20Fletcher A.I. Shuang R. Giovannucci D.R. Zhang L.

Intriguingly, Cdk5 has been demonstrated to have the ability to both promote regulated exocytosis of insulin and function as a negative regulator of dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission in the striatum (32Lilja L.

Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2191-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cdk5 was recently identified as a dephosphin kinase, essential for synaptic vesicle endocytosis, establishing Cdk5 as a key controller of membrane trafficking in nerve terminals (34Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J.

A. 2004; 101: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cdk5 has also been implicated in postsynaptic signaling triggered by dopamine through the dopamine and cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) and inhibitor-1 (I-1), proteins that through their phosphorylation status regulate the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (reviewed in Refs. 27Smith D.S. Greer P.L. Tsai L.H. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 277-283PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 29Smith D.S. Tsai L.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 28-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We previously reported that Cdk5 is present in pancreatic β-cells where it acts as a positive regulator of insulin secretion (32Lilja L. Yang S.N. Webb D.L. Juntti-Berggren L. Berggren P.O. Bark C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34199-34205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The goals of the present study were to investigate the expression, subcellular distribution and potential roles of p35 and p39 in Cdk5-mediated insulin secretion. Additionally, we aimed to explore potential substrates or mechanisms by which Cdk5 promotes insulin exocytosis. We have now demonstrated that Cdk5 in association with its regulatory protein p39 stimulates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in primary β-cells via phosphorylation of Munc18-1. We propose that Cdk5/p39 regulates insulin exocytosis at a biochemical step immediately after Ca2+-influx but prior vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Preparation of Islets and Single β-Cells—Mouse pancreatic β-cells were isolated from 10-12-month-old ob/ob mice as previously described (37Lernmark A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 38Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Hallberg A. Hellman B. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ob/ob islets are composed of more than 90% β-cells (38Nilsson T. Arkhammar P. Hallberg A. Hellman B. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Hellman B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1965; 131: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The cells used for immunocytochemistry were seeded onto coverslips and incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for up to 3 days in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Invitrogen), containing 11 mm glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 international units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. For electrophysiological recordings female NMRI mice (18-22 g; Bomholtgaard, Ry, Denmark) were stunned by a blow against the head and killed by cervical dislocation. The pancreas was quickly removed and islets of Langerhans were isolated by collagenase (type XI; Sigma) digestion. Single islet cells were prepared by shaking in a Ca2+-free solution. The cell suspension was plated on Nunc Petri dishes and incubated as described above. The procedure for sacrificing the animals was approved by local authorities. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from mouse brain (C57BL6) and pancreatic islets (ob/ob) using the RNeasy Mini kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). RTPCR was performed using the SuperScript™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). p35- and p39-specific primers were designed and synthesized (Amersham Biosciences and GenSet) according to data base sequences (p35 primers 5′-taggatccgccatcacctctgcagggac-3′ and 5′-tagtcgactcaccgatccagccccag-3′ and p39 primers 5′-cctctacctcgcctactcctac-3′ and 5′-atccctagcggtccaagttc-3′). The RT-PCR reactions were performed using 10 pmol of each primer and the following program: 30 min at 50 °C and 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55-60 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, ending with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. A 1-kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen) was used as size marker. Antibodies—Antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdk5 antibody, C8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-p35 antibody, C19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The p25N rabbit antiserum and a rabbit polyclonal anti-p39 antibody were kind gifts from Dr. K. Ishiguro (40Uchida T. Ishiguro K. Ohnuma J. Takamatsu M. Yonekura S. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Dr. J. Wang (41Wu D.C. Yu Y.P. Lee N.T. Yu A.C. Wang J.H. Han Y.F. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), respectively. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the last fourteen amino acids of the mouse p39 protein was synthesized and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against that epitope. The resulting anti-p39 antibody was designated anti-p39Cterm. For detection of insulin, a mouse monoclonal anti-insulin antibody, HB125 (Biogenex) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-insulin antibody, H-86 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. A mouse monoclonal anti-syntaxin 1 antibody, HPC-1 (Sigma) was used as a plasma membrane marker in immunoblotting. A mouse monoclonal antibody raised against Munc18-1 was used for immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry on primary β-cells (Transduction Laboratories). Secondary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (H+L) and Alexa Fluor 546 anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugates purchased from Molecular Probes. The secondary antibodies used in immunoblotting were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Dako Corporation and Rockland). Immunocytochemistry—Primary β-cells isolated from ob/ob mice were cultured 2-3 days as described above. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described previously (42Andersson J. Fried G. Lilja L. Meister B. Bark C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The stainings were analyzed with a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS confocal laser-scanner equipped with HeNe and Ar lasers and connected to a Leica DMLFSA microscope. The images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. Tissue Homogenization and Immunoblotting—Pancreatic islets and brain tissue isolated from ob/ob mice were homogenized in buffer containing (in mm): 20 HEPES, 2 EDTA, 1 MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture, according to instructions from the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics), pH 7.4. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Samples were separated on 10% Bis-Tris NU-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk powder and 0.025% Tween-20 (VWR International) for 1 h and then probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulins for 45 min at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus or ECL Advance, Amersham Biosciences), using a CCD camera (LAS 1000, Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) that provides optimal linearity of signal intensity. Subcellular Fractionation—Isolated islets from ob/ob mice were incubated for 1 h in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 3 or 17 mm glucose and supplements as described above. The islets were washed, homogenized and centrifuged as described previously (32Lilja L. Yang S.N. Webb D.L. Juntti-Berggren L. Berggren P.O. Bark C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34199-34205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 15-16 fractions (300 μl each) were collected from the top of the gradient. The linearity of the gradients was examined by measuring the refractive index of each fraction. Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were separated on 10% Bis-Tris NU-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated with appropriate antibodies followed by ECL as described above. Membrane/Soluble Fractionation of Sucrose Gradient Fractions—Fraction 10 (with maximal amounts of p35) and fraction 12 (with maximal amounts of p39) from sucrose density gradients were diluted to a sucrose concentration of 0.25 m. Membrane-bound organelles were disrupted by freezing and thawing the diluted fractions five times. The membrane and soluble fraction of the F10 and F12 were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were separated on NU-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated with appropriate antibodies followed by ECL as described above. Expression Vectors—Expression constructs encoding wild-type (wt) and a dominant negative (dn) form of Cdk5 were gifts of S. van den Heuvel (43van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). In the dnCdk5 mutant an Asp (D) is changed to an Asn (N) at amino acid 144. This amino acid substitution results in a catalytically inactive kinase (23Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 44Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The templates for p35 and p39 were subclones of genomic DNA generated after screening of a mouse genomic library (45Nildén F. Bäckström A. Bark C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA encoding the mouse p35 protein was cut out from the subclone with NcoI (blunt-ended) and BamHI. The generated fragment was inserted into the bicistronic pIRES2-EGFP expression vector (Clontech) using XhoI (blunt-ended) and BamHI cloning sites. Genomic DNA encoding the mouse p39 protein was PCR-amplified with the following primers, 5′-taatgaattcgctctgcaCCatgggcac-3′ and 5′-gatcggatccctagcggtccaagttc-3′, containing restriction sites for EcoRI and BamHI respectively (underlined sequences). To achieve a more efficient translation initiation the forward primer was modified to generate a Kozak sequence (mutated nucleotides in capital letters, original sequence is gg; GenBank™ accession number AF016393). The generated PCR product was subcloned into pGEM®-T easy vector (Promega), and thereafter inserted into the bicistronic pIRES2-EGFP expression vector using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. Both expression constructs were sequenced. Munc18-1 templates were kind gifts from Drs. R. Toonen, M. Verhage, and E. Stuenkel, respectively. The Munc18-1 wild-type template and the PKC mutant (triple mutations to alanine (A) in PKC-putative phosphorylation sites: Ser306, Ser312, and Ser313) were cloned into the bicistronic expression vector pIRES2-EGFP using EcoRI and BamHI or PstI restriction sites. The Cdk5 mutant (mutation in Cdk5-phosphorylation site, Thr574 → Ala574) was subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ vector (Stratagene) and thereafter inserted into the pIRES2-EGFP vector using PstI and SacII restriction sites. To ensure that the different constructs were correct and expressed properly, they were analyzed by DNA sequencing and transiently transfected into a insulinoma cell line (MIN6) followed by immunoblotting. Gene Expression in MIN6 Cells—MIN6 cells were transfected with munc18-1wt-pIRES2-EGFP, munc18-1Cdk5mt-pIRES2-EGFP, munc18-1PKCmt-pIRES2-EGFP or pIRES2-EGFP (mock), using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 technique (Invitrogen) and cultured for 48-72 h in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen), containing 11 mm glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 international units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 64 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were lysed in 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and protease inhibitor mixture as described by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). Equal amounts of protein from each sample were separated on 10% Bis-Tris NU-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated with appropriate antibodies followed by ECL as described above. Antisense Oligonucleotide Treatment—Cultures of primary β-cells were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein (1 μg/ml; Clontech) and 5 μm antisense or sense oligonucleotides using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and cultured for 24 h before capacitance measurements were performed. The antisense and sense oligonucleotides were synthesized at TAG Copenhagen (Denmark) and were phosphothioated at the indicated positions. The following oligonucleotides were used: Cdk5 antisense: 5′-TTCTCGTATTTCTGC-3′ (46Pigino G. Paglini G. Ulloa L. Avila J. Caceres A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 257-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdk5 sense: 5′-GCAGAAATACGAGAA-3′ (47Iijima K. Ando K. Takeda S. Satoh Y. Seki T. Itohara S. Greengard P. Kirino Y. Nairn A.C. Suzuki T. J.

Pigino G. Kunda P. Morfini G. Maccioni R. Quiroga S. Ferreira A. Caceres A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9858-9869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Capacitance Measurements in Transfected β-Cells—Single mouse pancreatic β-cells were transfected with either wtCdk5-pCMV, dnCdk5-pCMV, p35-pIRES2-EGFP, p39-pIRES2-EGFP, munc18-1wt-pIRES2-EGFP, munc18-1Cdk5mt-pIRES2-EGFP, munc18-1PKCmt-pIRES2-EGFP, or pIRES2-EGFP (mock), using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 technique (Invitrogen). The wtCdk5-pCMV and dnCdk5-pCMV were co-transfected with pIRES2-EGFP. Two days after transfection, cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were selected for whole cell patch clamp capacitance measurements. Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries, coated with Sylgaard at their tips and fire-polished before use. The pipette resistance when filled with the pipette solutions was 2-4 MΩ. The zero-current potential was adjusted before establishment of the seal with the pipette in the recording bath. Exocytosis was measured as increases in cell capacitance using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier and the Pulse software (v. 8.35, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrech/Pfalz, Germany). The interval between two successive points was 0.2 s and the measurements of cell capacitance were initiated <5 s following establishment of the standard whole-cell configuration. The extracellular solution was composed of (in mm): 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 5 d-glucose. The volume of the recording chamber was 0.4 ml and maintained at 33 °C. Solution entered the recording chamber at a rate of 1.5 ml per min. The pipette solution consisted of (in mm): 125 potassium glutamate, 10 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 3 Mg-ATP, 10 EGTA, 7 CaCl2 (pH 7.15 with KOH). The free Ca2+ concentration of the resulting buffer was 500 nm using the binding constants of Martell and Smith (49Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Amino Acids and Amines. 1 and 2. Plenum Press, New York1971Google Scholar). Data Analysis of Capacitance Measurements—Results are presented as mean values ± S.E. for indicated number of experiments. The exocytotic rate (ΔCm/Δt) is presented as the increase in cell capacitance during the first 60 s following establishment of the whole cell configuration, excluding any rapid changes during the initial 5 s required for equilibration of the pipette solution with cytosol. Statistical significance was evaluated using Dunnett's test. Human GH Transfection and Secretion—6 × 105 INS-1E cells (50Janjic D. Maechler P. Sekine N. Bartley C. Annen A.S. Wolheim C.B. Biochem.

Immediately after transfection the cells were seeded in 48-multiwell plates (2 × 105 cells per well) and cultured for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in complete medium composed of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Secretion experiments were performed with all test and control conditions carried out on the same pool of transfected cells. The cells were first incubated for 2 h in glucose-free culture medium. The cells were then washed twice and preincubated for 3"
https://openalex.org/W2026004488,"The X protein of hepatitis B virus (HBx) plays a major role on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Apolipoprotein B (apoB) in the liver is an important glycoprotein for transportation of very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins. Although lipid accumulation in the liver is known as one of the factors for the HCC, the relationship between HBx and apoB during the HCC development is poorly understood. To better understand the biological significance of HBx in HCC, liver Chang cells that specifically express HBx were established and characterized. In this study we demonstrate that overexpression of HBx significantly up-regulates the expression of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:β-d-mannoside-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III (GnT-III), an enzyme that functions as a bisecting-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase in apoB, and increases GnT-III promoter activity in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. GnT-III expression levels of HBx-transfected cells appeared to be higher than that of hepatocarcinoma cells as well as GnT-III-transfected cells, indicating that HBx may has a strong GnT-III promotor-enhancing activity. Intracellular levels of apoBs, which contained the increased bisecting GlcNAc, were accumulated in HBx-transfected liver cells. These cells as well as GnT-III-transfected liver cells revealed the inhibition of apoB secretion and the increased accumulation of intracellular triglyceride and cholesterol compared with vector-transfected cells. Moreover, overexpression of GnT-III and HBx in liver cells was shown to down-regulate the transcriptional level of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which regulates the assembly and secretion of apoB. Therefore, our study strongly suggested that the HBx increase in intracellular accumulation of aberrantly glycosylated apoB resulted in inhibition of secretion of apoB as well as intracellular lipid accumulation by elevating the expression of GnT-III.

Hepatogastroenterology. 1998; 45: 1221-1225PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatitis B virus is a major causative agent of acute and chronic hepatitis in humans (2Tiollais P. Charnay P. Vyas G.N. Science. 1981; 213: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and is closely associated with the incidence of human liver cancer. Among the four proteins that originate from the hepatitis B virus genome, HBx protein is a 17-kDa multifunctional regulatory protein and has been detected with high frequency in liver cells from patients with chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (3Kim C. Koike K. Saito I. Miyamura T. Jay G. Nature. 1991; 351: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). In our previous study HBx has an inhibitory effect on the p53-mediated transcription of the 3′-inositol phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10, which is associated with tumor suppression (4Chung T.W. Lee Y.C. Ko J.H. Kim C.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3453-3458PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HBx is thought to be associated with the development of HCC. However, the precise function of HBx in the tumorigenic transformation of liver cells remains unclear. The liver is the major organism for both the production of plasma lipoproteins and their uptake from plasma and catabolism (5Davis R.A. Hui T.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The production of apolipoprotein B (apoB, a 500-kDa protein)-containing lipoproteins by the liver is required for the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins (6Davis R.A.

Acta. 1994; 1212: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The assembly of apoB with lipid to form a secretion-competent particle is a complex process (11Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ginsberg H.N. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1997; 24: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that hepatic lipid availability is obligatory for apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly within the liver. This finding has been supported by studies demonstrating the necessity of triglyceride (12Ginsberg H.N. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol.

The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) also plays a key role in apoB secretion by catalyzing the transfer of lipids to the nascent apoB molecule as it is co-translationally translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (15Jamil H.

GnT-III catalyzes the attachment of a GlcNAc residue to mannose in the β(1–4) configuration in the region of N-glycans and forms a bisecting GlcNAc (17Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Sugiyama T. Hayashi N. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as shown in Scheme 1. Recent investigations revealed that the bisecting GlcNAc residue, a product of GnT-III activity, correlated with a number of biological events including the suppression of metastasis of mouse melanoma cells (18Pascale R. Narasimhan S. Rajalakshmi S. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and has been reported to be significantly elevated in the serum of human subjects with hepatomas, liver cirrhosis, as well as in HCC (19Ohno M.

Therefore, GnT-III also could be a factor for the development of HCC. ApoB is a glycoprotein and contains high mannose N-glycans or biantennary-type oligosaccharides in the case of human low density lipoproteins (26Swaminathan N. Aladjem F. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1516-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Taniguchi T. Ishikawa Y. Tsunemitsu M. Fukuzaki H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Some investigators show that the glycosylation of proteins and lipids are associated with development, differentiation, and carcinogenesis (28Hakomori S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 29Rademacher T.W. Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Annu. Rev.

Recently, aberrant glycosylation as the direct result of the formation of bisecting-GlcNAc by GnT-III has been shown to disrupt the function of apoB, leading to the generation of fatty liver (31Lee J.W.

On the basis of the findings reported herein, we provide evidence of the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibition of apoB secretion and intracellular accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol in vitro model by HBx/GnT-III expression. Cell Culture and Transfection—Chang cells (ATCC number CCL-13), a human liver cell line, were maintained using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were used for stable transfection with HBx and GnT-III cDNA using LipofectAMINE reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. The 465-bp and 1.6-kb cDNAs encoding the open reading frames for HBx and GnT-III were inserted into pcDNA3 expression vector at the HindIII/KpnI and BamHI/EcoRI sites, respectively. Transfected cells were then selected by cell culture medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 sulfate. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA from parental Chang cells and various transfected cells was prepared using TRIZOL (Invitrogen), and the cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcriptase with an oligo(dT) adaptor primer from the RNA LA PCR kit (Takara, Japan). To specifically detect the expression of endogenous human GnT-III and MTP, PCR was performed with the selective primers for human GnT-III and MTP in a PCR cycler. The primers used in this study were designed to detect mRNA for: human GnT-III, 5′-ACTTCTTCAAGACCCTGTCCTATGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGCCGTTGGCCCC CTCAGGCTTCT-3′ (antisense); MTP, 5′-TGCTGTCAGCATCTGG CGACCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAAAACCATCCGCTGGAAGTACTAT-3′ (antisense); β-actin. 5′-CAAGAGATGGCCACGGCTGCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCA-3′ (antisense). The sizes of products that were yielded by the PCR using these primers were expected to be 345, 500, and 247 bp for GnT-III, MTP, and β-actin, respectively. Northern Blot Analysis—To detect mRNA levels of HBx, GnT-III, and MTP, total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel. After electrophoresis the gel was blotted on Hybond C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). RNA was fixed to the membrane by cross-linking for 3 min using ultraviolet (UV). Hybridization was performed in Expresshyb (Clontech) to a random prime-labeled probe (Clontech) that encompassed the partial HBx, GnT-III, and MTP genes. Production GnT-III Antibody—Aglycosyl recombinant N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III protein deficient in the first 23 amino acids was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) followed by Sephacryl S-200 gel (Amersham Biosciences) filtration, and finally, preparative gel electrophoresis (33Song E.Y.

The procedure employed for the production of monoclonal antibodies was based on the protocol described by Harlow and Lane (34Harlow E.D. Lane P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-244Google Scholar). Balb/c mice were immunized by an intraperitoneal injection of aglycosyl recombinant N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III and mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant. Spleen cells from the mice were fused with the murine myeloma cell line SP2/0-Ag14. The monoclonal antibody-producing hybridomas were cloned by the limiting dilution technique and propagated by injecting them into mice. Subsequently, ascitic fluids were harvested and processed by protein G-Sepharose 4B chromatography to obtain purified monoclonal antibody as described previously (35Song E.Y. Kim K.S. Kim K.A. Kim Y.D. Kwon D.H. Byun S.M. Kim H.J. Chung T.W. Choe Y.K. Chung T.W. Kim C.H. Glycoconj. J. 2003; 9: l415-1421Google Scholar). Western Blot and Lectin Blot Analysis—Liver Chang cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 kallikrein inhibitor units of aprotinin per ml. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein (25 μg) was separated on SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking nonspecific binding sites, the membranes were incubated with specific antibodies, anti-GnT-III, anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon), anti-HBx (Koma Biotechnology, Korea), and anti-apoB (Calbiochem). After washing the membranes with phosphate-buffered saline three times, they were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. For detection of bisecting-GlcNAc residues, the membrane was incubated with 2 μg/ml biotinylated erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (E-PHA), Roche Applied Science). Lectins were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated lectins (Seikagakukougyo, Kyoto, Japan). Immunoblots were revealed by autoradiography using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—The cell lysate (0.5 mg/ml) was precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The precleared lysate was incubated with an anti-apoB antibody for 1 h, then 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. After extensive washing with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the immunoprecipitated apoB were eluted from beads with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Western blot and lectin blot were performed with anti-apoB and E-PHA, respectively, as described above. Construction of Plasmids and Transfections of Chang Cells with GnT-III Promoter-Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Gene Fusion Vector—pSV0-CAT, which expresses chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), was from the laboratory of Molecular Glycobiology, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejon, Korea. pGNT-CAT plasmid was constructed by ligating DNA fragment ranging from –1 to –1058 bp of GnT-III upstream region of promoter in pSV0-CAT. Cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of pGNT-CAT plasmid and different concentration of pCDNA-HBx gene by a LipofectAMINE-based transfection method. Transfected cells were cultured at 37 °C in 3% CO2 for 24 h followed by 5% CO2 for 24 h and used for the CAT assay. CAT Assay—The procedure previously developed by Bullock and Gorman (36Bullock C. Gorman C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 202-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was employed. Transfected cells from 1 plate were harvested, resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and subjected to 3 cycles of freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath and thawing in 37 °C incubator. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was saved in a clean tube. Total cell lysates were assayed for CAT activity were mixed with 4 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol (54 mCi/mmol), 70 μl of 1.0 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 20 μl of 4 mm acetyl-CoA, and distilled water to a final volume of 150 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, chloramphenicol was redissolved in 30 μl of ethyl acetate and applied to a TLC plate (Merck). The plate was incubated for 15 min in chloroform:methanol (95:5) and air-dried. After autoradiography, the radioactive spots on TLC plate were shown. Measurement of Triglyceride and Cholesterol in Liver Cells—To determine triglyceride and cholesterol content in vector and GnT-III- and HBx-transfected cells, Chang cells were starved for 24 h and then incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 μm concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acids (t-RAs) for 48 h. Triglyceride and cholesterol mass content from the cells was measured enzymatically (Sigma). Statistics—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and averages of three to five experiments. Means were compared by t tests to determine statistical significance. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. HBx Enhances the Expression of GnT-III by the Promoter Activity of the GnT-III Gene—Chang cells were transfected with the HBx cDNA using pcDNA expression vector. The expression of both HBx mRNA and protein was verified before the investigation of HBx-induced effects. The expression of HBx mRNA was confirmed by Northern blot analysis, and the RNA controls of the corresponding blots are shown in Fig. 1A. Furthermore, the expression of HBx protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-HBx antibodies (Fig. 1B). Although we were searching for some factors that induced GnT-III, we found that HBx protein enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of GnT-III in the HBx-transfected cells, Chang-HBx. To elucidate whether the endogenous GnT-III gene is activated in the Chang-HBx, the GnT-III mRNA and protein levels were measured by Northern blot (Fig. 2A), RT-PCR (Fig. 2B), and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). As shown by these data, the expression of GnT-III gene and protein was significantly elevated in Chang-HBx cells compared with Chang and Chang-pcDAN3 cells. Here, we postulate whether HBx may enhance the promoter activity of the GnT-III gene in the endogenous system. In a previous study we isolated and characterized the 5′-flanking region of GnT-III gene from human placental genome library (37Kim Y.J. Kim K.S. Ko J.H. Lee Y.C. Chung T.W. Choe I.S. Kim C.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A schematic diagram of the GnT-III promoter from –1058 to –1 is shown in Fig. 3A. Putative promoter elements are based on sequence comparison to known motifs: GRE, half-palindromic glucocorticoid-response element (TGTCCT), recognition sites for CREB (CGTGACGA), AP-2 (GGCCTGGGGA), and SP1 (GGGCGG). The EMBL data library accession number is L48489. To examine the effect of HBx on the promoter activity of human GnT-III gene, the plasmid pGNT-CAT containing GnT-III promoter in front of the CAT reporter gene was co-transfected in human normal liver Chang cells with an increasing amount of HBx expression vector (pcDNA3-HBx) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3B, the CAT activity of the GnT-III promoter was gradually elevated up to 5-fold by increasing the HBx expression vector, although detailed characterization of the promoter activity is limited due to its comprehensive properties of the GnT-III promoter region (38Koyama N. Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Kang R. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Kang B.S. Kim Y.J. Shim J.K. Song E.Y. Park Y.G. Lee Y.C. Nam K.S. Kim J.K. Lee T.K. Chung T.W. Kim C.H. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 31: 578-584Google Scholar). Therefore, these results showed that the HBx protein transactivated GnT-III gene transcriptionally and translationally. Comparison of the Levels of HBx and GnT-III mRNA and Protein in Normal Cells, Hepatocarcinoma Cells, and Our Transfected Cells—To compare the expression levels of HBx and GnT-III among the several cell lines, GnT-III cDNA was transfected into liver Chang cells, and RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were carried out using normal liver Chang cells, the hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2), and our transfected cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 5, we could not detect the HBx level in HepG2 cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A) and Western blot (Fig. 4B) because HepG2 is well known as hepatocarcinoma cell line, which is not integrated with hepatitis B virus genome. The level of GnT-III expression in HepG2 cells was similar to that of GnT-III-transfected cells but appeared to be lower than that in HBx-transfected cells. Moreover, in densitometry analysis (Fig. 4C) based on protein levels, GnT-III levels in HBx-transfected cells was increased up to 2-fold over that in GnT-III-transfected cells.Fig. 4Comparison of the levels of HBx and GnT-III mRNA and protein in normal cells, hepatocarcinoma cells, and our transfected cells.A, 1 μg of total RNA from each cell was subjected to RT-PCR for HBx (upper panel) and GnT-III (middle panel). β-Actin mRNA expression was also examined as a control (lower panel). B, proteins (25 μg) extracted from normal Chang, HepG2, Chang-GnT-III, and Chang-HBx cells were subjected to 10 and 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Expressions of HBx (upper panel) and GnT-III (middle panel) were analyzed by Western blot using a specific antibody to HBx and GnT-III. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) indicates that equal amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane (lower panel). C, protein bands were quantitated by densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Accumulation of ApoB with Increased Bisecting-GlcNAc in HBx-transfected Cells—To investigate the increase of accumulation of intracellular apoB in HBx-transfected liver cells, immunoprecipitation analysis was performed using cell lysates with anti-apoB antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 5A, compared with pcDNA transfected cells as control, HBx-transfected cells contained higher levels of intact apoB bands, 150- and 50-kDa apoB species. Next, to determine whether these apoB species are aberrantly glycosylated, lectin blot analysis were performed using E-PHA lectins, which are known to react preferentially with bisecting-GlcNAc (40Yamashita K. Hitoi A. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14753-14755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 5B, immunoprecipitated apoB species showed increased bisecting-GlcNAc, which is a consistent result with Western blot analysis in HBx-transfected cells. However, although an ∼80-kDa protein reacted with E-PHA, this band appeared to be nonspecific because it could not detect in Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the reactivity of immunoprecipitated apoB to E-PHA was blocked in the presence of an authentic inhibitor, GalNAc (41Serafini-Cessi F. Franceschi C. Sperti S. Biochem.

Therefore, these results indicated that HBx-transfected cells significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of apoB species, which contained increased bisecting GlcNAc. Enhanced Expression of GnT-III by HBx Decreases the Secretion of ApoB and Increases Accumulation of Cellular Triglyceride and Cholesterol Contents—Based on the finding that the expression level of GnT-III in HBx-transfected cell was higher than that in GnT-III-transfected cell as shown in Fig. 4, we hypothesized that the aberrant glycosylation of apoB by HBx-induced GnT-III expression may be involved in apoB secretion; the apoB protein level was measured by Western blot from culture media in the control vector, GnT-III, and HBx-transfected cells because apoB plays an important role for delivery of triglyceride from liver to peripheral tissue. Cells were treated with t-RA for 2 days in serum-free media because secretion of apoB induced by t-RA was increased in dose and time-dependent manner (data not shown). The same result was observed in treatment with oleic acid, and there was no apoptotic fragmentation in the cell (data not shown). The secretion of apoB was significantly decreased by 40 and 95% in GnT-III- and HBx-transfected cells, respectively, compared with in vector control (Fig. 6A), indicating that GnT-III expression level is an important factor for the inhibition of apoB secretion. This finding suggested that aberrant glycosylation of apoB mediated by enhanced expression of HBx-induced GnT-III inhibits the secretion of apoB and increases accumulation of intracellular apoB. As a result of the Western blot experiment of inhibition of apoB secretion in HBx- and GnT-III-transfected cells, as shown in Fig. 6B, we postulated that cellular triglyceride and cholesterol mass may be increased in the HBx- and GnT-III-transfected cells. To test this, we measured the accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol in the cytosolic fraction in Chang cells transfected with HBx and GnT-III. As expected, in Fig. 6C cellular triglyceride levels in GnT-III- and HBx-transfected cell were higher than vector-transfected cells up to 25% (p < 0.05) and 85% (p < 0.01), respectively. Cellular cholesterol levels in GnT-III- and HBx-transfected cells were slightly increased by 21% (p < 0.05) and 35% (p < 0.01), respectively. These results clearly indicated that increased accumulation of intracellular apoBs caused an accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol by enhanced expression of HBx-induced GnT-III. Expression Levels of MTP mRNA—Because MTP has been shown to play a critical role for apoB assembly and secretion, to determine whether MTP expression may be affected in the GnT-III- and HBx-transfected liver cells, MTP mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 7, A and B). The expression of MTP was significantly decreased in GnT-III- and HBx-transfected cells compared with pcDNA-transfected cells after treatment of t-RA for 48 h in serum-free media. When the cells were treated with t-RA, however, there was no difference in apoB gene expression by RT-PCR (data not shown). This result suggested that the relationship between HBx and GnT-III may regulate MTP expression for apoB assembly and secretion. Here, we provide evidence of the relationship between HBx and GnT-III responsible for inhibition of apoB secretion in vitro model. Many investigators have used HepG2 cell for studying apoB secretion. However, the HepG2 cell line is already a HCC, and increase of the expression of GnT-III gene was reported in human hepatocarcinoma tissues, fetal liver tissues, and hepatoma cell lines (42Song E.Y. Lee Y.C. Park Y.G. Chung T.W. Kim C.H. Cancer Investig. 2001; 19: 797-805Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study we have chosen a liver Chang cell line that is originally derived from normal liver tissue but is subsequently established via HeLa cell contamination. Miyoshi et al. (43Miyoshi E. Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Gu J. Sugiyama T. Hayashi N. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Taniguchi N. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3899-3902PubMed Google Scholar) observe that during hepatocarcinogenesis, GnT-III messenger RNA levels were increased in LEC rats, and Ishibashi et al. (21Ishibashi K.

Acta. 1989; 185: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) also reported that GnT-III activity in human serum, and liver and hepatoma tissues were increased in liver cirrhosis and hepatoma patients. We observed that HBx increases GnT-III expression by transcription as well as translation levels. In the previous study we found that the promoter region of GnT-III has seven AP-2 sites by sequence homology search (37Kim Y.J. Kim K.S. Ko J.H. Lee Y.C. Chung T.W. Choe I.S. Kim C.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Elevation of GnT-III gene expression by HBx may be modulated by AP-2 activation since HBx has been shown to activate promoters through several transcription factors such as AP-1, AP-2, NF-κB, CREB, and ATF-2 (45Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 46Hyman S.E. Comb M. Pearlberg J. Goodman H.M. Mol. Cell.

Imperial College Press, London1998: 161-181Crossref Google Scholar), although HBx does not bind directly to DNA (49Haviv I. Shamay M. Doitsh G. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We also showed that GnT-III expression levels in HBx-transfected cells is higher than that in hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells as well as GnT-III-transfected cells, indicating that HBx induces GnT-III expression with strong GnT-III promotor activity. Therefore, this finding supports several studies which show that GnT-III expression may be involved in the development of HCC (23Mori S. Aoyagi Y. Yanagi M. Suzuki Y. Asakura H. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1998; 13: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Narasimhan S. Schachter H. Rajalakshmi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1273-1281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this study did not determine the precise promotor region involved in the activation for GnT-III expression by HBx because of the limitation of the comprehensive properties of the GnT-III promoter region (38Koyama N. Miyoshi E. Ihara Y. Kang R. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Kang B.S. Kim Y.J. Shim J.K. Song E.Y. Park Y.G. Lee Y.C. Nam K.S. Kim J.K. Lee T.K. Chung T.W. Kim C.H. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 31: 578-584Google Scholar), but this is the first report that HBx transactivates GnT-III expression. The hepatic production of apoB-containing lipoproteins is regulated largely at posttranscriptional levels, with nascent apoB molecules secreted or degraded intracellularly (11Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our findings that intracellular accumulation of aberrantly glycosylated apoB species, which exhibit strong reactivities to E-PHA, is increased and low molecular weight immunoreactive apoB species (especially 150 and 50 kDa) are detected in HBx-transfected cells, the present study supports our previous results (31Lee J.W. Song E.Y. Chung T.W. Kang S.K. Kim K.S. Chung T.H. Yeom Y.I. Kim C.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and those of Ihara et al. (32Ihara Y. Yoshimura M. Miyoshi E. Nishikawa A. Sultan A.S. Toyosawa S. Ohnishi A. Suzuki M. Yamamura K. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They also showed that the 130- and 50-kDa apoB species were immunoprecipitated and detected with lectin blot analysis. In addition, apoB mRNA levels in liver Chang cells are not affected by HBx transfection by RT-PCR (data not shown), consistent with the concept that, under most conditions of altered apoB secretion from HepG2 cells, apoB mRNA levels remain unchanged (13Pullinger C.R.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1078-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some investigators suggest that hepatic triglyceride accumulation has a greater influence on apoB secretion (53Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and cholesteryl ester is the major lipid species stimulating very low density lipoprotein secretion (54Avramoglu R.K. Cianflone K. Sniderman A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2513-2528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our study, even though there is intracellular accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol in GnT-III- as well as HBx-transfected liver Chang cells, inhibition of apoB secretion occurs in these cells. Therefore, intracellular accumulation of apoB caused by the ability of HBx to induce GnT-III expression is the major determinant for the inhibition of apoB secretion and intracellular lipid accumulation. With regard to the association of apoB with tumorigenesis, lipid accumulation in the liver resulted in the development of dysplasia and carcinoma of the liver in mice expressing aberrantly truncated apoB (55Yamanaka S. Balestra M.E. Ferrell L.D. Fan J. Arnold K.S. Taylor S. Taylor J.M. Innerarity T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8483-8487Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Our study also revealed that an increase of the accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol in liver cells is detected in GnT-III- as well as HBx-transfected cells, which is consistent with previous studies by Lee et al. (31Lee J.W. Song E.Y. Chung T.W. Kang S.K. Kim K.S. Chung T.H. Yeom Y.I. Kim C.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and Ihara et al. (32Ihara Y.

A. 1998; 95: 2526-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which show that lipid accumulation in the liver in GnT-III transgenic mice leads to the generation of liver abnormality. Thus, intracellular accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol in liver cells caused by HBx-induced GnT-III expression may give us a new insight for HBx-mediated HCC development. In addition, MTP, an intraluminal protein in the endoplasmic reticulum plays an essential role in regulating the assembly and secretion of apoB containing lipoproteins (44Gordon D.A. Jamil H.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 22-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that HBx- and GnT-III-transfected cells showed down-expression of MTP mRNA but not in vector-transfected cell. Because cells were treated with t-RA in our experiment, MTP expression levels by RT-PCR and secretion of apoB by Western blot were increased in dose- and time-dependent manners (data not shown). However, these data questioned whether down-regulation of MTP transcriptional levels by overexpression of GnT-III and HBx may result from the accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol in liver cells primarily or secondarily. The contribution of down-regulation of MTP expression by GnT-III and HBx remains to be clarified. The availability of transgenic mice aberrantly expressing the human GnT-III in the liver may help not only to elucidate the role of protein/lipid glycosylation in the development and pathological change of the liver but also to develop therapeutic agents for human diseases caused by glycosylation abnormality. We are currently investigating whether hepatocytes from these transgenic mice show an altered sensitivity to viral infection or abnormal receptor-ligand interactions as the result of aberrant glycosylation of cell surface protein and lipids. In conclusion, HBx induced GnT-III expression may disrupt lipid metabolism by abnormal glycosylation of apoB and may target MTP for assembly and secretion of apoB in the liver cells."

Structural analysis of PapA5 at 2.75-Å resolution reveals a two-domain structure that shares unexpected similarity to structures of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, carnitine acetyltransferase, and VibH, a non-ribosomal peptide synthesis condensation enzyme. The PapA5 active site includes conserved histidine and aspartic acid residues that are critical to PapA5 acyltransferase activity. PapA5 catalyzes acyl transfer reactions on model substrates that contain long aliphatic carbon chains, and two hydrophobic channels were observed linking the PapA5 surface to the active site with properties consistent with these biochemical activities and substrate preferences. An additional α helix not observed in other acyltransferase structures blocks the putative entrance into the PapA5 active site, indicating that conformational changes may be associated with PapA5 activity.

Phthiocerol dimycocerosate esters and their congeners, otherwise known as PDIMs, comprise a polyketide family that has been shown to be directly involved in mycobacterial virulence (3Cox J.S. Chen B.

The genes associated with diesterification of phthiocerol and phthiodiolone to mycocerosic acid have remained unclear, but recent progress has been made through the genetic and functional characterization of M. tuberculosis PapA5, a Pap family member located within the PDIM synthesis gene cluster (16Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Deletion and complementation of the gene encoding PapA5 indicated that PapA5 was essential for PDIM production in M. tuberculosis, and although the involvement of PapA5 in the diesterification of phthiocerol and phthiodiolone could not be tested directly due to the unavailability of these compounds, PapA5 was assayed for CoA-dependent acyltransferase activities in an effort to define PapA5 substrate specificities for a variety of model lipid compounds. Taken together, these results suggested that papA5 encoded a protein capable of catalyzing acyl transfer chemistry. Although protein sequences of Pap family members include several amino acid motifs associated with other proteins that catalyze acyltransferase activities, the Pap family shares little sequence identity with acyltransferases outside of these regions. To elucidate structure-activity relationships for the Pap family of proteins, we determined the 2.75-Å crystal structure of PapA5 from M. tuberculosis. The structure reveals that PapA5 is related to the family of CoA-dependent acyltransferases. Further structural analysis combined with previously reported acyltransferase activities on defined lipid substrates suggests a model for PapA5 function. Purification of M. tuberculosis PapA5—PapA5-(1–422) was cloned, expressed, and purified from Escherichia coli as a N-terminal His6-Smt3 fusion protein (22Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The pET-based plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Stratagene). A 5-liter culture was grown by fermentation at 37 °C to an A600 of 2, adjusted to 30 °C and 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20% sucrose, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg/ml lysozyme and sonicated. After insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, His6-Smt3-PapA5 was purified by metal affinity and gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200). The His-Smt3 tag was removed by the Smt3-specific protease Ulp1, and PapA5 was further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75). PapA5 was obtained at 10 mg/L of E. coli culture and appeared homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and Coommassie Blue staining. PapA5 was concentrated to 10 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Crystallographic Analysis—PapA5 crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion against a well solution containing 5–10% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 5% glycerol, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5), and 20 mm dithiothreitol. Crystals were cryo-protected by addition of 15% glycerol. Crystals of native protein diffracted X-rays to 2.5 Å, although data were only processed to 2.75 Å due to problems associated with crystal mosaicity (P3121 a = b = 172.98 Å, c = 80.54 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°). Native data were collected at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X4A (Brookhaven, NY), and mercury data were collected from a crystal using a laboratory copper Kα source (Rigaku RU200) equipped with a confocal Osmic multilayer system and a Raxis-IV imaging plate detector.

Subsequent electron density maps were traced by hand with the program O to produce atomic models for each PapA5 protomer (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Crystals of PapA5 belonged to space group P3121 and contained two independent monomers per asymmetric unit. Phases were calculated to 2.75 Å using 2-fold NCS averaging with data obtained from a native protein crystal and a native crystal into which thimerosal was soaked (see “Experimental Procedures”; Table I). Both PapA5 monomers contain segments of polypeptide that did not have sufficient electron density to permit model building. These regions include residues 82–93, 176–180, 192–204, and 419–422 for monomer A and 1–2, 82–93, 176–180, and 419–422 for monomer B. The overall average Bfactor for the final coordinate set was ∼68 Å2. The termini that demarcate the disordered segments (marked by asterisks in Fig. 1) had Bfactor values of nearly twice that value, suggesting that segments not observed in the electron density maps were due to thermal motion in the crystal lattice. Despite the high overall Bfactor and disordered segments, the final model was successfully refined without NCS restraints to an Rfactor of 23.6 and Rfree of 29.5 with excellent geometry and no outliers in the Ramachandran plot. Monomer B will be referred to in subsequent discussions as few differences were observed between monomers, and monomer B contained a larger number of ordered amino acids. The PapA5 structure can most easily be described by dividing the protein into two domains (Fig. 1). Domain 1 is composed of secondary structural elements that include β-strands 1–8 and 13 and α-helices A through D. Domain 2 includes β-strains 9–12 and 14–15 and α-helices E through I. Domains 1 and 2 are self-contained with a few noted exceptions. Domain 1 includes β13, a strand that emanates from domain 2 to complete the four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet in domain 1 (β6, β7, β2, and β13). In addition, a loop from domain 2 between β-strands 10 and 11 extends into domain 1 and contacts portions of helix C and D. A large crossover loop is also observed between helix D and β-strand 8 that spans nearly 50 Å between the two domains. Monomer B amino acids 192–204 within the crossover loop have Bfactor values nearly twice that of the average model Bfactor, while the same region in monomer A is disordered and not present in the electron density maps. Despite these interdomain contacts, the connectivity between domains would not restrict movements of domain 1 and 2 with respect to one another. Domains 1 and 2 are structurally related and can be aligned to within 4.1 Å r.m.s.d. over 104 amino acids with 7% sequence identity. While similar, domain 1 contains the only known catalytic amino acid residues (His124 and Asp128) that have been directly implicated in PapA5 activity (16Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). His124 and Asp128 are located between strand 7 and helix C in the interface between domains 1 and 2 (Figs. 1 and 2). PapA5 Is Related to CoA-dependent Acyltransferases—A structural alignment between PapA5 and the Protein Data Bank using DALI shows that PapA5 contains structural and sequence motifs that are characteristic of the CoA-dependent acyltransferase family (Fig. 2) (28Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar). In rank order, proteins that could be aligned to PapA5 include the condensation domain from VibH (Protein Data Bank code 1l5a; 336 amino acids aligned to 4.0 Å r.m.s.d. with 11% sequence identity; Z-score 23.1), carnitine acetyltransferase (Protein Data Bank code 1ndf; 285 amino acids aligned to 3.8 Å r.m.s.d. with 10% sequence identity; Z-score 12.1), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (Protein Data Bank code 3cla; 127 amino acids aligned to 3.9 Å r.m.s.d. with 12% sequence identity; Z-score 6.9), and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (Protein Data Bank code 1eaf; 108 amino acids aligned to 2.9 Å r.m.s.d. with 17% sequence identity; Z-score 5.6). As stated above, domains 1 and 2 from Papa5 are related to each other, so each can be aligned to a single protomer from chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. In addition, PapA5 domains 1 and 2 are oriented in a similar manner to that observed for two of the three chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protomers as observed in the intact chloramphenicol acetyltransferase trimer (29Leslie A.G.W. Moody P.C. Shaw W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although structural alignments show PapA5 domain 2 to be more similar based on the number of amino acids that could be aligned, the alignments to domain 1 reveal higher sequence identity between structures, including the known HHX3DG catalytic amino acid motif that is conserved and observed in many CoA-dependent acyltransferase family members (Fig. 2). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase catalyzes CoA-dependent acetyl transfer in a reaction that is dependent on the second conserved histidine (His195) in the active site HHX3DG sequence motif (29Leslie A.G.W. Moody P.C. Shaw W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). His195 has been proposed to be a general base that promotes deprotonation of the chloramphenicol hydroxyl prior to the transfer of the acetyl group, and mutation of this residue results in a severely defective enzyme. While the aspartic acid has also been shown to be critical for activity, it appears to play a structural role in the organization of the active site. His124 and Asp128 are the corresponding histidine and aspartic acid in the PapA5 sequence and structure (Figs. 2 and 3), and as observed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, His124 is essential for PapA5 CoA-dependent acyltransferase activity (see below; Ref. 16Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although conserved, the second histidine in the HHX3DG motif does not perform similar catalytic roles in all CAT family members insomuch as mutation of this residue in the yeast dihydrolipoyl transacetylase results in no observable catalytic defect (30Niu X.D. Stoops J.K. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8614-8619Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PapA5 exhibits more structural similarity to VibH and carnitine acetyltransferase, since PapA5, VibH, and carnitine acetyltransferase each contain two tandem CAT-like domains with one active site located within the N-terminal CAT-like domain (31Keating T.A. Marshall C.G. Walsh C.T. Keating A.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 522-526PubMed Google Scholar, 32Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Carnitine acetyltransferase catalyzes the acyl transfer between carnitine and acetyl-CoA utilizing a similar mechanism to that proposed for CAT. In addition, the structural analysis of carnitine acetyltransferase and respective ligand complexes combined with previous biochemical data support a general base mechanism for His343 in deprotonation of the carnitine hydroxyl group prior to acyl transfer (32Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). VibH belongs to a large family of condensation domains that are associated with non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, large multidomain enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of a number of compounds such as antibiotics and virulence factors (33Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 34Quadri L.E. Keating T.A. Patel H.M. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14941-14954Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Quadri L.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). VibH catalyzes amide bond formation in the synthesis of vibriobactin (36Keating T.A. Marshall C.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15513-15521Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 37Keating T.A. Marshall C.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15522-15530Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). VibH also contains a conserved HHX3DG catalytic amino acid motif, although structural and mutational analysis revealed that VibH utilizes a mechanism distinct from CAT and carnitine acetyltransferase in that mutation of the second histidine did not result in severe catalytic defects but mutation of the Asp residue did. These data suggest that the tandem CAT-like domain architecture can be utilized in alternative ways to achieve a variety of chemical reactions. CoA-dependent acyltransferase family members have been categorized on the structural level in the SCOP data base by virtue of their oligomeric state (38Hubbard T.J. Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Some CAT family members such as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase are oligomeric and form their respective active sites in the intersubunit interfaces between protomers. Carnitine acetyltransferase and VibH are monomeric, but contain two tandem CAT-like domains. In both instances, VibH and carnitine acetyltransferase share similarity with the CAT intersubunit active site organization insomuch as each has its active site positioned within the interface between the two tandem CAT-like domains. PapA5 also contains two CAT-like domains and is organized in a similar manner to that observed for VibH and carnitine acetyltransferase (Fig. 1). Analysis of the aligned structures for PapA5 and carnitine acetyltransferase revealed similar locations for the active site histidine and aspartic acid residues located within domain 1 between domains 1 and 2 (Fig. 4). The carnitine acetyltransferase structure utilized for this alignment also included the substrate carnitine (32Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and comparison of the PapA5 and carnitine acetyltransferase active site clefts revealed a deep substrate cleft for carnitine acetyltransferase (Fig. 4D), whereas the analogous PapA5 cleft is occluded by helix H (Fig. 4C). Helix H is unique to the Pap family (Fig. 2), and its potential role in substrate coordination is discussed further below. PapA5 Active Site and Substrate Selectivity—PapA5 has been proposed to catalyze the diesterification of phthiocerol and phthiodiolone with mycocerosate, possibly through a mechanism that is dependent on the activation of mycocerosic acids as thioesters (16Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The possible mechanisms by which PapA5 might participate in this reaction were previously explored by measuring PapA5 acyltransferase activity using palmitoyl-CoA and several model substrates that included short-, medium-, and long-chain alcohols, diols, hydroxy esters, acids, amines, and thiols (16Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A subset of those substrates tested is depicted in Fig. 5. PapA5 exhibited a preference for saturated medium chain alcohols in reactions that were dependent on the presence of amino acid residues His124 and Asp128, suggesting that PapA5 utilizes a similar acyl transfer mechanism to that observed for several CAT family members including carnitine acetyltransferase. While CAT and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase utilize intersubunit interfaces to interact with respective ligands, large solvent-exposed channels were observed between the two tandem CAT-like domains in both VibH and carnitine acetyltransferase (Fig. 4, C and D) (31Keating T.A. Marshall C.G. Walsh C.T. Keating A.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 522-526PubMed Google Scholar, 32Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To gain insight into how PapA5 might organize its active site with respect to these other CAT family members, the PapA5 active site was superimposed to crystal structures of CAT, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, and carnitine acetyltransferase to enable modeling of chloramphenicol (29Leslie A.G.W. Moody P.C. Shaw W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), carnitine (32Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and CoA (32Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 39Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) into the PapA5 active site (Fig. 3B). Only CoA and chloramphenicol are depicted in Fig. 3B, since the ligand positions observed in carnitine acetyltransferase superimpose well to a first approximation with those ligands observed in CAT and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (32Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A similar modeling exercise was undertaken using VibH and respective ligands from CAT and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (31Keating T.A. Marshall C.G. Walsh C.T. Keating A.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 522-526PubMed Google Scholar). These alignments revealed both ligand binding sites to be accessible to solvent within the VibH structure, suggesting that VibH utilizes similar surfaces and substrate clefts to interact with its substrates. Experimental structures of carnitine acetyltransferase in complex with carnitine and CoA also showed a similar arrangement of ligands, suggesting that it too utilizes the same solvent-exposed channels to bind and coordinate respective ligands (32Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Inspection of the modeled ligands in the PapA5 active site shows the CoA ligand coordinated between β-strands 10 and 12 in an orientation similar to that observed in all CAT-CoA complexes, suggesting that PapA5 would interact with CoA ligands in a similar manner (Figs. 1 and 3B). The modeled positions of carnitine and chloramphenicol within the PapA5 active site show the respective hydroxyl moieties directly over catalytic His124 in PapA5, suggesting that the basic mechanisms employed in CAT activity are likely conserved in the PapA5 structure (Fig. 3B, carnitine shown in Fig. 4). Despite proper placement of the hydroxyl group, both carnitine and chloramphenicol encounter significant steric clashes with amino acid residues emanating from helix H, namely Phe327 and Phe331 (Fig. 3B). Helix H is unique to PapA5 and is not observed in either VibH, carnitine acetyltransferase, or other CAT family members (Fig. 2). Helix H effectively blocks access to one of the solvent exposed channels into the active sites observed in either VibH or carnitine acetyltransferase (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). Further inspection of the PapA5 molecular surface reveals two channels that lead into the PapA5 active site (Fig. 6). Channel 1 is ∼20 Å deep and is fully exposed via a solvent channel to the exterior of PapA5 (Figs. 3 and 6), whereas channel 2 is constricted by helix H and is ∼15 Å deep, indicating that if PapA5 were to utilize channel 2 in a manner reminiscent to that observed in carnitine acetyltransferase, it must undergo conformational changes to move helix H away from the channel to enable substrate interaction (Fig. 4). Interestingly, PapA5 exhibited substrate preference for octanol in acyltransferase activity assays in addition to other observed activities on substrates with aliphatic chains of ∼10 Å in length (Fig. 5; Ref. 16Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). While the measured depth of either channel would accommodate the preferred substrate lengths, they differ with respect to hydrophobicity and sequence conservation (Fig. 6, C and D). Channel 1 includes few conserved residues between Pap family members but is very hydrophobic in nature, while channel 2 includes several conserved residues but is slightly more hydrophilic in character. The preferred substrate lengths exhibited by PapA5 in vitro suggest a possible mode of interaction with phthiocerol and phthiodiolone, the proposed in vivo substrates for PapA5 (Fig. 5). Phthiocerol and phthiodiolone include two hydroxyl moieties located at positions 9 and 11 along the aliphatic chain (Fig. 5C). The approximate length (9–11 carbon units) of the remaining aliphatic chain is architecturally similar in many respects to that observed for several of the preferred model substrates, namely octanol (Fig. 5, compare A and C). If analogous to carnitine acetyltransferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, channel 2 would provide the most likely binding site for octanol and the analogous portions of either phthiocerol and phthiodiolone. In addition, the long aliphatic chains associated with the remaining portions of either phthiocerol and phthiodiolone could be accommodated in channel 1 (17–21 carbon units; Figs. 5C and 6). Phthiocerol or phthiodiolone are not commercially available or easily purified from natural sources, so it is currently implausible to obtain the relevant complexes to enable a more detailed study of PapA5 in complex with its physiological ligands, a necessary step to provide the basis for development of structure-based inhibitors of this enzyme. Although natural ligand complexes are currently beyond the scope of this study, we do plan to obtain complexes between PapA5 and some of the model compounds previously reported (16Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and represented in Fig. 5. However, the structural and biochemical characterization of PapA5 combined with the structures of carnitine acetyltransferase and VibH suggest putative roles for the catalytic residues observed in PapA5. In addition, structural and functional similarity between these protein families has likely identified the surfaces and channels utilized by PapA5 in its interactions with respective substrates, the exact details of which await further investigation. It has been previously noted that the Pap family shares weak similarity to Rif20 (16Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a gene encoded within the rifamycin gene cluster (40Floss H.G. Yu T.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The PapA5 structure and the structure-based sequence alignment between PapA5 and Rif20 and the conserved catalytic elements observed in these proteins support our earlier speculation (16Onwueme K.C. Ferreras J.A. Buglino J. Lima C.D. Quadri L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4608-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that Rif20 encodes a protein with similar catalytic properties to that observed for PapA5 and is responsible for catalyzing the as yet unidentified acyltransferase activity required for C25 O-acetylation during rifamycin biosynthesis.

Moreover, although plants represent the natural hosts for Agrobacterium, this microorganism can also transform a wide range of other eukaryotic species, ranging from fungi (2Piers K.L. Heath J.D.

Plant Pathol. 2001; 2: 171-176Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but VirE2 alone is sufficient to transport ssDNA into the nucleus of the plant cell (16Zupan J. Citovsky V. Zambryski P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2392-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although VirE2 accumulates in the cell nucleus even in very diverse plant species (9Citovsky V. Warnick D. Zambryski P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3210-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it fails to enter the nucleus of yeast or animal cells (15Tzfira T. Citovsky V. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2001; 2: 171-176Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Guralnick B. Thomsen G. Citovsky V.

VirE2 nuclear import in non-plant systems is promoted by expression of an Arabidopsis protein, VIP1, that interacts with VirE2 (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because VIP1, a basic leucine zipper motif protein, shows no significant homology to known animal or yeast proteins, it was suggested to be a cellular factor responsible, at least in part, for plant-specific VirE2 nuclear import (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The role of VIP1 in the nuclear import of transfer complexes is also consistent with observations that VIP1, which by itself is unable to associate with ssDNA, is able to interact with VirE2, whereas the latter is bound to the ssDNA, forming ternary VIP1-VirE2-ssDNA complexes in vitro (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Exactly how VIP1 facilitates nuclear import of VirE2, however, remains unknown. Here, we used purified VirE2 in an in vitro nuclear import assay to study the dependence of its nuclear import on the presence of purified VIP1. In vitro nuclear import in plant-permeabilized cells occurs without the addition of cytosolic factor, making these cells unsuitable for testing the roles of individual import factors (20Hicks G.R. Smith H.M.S. Lobreaux S. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1337-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Broder Y.C. Stanhill A. Zakai N. Friedler A. Gilon C. Loyter A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used permeabilized HeLa cells for in vitro studies of nuclear import. To shed light on the molecular mechanism by which VIP1 assists nuclear uptake of VirE2, a quantitative in vitro binding assay was used to examine interactions between VirE2, VIP1, and karyopherin α. Our results demonstrate the critical role of VIP1 for nuclear accumulation of VirE2 and suggest that VIP1 functions as a molecular bridge between VirE2 and karyopherin α. Protein Expression—All proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using the T7 RNA polymerase system (22Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) and purified to near homogeneity (95-98% pure as determined by silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels). VirE2 (23Hirooka T. Rogowsky P.M. Kado C.I. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1529-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was produced from the pET3b vector (22Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously for purification of the gene I protein of cauliflower mosaic virus (24Citovsky V. Knorr D. Zambryski P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2476-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged VIP1 (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and human karyopherin α (hKAPα) (25Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) were produced from the pET28a(+) vector (Novagen) and purified on nickel beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and standard protocols (26Armon-Omer A. Graessmann A. Loyter A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1117-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Labeling of Peptides and Proteins—Linear peptides corresponding to the nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences of the SV40 large T antigen (PKKKRKV) (27Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar), human immunodeficiency virus protein R (VPR) (NEWTLELLEELKNEAVRHF) (28Karni O. Friedler A. Zakai N. Gilon C. Loyter A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and VIP1 (KRILANRQSAARSKERKIR) (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) were synthesized as described before (29Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These peptides and recombinant full-length VirE2 and hKAPα proteins were covalently attached to unlabeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma), lissamine rhodamine-labeled BSA (R-BSA), or biotinylated BSA (bBSA) (Sigma) tags using sulfo-SMCC as a cross-linker as described previously (29Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, VirE2 and BSA were chemically labeled with lissamine rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Inc.) as described (21Broder Y.C. Stanhill A. Zakai N. Friedler A. Gilon C. Loyter A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Labeled peptides and proteins were purified from uncoupled labels or sulfo-SMCC by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column as described (21Broder Y.C. Stanhill A. Zakai N. Friedler A. Gilon C. Loyter A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and then aliquoted and stored at -70 °C until use. Microinjection into Plant Tissues—Purified VirE2 labeled with lissamine rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate was used in microinjection studies (30Rojas M.R. Zerbini F.M. Allison R.F. Gilbertson R.L. Lucas W.J. Virology. 1997; 237: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that were performed on detached mature leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana. Movement of fluorescent probes out of target mesophyll cells was monitored and recorded by confocal laser scanning microscopy, using a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (model TCS-4D, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a Narishige four-dimensional hydraulic micromanipulator system (31Noueiry A.O. Lucas W.J. Gilbertson R.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 925-932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Nuclear Import in Permeabilized HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were grown for 2 days on 10-mm coverslips to a subconfluent density and permeabilized with digitonin as described (29Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The permeabilized cells, supplemented with rabbit reticulocyte cytosolic extracts, were incubated with fluorescently labeled import substrates as described (29Friedler A. Zakai N. Karni O. Broder Y.C. Baraz L. Kotler M. Loyter A. Gilon C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and nuclear import was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal laser scanning microscope system. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for Protein-Protein Interactions—Binding of bBSA-VIP1 NLS, bBSA-hKAPα, or bBSA-VirE2 conjugates to hKAPα or VIP1 was assayed and quantified essentially as described previously (26Armon-Omer A. Graessmann A. Loyter A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1117-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Fineberg K. Fineberg T. Graessmann A. Luedtke N.W. Tor Y. Lixin R. Jans D.A. Loyter A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2625-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, MaxiSorb plates (Nunc) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a solution containing either 5 μg of hKAPα or VIP1 in 200 μl of 0.05 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The protein solutions were removed, the plates were washed with PBS, and 200 μl of a blocking solution (5% w/v BSA in PBS) was added. Following incubation at 37 °C for 2 h and a wash with PBS, the appropriate bBSA conjugates in PBS were added, and blocking solution was added to a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the plates were washed with PBS, and 200 μl of avidin-peroxidase (Roche Diagnostics) dissolved in the blocking solution was added. Following an additional incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the plates were washed with PBS, and horseradish peroxidase substrate was added according to the manufacturer's instructions. The horseradish peroxidase enzymatic activity was quantified by monitoring the absorbance of its reaction product at 490 nm (A490). In competition experiments, competitors were added to the coated plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before addition of bBSA conjugates. Nuclear Import in Mammalian Cells—For transient expression in mammalian cells, PCR-amplified virE2 gene was cloned into the XhoIBamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(-)Myc-HisA (Invitrogen), resulting in pcDNA-E2-Myc. The VIP1-expressing pCB6-VIP1 construct was previously described (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). pcDNA-E2-Myc, pCB6-VIP1, or a mixture of both constructs (1:1 molar ratio) were transformed into COS1 cells as described (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and subcellular localization of each of the proteins was determined by indirect immunofluorescence 24 h after transformation using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal laser scanning confocal microscope. VirE2 was detected using mouse anti-Myc antibodies (Invitrogen) and visualized with Cy5-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies, and VIP1 was detected using anti-VIP1 antibodies raised in the rabbit and visualized with Alexa Fluor-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Nuclear Import of Purified VirE2 in Plant Tissues—To assess the biological functionality of the purified intact VirE2, we examined its nuclear import in plant tissues. To this end, two preparations of fluorescently tagged VirE2, rhodamine-labeled (R-VirE2) and fluorescein-labeled (F-VirE2), were produced and microinjected directly into the cytoplasm of the mesophyll cells of N. benthamiana leaves. R-VirE2 efficiently accumulated in the plant cell nucleus (Fig. 1A, arrow), resulting in strong nuclear staining and only very faint, residual cytoplasmic signal. A virtually identical nuclear localization pattern was observed with microinjected F-VirE2 (Fig. 1B, arrow), indicating that the chemical composition of the fluorescent tag had no effect on the subcellular targeting of VirE2. In control experiments, R-BSA (Fig. 1C) and fluorescent-labeled BSA (data not shown) remained cytoplasmic following microinjection into leaf mesophyll cells. These results demonstrate that the recombinant purified VirE2 is biologically active and is imported into the cell nucleus in living plant cells. Nuclear Import of VirE2 in Permeabilized HeLa Cells—Next, we tested conditions for active nuclear import of VirE2 in an in vitro system, which allows better control over its molecular components than in living cells. In this experimental system composed of permeabilized HeLa cells and exogenously added reticulocyte cytosol, R-VirE2 showed no significant nuclear import, with very little if any intranuclear fluorescent signal (Fig. 2A), consistent with the previously reported inability of non-plant systems to support nuclear transport of VirE2 (15Tzfira T. Citovsky V. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2001; 2: 171-176Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Guralnick B. Thomsen G. Citovsky V. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Rhee Y. Gurel F. Gafni Y. Dingwall C. Citovsky V. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Recently, an Arabidopsis protein, VIP1, has shown to be required for in vivo nuclear accumulation of VirE2 fused to various reporters, such as β-glucuronidase and green fluorescent protein, in plant and mammalian cells (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Here, we tested the ability of VIP1 to facilitate nuclear transport of unfused VirE2 in vitro. Fig. 2B shows that the addition of purified recombinant VIP1 to R-VirE2 promoted efficient uptake of the fluorescent signal into nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells, consistent with nuclear import. This VIP1-dependent nuclear accumulation of R-VirE2 did not occur in the absence of the cytosolic factors (data not shown) and was greatly inhibited in the presence of wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 2C), GTPγS (Fig. 2D) or at low temperature (4 °C) (data not shown). The wheat germ agglutinin lectin blocks nuclear import by interacting with the protein components of the nuclear pore. GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, blocks the activity of Ran, an essential regulator of nuclear import, and inhibition by low temperature is indicative of involvement of metabolic energy, which also is known to be required for nuclear import (33Forbes D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 34Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 35Melchior F. Gerace L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). That the VIP1-induced accumulation of R-VirE2 within the nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells was blocked by these specific inhibitors indicates that it occurred by a true process of active nuclear import. Next, we examined whether karyopherin α, the nuclear import receptor that directly recognizes the transported proteins (36Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 37Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 931-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), plays a role in the VIP1-induced nuclear uptake of VirE2. The amounts of karyopherin α in the in vitro import system can be effectively depleted by the addition of competing concentrations of SV40 NLS peptide, which is known to specifically bind karyopherin α (37Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 931-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), preventing it from promoting nuclear import of the labeled substrate (39Subramaniam P.S. Mujtaba M.G. Paddy M.R. Johnson H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 403-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Ballas N. Citovsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, addition of the SV40 NLS peptide conjugated to a BSA carrier virtually blocked accumulation of R-VirE2 in the nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells even in the presence of VIP1 (Fig. 2E), whereas the addition of free BSA as expected had no effect on nuclear import of R-VirE2 (Fig. 2F). These results demonstrate involvement of karyopherin α in the VirE2 nuclear import. The molecular mechanism by which this involvement may occur is explored in the subsequent sections of this article. Protein Interactions Involved in Nuclear Import of VIP1—To better understand the molecular pathway by which VIP1 assists nuclear import of VirE2, we examined interactions between VIP1, VirE2, and hKAPα. To this end, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which one of the interacting proteins, usually VIP1, was immobilized on a plastic surface, incubated with a ligand such as hKAPα or VirE2, and conjugated to bBSA in the presence of a large excess of free BSA to quench nonspecific interactions. The degree of binding was then quantified by detection with peroxidase-conjugated avidin (see “Materials and Methods” and Ref. 26Armon-Omer A. Graessmann A. Loyter A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1117-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The use of bBSA as a soluble tag was developed to enhance the solubility of VirE2 as well as to increase the sensitivity of the binding assay, thus allowing the use of relatively low, nanomolarlevel concentrations of ligand proteins to avoid nonspecific interactions. Fig. 3A shows that immobilized VIP1 efficiently interacted with bBSA-tagged hKAPα (bBSA-hKAPα). This dose-dependent binding occurred in a saturable fashion, characteristic of specific interactions. The specificity of VIP1-hKAPα binding was confirmed by competition experiments in which increasing concentrations of an unlabeled specific competitor, VIP1, efficiently inhibited binding (Fig. 3B). We then tested whether hKAPα recognizes the bipartite NLS sequence of VIP1, located between amino acid residues 118 and 136 (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 3C demonstrate dose-dependent and saturable interaction of hKAPα with a peptide corresponding to the VIP1 NLS and conjugated to bBSA (bBSA-VIP1 NLS). A significant, 60-70%, inhibition of this interaction was achieved in the presence of a specific competitor, BSA-conjugated SV40 NLS peptide, which is well known to interact with karyopherin α (37Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 931-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Importantly, a BSA conjugate of another type of NLS, VPR, which is not recognized by karyopherin α (41Bukrinsky M. Adzhubei A. Rev. Med. Virol. 1999; 9: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Krichevsky A. Graessmann A. Nissim A. Piller S.C. Zakai N. Loyter A. Virology. 2003; 305: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), did not compete with the VIP1 NLS (Fig. 3C), indicating specificity of the VIP1 NLS-hKAPα interaction. The biological activity of the VIP1 NLS was directly demonstrated using permeabilized HeLa cells. In this system, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the VIP1 NLS sequence efficiently promoted nuclear import of rhodamine-labeled BSA conjugated to this peptide (R-BSA-VIP1 NLS) (Fig. 4A). Nuclear accumulation of R-BSA-VIP1 NLS was almost completely inhibited by an unlabeled specific competitor, BSA-VIP1 NLS (Fig. 4B), GTPγS, and low temperature (4 °C) (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the VIP1 NLS is biologically functional, mediating active protein nuclear import via the karyopherin α-dependent pathway. Protein Interactions Involved in Nuclear Import of VirE2 and Formation of Ternary VirE2-VIP1-hKAPα Complexes—To better understand the role of VIP1 in nuclear import of VirE2, we examined interactions between VIP1, hKAPα, and VirE2 and tested whether VIP1 can simultaneously bind both hKAPα, and VirE2. Fig. 5A shows that VIP1 bound bBSA-labeled VirE2 in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion and that the VIP1-VirE2 binding was inhibited by a specific competitor, BSA-VirE2, but not by a nonspecific competitor, BSA-VPR NLS, indicating a specific interaction. Unlike VIP1, VirE2 did not exhibit statistically significant interaction with hKAPα (Fig. 5B), and this result was consistent with previous observations that VirE2 did not interact with a plant karyopherin α, At-KAPα, in a yeast two-hybrid system (43Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10435-10440Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The addition of unlabeled VIP1, however, promoted dose-dependent and saturable association of VirE2 with hKAPα (Fig. 5B). This association could occur only if VIP1 bound both VirE2 and hKAPα together, in a single complex. This idea was further supported by the observation that BSA-SV40 NLS, which prevented VIP1-dependent nuclear import of VirE2 in permeabilized cells (Fig. 2E) and inhibited VIP1 NLS binding to hKAPα (Fig. 3C), also abolished the VIP1-dependent association of VirE2 and hKAPα (Fig. 5B). Nuclear Import of VirE2 in Living COS1 Cells—The role of VIP1 in the VirE2 nuclear import demonstrated in vitro (Fig. 2) was confirmed in vivo in living mammalian cells. Previously, this VIP1 function has been shown only with green fluorescent protein-VirE2 fusions (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), whereas here we used VirE2 tagged with a Myc epitope as the import substrate. VirE2 and VIP1 were expressed in COS1 cells and detected using mouse anti-Myc antibodies with Cy5-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies and rabbit anti-VIP1 antibodies with Alexa Fluor-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Fig. 6 shows that VirE2 expressed alone remained completely cytoplasmic (Fig. 6A, dispersed blue fluorescent signal surrounding fluorescence-free black nuclei), whereas VIP1 efficiently localized to the cell nucleus (Fig. 6C, red fluorescent signal almost exclusively concentrated within cell nuclei). Coexpression of VirE2 with VIP1 resulted in a substantial accumulation of VirE2 in the cell nucleus; simultaneous detection of VirE2 (Fig. 6E) and VIP1 (Fig. 6F) localized a significant proportion of these proteins within the cell nucleus. Fig. 6 also demonstrates that, in these coexpressing cells, merged images of VirE2 (Fig. 6E, blue signal) and VIP1 (Fig. 6F, red signal) indicated colocalization of these proteins within the cell nucleus (Fig. 6G, pink signal). It is important to note that in Fig. 6 the confocal optical sections with the plane of focus through the cell nucleus detect intranuclear accumulation of the fluorescent label rather than its perinuclear binding. Thus, VIP1 facilitates nuclear import of intact VirE2 in an animal system in vivo. Permeabilized animal cells have been instrumental in dissection of nuclear import pathways, allowing for identification of essential soluble components of the import machinery (44Görlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 45Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). This approach, however, is not feasible in plants because nuclear import in permeabilized plant protoplasts is independent of the addition of soluble cellular factors (20Hicks G.R. Smith H.M.S. Lobreaux S. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1337-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Broder Y.C. Stanhill A. Zakai N. Friedler A. Gilon C. Loyter A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Instead, permeabilized animal cells also have been used to study plant nuclear import, and such studies have demonstrated that plant cytosolic factors support nuclear uptake in permeabilized HeLa cells (21Broder Y.C. Stanhill A. Zakai N. Friedler A. Gilon C. Loyter A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and that Agrobacterium karyophilic proteins are imported into animal cell nuclei (46Ziemienowicz A. Görlich D. Lanka E. Hohn B. Rossi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3729-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here, we used this in vitro nuclear import system to study the molecular requirements for nuclear import of VirE2 of Agrobacterium, a protein known to play a central role in the Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of plants (5Tzfira T. Rhee Y. Chen M.-H. Citovsky V. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 187-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 47Tzfira T. Citovsky V. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We also used a quantitative, enzyme-linked immunosorbent-based in vitro binding assay to elucidate protein-protein interactions involved in the VirE2 nuclear import. Our results indicate that animal cytosolic factors were insufficient for in vitro nuclear import of VirE2. On the other hand, our microinjection studies in plant tissues demonstrated that VirE2 is a karyophilic protein in plant cells. An explanation for this difference is that VirE2 is not directly recognized by the animal cell nuclear import machinery. Thus, plant cells may contain a protein factor that mediates the targeting of VirE2 into the cell nucleus, whereas this factor is absent in animal cells. Indeed, recent studies indicated that the Arabidopsis protein, VIP1, that binds VirE2 is important for VirE2 nuclear import and Agrobacterium tumorigenicity in vivo (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 43Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10435-10440Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The data presented here establish that VIP1 is responsible for the nuclear uptake of VirE2 because its addition to the in vitro import reaction mediated efficient accumulation of VirE2 in the nuclei of permeabilized HeLa cells. Nuclear accumulation of VirE2 in living mammalian cells also depended on the presence of VIP1, demonstrating similar requirements for VIP1 during nuclear import of VirE2 in animal cells both in vitro and in vivo. Presently, we cannot explain why, in previous studies by others, VirE2 was reported to enter animal cell nuclei in vitro in the absence of exogenously added VIP1 (46Ziemienowicz A. Görlich D. Lanka E. Hohn B. Rossi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3729-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 48Ziemienowicz A. Merkle T. Schoumacher F. Hohn B. Rossi L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Specific protein-protein interactions underlying the VIP1 role in the VirE2 nuclear import were examined and dissected using a quantitative in vitro binding assay (26Armon-Omer A. Graessmann A. Loyter A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1117-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). VIP1 specifically interacted with human karyopherin α, and this binding was most likely mediated by the VIP1 NLS signal, which was itself capable of specific binding to karyopherin α. These interactions indicate that VIP1 is imported into the cell nucleus by a karyopherin α-mediated pathway via its NLS; indeed, the VIP1 NLS sequence also promoted in vitro nuclear import of an unrelated cargo molecule. Unlike VIP1, VirE2 was not recognized by human karyopherin α, explaining the inability of VirE2 to enter the nuclei of animal cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, VirE2 exhibited a specific interaction with VIP1, consistent with the notion that VIP1 may serve as a physical link between VirE2 and karyopherin α. Although this idea has been proposed previously (19Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3596-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 43Tzfira T. Vaidya M. Citovsky V. Proc.

A. 2001; 98: 385-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it has never been proven directly. Our in vitro binding experiments provided this evidence by demonstrating specific and saturable association of VirE2 with karyopherin α in the presence of VIP1, indicating formation of ternary VirE2-VIP1-hKAPα complexes in which VIP1 serves as a bridge between VirE2 and hKAPα. In these complexes, VIP1 likely functions as a molecular adapter between VirE2 and karyopherin α, allowing VirE2 to utilize the host cell nuclear import machinery even without being directly recognized by its components. That VIP1 does act as such an adaptor rather than the import factor itself was supported by our observations that nuclear accumulation of VirE2 in the presence of VIP1 was inhibited by the SV40 NLS peptide known to specifically block the karyopherin α-dependent nuclear import pathway (39Subramaniam P.S. Mujtaba M.G. Paddy M.R. Johnson H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 403-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Ballas N. Citovsky V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because VIP1 appears to be found only in plants but not in yeast or animal cells, VirE2 nuclear import also occurs only in plant cells. Potentially, this reliance on the cellular VIP1 protein for efficient infection may represent a result of a long evolutionary relationship between Agrobacterium and its plant hosts."

We have now cloned mouse SIRPβ cDNA and have shown that the gene is expressed in various tissues in addition to cells of the macrophage lineage. Engagement of SIRPβ by specific monoclonal antibodies promoted Fcγ receptor-dependent or -independent phagocytosis in mouse peritoneal macrophages. It also induced marked activation of MAPK and the upstream kinase MEK but weak activation of Akt. MEK inhibitors markedly blocked the promotion of phagocytosis by SIRPβ, whereas an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase partly blocked such response. In addition, inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase or of myosin ATPase blocked the promotion of phagocytosis by SIRPβ. Furthermore, SIRPβ induced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia in macrophages as well as the translocation of activated MAPK to these structures. It also elicited tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12, Syk, and SLP-76, and a Syk inhibitor blocked the promotion of phagocytosis and activation of MAPK by SIRPβ. Our results suggest that engagement of SIRPβ promotes phagocytosis in macrophages by inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12, Syk, and SLP-76 and the subsequent activation of a MEK-MAPK-myosin light chain kinase cascade.

The cross-linking of FcγRs by the Fc region of IgG induces tyrosine phosphorylation by an Src family kinase of the receptors themselves and of associated proteins that contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (5Cox D.

The phosphorylated ITAM then serves as a docking site for the tyrosine kinase Syk. Downstream signaling mediated by phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase or Rho family small GTP-binding proteins eventually triggers phagocytosis of IgG-coated (opsonized) particles (5Cox D. Greenberg S.

Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). It was initially discovered on the basis of its homology to another transmembrane protein, named SHP substrate-1 (SHPS-1) or SIRPα (11Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Human SIRPβ is expressed in monocytes and granulocytes but not in lymphocytes (12Seiffert M. Brossart P. Cant C. Cella M. Colonna M. Brugger W. Kanz L. Ullrich A. Bühring H.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). SIRPβ forms a complex with DAP12 in human monocytes or transfected nonhematopoietic cells (13Dietrich J. Cella M. Seiffert M. Bühring H.J. Colonna M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Tomasello E. Cant C. Bühring H.J. Vely F. Andre P. Seiffert M. Ullrich A. Vivier E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DAP12 is a transmembrane protein that was originally identified on the basis of its association with the inhibitory receptors of natural killer cells (15Lanier L.L. Corliss B. Wu J. Phillips J.H.

Med. 2000; 192: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Its intracellular region contains a single ITAM motif, which binds Syk or the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. The association between SIRPβ and DAP12 is thought to be mediated by an ionic interaction between single amino acids of opposite charge (lysine of SIRPβ and aspartic acid of DAP12) within the transmembrane regions (13Dietrich J. Cella M. Seiffert M. Bühring H.J. Colonna M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Tomasello E. Cant C. Bühring H.J. Vely F. Andre P. Seiffert M. Ullrich A.

Ligation of SIRPβ resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of DAP12 and the subsequent recruitment of Syk to the SIRPβ-DAP12 complex in RBL-2H3 cell transfectants (14Tomasello E. Cant C. Bühring H.J. Vely F. Andre P. Seiffert M. Ullrich A. Vivier E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2147-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

SIRPβ is therefore implicated as a positive regulator of hematopoietic cells.In contrast to SIRPβ, the function of the related SHPS-1 (also known as SIRPα, P84, and BIT) is relatively well characterized (11Kharitonenkov A.

SHPS-1 was initially discovered as a tyrosine-phosphorylated transmembrane protein that binds the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 and serves as their substrate (18Fujioka Y.

The putative extracellular region of SHPS-1 contains three Ig-like domains, similar to SIRPβ, whereas the cytoplasmic region of this protein contains four YXX(L/V/I) motifs, which are putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites and binding sites for the SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 (11Kharitonenkov A.

Indeed, the binding of CD47 on RBCs to SHPS-1 on macrophages inhibits phagocytosis of RBCs by macrophages (27Oldenborg P.A. Zheleznyak A. Fang Y.F. Lagenaur C.F. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P.

Med. 2001; 193: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), suggesting that the CD47-SHPS-1 system contributes to self versus nonself recognition by macrophages. The binding of CD47 on T cells to SHPS-1 on dendritic cells also suppresses cytokine production by the dendritic cells (12Seiffert M. Brossart P. Cant C. Cella M. Colonna M. Brugger W. Kanz L. Ullrich A. Bühring H.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).We have now investigated the role of SIRPβ in macrophage function. We thus examined the effects of engagement of SIRPβ by specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on phagocytosis as well as on intracellular signaling in macrophages.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—Rat mAbs and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) to mouse SIRPβ were generated with a recombinant SIRPβ-Fc fusion protein (the extracellular region of mouse SIRPβ fused to the Fc region of human IgG) as antigen (see below). For the generation of mAbs, the purified SIRPβ-Fc protein was injected into the hind foot pads of two Wistar rats three times at 1-week intervals, after which lymphocytes were isolated from the draining lymph nodes and fused with P3U1 myeloma cells as described previously (21Noguchi T.

Hybridoma clones producing mAbs that reacted with SIRPβ-Fc but not with SHPS-1-Fc were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among several positive clones, clones 80 and 84 were selected for experiments. The mAbs were purified from serum-free culture supernatants of hybridoma cells by column chromatography on protein G-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Biosciences). The isotype of both mAbs 80 and 84 was determined as IgG2a,κ with the use of a Rat MonoAB ID/SP kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Rabbit pAbs to SIRPβ were purified from serum by column chromatography with SIRPβ-Fc conjugated to Sepharose and were then passed through a column of human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) conjugated to Sepharose in order to remove antibodies that reacted with the human Fc portion of the antigen. Rabbit pAbs to DAP12 were generated as described previously (29Aoki N. Kimura S. Takiyama Y. Atsuta Y. Abe A. Sato K. Katagiri M. J.

Rabbit pAbs to BLNK (for immunoprecipitation) were kindly provided by H. Yakura (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience, Tokyo, Japan). Rabbit pAbs to MAPK and to active MAPK were from Promega; rabbit pAbs to MEK, to active MEK, to Akt, and to active Akt, and a mouse mAb to phosphotyrosine (PY-100) were from Cell Signaling Technology; rabbit pAbs to the phosphorylated form of myosin light chain (MLC), rabbit pAbs to Syk (N-19), rabbit pAbs to SLP-76 (H-300), and rabbit pAbs to BLNK (C-19, for immunoblot analysis) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Isotype-matched control rat IgG (IgG2a,κ) was from Pharmingen. Rabbit pAbs to mouse RBCs were from Cedarlane Laboratories.

Recombinant mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was from R&D Systems.Cloning of Mouse SIRPβ cDNAs—A full-length cDNA for C57BL/6 mouse SIRPβ was amplified by PCR from a λZapII spleen cDNA library (Stratagene) with the primers 5′-CCGGATCCAACAGGGTTCTTAACACCAACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGAATTCTGCTCATTAGCACTTATTTCCA-3′ (antisense). The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). A Balb/c mouse SIRPβ cDNA was amplified from a Marathon-Ready spleen cDNA library (Clontech) by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR, with the primers 5′-CTCCTCAAGGGCAGATATGTTCACCAAGAGACA-3′ (antisense) and 5′-GTCTCCTATAGAGTTTCCAGCACAGT-3′ (sense) for the 5′-and 3′-RACE reactions, respectively. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences of the amplified cDNAs were verified by sequencing with an ABI PRISM310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).RT-PCR Analysis—Balb/c mouse SIRPβ cDNA fragments were amplified with the sense primer 5′-TGTGAAGTTCCAGAGAGGATCATCAGAGCC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TAGGTTCCAACACCACCTGGACTGTGCTGG-3′ and with first strand cDNAs generated from Balb/c mouse tissues (Clontech) as templates. First strand cDNAs were also prepared with a Superscript-based kit (Invitrogen) from total RNA that had been isolated from peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) and RAW264.7 cells. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA fragments were simultaneously amplified from the same first strand cDNA preparations as an internal control.Cells, Cell Culture, and Transfection—All cells were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. CHO cells stably expressing an active form of H-Ras (CHO-Ras cells) were kindly provided by S. Shirahata (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). CHO-Ras cells expressing mouse SHPS-1 (30Sato R.

CHO-Ras cells stably expressing mouse SIRPβ were generated as described below. These three cell lines were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10% FBS, and geneticin (500 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). For CHO-Ras cells stably expressing mouse SIRPβ, the culture medium was also supplemented with Zeocin (250 μg/ml) (InvivoGen). The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (kindly provided by Y.

In brief, the peritoneum was flushed with ice-cold PBS 3 days after intraperitoneal injection of C57BL/6 mice with 2 ml of 3% thioglycolate broth (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan). The exudate cells were isolated by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold RPMI 1640, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, nonadherent cells, which include neutrophils, B cells, and T cells, were washed away.To examine the effect of a dominant-negative mutant of Syk on phagocytosis, RAW264.7 cells were cotransfected with a vector for GFP and a vector for kinase-negative porcine Syk (kindly provided by H. Yamamura, Kobe University, Hyogo, Japan) or the corresponding empty vector with the use of LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty four h after transfection, cells were subjected to phagocytosis assay as described below.Generation of CHO-Ras Cells Expressing SIRPβ—A full-length C57BL/6 mouse SIRPβ cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was then digested with EcoRV and NotI, rendered blunt-ended, and self-ligated to disrupt the EcoRV recognition sequence in the multiple cloning site. It was then subjected to PCR with the sense primer 5′-CCGATATCCGAGGAGGACCTGAGAGAGCTGAAAGTGATC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CCGATATCAGCTTCTGCTCTCTCACAGCTGCTCC-3′ to generate an expression plasmid for Myc epitope-tagged SIRPβ (with the Myc tag sequence inserted at the COOH terminus of the putative signal sequence of SIRPβ, between Arg29 and Glu30). The PCR product was digested with EcoRV and self-ligated, and its nucleotide sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The DNA fragment encoding Myc-SIRPβ was excised with ApaI and KpnI and then subcloned into pCAGGS (kindly provided by J. Miyazaki, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). CHO-Ras cells were then transfected with pCAGGS-Myc-SIRPβ and pTracer-CMV (Invitrogen) containing a Zeocin resistance gene with the use of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 10% FBS, geneticin (500 μg/ml), and Zeocin (500 μg/ml). Colonies were isolated 14-21 days after transfection. Several cell lines expressing Myc-SIRPβ were identified by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with the 9E10 mAb to the Myc tag.Preparation of SIRPβ-Fc and SHPS-1-Fc Fusion Proteins—For preparation of SIRPβ-Fc, a DNA fragment encoding the Fc portion was excised from the pEFneoFc76 vector (32Motegi S. Okazawa H. Ohnishi H. Sato R. Kaneko Y. Kobayashi H. Tomizawa K. Ito T. Honma N. Bühring H.J. Ishikawa O. Matozaki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2634-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and NotI and was subcloned into pTracer-CMV to generate the vector pTracer-Fc. A DNA fragment encoding the extracellular region of SIRPβ (amino acids 1-362) was amplified from a full-length C57BL/6 mouse SIRPβ cDNA by PCR with the sense primer 5′-CCGGATCCAACAGGGTTCTTAACACCAACC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AGGTCTAGAAGCAATACCTGCCGTCTTCA-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XbaI, and the resulting DNA fragment was subcloned into pTracer-Fc to generate the SIRPβ-Fc expression plasmid pTracer-CMV-SIRPβ-Fc. CHO-Ras cells were transfected with pTracer-CMV-SIRPβ-Fc and subjected to selection with Zeocin as described previously (32Motegi S. Okazawa H. Ohnishi H. Sato R. Kaneko Y. Kobayashi H. Tomizawa K. Ito T. Honma N. Bühring H.J. Ishikawa O. Matozaki T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2634-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Several cell lines producing SIRPβ-Fc were identified by immunoblot analysis of culture supernatants with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat pAbs specific for the Fc fragment of human IgG (Jackson Immuno Research). CHO-Ras cells producing a similar fusion protein of mouse SHPS-1 and the Fc portion of human IgG were also generated. The Fc fusion proteins produced by cells cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) medium were purified from the culture supernatants by column chromatography on protein A-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin (10 μg/ml). The lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose beads. The beads were then washed twice with cell lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. For detection of phosphorylated MLC, cells were treated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid to precipitate all proteins. The pellets were then washed with ice-cold acetone containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, dried, and dissolved with urea sample buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 22 mm glycine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 8 m urea. Samples were then diluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Immune complexes were detected with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Opsonization of Mouse RBCs—IgG- or C3bi-opsonized RBCs were prepared as described previously with minor modifications (28Oldenborg P.A. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).Cross-linking of SIRPβ for Phagocytosis Assay and Determination of Downstream Signaling—Thioglycolate-elicited mouse PEMs were plated in 24-well culture plates and cultured for 3-4 days. Immediately before phagocytosis assays, the plates were placed on ice and mAbs 80 or 84 to mouse SIRPβ (or isotype-matched control rat IgG) were then added to the cells at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. After incubation for 15 min on ice, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then serum-free RPMI 1640 containing both goat pAbs to rat IgG (20 μg/ml) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and glutaraldehyde-stabilized IgG-opsonized sheep RBCs (Ig-sRBCs) (5 × 107 per well) (Inter-Cell Technologies) was added. IgG-opsonized, non-opsonized, or C3bi-opsonized mouse RBCs were also tested by the same procedure. After incubation for 15 min on ice, culture plates were transferred to a water bath at 37 °C to initiate phagocytosis. Phagocytosis was terminated after the indicated times by again placing the plates on ice, and the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times. The PEMs were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, after which phagocytosed RBCs were detected with a phase-contrast microscope, and random fields were photographed. For phagocytosis assays with mouse RBCs, the PEMs were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with hemolysis buffer (154 mm NH4Cl (pH 7.3), 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA) before fixation to remove attached RBCs. To determine the phagocytosis index, we identified >100 cells in randomly chosen fields of view, and the percentage of cells that had engulfed RBCs was determined. For characterization of signaling downstream of SIRPβ, PEMs were treated with mAbs to SIRPβ and secondary cross-linking antibodies as described above. Cell lysates were then prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis.Immunocytofluorescence—PEMs were fixed for 20-30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde and were then permeabilized for 60 min at room temperature in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum (blocking solution). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in blocking solution. For visualization of F-actin, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) together with the secondary antibodies. The cells were finally washed with PBS and mounted. Fluorescence images were acquired with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM5 PASCAL, Zeiss).RESULTSCloning of Mouse SIRPβ cDNAs and Tissue Distribution of SIRPβ mRNA—To investigate the role of SIRPβ in macrophage function, we first cloned mouse SIRPβ cDNAs. A data base search based on the homology between human and mouse SIRPβ cDNAs yielded two mouse EST clones (BB637627 and BB666974 (DDBJ)) that correspond to the 5′ region of SIRPβ cDNA (∼0.7 kb), including the initiation codon, as well as two EST clones (BB144964 and BB559616 (DDBJ)) corresponding to the 3′ region of SIRPβ cDNA (∼0.7 kb), including the termination codon. We designed PCR primers based on the sequences of these EST clones to isolate a full-length SIRPβ cDNA (DDBJ accession number AB112022) by PCR from a C57BL/6 mouse spleen cDNA library. We also cloned another full-length SIRPβ cDNA (DDBJ accession number AB112024) from a Balb/c mouse spleen cDNA library by RACE-PCR. These C57BL/6 and Balb/c mouse cDNAs comprise 1317 and 1232 bp, respectively, and each contain a single open reading frame (1173 bp) that encodes a protein of 391 amino acids (Fig. 1A).The predicted structure of mouse SIRPβ is similar to that of the human protein (11Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar); it is a putative transmembrane protein with three Ig-like domains in its extracellular region and a short cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1, A and B). The first Ig domain is homologous to a V-type Ig domain, whereas the second and third Ig domains resemble a C1-type Ig domain (33Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 6: 381-405Crossref Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). The overall amino acid sequence identity between the C57BL/6 and Ba"
https://openalex.org/W2116121003,"Here we characterize the intracellular effectors of the antiproliferative activity of somatostatin in glioma cell lines and post-surgical specimens. The responsiveness to somatostatin correlated with the expression of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase DEP-1/PTPη, identified in C6 and U87MG cells, in which somatostatin inhibited cell growth. The expression of a dominant negative mutant of DEP-1/PTPη in C6 cells abolished somatostatin effects, confirming the involvement of this phosphotyrosine phosphatase in such effects. Somatostatin treatment increased the activity of DEP-1/PTPη and inhibited ERK1/2 activation. Conversely, basic fibroblast growth factor-dependent MEK phosphorylation was not affected, suggesting a direct effect on ERK1/2. In vitro experiments showed that PTPη was able to interact and dephosphorylate ERK1/2 activated by basic fibroblast growth factor. Furthermore, by transfecting PTPη in the somatostatin-unresponsive, DEP-1/PTPη-deficient U373MG cells, the somatostatin-dependent control of cell proliferation was recovered. Finally we evaluated the requirement for DEP-1/PTPη in somatostatin inhibition of cell proliferation in post-surgical specimens derived from different grade human gliomas. Although all of the glioma analyzed expressed somatostatin receptor mRNA, DEP-1/PTPη expression was limited to 8 of 22 of the tumors. Culturing seven gliomas, a correlation between the expression of DEP-1/PTPη and the somatostatin antiproliferative effects was identified. In conclusion we propose that the expression and activation of DEP-1/PTPη is required for somatostatin inhibition of glioma proliferation.

Prostate. 2002; 52: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The effects of SST are mediated by a family of five G protein-coupled receptors (named SSTR1–5) (5Florio T. Schettini G. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 17: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that are variably expressed in both normal tissues and tumors (6Reubi J.C. Maurer R. von Werder K. Torhorst J. Klijn J.G. Lamberts S.W. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 551-558PubMed Google Scholar). SST inhibition of cell proliferation involves both direct and indirect mechanisms. SST indirectly controls cell growth in vivo through its inhibitory effects on the release of growth promoting hormones (7Reubi J.C. Laissue J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 110-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or through an antiangiogenic mechanism involving the regulation of proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and monocytes (8Albini A.

The modulation of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity is considered one of the main intracellular pathways responsible for the direct inhibition of cell growth by SST (3Florio T. Scorziello A.

Indeed, although protein-tyrosine kinases provide the “on switch” for both normal and tumoral cell proliferation and migration, in most cases, PTPs represent the “off switch” signal to bring back cell activity to the basal state. In the past years different endogenous compounds displaying antiproliferative activity have been reported to modulate the activity of this class of enzymes including, in addition to SST, gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone, angiotensin II, and dopamine (14Lee M.T.

Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). In particular, a SST-dependent increase of PTP activity has been shown to induce dephosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, inhibiting the mitogenic activity of epidermal growth factor (10Pan M.G.

FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The SST-induced PTP activity was reported to be associated to the plasma membrane, sharing biochemical features with the SHP1 and SHP2 phosphatases (19Srikant C.B. Shen S.H.

Although SHPs are involved in the cytostatic activity of SST, more recently they were reported to play a more general role as adaptor molecules rather than specific effectors. Indeed, SHP1 and SHP2 may act both as positive or negative regulators of intracellular signaling, depending on the cell context. For instance, it was reported that SHP2 may be an activator of the signaling through epidermal growth factor receptor or Met but an inhibitor of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-activated intracellular pathways (24Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M.

Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that the specific antiproliferative activity of SST may also involve other PTPs. We recently reported that SST-dependent cytostatic effects in the PC Cl3 rat thyroid cells are mediated by the activation of a receptor-like PTP, named PTPη (27Florio T. Arena S. Thellung S. Iuliano R. Corsaro A. Massa A. Pattarozzi A. Bajetto A. Trapasso F. Fusco A. Schettini G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1838-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), on the basis of its homology with the human DEP-1/HPTPη gene (28Zhang L. Martelli M.L. Battaglia C. Trapasso F. Tramontano D. Viglietto G. Porcellini A. Santoro M. Fusco A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PTPη is expressed ubiquitously, showing high levels in the brain, liver, and spleen (28Zhang L. Martelli M.L. Battaglia C. Trapasso F. Tramontano D. Viglietto G. Porcellini A. Santoro M. Fusco A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The predicted protein contains a unique intracellular catalytic domain, a short transmembrane domain, and an extracellular region containing eight fibronectin type III-like repeats (28Zhang L. Martelli M.L. Battaglia C. Trapasso F. Tramontano D. Viglietto G. Porcellini A. Santoro M. Fusco A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence suggests that this PTP is involved in the negative regulation of cell growth. For example, after vascular injury DEP-1 is down-regulated in migrating and proliferating endothelial cells (29Borges L.G. Seifert R.A. Grant F.J. Hart C.E. Disteche C.M. Edelhoff S. Solca F.F. Lieberman M.A. Lindner V. Fischer E.H. Lok S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the overexpression of DEP-1 in macrophages or breast cells inhibited the generation of the stable lines, likely because of the marked inhibition of the proliferation (30Osborne J.M. den Elzen N. Lichanska A.M. Costelloe E.O. Yamada T. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a role as an inhibitor of proliferation, DEP-1/PTPη has also been implicated in cell differentiation, because its expression increased in differentiated breast cancer cells (31Keane M.M. Lowrey G.A. Ettenberg S.A. Dayton M.A. Lipkowitz S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar) and was induced by differentiating agents (i.e. thyroid-stimulating hormones) in normal thyroid cells (32Martelli M.L. Trapasso F. Bruni P. Berlingieri M.T. Battaglia C. Vento M.T. Belletti B. Iuliano R. Santoro M. Viglietto G. Fusco A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Conversely, PTPη expression is down-regulated by oncogene-dependent thyroid cell transformation as well as in malignant human thyroid tumors (33Florio T. Scorziello A. Thellung S. Salzano S. Berlingieri M.T. Fusco A. Schettini G. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3756-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 34Trapasso F. Iuliano R. Boccia A. Stella A. Visconti R. Bruni P. Baldassarre G. Santoro M. Viglietto G. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9236-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Reintroduction of PTPη into transformed rat thyroid cells leads to a the recovery of a partially differentiated phenotype and the slowing down of the proliferation rate via the inhibition of the ERK1/2-dependent proteolysis of p27kip1 (27Florio T. Arena S. Thellung S. Iuliano R. Corsaro A. Massa A. Pattarozzi A. Bajetto A. Trapasso F. Fusco A. Schettini G. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9236-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Importantly after SST treatment, a similar activation of SHP2 was observed in both PTPη-expressing or nonexpressing transformed cells, but SST was able to induce a p27kip1-mediated cytostatic effect only when PTPη was activated (27Florio T. Arena S. Thellung S. Iuliano R. Corsaro A. Massa A. Pattarozzi A. Bajetto A. Trapasso F. Fusco A. Schettini G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1838-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data indicate that, in this cell model, although SST activates both SHP2 and PTPη, the latter enzymatic activity is required to transduce SSTR-dependent antiproliferative signals. The aim of this paper was to establish a more general role for DEP-1/PTPη as transducer of the antiproliferative activity of SST. In particular we analyzed different glioma cell lines and post-surgical specimens from human gliomas to identify a correlation between the expression of this PTP and a possible responsivity to the antitumoral effects of SST. Materials—SST and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem (Lucerne, Switzerland), vanadate was from ICN Biochemicals Inc. (Cleveland, OH), and all other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Antibodies—For DEP-1/PTPη detection, we used antibodies raised against the intracellular region of DEP-1 or PTPη expressed as a recombinant protein fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and affinity-purified (34Trapasso F. Iuliano R. Boccia A. Stella A. Visconti R. Bruni P. Baldassarre G. Santoro M. Viglietto G. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9236-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), used, in Western blot experiments, at the dilution of 1:500. The other antibodies were p44/42, phospho-p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, MEK, and phospho-MEK (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) all used at the dilution of 1:1000. Cell Cultures, Treatments, and Transfections—C6 cell lines were grown in Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (ICN). U87 MG, U373 MG, DBTRG 05MG and CAS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All of the cell lines were obtained from the Bank of Biological Material of the Interlab Cell Line Collection (National Institute for Cancer Research, Genova, Italy). Pertussis toxin (PTX) (180 ng/ml) treatment was performed in serum-free medium for 18 h before the experimental treatments, as reported (35Schettini G. Florio T. Meucci O. Landolfi E. Grimaldi M.

Transfections were performed using the FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the generation of stable cell lines, after the transfection with plasmids with PTPη, PTPη[C/S], or PTPα subcloned in PCDNA3, the cells were selected in G418 (500 μg/ml). Single clones were isolated and kept in G418 containing medium. The expression of the transfected genes was confirmed by both RT-PCR and Western blot (WB). Patients, Tumors, and Tissue Preparation—Post-surgical glioma samples were obtained from the Division of Neurosurgery of the Department of Neuroscience, Ophthalmology and Genetics of the University of Genova. Thirty-six patient-derived specimens (15 females and 21 males; age range; 14–85 years; mean age, 57.3 years) were analyzed. Diagnosis and classification into histological subtypes, carried out at the Department of Pathology of San Martino Hospital (Genova, Italy), showed that one tumor was a pylocitic astrocytoma (World Health Organization grade I), five were fibrillary astrocytomas (World Health Organization grade II), nine were anaplastic astrocytomas (World Health Organization grade III) and 21 were glioblastoma multiforme (World Health Organization grade IV). After histological examination, part of each tumor was immediately frozen at –80 °C until mRNA extraction, and, when possible, the remaining tissue was dispersed and grown in primary cultures, as described below. Messenger RNA Analysis—The expression of specific mRNAs was evaluated by means of RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated using the acidic phenol technique (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62893) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed as previously reported (27Florio T. Arena S. Thellung S. Iuliano R. Corsaro A. Massa A. Pattarozzi A. Bajetto A. Trapasso F. Fusco A. Schettini G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1838-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA were treated for 45 min with RNase-free DNase at 37 °C to remove genomic DNA contamination, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. RT reaction was performed using oligo(dT)16 primer and the avian myeloblastosis virus RT (Amersham Biosciences), for 40 min at 42 °C. PCR was performed on 10 ng of cDNA as follows (final volume, 50 μl): 5 min of denaturation at 94 °C followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by 7 min at 72 °C, using the Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 units/reaction) (Roche Applied Science). The amplified DNA fragments were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers used for the amplification of both rat and human SSTR1–5 cDNAs were previously described (27Florio T. Arena S. Thellung S. Iuliano R. Corsaro A. Massa A. Pattarozzi A. Bajetto A. Trapasso F. Fusco A. Schettini G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1838-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 37Florio T.

Martelli M.L. Battaglia C. Trapasso F. Tramontano D. Viglietto G. Porcellini A. Santoro M. Fusco A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); for human DEP-1, primers were designed according to the sequences of the nucleotides 3794–3814 and 4319–4339 of the published sequence (GenBank™ accession number U10886). β-Actin fragment amplification was assessed in all PCR as reaction efficiency control, using specific primers designed based on the nucleotides 2595–2682 and 2865–2988 of the published sequence (accession number J00691) (38Porcile C.

In addition a negative control (PCR amplification in the absence of RT reaction) was used to verify the absence of genomic DNA contamination in the cDNA samples. Primary Cultures of Human Glioma Cells—Single cell suspensions were obtained from resected glioma pieces (patients 2, 3, 12, 15, 24, 32, and 34) after mechanical disruption under sterile conditions. The cultures were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids. The medium was changed every 24 h removing nonadherent cells. The cells were subcultured at least once before experiments. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—DNA synthesis activity was measured by means of the [3H]thymidine uptake assay, as previously reported (16Florio T. Pan M.G. Newman B. Hershberger R.E. Civelli O. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24169-24172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated at the density of 5 × 104 in 24-well plates. After 24 h the cells were serum-starved for 48 h and treated with the test substances for 16 h. In the last 4 h the cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences). Then the cells were trypsinized (15 min at 37 °C), extracted in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and filtered under vacuum through fiber glass filters (GF/A; Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The filters were sequentially washed with 10 and 5% trichloroacetic acid and 95% ethanol. The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was counted in a scintillation counter. PTP Assay—PTP assay was performed on immunocomplexes using the synthetic substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) in a spectrophotometric assay. The samples were incubated at 30 °C in a 80-μl volume containing 20 μl of a 5× reaction buffer (250 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm EDTA, 500 nm microcystin-leucine-arginine (Alamone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel)), and the reaction was started by adding 20 μl of 50 mm pNPP, carried out for 60 min, and stopped by adding 900 μlof0.2 n NaOH. The absorbance of the sample, directly proportional to the amount of the cleaved substrate, was measured at 410 nm (39Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Total cell lysates (250 μg) were incubated with the appropriate antibody (1 μg/1 mg of protein) for 2 h at 4 °C in RIPA buffer, and then protein A-Sepharose was added for an additional hour. After three washes with RIPA buffer the immunocomplexes were precipitated and analyzed in WB. For PTP immunocomplex assay, the precipitation was done with IgG-coupled magnetic beads (Dynabeads), because the protein A caused hydrolysis of pNPP (27Florio T. Arena S. Thellung S. Iuliano R.

Pull-down Experiments—GST-fused recombinant PTPη and its fragment 993–1135 were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (40Corsaro A. Thellung S. Russo C. Villa V. Arena S. D'Adamo M.C. Paludi D. Rossi Principe D. Damonte G. Benatti U. Aceto A. Tagliavini F. Schettini G. Florio T. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Precipitation experiments were performed as reported (41Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved C6 cells were treated for 10 min with 50 ng/ml bFGF and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm vanadate, and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). One mg of proteins was precleared with 20 μl of slurry of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), then incubated with 1 mg of recombinant PTPη993–1135, and left rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. ERK-PTPη993–1135 complex was then precipitated by centrifugation after incubation with 20 μl of slurry of glutathione-Sepharose and washed three times with the same buffer without vanadate. After the last wash the sample was resuspended in PTP assay buffer (see above) and divided in four samples into which was added buffer alone or containing different concentrations of recombinant, catalytically active PTPη. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, and then the reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer and boiling the samples for 1 min. The samples were then size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed in WB for the presence of phospho-ERK1/2. Statistical Analysis—The experiments were performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was performed by means of one-way analysis of variance. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Somatostatin Inhibition of Glioma Cell Proliferation Correlates with the Expression of DEP-1/PTPη—To establish a general role for DEP-1/PTPη as an intracellular effector of the antiproliferative activity of SST, we analyzed the effects of this peptide on the proliferation of different human and rat glioma cells. We evaluated SST effects on the U87 MG, U373 MG, CAS1, and DBTRG 05MG human glioblastoma cells and the C6 rat glioma cells. All of these cell lines expressed multiple SSTR, as determined by RT-PCR experiments (Table I). In particular all of the cell lines showed SSTR2 mRNA either as single receptor (U87 MG and U373 MG) or in association with SSTR1 (DBTRG 05MG), SSTR1 and 3 (CAS1), and SSTR1, 3, and 5 (C6). However, irrespectively to the pattern of SSTR mRNA expression, only U87 MG and C6 cells showed a significant inhibition of bFGF-induced cell proliferation after SST treatment. In these cells, SST caused a dose-dependent inhibition of bFGF-stimulated DNA synthesis, with EC50 of 1 and 10 nm, respectively (Fig. 1). Conversely, in U373 MG, DBTRG 05MG, and CAS1, SST was completely ineffective as far as cell proliferation inhibition, even when used at high concentration (Fig. 1). Because all of the cell lines expressed SSTR subtypes able to inhibit cell proliferation, to understand the molecular determinants of the antiproliferative effects of SST, we investigated, in the different cell lines, the expression of DEP-1/PTPη by means of both RT-PCR and WB. As shown in Fig. 1 (bottom right panel), we identified a precise correlation between the expression of DEP-1/PTPη and the inhibitory effects of SST. Indeed, DEP-1/PTPη mRNA and protein were identified only in C6 and U87 MG cells.Table IExpression of the mRNA for the somatostatin receptor subtypes in established cell lines derived from rat and human gliomasNameSSTR1SSTR2SSTR3SSTR4SSTR5C6 (r)++++++-++U87 MG (h)-++---U373 MG (h)-++---DBTRG 05MG (h)++++---CAS 1 (h)++++++-- Open table in a new tab DEP-1/PTPη Activation by Somatostatin Interferes with ERK1/2 Activity—Thus, we characterized the SST regulation of DEP-1/PTPη activity and its relationship with the antiproliferative effects of SST, using the C6 cells as glioma cell model (42Grobben B. De Deyn P.P. Slegers H. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 310: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation induced by SST was completely reverted by the pretreatment with PTX (180 ng/ml, 18 h), involving the activation of Gαi/o in SST effects, and by means of vanadate (30 μm), confirming that the activation of PTPs was necessary to SST to block the proliferative stimulus of bFGF (data not shown). The direct regulation of PTPη by SST was measured in a PTP assay, after immunoprecipitation of the enzyme, in control or SST-treated cells, as previously reported (27Florio T. Arena S. Thellung S. Iuliano R. Corsaro A. Massa A. Pattarozzi A. Bajetto A. Trapasso F. Fusco A. Schettini G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1838-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SST treatment caused a significant increase in PTPη activity starting after 15 min of treatment, and that further increased up to 60 min (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the increase in PTPη activity was completely reverted by PTX treatment (180 ng/ml, 18 h) (Fig. 2A). To correlate the SST-dependent increase of PTPη activity with the SST effects on cell proliferation, we evaluated the effects of SST on C6 cell proliferation in two selected clones stably transfected with a dominant negative mutant of PTPη (PTPη[C/S]) (43Grazia Lampugnani M.

https://openalex.org/W2107115483,"Carboxylesterases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of a wide range of ester-containing endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. Although the use of pyrethroids is increasing, the specific enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of these insecticides have yet to be identified. A pyrethroid-hydrolyzing enzyme was partially purified from mouse liver microsomes using a fluorescent reporter similar in structure to cypermethrin (Shan, G., and Hammock, B. D. (2001) Anal. Biochem. 299, 54-62 and Wheelock, C. E., Wheelock, A. M., Zhang, R., Stok, J. E., Morisseau, C., Le Valley, S. E., Green, C. E., and Hammock, B. D. (2003) Anal. Biochem. 315, 208-222) and subsequently identified as a carboxylesterase (NCBI accession number BAC36707). The expressed sequence tag was then cloned, expressed in baculovirus, and purified to homogeneity. Kinetic constants for a large number of both type I and type II pyrethroid or pyrethroid-like substrates were determined. This esterase possesses similar kinetic constants for cypermethrin and its fluorescent-surrogate (kcat = 0.12 ± 0.03 versus 0.11 ± 0.01 s-1). Compared with their cis- counterparts, trans-permethrin and cypermethrin were hydrolyzed 22- and 4-fold faster, respectively. Of the four fenvalerate isomers the (2R)(αR)-isomer was hydrolyzed at least 1 order of magnitude faster than any other isomer. However, it is unlikely that this enzyme accounts for the total pyrethroid hydrolysis in the microsomes because both isoelectrofocusing and native PAGE indicate the presence of a second region of cypermethrin-metabolizing enzymes. A second carboxylesterase gene (NCBI accession number NM_133960), isolated during a cDNA mouse liver library screening, was also found to hydrolyze pyrethroids. Both these enzymes could be used as preliminary tools in establishing the relative toxicity of new pyrethroids.

Both these enzymes could be used as preliminary tools in establishing the relative toxicity of new pyrethroids. Because of the removal of organophosphates from the market, pyrethroids are now the major class of insecticides used in the United States with more than 1200 metric tons used in American agriculture in 1997 (USGS Pesticide National Synthesis Project, available at ca.water.usgs.gov/pnsp). Both agricultural and residential usage is continuing to grow (4Landrigan P.J. Claudio L. Markowitz S.B. Berkowitz G.S. Brenner B.L. Romero H. Wetmer J.G. Matte T.D. Gore A.C. Godbold J.H. Wolff M.S.

Health Perspect. 2002; 110: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), leading to increased human exposure to these compounds. Pyrethroids are ester-containing insecticides that generally have low acute oral mammalian toxicity due to their rapid metabolism (6Casida J.E. Gammon D.W. Glickman A.H. Lawrence L.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1983; 23: 413-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 7Soderlund D.M. Xenobiotica. 1992; 22: 1185-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The major routes of pyrethroid metabolism in humans include ester hydrolysis by carboxylesterases (8Abernathy C.O. Ueda K. Engel J.L. Gaughan L.C. Casida J.E. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1973; 3: 300-311Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and oxidation by cytochrome P450s (8Abernathy C.O. Ueda K. Engel J.L. Gaughan L.C. Casida J.E. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1973; 3: 300-311Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9El-Tawil O.S. Abdel-Rahman M.S. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2001; 44: 33-39Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Hodgson E. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2003; 17: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and alcohol dehydrogenases (11Choi J. Rose R.L. Hodgson E. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 2002; 73: 117-128Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Carboxylesterases are also responsible for the hydrolysis of a large number of other endogenous and xenobiotic ester-containing compounds such as long chain, acyl-CoA esters, and many drugs (12Satoh T. Hosokawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Their importance in the hydrolysis of pyrethroids in mammals was first demonstrated via the use of carboxylesterase inhibitors (8Abernathy C.O. Ueda K. Engel J.L. Gaughan L.C. Casida J.E. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1973; 3: 300-311Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These observations were further confirmed when Suzuki and Miyamoto (13Suzuki T. Miyamoto J. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 8: 186-198Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) isolated a pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase from rat liver. Although pyrethroids have relatively low mammalian toxicity, a natural variation in esterase activity or the presence of other esterase substrates and/or inhibitors may compromise the ability of an organism to detoxify these pesticides (12Satoh T. Hosokawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both the levels of cytochrome P450s and carboxylesterases have been shown to be significantly lower in prenatal/newborn rats than in adults (14Miyamoto J. Kaneko H. Tsuji R. Okuno Y. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 933-940Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Cantalamessa F. Arch. Toxicol. 1993; 67: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These data suggest an increased susceptibility of fetuses and young infants to pyrethroids. Although it has been established that carboxylesterases are involved in the detoxification of pyrethroids (16Miyamoto J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1976; 14: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), most of the work on pyrethroid toxicity in mammals has been based solely on investigations in whole animals (16Miyamoto J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1976; 14: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) or liver microsomes (8Abernathy C.O. Ueda K. Engel J.L. Gaughan L.C. Casida J.E. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1973; 3: 300-311Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Soderlund D.M. Abdel Y.A.I. Helmuth D.W. Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 17: 162-169Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, the specific carboxylesterases that hydrolyze pyrethroids have not yet been characterized (18Sogorb M.A. Vilanova E. Toxicol. Lett. 2002; 128: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Several carboxylesterase isozymes with various substrate specificities have been isolated from a variety of organisms (12Satoh T. Hosokawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). However, none have displayed any specificity for pyrethroids. Therefore, we decided to identify a pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase(s) and to clone, express, and purify it for further characterization. This esterase was isolated from a common laboratory mouse strain (Swiss-Webster) due to the use of mice as animal models for studying the effects of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds (19Miyata M. Yakugaku Zasshi. 2003; 123: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). By isolating specific carboxylesterases we may begin to understand their relative importance in the hydrolysis of a range of different esters. Chemicals—All substrates used in this study are numbered according to the system outlined in Fig. 1. The compounds (R/S)-α-cyano(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-methyl acetate (A1), (R/S)-α-cyano(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)methyl-(R/S)-trans/cis-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate (A2), (R/S)-α-cyano(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-methyl-(R)-(-)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl butanoate ((αR/S)(2R)-A3), (R/S)-α-cyano(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)-methyl-(S)-(+)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-methyl butanoate ((αR/S)(2S)-A3), and fenvalerate isomers ((αR)(2R)-B3), ((αR)(2S)-B3), ((αS)(2R)-B3), ((αR)(2R/S)-B3), and ((αS)(2R/S)-B3) were all previously synthesized in this laboratory (1Shan G.

Malathion, cypermethrin (B2), esfenvalerate ((αS)(2S)-B3), (trans/cis)-permethrin (C2), and (cis)(αS)(1R,3R)deltamethrin ((cis)(αS)(1R,3R)-B4) were obtained from Chem Services Inc. (West Chester, PA). Both cis- and trans-permethrin (C2) were gifts from ICI Agrochemicals. Both cis- and trans-cypermethrin (B2), α-cypermethrin ((αR)(1S,3S)- and (αS)(1R,3R)-B2) and ζ-cypermethrin ((αS)(1R/S,3R/S)-B2) (S/R ratio, 89.7/10.3) were gifts from FMC Corp. (Princeton, NJ). All isomers unless otherwise stated were ∼99% of the isomer mixture indicated. All other chemicals used in this study were either purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher. Synthesis of compounds A4-8 is outlined in the supplemental material. Isolation of a Cypermethrin-hydrolyzing Carboxylesterase—The following procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Livers from male Swiss-Webster mice (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA) were perfused with 1.15% KCl (∼10 °C) and homogenized (2 × 30 s, 10,000 rpm, Polytron homogenizer, Brinkmann) in Buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 1-phenyl-2-thiourea). The supernatant was collected by centrifugation of the homogenized sample (10,000 g, 20 min). The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (ratio 1:10), and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min). After centrifugation of the combined supernatants (100,000 × g, 1 h), the microsomes were washed in fresh buffer A, re-pelleted (100,000 × g, 1 h), resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 0.5 m EDTA, and 1 mm 1-phenyl-2-thiourea, and stored at -80 °C. Microsomes were solubilized using the previously described protocol (21Huang T.L. Shiotsuki T. Uematsu T. Borhan B. Li Q.X. Hammock B.D. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, octyl pyranoglucoside (final concentration, 1% w/v) was added to the microsomes, which were then placed on a rotating wheel for 1 h. The resulting protein mixture was concentrated, mixed 1:1 with Tris-glycine native sample buffer (Invitrogen), loaded onto a 7% polyacrylamide gel tube, and run overnight on a preparative electrophoresis unit (Mini Prep Cell, Bio-Rad). The pyrethroid activity was screened with A2. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by filtration (30-kDa cutoff; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Identification of a “cypermethrin-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase” was achieved via separation of the semi-purified protein on two-dimensional PAGE. A pH 4-7 immobilized pH gradient strip (13 cm, Amersham Biosciences) was rehydrated overnight in a solution (250 μl) containing semi-purified protein (10-15 μg), 5% glycerol, and 2% immobilized pH gradient (4Landrigan P.J.

A second SDS-PAGE dimension was run by first equilibrating the strip in SDS equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% v/v glycerol, 2% w/v SDS, and bromphenol blue) with 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol for 15 min. This solution was then replaced with SDS equilibration buffer that included 0.25% (w/v) iodoacetamide, and the strip was equilibrated for 15 min. This strip was then loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and sealed with 1% IsoGelagarose. The gel was run at a constant current of 30 mA in a vertical slab gel unit (Hoeffer) at 10 °C. After the isoelectrofocusing step, a second immobilized pH gradient strip was cut into ∼1-2-mm slices and screened for A2 activity. The strip was then aligned with the SDS-PAGE gel, and the appropriate spots were sequenced. In-gel trypsin digestion followed by peptide mass-mapping and mass spectrometry protein sequencing were performed by the Molecular Structure Facility (University of California at Davis). cDNA Library Screening—The mRNA from Swiss-Webster mouse liver (∼4 g, pooled from 4 mice) was isolated via a two-step procedure in which total RNA was initially extracted (RNeasy and Oligotex Kits, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript reverse transcriptase II (Invitrogen) and the BD SMART mRNA amplification Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's procedure. The cDNA generated was used as the template in the subsequent PCR reaction. PCR primers were designed to one of the sequenced peptides, NLFGSEDLK (5′-AATTTGTTYGGTTCAGAGGATCTGAAG-3′) and, in addition, to either the conserved catalytic serine region IFGESAGGT (5′-TGTGCCACCTGCTGACTCTCCAAAAAT-3′) or the C-terminal region of the putative mouse carboxylesterase (NCBI accession number BAC36707) (5′-CTACAACTCTTTGTGCCTCTCCTGAGA-3′). A DNA fragment (399 bp or 1.4 kilobases) was amplified with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using the above primers and employing the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 45 °C for 5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, and completed with 72 °C for 10 min. The DNA fragment was ligated into a pCR2.1-TOPO treated vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen), and the sequence was verified (DNA Sequencing Facility, University of California at Davis). Approximately 1% of a mouse (C57Bl/6J) liver cDNA library (1 × 107 independent clones) (Invitrogen) was screened using the horseradish peroxidase-labeled PCR fragment generated above (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Potentially positive clones were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α and verified by DNA sequencing. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the Pyrethroid-hydrolyzing Carboxylesterase—An Expressed Sequence Tag (Clone ID 1450336, Invitrogen) was purchased that contained the gene (NCBI accession number BC055062) corresponding to the protein identified by mass spectrometry. The gene was excised from the original vector (pME18S-FL3) using StuI/XbaI and ligated into a similarly cut vector pBacPAK8 (BD Biosciences). The recombinant baculovirus containing the esterase gene was generated (22OReilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1994Google Scholar) and expressed in High five Trichoplusia ni cells (2 liters, 1 × 106/ml) with a multiplicity of infection of ∼0.1. At 72 h post-infection the cells were pelleted (2,000 × g, 20 min), resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 1-phenyl-2-thiourea), and homogenized (2 × 30 s; Polytron homogenizer, Brinkmann). The supernatant that was generated after centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min) underwent further centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h) to pellet the microsomal fraction. The latter supernatant was diluted 5-fold with buffer B (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol), loaded onto a DEAE ion exchange column (3 × 15 cm; Amersham Biosciences), and washed in the same buffer. After a second wash with 75 mm NaCl in Buffer B, the esterase was eluted with 125 mm NaCl in Buffer B and detected by measuring p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis. After concentration, the targeted protein was further purified using a preparative isoelectrofocusing unit (Bio-Rad; pH 3-8). The esterase-containing fractions were then combined, mixed with an equal volume of Buffer B containing 4 m KCl, and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.6 × 9 cm; Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated in advance with buffer B containing 2 m KCl. The esterase was eluted at ∼50 mm KCl by running a linear salt gradient (2 to 0 m KCl) and was then stored at -80 °C. The enzyme could be purified in a similar fashion from the microsomal fraction generated after the second centrifugation step (100,000 × g). In this case, solubilization (1% (w/v) octyl glucopyranoside) was necessary before application on the DEAE column. Characterization of the Carboxylesterases—Protein concentration was determined with the Pierce BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE and native PAGE were performed using 12% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen), whereas IEF PAGE was performed using IEF 3-7 gels (Invitrogen). The pI was estimated by incubating 2.5-mm IEF gel strips at room temperature for 30 min in water (500 μl) and measuring the pH with a pH meter. De-glycosylated protein was obtained by employing N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) using the procedure provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the esterase (100 μg) was denatured with the addition of 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol (final concentration) for 10 min at 100 °C. After cooling on ice, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40 (final concentration), and N-glycosidase F (5000 units) were added, and the consequent solution (final volume 100 μl) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Enzyme Activity Assays—Esterase activity was detected using a number of different substrates: pNPA, malathion, individual pyrethroid isomers or racemic mixtures, and fluorescent-pyrethroid surrogates (A1-8). Because all isomers or isomer mixtures were at least 98% of the stereochemistry indicated, quantities were sufficient to satisfy Michaelis-Menten conditions. Briefly, pNPA hydrolysis was monitored for 2 min at 405 nm according to the methods of Ljungquist and Augustinsson (23Ljungquist A. Augustinsson K.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), as modified in Wheelock et al. (24Wheelock C.E. Severson T.F. Hammock B.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The malathion assay was conducted according to the method previously described (25Talcott R.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1979; 47: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Huang T.L. Villalobos S.A. Hammock B.D. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). GCMS assays (2Wheelock C.E. Wheelock A.M. Zhang R. Stok J.E. Morisseau C. Le Valley S.E. Green C.E. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 315: 208-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were modified by adding 1 μl of substrate (B2-4, 7, C2, D2, and E7; 25 mm in ethanol) to 0.5 ml of the enzyme (1-30 μg/ml). The enzyme mixture was incubated for 20 s to 10 min depending on the substrate. Ethyl acetate (250 μl) and brine (250 μl) were added to each sample, after which the mixture was vortexed. An internal standard (3-(4-methoxy)-phenoxybenzaldehyde; 80 μm final concentration) was added to 100 μl of the ethyl acetate solution, and this solution was analyzed by GCMS. The method detection limits for 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde and 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzaldehyde were calculated by heat-killing the carboxylesterase (3 μg) and running a mock assay without the addition of substrate. The assay solutions were spiked with either 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde or 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (0.5 μm final concentration; 5× lowest detectable standard), brine (250 μl) and ethyl acetate (250 μl) were added, and the mixture was vortexed. This procedure was repeated seven times, and the ethyl acetate extract of each replicate was analyzed by GCMS. Fluorescent assays were conducted by measuring the production of 6-methoxynaphthaldehyde for 9 min after the addition of the substrates (A1-8) using an excitation wavelength of 330 nm (bandwidth, 35 nm) and an emission wavelength of 465 nm (bandwidth, 35 nm) (2Wheelock C.E. Wheelock A.M. Zhang R. Stok J.E. Morisseau C. Le Valley S.E. Green C.E. Hammock B.D. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 315: 208-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Protein concentration varied from 1 ng to 50 μg for these fluorescent assays. All assays were performed in buffer B at 30 °C. No more than 10% of the substrate was hydrolyzed during the assay, and solvent content never exceeded 1% of the total assay volume. Isolation of a Pyrethroid-hydrolyzing Carboxylesterase from Mouse Liver—To isolate a “pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase” microsomes were prepared from murine livers. Cypermethrin and A2 were employed to characterize the behavior of esterases on both native and IEF PAGE. At least 90% of the A2 activity was associated with esterases located in the lower section of both native and IEF gels (Fig. 2). Further analysis revealed a second region of pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterases accounting for 50-60% of the total cypermethrin activity (Fig. 2). Because the esterases that migrate faster on native PAGE (Fig. 2A) had higher apparent hydrolase activity specific for cypermethrin and A2 when compared with pNPA (5-10% of the total pNPA activity), we concentrated on purifying a pyrethroid hydrolase from this area using A2 as a reporter. Effective separation of the pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase(s) from the majority of the other esterases was achieved using a preparative electrophoresis unit (Table I). To separate the remaining proteins, IEF PAGE was employed together with SDS-PAGE to run a two-dimensional gel. Three protein spots on this two-dimensional gel were found to have A2 hydrolysis activity.Table IPartial purification of a pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase from mouse liver microsomesTotal proteinTotal activityaEnzyme activity was measured using A2 as described under “Materials and Methods.”Specific activityPurification foldActivitymgnmol/minnmol/min/mg%Microsomes22NDbNot determined.NDSolubilized microsomescMicrosomes were solubilized according to the methods of Huang et al.

Open table in a new tab Identification of a Pyrethroid-hydrolyzing Carboxylesterase—Mass spectral sequence analysis of the protein spot with the highest pyrethroid activity produced two peptide sequences (PYTEEEE; LQFWTK) that were identical to sequences in a putative carboxylesterase (NCBI accession number BAC36707). A third peptide (QNDNLFGSEDLK) was also found to correspond to the same putative carboxylesterase with a one-amino acid difference from the reported sequence (reported sequence, QNDNLMGSEDLK). The remaining two protein spots that possessed pyrethroid activity were also analyzed. Although they contained some of the same peptides that corresponded with the first carboxylesterase, they were both contaminated with other proteins, and therefore, no conclusions were drawn (peptides observed were GFFSTGDQHAK and QQNLVHFGG; residues that are different in NCBI accession number BAC36707 are underlined). Screening cDNA Library—Using the information gathered from protein sequencing we attempted to isolate the corresponding gene (NCBI accession number BC055062) from a mouse liver cDNA library using a probe generated by PCR. Although the gene of interest was not isolated from these attempts, two other putative carboxylesterase genes were found (NCBI accession numbers NM_133960 and NM_144930). Expression and Purification—The pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase (NCBI accession number BAC36707) was expressed by infecting T. ni High five cells with the recombinant baculovirus. Esterase activity was subsequently found in both the microsomal pellet and the supernatant of centrifugation (100,000 × g), and thus, the esterase was purified separately from both sources. The most effective step in the purification of this esterase was performed by the preparative IEF unit, which increased the specific activity of the enzyme 10-fold (Table II). The two additional carboxylesterase genes were both expressed and purified in a similar fashion to the first (data not shown).Table IIPurification of a recombinant pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase BAC36707 expressed in baculovirusStepTotal activityaEnzyme activity was measured using A2 as described under “Materials and Methods.”Total proteinActivitySpecific activityPurification foldnmol/minmg%nmol/min/mgCrude1900 ± 2303600 ± 1301000.54 ± 0.061.0010,000 × g1200 ± 572100 ± 45630.56 ± 0.031.04Supernatant 100,000 × g980 ± 801700 ± 31510.58 ± 0.051.08DEAE200 ± 1131 ± 3116.5 ± 0.912Preparative IEF (3-8)280 ± 123.5 ± 0.11478 ± 10146Phenyl-Sepharose159 ± 11.4 ± 0.18110 ± 6209a Enzyme activity was measured using A2 as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Characterization of the Pyrethroid-hydrolyzing Carboxylesterase—The N-terminal sequence (DSASPIRNTH) confirmed that the expressed protein gave an exact match to the mature protein with the removal of the signal peptide (27 amino acids). IEF PAGE analysis revealed 3 separate bands that had an average pI of 5.8 ± 0.2, similar to that determined from the mouse liver microsomes. Initial experiments using mass spectrometry indicated that the esterase was heavily glycosylated, and hence, it was difficult to determine the mass of the protein. SDS-PAGE indicated that the purified enzyme had two equally intense bands. Only the lower of the two bands remained after removal of the glycosylation, suggesting that approximately half of the protein was not glycosylated. Kinetic Analysis of the Pyrethroid-hydrolyzing Carboxylesterase—To determine the specificity of the esterase BAC36707 toward pyrethroids, the kinetic constants of a number of general esterase substrates were compared with both pyrethroid mimics (A2, A3, and A5) and cypermethrin (Table III). For this particular enzyme A2 seems to be an excellent mimic of cypermethrin because there is little difference between these two substrates (Km and kcat). In addition, the esterase was found to have similar Km values to other pyrethroids, such as (αR/S)(2R)-A3 and A5 but with much lower kcat values. Comparison to acetate substrates such as A1 and pNPA suggests that the enzyme predominantly recognizes the acid component of the pyrethroid rather than the alcohol. Although pNPA has an extremely high kcat value (94 ± 2 s-1), the Km value for this substrate was ∼200-600-fold higher than that of the pyrethroids.Table IIIKinetic constants determined for the purified recombinant pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase (NCBI accession number BAC36707)SubstrateKmkcatkcat/KmμMs−1μM−1 s−1p-Nitrophenyl acetate286 ± 1694 ± 20.33 ± 0.01Cypermethrin (B2)0.50 ± 0.150.12 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.06A1NMaNM, not measurable.

Recently, the structures of the autoinhibited and the activated forms of the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox (Protein Data Bank codes 1NG2 and 1OV3) were reported (18Groemping Y. Lapouge K. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Cell. 2003; 113: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We also determined the structure of the tandem SH3 domains in the autoinhibited form (p47phox(151-340); Protein Data Bank code 1UEC) independently (19Yuzawa S. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Ogura K.

Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The structure of the autoinhibited form of the tandem SH3 domains reveals that elongated monomers are related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis at the hinge, forming an intertwisted dimer with a dumbbell-like shape (89 × 64 × 64 Å). The strand-exchanged region where βA, βB, and βC of the N-terminal moiety of one monomer were intertwined with βD, the 310 helical region, and βE of the other (Fig. 1, B and C) takes a typical SH3 fold. This strand-exchanged and intertwisted region was identified as the N-terminal SH3 domain, although the distal loop of the canonical SH3 fold was extended to form the hinge. The split half of the intertwisted dimer in the crystal structure has been assumed to be physiologically relevant and to represent the structure of the tandem SH3 domains in the autoinhibited form (18Groemping Y.

Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which we called the globular module (Fig. 1B). However, a crucial issue remains to be clarified: whether the globular module exists in solution and if it represents the structure of the autoinhibited form of the tandem SH3 domains. This prompted us to investigate the structural characterization of the tandem SH3 domains in the autoinhibited form in solution. Herein, we report the structural properties of p47phox(151-340) in solution elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis. Sample Preparation—The truncated form of p47phox, residues 151-340 (p47phox(151-340)) including PBR/AIR, was expressed and purified as previously reported (19Yuzawa S. Suzuki N.N. Fujioka Y. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1479-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The truncated form of p47phox, residues 151-286, corresponding to the tandem SH3 domains without PBR/AIR (p47phox(151-286)), was cloned into a pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences), transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and expressed, as previously described (17Shiose A. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The cells were disrupted by sonication at 4 °C in 25 mm phosphate-buffered saline buffer at pH 7.4. The protein was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline buffer at pH 7.4, and the bound protein was eluted using 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, and 25 mm reduced glutathione. The N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag of p47phox(151-286) was then removed by incubation with thrombin protease (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h at 25 °C, and the digested protein was dialyzed against 2 liters of 25 mm Tris buffer at pH 8.0. The protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography on a resource Q 6-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris buffer at pH 8.0, and the bound protein was eluted using a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mm in the same buffer. Further purification was carried out by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 25 mm BisTris buffer at pH 6.5 and 150 mm NaCl. The protein was concentrated using Centriprep YM-10 (Millipore) to ∼10 mg/ml. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was carried out at 25 °C using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to an ÄKTA system (Amersham Biosciences). Sample containing 30-120 μg of purified p47phox(151-340) was passed over the Superose 12 column equilibrated with running buffer containing 25 mm BisTris buffer at pH 6.5 and 150 mm NaCl. The samples were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the fractions were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The column was calibrated using the following molecular mass standards: RNase A (13.7 kDa), chicken egg white ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), (Amersham Biosciences), and bovine carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) (Sigma-Aldrich). A standard curve for molecular mass was constructed by plotting molecular mass against elution volume. Molecular weight for injected p47phox(151-340) was estimated in comparison with the standard curve. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out using a Beckman Model XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) equipped with both absorbance and interference optical detection system with an An-60 Ti rotor at 25 °C. Loaded p47phox(151-340) sample concentrations were 1.5, 2.8, and 4.2 mg/ml in 25 mm BisTris buffer at pH 6.5 and 150 mm NaCl. The protein samples were 110 μl with 130 μl of reference buffer in six-channel centerpiece. The data were collected at equilibrium for three different angular velocities: 12,000, 16,000, and 20,000 rpm. An interference fringe was measured using the Rayleigh interference optics. After 12 h of centrifugation, displacement of the interference fringes was compared at 2-h intervals to ensure that the sedimentation equilibrium was reached. Data analysis was carried out using the Beckman Optima XL-A/XL-I software, version 4.1(Beckman Corlter, Inc.) based on the Origin software (Microcal, Inc.). Small Angle X-ray Scattering—SAXS data were collected on both p47phox(151-340) and p47phox(151-286) within a concentration range of the proteins from 2 to 16 mg/ml to estimate the possible effects of protein concentration on the determination of structural parameters. All of the measurements were made using a SAXS diffractometer in BL-10C installed at the Photon Factory in Tukuba, Japan (21Ueki T. Hiragi Y. Kataoka M. Inoko Y. Amemiya Y. Izumi Y. Tagawa H. Muroga Y. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 23: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 22Kataoka M. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The wavelength of the x-ray was 1.488 Å. The sample cell had a volume of 50 μl and a 1-mm path length with quartz windows. The data acquisition time was 600 s for each measurement. The identical buffer solution to the sample was recorded to measure solvent scattering. Protein scattering was obtained by subtracting the solvent scattering as the background trace. The scattering data were analyzed using the Guinier approximation I(Q)=I(0) exp(−Rg2Q2/3), where Q, Rg and I(0) were the momentum transfer, the radius of gyration, and the intensity at a zero scattering angle, respectively (23Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-Angle Scattering of X-ray. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1955Google Scholar). Q was defined as Q = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ and λ were the scattering angle and wavelength of the x-rays, respectively. The I(0) and Rg values were calculated using the intensity of zero angle (ln(I(0)) and slope ((−Rg2/3)) by linear extrapolation of the Guinier plots in the range of Q × Rg < 1.8 (22Kataoka M. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-Angle Scattering of X-ray.

Biol. 2001; 306: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To estimate the relative molecular weight of scattering species, the zero angle intensity I(0) was scaled to the relative molecular weight using the scattering data for bovine carbonic anhydrase (Sigma-Aldrich), a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa. The distance distribution function, P(r), defined by P(r) = 1/2π2 ∫I(Q)Qr sin(Qr) dQ, corresponds to the distribution of distance, r, between the volume element. P(r) was calculated by the indirect Fourier transform algorithm using the GNOM program (25Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2874) Google Scholar). The Q ranges used in the P(r) analysis were from 0.02 to 0.30 Å-1 for p47phox(151-340) and from 0.03 to 0.19 Å-1 for p47phox(151-286). The Rg values, calculated as Rg2=∫r2P(r)dr/(2 ∫P(r)dr), were estimated from the distance distribution function, P(r). The Dmax was a maximum dimension. Structural parameters were derived using both Guinier analysis and the distance distribution function, P(r). The distance distribution functions using the crystal structure coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1UEC) were estimated from the frequency of distances among carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in a 1-Å interval (24Yuzawa S. Yokochi M. Hatanaka H. Ogura K. Kataoka M. Miura K. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Rg was calculated from the coordinates. The maximum dimension, Dmax, was derived from the point at which P(r) approaches 1/100 of the maximum intensity. Low resolution models of p47phox(151-340) were generated from experimental scattering data by the ab initio shape determination program DAMMIN (26Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). DAMMIN calculates a volume of a protein filled with densely packed spheres (dummy atoms) to fit the experimental scattering data by a simulated annealing minimization procedure. The scattering data in the range of the momentum transfer with a Q value of 0.02-0.30 Å-1 were used for the fit. Ten independent fits were run with DAMMIN. The independent models were superimposed using the program SUPCOMB (27Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and averaged by the program DAMAVER (28Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), highlighting common structural features. NMR Spectroscopy—The sequence specific resonance assignments of p47phox(151-340) were previously described (29Yuzawa S. Yokochi M. Fujioka Y. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A NMR sample containing 1.0 mm15N-labeled p47phox (151-340) in 25 mm BisTris buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, in 90% H2O, 10% D2O was utilized for the steady state heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE experiments. The NOE spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity plus 600 MHz NMR spectrometer at 25 °C using a sensitivity enhanced technique with pulsed field gradients (30Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Four sets of the spectra were acquired using a 3.0 s relaxation delay in the experiment. The 15N-labeled sample containing ∼0.3 mm p47phox(151-340) protein in 25 mm BisTris buffer (pH 6.5) and 150 mm NaCl was lyophilized from water and dissolved into 99.9% D2O. After leaving the sample for ∼15 min to allow temperature equilibration, 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded under identical conditions at different time intervals. The total measurement time for each HSQC spectrum was ∼30 min. Two NMR samples were prepared to measure 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings in 500 μl of 90% H2O/10% D2O (pH 6.5) in Wilmad sample tubes, the isotropic sample, and the aligned sample. The isotropic sample contains 1 mm protein dissolved in 25 mm BisTris and 150 mm NaCl. The aligned sample contains 0.3 mm protein dissolved in isotropic sample buffer with an additional 5% C12E5 polyethylene glycol/n-hexanol mixture with a molar ratio of surfactant to alcohol of 0.96 (31Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The weak alignment was established throughout the measurements because the deuterium signal was observed as a sharp doublet with ∼24 Hz splitting at 25 °C before and after the measurements. One-bond 1H-15N coupling constants were measured on a Varian Unity INOVA 800 MHz NMR spectrometer at 25 °C using two-dimensional 1H-15N IPAP-type sensitivity enhanced HSQC (IPAP HSQC) spectra with in-phase (IP) or anti-phase (AP) selections (32Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 33Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The weighted sum and difference of the IP and AP IPAP HSQC spectra yielded spectra displaying only the up-field and down-field 15N doublet components. The residual dipolar coupling (RDC) values were obtained by subtracting the observed coupling values of the isotropic sample from those of the aligned sample. All of the two-dimensional NMR experiments were carried out using 256 and 1024 complex points in t1 and t2, respectively. Final data sets comprised 1024 and 4096 real points with a digital resolution of 2.9 and 2.7 Hz/point in F1 and F2, respectively. All of the pulse sequences were a modified version of the Varian Protein Pack (www.varianinc.com). NMR spectra were processed using VNMR (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA), or NMRPipe (34Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11279) Google Scholar). TALOS software was used to predict backbone dihedral angles (35Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Fitting of the dipolar couplings to the structure was made using the Module program (36Dosset P. Hus J.C. Marion D. Blackledge M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). All of the structure figures were prepared using PyMOL (37DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. 2001; (www.pymol.org)Google Scholar). Molecular Mass in Solution—Because the tandem SH3 domains in the autoinhibited form of p47phox (p47phox(151-340)) exist as an intertwisted dimer in the crystalline state, we first investigated whether p47phox(151-340) could form a dimer or not in solution. Analytical size exclusion chromatography of purified p47phox(151-340) indicated that the protein forms a single species with no evidence of aggregation (Fig. 2A). Calibration with molecular weight standards revealed that p47phox(151-340) corresponded to a globular protein of ∼24 kDa, roughly consistent with the molecular mass calculated by the primary amino acid sequence (∼22 kDa). The sedimentation equilibrium experiments were subsequently performed, which give a molecular weight independent of a molecular shape. The sedimentation equilibrium data for the p47phox(151-340) at three different speeds are shown in Fig. 2B (lower panel). The data were analyzed based on the monomeric model. The goodness of fit to the model is excellent as shown in Fig. 2B (upper panel). We estimated an average molecular mass of 21400 ± 800 Da for p47phox(151-340), which is within an experimental error of the molecular mass of 21989 calculated for the p47phox(151-340) monomer from its amino acid sequence. A higher order oligomer or molecular aggregate was not detected. Molecular Mass and Average Size by Small Angle X-ray Scattering—The molecular masses and average sizes of p47phox(151-340) and p47phox(151-286) were estimated by SAXS analysis. The measured SAXS profiles showed obvious differences between p47phox(151-340) and p47phox(151-286) (Fig. 3A and 3B). Because the SAXS profile is sensitive to the size and shape of scattering molecules, the difference was attributed to the difference in the structures of the two proteins. A more quantitative representation of the structural difference can be obtained from the analyses of the Guinier approximation of the scattering data, which provides two structural parameters, the radius of gyration (Rg) and the relative molecular mass (Mr) from the zero angle scattering intensity, I(0). The small angle regions of the Guinier plots (ln(I(Q)) versus Q2) obtained from the scattering data were fitted to a single straight line (see “Experimental Procedures” for the definition of I(Q) and Q), as shown in Fig. 3 (C and D). These data sets for each protein were considered free of high molecular mass aggregates, because an upward shift in the lower angle region of the Guinier plots was not detected (22Kataoka M. Head J.F. Seaton B.A. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-Angle Scattering of X-ray.

Biol. 2001; 306: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Each of these data sets showed no concentration dependence in Rg and I(0), indicating that no concentration dependent interaction existed. The relative molecular masses of p47phox(151-340) and p47phox(151-286) were scaled using the scattering data for bovine carbonic anhydrase, a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa. The molecular masses of p47phox(151-340) and p47phox(151-286) were estimated to be 22.5 and 15.4 kDa, respectively. These values are in good agreement with those calculated from the amino acid sequences. Considering the molecular mass estimated from the gel filtration analysis, the sedimentation equilibrium analysis, and the small angle x-ray scattering data, we concluded that both proteins exist as monomers in solution. Interestingly, Rg of p47phox(151-340) was found to be 19.3 Å in contrast to 25.4 Å of p47phox(151-286), showing that the average molecular dimension of p47phox(151-340) is much smaller than that of p47phox(151-286) (Table I).Table ISummery of structural parameters of p47phox(151-340) and p47phox(151-286)p47phox(151-340)p47phox(151-286)Guinire approximationRg (Å)aRg is the radius of gyration, derived from the scattering data using Gunier approximation, the program GNOM, and the DAMMIN.19.3 (0.5)bThe values in parentheses indicate standard deviations of the structural parameters estimated by SAXS analysis.25.4 (0.9)Mr saxs (kDa)cMr saxs and Mr seq are molecular masses estimated from the scattering data and calculated from the primary sequence as a monomer.22.5 (0.6)15.4 (0.6)Mr seq (kDa)cMr saxs and Mr seq are molecular masses estimated from the scattering data and calculated from the primary sequence as a monomer.22.015.3P(r) analysisRg (Å)aRg is the radius of gyration, derived from the scattering data using Gunier approximation, the program GNOM, and the DAMMIN.19.2 (0.3)25.3 (0.8)Dmax (Å)dDmax is a maximum dimension.6080Ab initio shape analysiseAb inito molecular shapes were calculated with the program DAMMIN.Rg (Å)aRg is the radius of gyration, derived from the scattering data using Gunier approximation, the program GNOM, and the DAMMIN.19.32 (0.01)Dmax (Å)dDmax is a maximum dimension.59.3 (0.2)χ20.51a Rg is the radius of gyration, derived from the scattering data using Gunier approximation, the program GNOM, and the DAMMIN.b The values in parentheses indicate standard deviations of the structural parameters estimated by SAXS analysis.c Mr saxs and Mr seq are molecular masses estimated from the scattering data and calculated from the primary sequence as a monomer.d Dmax is a maximum dimension.e Ab inito molecular shapes were calculated with the program DAMMIN.

Therefore, P(r) provides a quantitative evaluation of the conformational properties of proteins in solution. P(r) functions of p47phox(151-286) and p47phox(151-340) were evaluated from a set of scattering data using the indirect Fourier transform method (25Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2874) Google Scholar). The observed structural parameters from the P(r) analysis are summarized in Table I together with those estimated from the Guinier approximation. The P(r) functions of p47phox(151-340) and p47phox(151-286) are shown in Fig. 3 (E and F), respectively. The P(r) of p47phox(151-340) showed a single Gaussian-like curve with a peak at 22 Å and a half-width of 28 Å. Because a Gaussian-like curve is characteristic to a spherical molecule, p47phox(151-340) was considered a globular protein (Fig. 3E). Contrastingly, the P(r) of p47phox(151-286) showed a curve with a peak located at nearly 25 Å, and the spread of the distribution curve extended to 80 Å (Fig. 3F), suggesting a relatively elongated structure.

Rho-Rho kinase is considered to inhibit MLCP via phosphorylation, whereas protein kinase C (PKC) induced sensitization has been shown to be dependent on phosphorylation of the inhibitory protein CPI-17. We have explored the interaction of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) with Ca2+ sensitization pathways using permeabilized mouse smooth muscle. Three conditions giving ∼50% of maximal active force were compared in small intestinal preparations: 1) Ca2+-activated unsensitized muscle (pCa 5.9 with Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632); 2) Rho-Rho kinase-sensitized muscle (pCa 6.1 with guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate); and 3) PKC-sensitized muscle (pCa 6.0 with Y27632 and PKC activator phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate). 8-Br-cGMP relaxed the sensitized muscles but had marginal effects on unsensitized preparations, showing that PKG reverses both PKC and Rho-mediated Ca2+ sensitization. CPI-17 was present in permeabilized intestinal tissue. In PKC-sensitized preparations, CPI-17 phosphorylation decreased in response to 8-Br-cGMP. The rate of PKC-mediated phosphorylation in the presence of the MLCP inhibitor microcystin-LR was not influenced by 8-Br-cGMP. PKC-induced Ca2+ sensitization also was reversed in vascular smooth muscle tissues (portal vein and femoral artery). We conclude that actions downstream of cGMP/PKG can reverse PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CPI-17 and Ca2+ sensitization in smooth muscle.

We conclude that actions downstream of cGMP/PKG can reverse PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CPI-17 and Ca2+ sensitization in smooth muscle. Smooth muscle contraction involves a rise in intracellular [Ca2+]. The Ca2+-calmodulin complex activates myosin light chain kinase, which phosphorylates the 20-kDa myosin regulatory light chains (MLC20). 1The abbreviations used are: MLC20, 20-kDa myosin regulatory light chain; MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase; PKC and PKG, protein kinases C and G, respectively; PSS, HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP, respectively; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)trisphosphate; MYPT1, myosin-targeting subunit 1.1The abbreviations used are: MLC20, 20-kDa myosin regulatory light chain; MLCP, myosin light chain phosphatase; PKC and PKG, protein kinases C and G, respectively; PSS, HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP, respectively; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)trisphosphate; MYPT1, myosin-targeting subunit 1. This phosphorylation is counteracted by myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), which dephosphorylates MLC20. The extent of phosphorylation and contraction is modulated by the relative activities of myosin light chain kinase and MLCP (1Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). These enzymes are influenced by a signaling network of processes in the smooth muscle cell (2Arner A. Pfitzer G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 134: 63-146PubMed Google Scholar, 3Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). The inhibition of MLCP leads to Ca2+ sensitization, i.e. increased MLC20 phosphorylation and force at a given intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The activation of MLCP leads to Ca2+ desensitization, i.e. decreased MLC20 phosphorylation and force at a given intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Alterations in Ca2+ sensitivity also can be achieved by modulation of myosin light chain kinase, e.g. by the action of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (4Stull J.T. Tansey M.G. Tang D.C. Word R.A. Kamm K.E. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, contraction can be regulated by MLC20 phosphorylation-independent mechanisms, e.g. acting on thin filaments (2Arner A. Pfitzer G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 134: 63-146PubMed Google Scholar, 3Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol.

Phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-34 by protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown in vitro (9Toth A. Kiss E. Gergely P. Walsh M.P. Hartshorne D.J. Erdodi F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); the relevance of this result and the effect on the holoenzyme are unknown. MLCP is blocked and inhibited by the binding of the phosphorylated form of protein kinase C-potentiated inhibitory protein for heterotrimeric myosin light chain phosphatase of 17 kDa (CPI-17). CPI-17 is a major target for phosphorylation by PKC, which phosphorylates the Thr-38 residue. This process has been shown to be crucial for PKC-mediated increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of force (Ca2+ sensitization) in smooth muscle (10Kitazawa T. Takizawa N. Ikebe M. Eto M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 520: 139-152Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 36Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol.

Hence, several known mechanisms modulating Ca2+sensitivity in smooth muscle converge on MLCP and CPI-17. The physiological importance of these mechanisms in vivo is not known. Also, it is difficult to appreciate the role of protein kinase A and PKG phosphorylation of CPI-17, because these two kinases are mediators of desensitizing pathways in smooth muscle. CPI-17 also has been shown to have roles in other tissues, e.g. cerebellar signaling (18Eto M. Bock R. Brautigan D.L. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1145-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and platelet secretion (19Watanabe Y. Ito M. Kataoka Y. Wada H. Koyama M. Feng J. Shiku H. Nishikawa M. Blood. 2001; 97: 3798-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cGMP-activated kinase (PKG) are major mediators of nitric oxide induced relaxation of smooth muscle. Their effects are because of both decreased intracellular Ca2+ concentration and a decreased sensitivity to Ca2+ (20Hofmann F. Ammendola A. Schlossmann J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lincoln T.M. Dey N. Sellak H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 22Bonnevier J.

The decreased Ca2+sensitivity in response to cGMP has been shown to be mediated by PKG (22Bonnevier J. Fassler R. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Arner A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5146-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and is associated with the activation of MLCP (23Lee M.R. Li L. Kitazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5063-5068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Wu X. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One mechanism contributing to decreased Ca2+sensitivity in response to cGMP and PKG activation includes the phosphorylation of the small monomeric G-protein RhoA. Phosphorylation of RhoA prevents its membrane binding and activation of Rho kinase (25Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21722-21729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). PKG also has been shown to phosphorylate the protein telokin, promoting its relaxant effect via MLCP (26Wu X. Haystead T.A. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11362-11369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Another proposed pathway for PKG-induced relaxation involves the phosphorylation of the heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20), which has been suggested to act independently of MLC20 phosphorylation (27Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Rembold C.M. Foster D.B. Strauss J.D. Wingard C.J. Van Eyk J.E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 865-878Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PKG is targeted to MYPT1 via a leucine zipper interaction, and dissociation of this complex has been reported to result in a loss of cGMP-induced Ca2+ desensitization (29Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 30Surks H.K. Mendelsohn M.E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a mechanism suggested to be dependent on MYPT1 isoforms (31Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PKG can phosphorylate MLCP; however. this is not on the inhibitory site and PKG phosphorylation of MLCP does not alter the ability of MLCP to dephosphorylate MLC20 (32Nakamura M. Ichikawa K. Ito M. Yamamori B. Okinaka T. Isaka N. Yoshida Y. Fujita S. Nakano T. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A more indirect mechanism has been suggested, possibly via a change in affinity of MLCP for phospholipid membranes (32Nakamura M. Ichikawa K. Ito M. Yamamori B. Okinaka T. Isaka N. Yoshida Y. Fujita S. Nakano T. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In vitro, PKG can phosphorylate CPI-17 on Thr-38, which would be associated with increased Ca2+ sensitivity if it were to occur in vivo (17Erdodi F. Kiss E. Walsh M.P. Stefansson B. Deng J.T. Eto M. Brautigan D.L. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), as discussed above. Recently, it was reported that nitric oxide-mediated relaxation of intact vascular smooth muscle is associated with decreased phosphorylation of CPI-17 (33Etter E.F. Eto M. Wardle R.L. Brautigan D.L. Murphy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34681-34685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether cGMP and PKG can promote smooth muscle relaxation by increasing the rate of dephosphorylation of CPI-17.The aim of this study was to explore whether cGMP/PKG can relax PKC-sensitized, Rho kinase-independent smooth muscle contraction and whether phosphorylation on residue Thr-38 of CPI-17 is influenced. We provide evidence that actions downstream of cGMP/PKG can reverse PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CPI-17 and Ca2+ sensitization in smooth muscle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSmooth Muscle Preparations—Young adult female NMRI mice weighing approximately 30 g were used (B&K Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden). The animals were killed by cervical dislocation, and the femoral artery, portal vein, and the distal part of the small intestine were isolated. The longitudinal (external) muscle layer was peeled off from the small intestine, and preparations were made ∼4 × 1 mm and 0.05 mm thick. The portal vein was dissected free of connective tissue and divided longitudinally in two strips, and the femoral artery was dissected free of connective tissue and cut into 2-mm-long sections using forceps and microscissors under the microscope.Force Recordings from Permeabilized Preparations—The portal vein and intestinal strips were wrapped at both ends with aluminum foil. The sections of the femoral artery were mounted on two stainless steel wires (diameter 30 μm). The wires were bent 90° outside each end of the vessel. The wires again were bent 90° at 1 mm from the vessel and wrapped with aluminum foil. All of the preparations were mounted horizontally between the extended arm of a force transducer (AE 801, SensoNor a.s., Horten, Norway) and a tungsten wire enabling length adjustment. The experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C) in the surface tension bubble of 140 μl of solution in small plastic cups. The solution was stirred continuously throughout the experiments using small stirring magnets except during the β-escin permeabilization procedure. The strips first were equilibrated for ∼45 min in HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (PSS) (see below) before a test contraction using 80 mm KCl was made. Thereafter, the preparations were permeabilized using α-toxin or β-escin as described below.Staphylococcus aureus α-Toxin Permeabilization—The preparations were permeabilized using the staphylococcus α-toxin essentially as described previously (34Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparations were relaxed in Ca2+-free HEPES-buffered PSS for 10 min. The preparations then were transferred to the relaxation solution, and after 5 min, they were treated with relaxation solution with S. aureus α-toxin (5000–10,000 units/ml, Calbiochem) for 60 min. Finally, the preparations were kept 20 min in α-toxin-free relaxation solution containing 10 μm of the calcium ionophore A23187.β-Escin Permeabilization—The β-escin permeabilization procedure was preformed essentially as described by Otto et al. (35Otto B. Steusloff A. Just I. Aktories K. Pfitzer G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 317-329Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The preparations were relaxed in Ca2+-free HEPES-buffered PSS for 10 min, transferred to the relaxation solution for 5 min, and treated with relaxation solution containing 50 μm β-escin for 30 min. The preparations then were kept 15 min in β-escin-free relaxing solution containing 10 μm of the calcium ionophore A23187.CPI-17 Protein Analysis—CPI-17 content and phosphorylation were determined in small intestinal muscle preparations subjected to the same β-escin permeabilization procedure and experimental protocol as shown in the force experiments. The preparations were frozen using clamps precooled in liquid N2 and immediately homogenized in SDS sample buffer (see below) in glass homogenizers at 4 °C, boiled for 1 min, centrifuged briefly, and separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels. The samples from the different treatment conditions were run in identical concentrations on two gels in parallel, one that was used to determine the total amount of CPI-17 and the other that was used to determine the amount of phosphorylated CPI-17. After transfer to the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), one membrane was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against CPI-17 (Upstate Group, Inc.) and the other was incubated with a polyclonal antibody, raised in goat, using a peptide of CPI-17 phosphorylated at Thr-38 (sc-17560, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (for the specificity of these antibodies, see Ref. 36Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9897-9900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The antibody binding was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The ECL intensity of the gels was analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The extent of CPI-17 phosphorylation was determined as the ratio of the ECL reaction from phosphorylated CPI-17 relative to total CPI-17. To obtain a measurement of the content of CPI-17 in intact and in β-escin-permeabilized small intestinal preparations relative to intact aorta, Coomassie blue-stained gels and Western blots were performed in parallel. The CPI-17 fluorescence of the ECL reaction was expressed relative to the actin intensity on the Coomassie blue-stained gel.Solutions—The HEPES-buffered PSS contained (in mm) the following: 118 NaCl; 5 KCl; 1.2 Na2HPO4; 1.2 MgCl2; 1.6 CaCl2; 24 HEPES; and 10 glucose. The pH was adjusted to 7.4. The Ca2+-free PSS was made by omitting CaCl2. Prior to use, the PSS was gassed with 100% O2. The relaxation solution (pCa 9) used for permeabilized preparations contained (in mm) the following: 30 TES; 10 phosphocreatine; 5.14 Na2ATP; 7.92 Mg acetate; 46.6 K+ methanesulfonate; 10 EGTA; and 1 dithiothreitol. The contraction solution (pCa 4.5) was made by replacing EGTA with Ca-EGTA. The ionic strength and free [Mg2+] were held constant by varying [K+ methanesulfonate] and [magnesium acetate]. The pH was adjusted to 7.1. Different free Ca2+ concentrations were obtained by mixing the relaxation and contraction solutions to gain the desired Ca-EGTA/EGTA ratio. Calmodulin (0.5 μm) was added throughout experiments following β-escin permeabilization. The SDS sample buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 1 mg ml–1 bromphenol blue, 2% SDS, 30 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μm microcystin-LR (Calbiochem). Y27632 was obtained from Tocris. PDBu, 8-Br-cGMP, and 8-Br-cAMP were obtained from Sigma.Statistics—All of the values are given as the mean ± S.E. of n observations. All of the curve fitting and statistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot 8.0 and SigmaStat 3.0 software (SPSS Inc.).RESULTSThe smooth muscle strips from ileum and portal vein permeabilized with S. aureus α-toxin exhibited a force at saturating [Ca2+] of ∼0.4 milli Newton. This was equivalent to ∼ 100% of the initial high K+ (80 mm KCl) induced responses in the intact muscle. The corresponding values for the femoral artery were ∼0.2 milli Newton and ∼120%. The force at saturating [Ca2+] in β-escin-permeabilized intestinal muscle strips was ∼80% of the high K+-induced force.Dose-response curves for β-escin-permeabilized small intestinal muscle strips to Ca2+ in the presence of 0.5 μm calmodulin were sigmoidal with a half-maximal response at a pCa of ∼6.0. If these β-escin-permeabilized strips were subjected to an intermediate Ca2+ concentration (pCa 5.9) giving ∼70% of maximal force and then challenged with 30 μm of the Rho kinase blocker Y27632, they relaxed slightly by ∼15% (Fig. 1). At pCa 6.1, the force was ∼20% maximal force and slightly inhibited by Y27632 (relaxation ∼ 10%). In absence of Y27632, at this Ca2+ level, GTPγS (10 μm) increased the force markedly to ∼60% of the maximum (pCa 4.5). The GTPγS responses were abolished completely if 30 μm Y27632 was present or added. The protein kinase C activator PDBu (1 μm) increased the force at a constant suboptimal Ca2+ concentration in the presence of 30 μm Y27632, both in β-escin- and α-toxin-permeabilized small intestinal muscle strips as shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Panel A, β-escin-permeabilized small intestinal preparations contracted at pCa 6.0, treated with Y27632 (30 μm), and subjected to 1 μm PDBu. ***, p < 0.001 (n = 7–12). Panel B, α-toxin-permeabilized preparations contracted at pCa 6.0, treated with Y27632 (30 μm), and subjected to 1 μm PDBu. **, p < 0.01 (n = 7). Force values are given relative to the maximal force recorded at pCa 4.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The effects of 8-Br-cGMP were compared in β-escin-permeabilized small intestinal strips under three different conditions, all giving ∼50% of the maximal force: 1) unsensitized condition (pCa 5.9 with Rho kinase inhibitor, 30 μm Y27632); 2) Rho-Rho kinase-sensitized condition (pCa 6.1 with 10 μm GTPγS); and 3) PKC-sensitized condition (pCa 6.0 with Rho kinase inhibitor, 30 μm Y27632, and PKC activator, 1 μm PDBu). The initial force values under these conditions are shown in Fig. 3, panel A. The extent of relaxation after the addition of 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP is shown in Fig. 3, panel B. The effect of 8-Br-cGMP on unsensitized muscle (condition 1, above) (pCa 5.9 with Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632) was marginal. As shown in Fig. 3, panel B, 8-Br-cGMP significantly reduced tension in muscles sensitized with GTPγS or PDBu.Fig. 3Panel A, β-escin-permeabilized small intestinal preparations contracted at three different conditions: 1) unsensitized (pCa 5.9 treated with 30 μm Y27632); 2) Rho-Rho kinase-sensitized (pCa 6.1 treated with 10 μm GTPγS); and 3) PKC-sensitized (pCa 6.0 treated with 30 μm Y27632 and 1 μm PDBu). Force values are given relative to the maximal force recorded at pCa 4.5. n = 7–15. Panel B, the extent of relaxation after the addition of 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP in the three different conditions illustrated in panel A. The extent of relaxation is given relative to the force level prior to the addition of the nucleotide. The extent of relaxation in Rho-Rho kinase and PKC-sensitized muscles were significantly larger (p < 0.01, Bonferroni corrected Student's t test) compared with relaxation in unsensitized muscle (n = 6–10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To explore whether the relaxation of PKC-induced responses by 8-Br-cGMP also was present using a different permeabilization method of the small intestinal strips, we performed experiments using the α-toxin-permeabilized tissue. In α-toxinpermeabilized muscle strips contracted at pCa 6.0, treated with 30 μm Y27632, and sensitized with 1 μm PDBu (same protocol as in Fig. 2, panel B), 1 μm 8-Br-cGMP induced the relaxation (Fig. 4, panel A). There was no further relaxation if 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP was added.Fig. 4Original trace of α-toxin-permeabilized small intestinal smooth muscle preparations (panel A), portal vein (panel B), and femoral artery (panel C). In separate experiments, the [Ca2+] giving a half-maximal force was determined (small intestine, 6.0 ± 0.1 pCa; portal vein, 6.0 ± 0.1 pCa; and femoral artery, 6.3 ± 0.1 pCa, n = 4–8). The preparations were activated at these [Ca2+] and then treated with Y27632 (30 μm) before the addition of PDBu (1 μm). At the plateau of the Rho kinase-independent PDBu-induced contraction, the preparations were relaxed in response to 8-Br-cGMP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine whether the 8-Br-cGMP-induced relaxation of PKC-sensitized smooth muscle was present also in other types of smooth muscle, the experiments on PKC-sensitized muscle (condition 3, above) were performed on α-toxin-permeabilized preparations of the portal vein (Fig. 4, panel B) and femoral artery (Fig. 4, panel C). The muscles were activated at a [Ca2+], giving ∼50% of maximal force (pCa 6.0 for portal vein and pCa 6.3 for femoral artery). In all of the three tissues examined, PDBu induced an increase in force in the presence of Y27632, which could be relaxed by 1 μm 8-Br-cGMP. The femoral artery was more responsive to PDBu and 1 μm PDBu resulted in a maximal contraction that could not be influenced by 8-Br-cGMP. However, as shown in Fig. 4, panel C, a lower concentration of PDBu (30 nm) induced a potentiation of force that was inhibited fully by 8-Br-cGMP. Fig. 5 summarizes these results and shows that 8-Br-cGMP relaxes PKC-sensitized preparations of these different muscle types. The time to reach half-maximal relaxation in response to 8-Br-cGMP was 46 ± 5 s in the small intestine, 105 ± 9 s in the portal vein, and 424 ± 11 s in the femoral artery (n = 4).Fig. 5Extent of relaxation in response to 1 μm 8-Br-cGMP in preparations of small intestine, portal vein, and femoral artery. The muscles were activated as shown in Fig. 4, and the extent of relaxation is expressed relative to the force prior to the addition of the cyclic nucleotide (n = 4–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Western blot protein analysis was performed on β-escinpermeabilized small intestinal muscle strips to examine whether CPI-17 was present and whether its state of phosphorylation was altered in response to 8-Br-cGMP. The CPI-17/actin ratio in intact ileum preparations compared with intact aorta was 0.22 ± 0.06 (n = 6). There was no detectable difference in CPI-17 content after the β-escin permeabilization procedure (data not shown). The preparations were subjected to the same protocol as shown in Fig. 4, adding 1 or 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP at 5 min after addition of PDBu. To determine CPI-17 phosphorylation, β-escin-permeabilized preparations were frozen rapidly 10 min after the addition of 8-Br-cGMP. Control samples did not receive cyclic nucleotide but were frozen at the same point in time, 15 min after the addition of PDBu. Relative CPI-17 phosphorylation was decreased significantly after the addition of 1 or 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP compared with controls (Fig. 6, panels A and B). In experiments following the same protocol, with the exception that 1 μm microcystin-LR was added together with PDBu, 8-Br-cGMP failed to decrease CPI-17 (Thr-38) phosphorylation. Instead, we noted a slight but not significant increase in CPI-17 (Thr-38) phosphorylation compared with microcystin-LR-treated controls not receiving 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 6, panel C). To examine whether 8-Br-cGMP reduced CPI-17 phosphorylation via the inhibition of PKC, we used the protocol above in β-escin-permeabilized muscle at a high [8-Br-cGMP] (100 μm). PDBu (1 μm) and microcystin-LR (1 μm) with and without 8-Br-cGMP were introduced 5 min after the addition of Y27632. The preparations were frozen immediately before and 3 and 10 min after exposure to PDBu. CPI-17 phosphorylation increased with time after the addition of PDBu in the presence of Y27632 and microcystin-LR. We observed no difference in CPI-17 (Thr-38) phosphorylation over time between 8-Br-cGMP-treated preparations and untreated controls as illustrated in Fig. 7.Fig. 6Panel A, Rho kinase-independent (30 μm Y27632) PDBu (1 μm) induced CPI-17 (Thr-38) phosphorylation at pCa 6.0 at 0 (open bar) and 1 μm 8-Br-cGMP (filled bar).

The reasons for these fundamental differences in nitrate transport into the cells of representative members of these two eukaryotic kingdoms are discussed. Nitrate is a major source of nitrogen for most algae, bacteria, fungi, and higher plants, and it is the nutrient that most frequently limits their growth (reviewed in Refs. 1Crawford N.M. Glass A.D.M. Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 385-395Google Scholar, 2Daniel-Vedele F. Filleur S. Caboche M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Williams L.

The first step in the assimilation of nitrate is the influx of nitrate into cells, which is an active process, because it can occur against an electrochemical potential gradient (4Vidmar J.J. Zhuo D.

Although there is considerable biochemical, genetical, and molecular biological information about these systems and their regulation, it is still not clear whether nitrate reductase is required for nitrate transport activity or whether transport occurs quite independently and in the absence of nitrate reductase activity (Ref. 5Wray J.L. Kinghorn J.R. Molecular and Genetical Aspects of Nitrate Assimilation. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989Google Scholar and references therein). Mutants impaired in nitrate reductase activity have been studied to answer this question. Plant mutants with low levels of nitrate reductase in barley possess considerable nitrate transport activity (6King B.J. Siddiqi M.Y. Glass A.D.M. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Siddiqi M.Y. King B.J. Glass A.D.M. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and nitrate reductase-defective mutants in tobacco accumulate high levels of nitrate indicative of functional uptake (8Scheible W.R. Lauerer M. Schulze E.D. Caboche M. Stitt M. Plant J. 1997; 11: 671-691Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, these mutants still possess some nitrate reductase activity making the interpretation of the importance of an active nitrate reductase for nitrate uptake somewhat equivocal, as low nitrate reductase activity alone might be sufficient to allow substantial transport. Fungi are more amenable to an intensive genetical approach, but, nevertheless, there are conflicting reports as to whether or not nitrate reductase activity per se is required for the expression of nitrate transport in fungi. For instance, studies carried out with Aspergillus nidulans implied an obligatory requirement (9Brownlee A.G. Arst Jr., H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the results in the related ascomycetous fungus Neurospora crassa (10Schloemer R.H. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 258-269Google Scholar) showed complete autonomy. Recent work (11Machin F. Medina B. Navarro F.J. Perez M.D. Veenhuis M. Tejera P. Lorenzo H. Lancha A. Siverio J.M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in the nitrate-assimilating yeast Hansenula polymorpha shows that nitrate transport levels correlates with transporter protein levels and not nitrate reductase levels, although they did not assay nitrate uptake in a nitrate reductase-defective mutant. Here we demonstrate that nitrate reductase activity is mandatory for nitrate accumulation in cells of the lower eukaryotes, the fungi. The evidence comes first from heterologous studies with the A. nidulans NrtA (and NrtB) nitrate transporter proteins in the non-assimilating yeast Pichia pastoris and second from null nitrate reductase mutants of N. crassa and other nitrate-assimilating fungi. In contrast, studies of nitrate reductase null mutants in higher eukaryotic plant cells of Arabidopsis thaliana show that nitrate transport has no such obligatory requirement for nitrate reductase activity. Yeast Strains—P. pastoris GS115, a histidine-requiring derivative of the wild-type strain, which is unable to assimilate nitrate, and recombinant strain AtNia2, which possesses Arabidopsis nitrate reductase activity (12Su W. Huber S.C. Crawford N.M. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Su W. Mertens J.A. Kanamaru K. Campbell W.H. Crawford N.M.

Strains were maintained on yeast extract peptone dextrose medium (YPD) as recommended by Invitrogen. Filamentous Fungal Strains—Aspergillus fumigatus strains used in this study were wild-type, cnx1 and cnx3 mutants, Aspergillus niger wild-type and niaD101, and Aspergillus oryzae wild-type and niaD100 (all this study), and N. crassa wild-type, nit-3 (RIP), and nit-10 (RIP). 1G. Marzluf, unpublished. Mutant nit-3 (RIP) was found to lack nitrate reductase activity and nit-10 (RIP) nitrate transport activity (this study). Strain nit-1 is defective in the synthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (15Kramer S. Hageman R.V. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and lacks nitrate reductase activity (this study). Mutant Aspergillus strains lacking nitrate reductase were selected on the basis of resistance to chlorate toxicity (16Cove D.J. Heredity. 1976; 36: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). All strains were maintained on Aspergillus complete medium (17Clutterbuck A.J. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. 1. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1974: 447-510Google Scholar). Fungal Net Nitrate Transport and Nitrate Reductase Assays—Conidial suspensions from filamentous fungi were inoculated into 200 ml of minimal medium containing 5 mm urea as the sole nitrogen source in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks, which were incubated with orbital shaking at 250 rpm. For A. niger, A. oryzae, and N. crassa incubation was carried out at 25 °C for 16–20 h and for A. fumigatus and A. nidulans at 37 °C for 6.5–7.5 h. To induce the nitrate assimilation pathway, 10 mm sodium nitrate was added 5 h before harvesting cells grown at 25 °C and 100 min before harvesting the cells grown at 37 °C. Yeast cultures were grown in 150 ml of YPD in baffled 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks shaking at 200 rpm at 30 °C overnight to reach an A600 of 1.2–1.5. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 2200 × g at room temperature and were washed with Pichia yeast nitrogen base (Invitrogen) containing 10 mm proline as the nitrogen source. Cells were resuspended in 150 ml of the same medium in baffled 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, and 0.5% methanol was added to induce the expression of genes under the control of the aox1 (alcohol oxidase) promoter. Flasks were incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for a total of 20 h with a further 0.5% methanol added after a 12-h incubation. Filamentous fungi were harvested by filtration through a miracloth (CN Biosciences, Nottingham, UK), and yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation as described above. Following washing in nitrate-free medium, net nitrate transport assays were carried out in minimal medium containing an initial concentration of 500 μm nitrate at 30 °C for P. pastoris, A. niger, A. oryzae, and N. crassa or at 37 °C for A. fumigatus and A. nidulans by the method described for A. nidulans (9Brownlee A.G. Arst Jr., H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken from the uptake medium at the start of incubation and after 20 min, wherein cells were removed rapidly by filtration through Millex filters (Millipore, Molsheim, France). Results are expressed as the nanomoles of nitrate depleted from the medium/min/mg of dry weight. N. crassa net nitrate transport assays were repeated using the original method developed for Neurospora (10Schloemer R.H. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 258-269Google Scholar). Nitrate reductase assays were carried out according to the method described by Garrett and Cove (18Garrett R.H. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 149: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the results are expressed as the formation of nmol of nitrite/min/mg of protein. Fungal Uptake Assays Using the Tracer (13NO3−)—The growth of A. nidulans strains and the assay of nitrate influx were performed as detailed in Unkles et al. (19Unkles S.E. Zhou D. Siddiqi M.Y. Kinghorn J.R. Glass A.D.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6246-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Tracer experiments were conducted at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The routine concentration range of 250 μm nitrate was used. Growth of P. pastoris is described above, and the assay of nitrate influx was as detailed in Unkles et al. (19Unkles S.E. Zhou D. Siddiqi M.Y. Kinghorn J.R. Glass A.D.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6246-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Values for influx are expressed as nmol of nitrate/mg of dry weight/h. Escherichia coli Strains, Plasmids, and Media—Standard procedures were used for propagation of plasmids as well as for subcloning and maintenance of plasmids within the E. coli strain DH5α. Fungal Molecular Methods—DNA was isolated using a Nucleon BACC2 Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). The conditions used during dot blot analysis were as described previously (20Unkles S.E. Heck I.S. Appleyard M.V.C.L. Kinghorn J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19286-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing was determined by automated sequence analysis as described before (20Unkles S.E. Heck I.S. Appleyard M.V.C.L. Kinghorn J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19286-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed as recommended by Invitrogen with selection for zeocin resistance. Construction of Plasmid Vectors for Expression in P. pastoris—cDNA copies of A. nidulans nrtA and nrtB genes were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from total RNA of the A. nidulans wild-type strain biA1 grown on nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. Primers NRTAF (5′-AGGAGAATTCAAGATGGACTTCGCCAAGCTGCTG) and NRTAR (5′-AGGACTCGAGCTCCCTCATCTGACTTTTCGG) allowed the cloning of the nrtA cDNA into the EcoRI-XhoI sites, and primers NRTBF (5′-TACTGAATTCGCAATGAAACCCACCCAAG) and NRTBR (5′-TACTTACGTAGTGGTTCTGTTTAGGAACAGG) allowed the cloning of the nrtB cDNA into the EcoRI-SnaBI sites of the expression vector pPICZ-C (Invitrogen) to give plasmids PICNRTA and PICNRTB, respectively. The complete sequence of both genes was verified using primers PICF (5′-GACTGGTTCCAATTGACAAGC) and PICR (5′-ACCGGTCTTCTCGTAAGTG). Peptide and Antibody Production—Three peptides were purchased from the Molecular Biology Unit, University of Newcastle, Newcastleupon-Tyne, United Kingdom. These were IPDVEKKGTETPLEP (NrtA residues 269–283) and SPSRKEAFNVIFSL (NrtA residues 301–314) both from the large central loop and SWVRPVKSQMRE (NrtA residues 495–507) from the C terminus (see Ref. 19Unkles S.E. Zhou D. Siddiqi M.Y. Kinghorn J.R. Glass A.D.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6246-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar for coordinates). These peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via cysteine residues synthesized at the N terminus of each peptide. A pool of the three conjugated peptides was used to raise antibodies in rabbits by a standard procedure of six serial subcutaneous injections. Western Blotting—Yeast and filamentous fungi were grown as for assays above, harvesting filamentous fungi by filtration and yeast by centrifugation. Spore germlings and yeast cells were washed with cold sterile distilled water and were used fresh (yeast) or were frozen in liquid nitrogen (filamentous fungi). Yeast cells (500-mg wet weight) were resuspended in 7 ml of extraction buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm MOPS, 2The abbreviation used is: MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. pH 7.2) at 4 °C containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and one Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostics)/10 ml of buffer. Cold acid-washed sand (VWR International Ltd., Lutterworth, UK) (6 ml) was added, and cells were disrupted by vortexing vigorously for a total of 6 min in 30-s bursts with a 1-min cooling on ice between bursts. Filamentous fungi (300–500 mg of pressed wet weight of the spore germlings) were ground in liquid nitrogen, and the powder was suspended in 10 ml of cold extraction buffer. Crude plasma membrane preparations from yeast and filamentous fungi were made first by the centrifugation of suspensions at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove sand and whole cells followed by the centrifugation of the supernatant at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The gelatinous pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of extraction buffer, and aliquots were stored at –85 °C. Protein estimations were carried out using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein samples were denatured by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 1% SDS and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, then the samples were centrifuged for 1 min, electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked by incubation overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (137 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 5% (w/v) membrane-blocking agent (Amersham Biosciences). NrtA was detected by an incubation of the blot with 1:500 anti-NrtA antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% (w/v) membrane-blocking agent for 2 h at room temperature following a washing with TBST (TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) with 1:40,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. After further washing with TBST, peroxidase activity was visualized using ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Arabidopsis Strains—The nitrate reductase null mutant strain was generated by crossing the NIA2 deletion strain chl3-5 (23Wilkinson J. Crawford N.M. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with a line containing a dissociation element insertion in NIA1 (24Parinov S. Sevugan M. Ye D. Yang W.-C. Kumaran M. Sundaresan V. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). F2 segregants that were homozygous for the NIA1 insertion and NIA2 deletion were identified and propagated. These plants had no detectable nitrate reductase mRNA or activity (data not shown). Arabidopsis Growth Conditions—Plants were grown hydroponically with 20–25 ml of medium in 50-ml beakers and 24-h light with 2.5 mm ammonium succinate for 10 days, then NH4NO3 was added to the cultures to a final concentration of ∼350 μm as described by Wang et al. (25Wang R. Okamoto M. Xing X. Crawford N.M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis Nitrate Determinations—Nitrate concentrations in media and tissue extracts were determined chemically by the hydrazine sulfate method as described by Kamphake et al. (26Kamphake L.J. Hannah S.A. Cohen J.M. Water Res. 1967; 1: 205-216Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To measure nitrate accumulation, fresh tissues were ground into frozen powder in liquid nitrogen. Approximately 50 mg of the frozen powder was transferred into a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube and weighed. 1 ml of water was added to the tube and then boiled with the lid closed for 15 min. The boiled samples were centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at maximum speed. The supernatant was removed for nitrate assay. Net Nitrate Transport Activity in P. pastoris, a Nitrate Non-assimilating Yeast—Plasmids PICNRTA and PICNRTB containing the cloned high affinity nitrate transporter genes of A. nidulans, nrtA, and nrtB, respectively, under the control of the yeast AOX1 promoter were transformed individually into the recipient P. pastoris GS115, a yeast strain which does not assimilate nitrate or possess nitrate reductase activity (12Su W. Huber S.C. Crawford N.M. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Su W. Mertens J.A. Kanamaru K. Campbell W.H. Crawford N.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26995-27002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on the basis of zeocin resistance, and the DNA from selected transformants were dot-blotted to verify the presence of the transporter gene. Transformants harboring the nrtA or nrtB gene were grown, with the expression of the genes being induced by methanol, and net nitrate transport activity was assayed. No detectable nitrate transport was observed in representative transformants of GS115, such as T5 and T9, with the nrtA (Table I) or nrtB (data not shown) expression constructs. This result was supported by the phenotype of T5 or T9 strains (Fig. 1). Both transformants were found to be resistant to chlorate (a toxic analogue of nitrate), similar to strain GS115 suggesting impaired chlorate (and hence nitrate) uptake.Table IHeterologous expression of A. nidulans NrtA in the yeast P. pastoris without and with recombinant nitrate reductase activityHost strain and transformantHeterologous nitrate transport geneNet nitrate uptakeGS115None0T5nrtA0T9nrtA0AtNia2None0T51nrtA1.20 ± 0.06T59nrtA1.04 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Vectors PICNRTA and PICNRTB were transformed into P. pastoris AtNia2, a recombinant strain that harbors the A. thaliana gene AtNIA2 encoding methanol-inducible nitrate reductase activity (12Su W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26995-27002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As before, nrtA or nrtB transformants were selected on the basis of zeocin resistance, the DNA from transformants was dot-blotted, and nrtA or nrtB expression was induced by methanol. Functional expression of net nitrate transport by either the nrtA (Table I) or nrtB genes (data not shown) was observed in transformants of the recipient yeast strain possessing nitrate reductase activity, such as T51 and T59. The observation that nitrate was taken up by transformants T51 and T59 was supported by chlorate toxicity tests, both strains being sensitive, indicating the ability to take up chlorate (Fig. 1). Net Nitrate Transport in Nitrate Reductase Null Strains of Fungi—Because there are conflicting results in the filamentous fungal literature, we extended previous studies to obtain clarification. Nitrate reductase loss-of-function mutants were generated on the basis of resistance to chlorate as described previously (16Cove D.J. Heredity. 1976; 36: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) for A. fumigatus, A. niger, and A. oryzae. Several were found by genetic complementation tests and growth responses to be nitrate reductase structural gene mutants (niaD) or to be mutant in one of several molybdenum cofactor genes (cnx) required for nitrate reductase activity. None of the representative mutant strains were found to possess nitrate reductase activity, and no detectable net nitrate uptake was observed in any of these strains (Table II).Table IINet nitrate uptake in nitrate reductase defective filamentous fungal mutantsSpecies and mutationNitrate reductase activityNet nitrate uptakeA. fumigatuswild-type64.310.9cnx100cnx300A. nigerwild-type41.07.2niaD10100A. oryzaewild-type73.76.3niaD10000N. crassawild-type100.27.8nit-3 (RIP)00nit-100nit-10 (RIP)11.40 Open table in a new tab No detectable uptake (as judged from the results from conventional Aspergillus uptake experimental procedures) was observed in the N. crassa nit-3 (RIP) strain, which is effectively a knock-out of the nitrate reductase structural gene (i.e. nit-3) and is devoid of measurable nitrate reductase activity (Table II). As these results were at variance with the original published data (10Schloemer R.H. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 258-269Google Scholar), the transport assays were repeated using growth conditions and assay methods precisely according to the original method used for N. crassa. Again, no net nitrate uptake was observed in the nitrate reductase defective mutant nit-3 (RIP) or in a molybdenum cofactor defective mutant, designated nit-1 in N. crassa (15Kramer S. Hageman R.V. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally, the lack of net nitrate transport in the N. crassa mutant nit-10 (RIP) confirmed that this protein is functionally responsible for nitrate transport, and the failure of this mutant to grow on nitrate suggests that it is the only nitrate permease in N. crassa (Table II). It is noteworthy that mutant nit-10 (RIP) still retained nitrate reductase activity, although nitrate failed to enter the cell. A similar result was observed for transporter mutants of A. nidulans (19Unkles S.E. Zhou D. Siddiqi M.Y. Kinghorn J.R. Glass A.D.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6246-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). nrtA Expression—Previous work (19Unkles S.E. Zhou D. Siddiqi M.Y. Kinghorn J.R. Glass A.D.M.

A. 1991; 88: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) has shown that in A. nidulans, the nrtA transcript is present in niaD or cnx mutants lacking nitrate reductase activity. Likewise in P. pastoris, the nrtA transcript was observed in transformants such as T5 and T9 (data not shown) lacking nitrate reductase activity. Protein Analysis—Western blot analysis was carried out using anti-NrtA antibodies to determine whether the NrtA protein was present in crude membrane preparations from yeast or filamentous fungal cells with and without nitrate reductase activity. A major immunoreactive polypeptide of ∼50 kDa was observed in a representative transformed P. pastoris strain, T9, a transformant of GS115 that lacks nitrate reductase (Fig. 2), and also in transformants T8 and T15 (data not shown). This 50-kDa polypeptide was absent from the recipient strain GS115 but was present in the P. pastoris transformant T51. However, the protein was not observed in the corresponding nitrate reductase-containing recipient strain AtNia2 or a in zeocin-resistant transformant of AtNia2, T52, which had no detectable nitrate uptake (data not shown). Western blots of crude membrane preparations from nitrate-induced A. nidulans nitrate reductase-defective strains also showed a faint immunoreactive polypeptide of 50 kDa similar to the wild-type band. It is noteworthy that confirmation that the 50-kDa polypeptide is indeed the NrtA protein came from studies of an A. nidulans nrtA deletion mutant, nrtA747. When this strain was grown under inducing conditions, it lacked this 50-kDa polypeptide (data not shown). Fungal Uptake Assays Using the Tracer (13NO3−)—To circumvent the possibility that in nitrate reductase null mutants, nitrate influx was normal but then a rapid efflux occurred (an unlikely but possible explanation for observed zero net flux in net nitrate uptake results), nitrate influx was undertaken using the very sensitive short lived tracer (13NO3−) on a few selected strains. Unlike the depletion method of measuring net nitrate uptake by measuring the disappearance of nitrate from the uptake solution, the tracer method measures tracer contained within samples of the fungus after a rinsing with non-labeled solution. A. nidulans mutant niaD171 lacked nitrate reductase activity (i.e. no measurable nitrite was formed in nitrate reductase assays of niaD171 cell-free extracts grown under inducing conditions, whereas the wild-type extract formed 36 nmol of nitrite/min/mg), and net nitrate influx was undetectable with niaD171 (>0.06 nmol/min/mg compared with 13.6 nmol/min/mg for wild-type). The results presented in Fig. 3 showed that the A. nidulans mutant niaD171 likewise displayed negligible (13NO3−) influx values that were approximately similar to the double mutant strain nrtA747nrtB101. Nitrate Depletion in a Nitrate Reductase Loss-of-function A. thaliana Strain—Studies over a period of 24 h indicated that the net nitrate uptake of a nitrate reductase null mutant (see “Experimental Procedures”), as judged by nitrate depletion assays, was similar to the wild-type (Table III). Furthermore, nitrate accumulated to a significantly higher level in the roots and shoots of the nitrate reductase null mutant compared with the wild-type levels, presumably because of the lack of nitrate reductase activity (Table IV).Table IIINitrate depletion by wild-type and nitrate reductase null mutant of A. thalianaIncubation timeNitrate concentrationWild-typeNitrate reductase nullhμm0337.4 ± 41.3342.4 ± 45.41322.4 ± 34.7313.1 ± 22.32307.5 ± 6.5294.8 ± 14.64261.5 ± 7.5270.3 ± 14.18173.5 ± 7.0205.1 ± 14.01696.5 ± 94.0158.4 ± 49.52430.3 ± 15.748.7 ± 49.5 Open table in a new tab Table IVNitrate accumulation in wild-type and nitrate reductase null mutants of A. thaliana upon exposure to nitrateTissueNitrate accumulationμmol/g of tissueWild-type root9.37 ± 3.42Wild-type shoot2.00 ± 1.28Nitrate reductase null root21.35 ± 0.31Nitrate reductase null shoot6.97 ± 0.27 Open table in a new tab This study was undertaken to determine whether nitrate reductase is required for nitrate uptake activity in the cells of fungi and plants, because certain previous studies were equivocal, possibly due to mutant strains retaining some nitrate reductase activity. Our goals therefore were to generate cells for both lower and higher eukaryotic representatives devoid of nitrate reductase activity and to study their nitrate-transport profiles. Initially, studies were carried out using the non-nitrate-assimilating yeast P. pastoris, which is a lower eukaryote. Net nitrate transport activity was determined in cells transformed with the A. nidulans nitrate transporter gene nrtA in the presence and absence of a recombinant A. thaliana nitrate reductase gene NIA2. Net nitrate transport was clearly observed in nrtA transformant cells with, but not without, NIA2. Subsequently, nitrate reductase-defective mutants were generated in several different filamentous fungi. Nitrate reductase loss-of-function mutants were identified, and all lacked net nitrate transport, including N. crassa for which mutants were originally reported to possess significant nitrate uptake levels (10Schloemer R.H. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 258-269Google Scholar). Finally, results from experiments using the short lived tracer (13NO3−) confirm that there is a loss of nitrate accumulation in fungal strains lacking nitrate reductase activity. It is clear therefore that yeast and filamentous fungi fail to accumulate nitrate in the complete absence of nitrate reductase. In contrast, in the higher eukaryotic plant, A. thaliana, nitrate transport activity is completely independent of nitrate reductase activity as judged by the retention of transport and the accumulation of nitrate in a loss-of-function nitrate reductase mutant, a strain generated by disruption of both nitrate reductase structural genes, NIA1 and NIA2. Lack of nitrate uptake is not because of a down-regulation of transporter gene expression or a lack of translation in fungi. It has been shown previously that nitrate reductase activity was not required for the transcription of nrtA (the A. nidulans nitrate transporter coding gene), and indeed, the nrtA transcript abundance in nitrate reductase loss-of-function mutants was elevated compared with wild-type levels because of the continued presence of the inducer (19Unkles S.E. Zhou D. Siddiqi M.Y. Kinghorn J.R. Glass A.D.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6246-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Unkles S.E. Hawker K. Grieve C. Campbell E.I. Kinghorn J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

This conclusion was supported in this study of the nitrate non-assimilating yeast, P. pastoris, in which regulation by nitrate-mediated induction was replaced by alcohol. The resulting methanol-induced nrtA transcript abundance was demonstrated in strains lacking nitrate reductase. Moreover, it would appear from Western blot experiments that the loss of nitrate transport activity in fungal nitrate reductase minus strains is not because of a failure to translate the transporter protein, as NrtA protein expression was observed. We concluded that the lack of nitrate reductase activity appears to be the reason for the lack of nitrate uptake, rather than altered regulation, and nitrate reductase from the same species is not required to permit nitrate transport. Nitrate transport in yeast could be elicited in the presence of a plant nitrate reductase, and this indicates that there is no absolute requirement for fungal nitrate reductase per se to be present for transport activity. These results raise the obvious question what is the basis for the fundamental difference in nitrate reductase requirements for nitrate influx between these two eukaryotic groups? The first possibility is that there is a physical/mechanistic interaction or cross-talk between nitrate reductase and the transporter protein in fungal but not in plant cells. In this regard, nitrate, as well as being a nutrient, plays a role in morphogenic processes acting as a signal for instance in lateral root formation and stomatal closure in plants (28Zhang H. Forde B.G. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 51-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Garcia-Mata C. Lamattina L. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For these additional functions, plants may have evolved a mechanism(s) to bypass the need for nitrate reductase. This proposition, however, may appear less probable, because plant nitrate reductase can substitute adequately for the fungal enzyme in yeast. A second possibility is that nitrate reductase is required to maintain a gradient for nitrate entry into cells. Therefore if nitrate is not removed by nitrate reductase to nitrite (i.e. biochemical sequestration of nitrate), nitrate influx ceases. If this is indeed the situation, why can plants apparently concentrate nitrate against a large gradient in the absence of nitrate reductase activity, whereas fungi cannot? Estimates suggest that a lower limit for plant root nitrate concentration may be ∼5mm (30Siddiqi M.Y. Glass A.D.M. Plant Cell Environ. 2002; 25: 1215-1217Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The answer may lie in the storage of nitrate. Although the lower eukaryotes are incapable of nitrate storage, the higher eukaryote may reserve large quantities of nitrate for example within the vacuole of root cells. Indeed, given free access to nitrate plant root cells may accumulate up to 80 μmol/g of fresh weight, equivalent to ∼80 mm nitrate (4Vidmar J.J. Zhuo D. Siddiqi M.Y. Schjoerring J.K. Touraine B. Glass A.D.M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition, many higher plants conduct most of the absorbed nitrate to the shoot for assimilation. The maintenance of a gradient due to nitrate removal is attractive, because the plant possesses no less than seven high affinity nitrate transporter paralogues (compared with just one gene observed in the genome of most fungi sequenced so far), and the function of several of these plant genes could be involved in storage processes. Therefore, in the absence of nitrate reductase, the nitrate concentration at the plasma membrane of plant cells may be maintained at a relatively low concentration by sequestration into the vacuole or by transfer to the shoots. In other words, such biophysical removal of nitrate in plant cells would maintain an appropriate gradient necessary to sustain nitrate transport, even in the absence of nitrate reductase activity. In fungal cells, the nitrate concentration localized at the membrane could rise rapidly in the absence of nitrate reductase activity to a concentration which would preclude further transport. Notwithstanding, it is somewhat puzzling that no significant fungal (13NO3−) accumulation is observed in the absence of nitrate reductase activity, because some accumulation into the cell might be expected, at least until the free energy gradient of nitrate was dissipated and the pump was stalled. Further experimentation should shed more light into these processes. We thank Dr. G. Marzluf, Ohio State University, for kindly providing RIP mutants in the nitrate assimilation pathway of N. crassa.

The enzymatic activity of TPase was found to be essential for its angiogenesis-stimulating properties. All of the previously described TPase inhibitors are either pyrimidine analogues that interact with the nucleoside-binding site of the enzyme or modified purine derivatives that mimic the pyrimidine structure and either compete with thymidine or act as a multisubstrate (competitive) inhibitor. We now describe the inhibitory activity of the purine riboside derivative KIN59 (5′-O-tritylinosine) against human and bacterial recombinant TPase and TPase-induced angiogenesis. In contrast to previously described TPase inhibitors, KIN59 does not compete with the pyrimidine nucleoside or the phosphate-binding site of the enzyme but noncompetitively inhibits TPase when thymidine or phosphate is used as the variable substrate. In addition, KIN59 was far more active than other TPase inhibitors, previously tested by us, against TPase-induced angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. The observed anti-angiogenic effect of KIN59 was not accompanied by inflammation or any visible toxicity. Inosine did not inhibit the enzymatic or angiogenic activity of the enzyme, indicating that the 5′-O-trityl group in KIN59 is essential for the observed effects. In contrast with current concepts, our data indicate that the angiogenic activity of TPase is not solely directed through its functional nucleoside and phosphate-binding sites. Other regulatory (allosteric) site(s) in TPase may play an important role in the mechanism of TPase-triggered angiogenesis stimulation and apoptosis inhibition. Identification of these site(s) is important to obtain a better insight into the molecular role of TPase in the progression of cancer and angiogenic diseases.

Identification of these site(s) is important to obtain a better insight into the molecular role of TPase in the progression of cancer and angiogenic diseases. Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels arise from pre-existing vessels (1Liekens S. De Clercq E. Neyts J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). It is essential during embryogenesis for the formation of a vascular plexus, which ensures an adequate blood supply to all developing tissues. In adults, neovascularization is limited to wound healing and the female reproductive cycle. During these processes, angiogenesis is tightly regulated. Unregulated angiogenesis may lead to the progression of several inflammatory diseases and is an essential component of solid tumor growth and metastasis. The formation of new blood vessels requires several sequential steps, which are regulated by a number of angiogenic factors, including chemokines, growth factors, integrins, and enzymes, such as proteases and thymidine phosphorylase (TPase) 1The abbreviations used are: TPase, thymidine phosphorylase; CAM, chick chorioallantoic membrane; dThd, thymidine; 7DX, 7-deazaxanthine; MBEC, mouse brain endothelial cell; Thy, thymine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. (1Liekens S. De Clercq E. Neyts J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 253-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). TPase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of pyrimidine 2′-deoxynucleosides to 2-deoxyribose 1-phosphate and their respective pyrimidine bases. TPase also recognizes several nucleoside analogues that are being used clinically as antiviral (i.e. 5-(E)-(2-bromovinyl)-2′-deoxyuridine, 5-trifluoromethyl-2′-deoxyuridine, 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine) or anti-tumor (i.e. 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine) agents (2Desgranges C. Razaka G. Rabaud M. Bricaud H. Balzarini J. De Clercq E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As such, TPase plays a key role in the pyrimidine nucleoside salvage pathway, as well as in the inactivation of cytotoxic pyrimidine nucleoside analogues. The angiogenic protein, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, isolated from platelets in 1987, was shown to be identical to TPase (3Usuki K. Saras J. Waltenberger J. Miyazono K. Pierce G. Thomason A. Heldin C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis revealed that the enzymatic activity of TPase is essential for its angiogenic effect (4Miyadera K. Sumizawa T. Haraguchi M. Yoshida H. Konstanty W. Yamada Y. Akiyama S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1687-1690PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, TPase/platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor stimulates endothelial cell migration and is therefore not an endothelial cell growth factor (5Ishikawa F. Miyazono K. Hellman U. Drexler H. Wernstedt C. Hagiwara K. Usuki K. Takaku F. Risau W. Heldin C.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). However, endothelial cell migration, in the absence of proliferation, is sufficient to induce an angiogenic response. The mechanism by which TPase induces angiogenesis is still unclear, although significant progress has been made recently. In contrast to other angiogenesis stimulators, TPase does not contain a signal sequence required for cell secretion. Also, an endothelial cell receptor for TPase has never been identified. Therefore, it is most likely that the products of its enzymatic activity, rather than TPase itself, possess the angiogenic properties. Recent observations suggest that 2-deoxy-d-ribose induces angiogenesis by generating oxygen radical species, which induce the secretion of oxidative stress-responsive angiogenic factors, like vascular endothelial cell growth factor, interleukin-8, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (6Brown N.S. Jones A. Fujiyama C. Harris A.L. Bicknell R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6298-6302PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Hotchkiss et al. (7Hotchkiss K.A. Ashton A.W. Klein R.S. Lenzi M.L. Hui Zhu G. Schwartz E.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 527-533PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that TPase and 2-deoxy-d-ribose activate specific integrins, which directly links TPase-induced endothelial cell migration to intracellular signal transduction pathways. TPase is overexpressed in many solid tumors. Moreover, TPase levels correlate well with microvessel density in breast, ovarian, colorectal, endometrial, and esophageal cancers (8Toi M. Hoshina S. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto Y. Ishitsuka H. Tominaga T. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 64: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 9Hata K. Nagami H. Iida K. Miyazaki K. Collins W.P. Obstet.

Int. 2001; 51: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), pointing to an important role for this enzyme in tumor vascularization. In addition, TPase has been shown to inhibit tumor cell apoptosis (12Okamoto E. Osaki M. Kase S. Adachi H. Kaibara N. Ito H. Pathol. Int. 2001; 51: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is an anti-cancer potential for potent and specific TPase inhibitors. So far, few potent TPase inhibitors have been described, most of which are pyrimidine analogues, including 6-aminothymine, 6-amino-5-bromouracil, and 5-chloro-6-[1-(2-iminopyrrolidinyl)methyl]uracil hydrochloride (13Matsushita S. Nitanda T. Furukawa T. Sumizawa T. Tani A. Nishimoto K. Akiba S. Miyadera K. Fukushima M. Yamada Y. Yoshida H. Kanzaki T. Akiyama S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1911-1916PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the structure of Escherichia coli TPase (14Walter M.R. Cook W.J. Cole L.B. Short S.A. Koszalka G.W. Krenitsky T.A. Ealick S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14016-14022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which shows 40% sequence identity with human TPase (15Norman R.A. Barry S.T. Bate M. Breed J. Colls J.G. Ernill R.J.

Structure. 2004; 12: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we recently designed and synthesized the first purine derivative (7-deazaxanthine (7DX)) with inhibitory activity against E. coli TPase (16Balzarini J. Esteban-Gamboa A. Esnouf R. Liekens S. Neyts J. De Clercq E. Camarasa M.J. Pérez-Pérez M.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 7DX was then used as a lead compound to develop more potent purine-based multisubstrate inhibitors of TPase (17Esteban-Gamboa A. Balzarini J. Esnouf R. De Clercq E. Camarasa M.J. Pérez-Pérez M.J. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The prototype compound (TP65) contains an alkyl phosphonate moiety, covalently linked to 7DX (Fig. 1). We proved that TP65 is able to concomitantly interact at the nucleoside and phosphate-binding sites (in a competitive manner with regard to the natural substrates dThd and phosphate), thus immobilizing the enzyme in an open, inactive conformation (18Balzarini J. Degrève B. Esteban-Gamboa A. Esnouf R. De Clercq E. Engelborghs Y. Camarasa M.J. Pérez-Pérez M.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, TP65 inhibited TPase-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay (19Liekens S. Bilsen F. De Clercq E. Priego E.M. Camarasa M.J. Perez-Perez M.J. Balzarini J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe the inhibitory activity of the inosine analogue KIN59 (Fig. 1) against human and bacterial recombinant TPase. KIN59 is an unusual TPase inhibitor; it is a purine nucleoside with an intact ribose moiety. Extensive kinetic studies show that, in contrast to previously described TPase inhibitors, KIN59 does not compete with the phosphate or the nucleoside-binding site of the enzyme. Moreover, KIN59 was far more active than other TPase inhibitors (tested in our laboratory) in the CAM assay, indicating that other, yet unrevealed sites on the TPase enzyme may be essential to confer certain biological properties to TPase, such as its angiogenic potential. Identification of these sites might help to clarify the mechanism of angiogenesis stimulation by TPase. Materials—KIN56 (5′-O-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityl)-2′-deoxyadenosine; Fig. 1), 2′-deoxyadenosine, hypoxanthine, 5′-deoxy-5′-(methylthio)adenosine, and 5′-deoxyadenosine were purchased from Sigma. Inosine was from Fluka (Switzerland), and 5′-chloro-5′-deoxyadenosine was from Berry and Associates (Dexter, MI). Compound Synthesis—We have employed an improved synthetic procedure compared with the reported method (20Muramatsu N. Takenishi T. J. Org. Chem. 1965; 30: 3211-3212Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) for the synthesis of 5′-O-tritylinosine (KIN59; Fig. 1), as follows: To a solution of inosine (1.0 g, 3.73 mmol) in dry pyridine (19 ml), trityl chloride (1.8 g, 6.34 mmol), and 4-N,N′-dimethylaminopyridine (18.2 mg, 0.15 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 15 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (20 ml) and a 0.1 n HCl solution (20 ml). The organic phase was washed with water (20 ml) and brine (20 ml). The organic layer was dried on anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (CH2Cl2:MeOH, 10:1) to yield 780 mg (41%) of 5′-O-trityl-inosine as a white solid: melting point, 230-232 °C; melting point described in the literature, (20Muramatsu N.

Cell Cultures—BALB/c mouse brain microvascular endothelial 10027 cells (MBECs) were kindly provided by Prof. M. Presta (Brescia, Italy). MBECs were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. This spontaneously immortalized cell line was identified as endothelial on the basis of different phenotypic markers (22Bastaki M. Nelli E.E. Dell'Era P. Rusnati M. Molinari-Tosatti M.P. Parolini S.

Purification of Recombinant TPase—The E. coli TPase gene was expressed in E. coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, as described previously (19Liekens S. Bilsen F. De Clercq E. Priego E.M. Camarasa M.J. Perez-Perez M.J. Balzarini J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The pMOAL-10T vector containing the human TPase gene (fused to glutathione S-transferase) was kindly provided by Prof. R. Bicknell (Oxford, UK). Protein purification was performed as described (19Liekens S. Bilsen F. De Clercq E. Priego E.M. Camarasa M.J. Perez-Perez M.J. Balzarini J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TPase Enzyme Assays—The phosphorolysis of thymidine (dThd) by human or E. coli glutathione S-transferase-TPase was measured by HPLC analysis. The incubation mixture (500 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm potassium phosphate (unless otherwise stated in the kinetic experiments), 150 mm NaCl, and 100 μm of dThd in the presence of 0.025 U TPase. Incubations were performed at room temperature. At different time points (i.e. 0, 20, 40, and 60 min), 100-μl fractions were withdrawn, transferred to an Eppendorf tube thermo block, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Next, the samples were rapidly cooled on ice, and dThd was separated from thymine (Thy) and quantified in the samples on a reverse phase RP-8 column (Merck) by HPLC analysis. The separation of Thy and dThd was performed by a linear gradient from 98% buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4 with 5 mm heptane sulfonic acid, pH 3.2) and 2% acetonitrile to 50% buffer B and 50% acetonitrile. The retention times of Thy and dThd were 4.2 and 8.5 min, respectively. UV-based detection of Thy and dThd was performed at 267 nm. To evaluate the inhibitory effect of the compounds, a variety of inhibitor concentrations, including 1 mm, 100 μm, 10 μm, and 0 μm (control) were added to the reaction mixture (500 μl) containing 100 μm of dThd. Aliquots of 100 μl were withdrawn from the reaction mixture at several time points, as described above, heated at 95 °C to inactivate the enzyme, and analyzed by HPLC. To discriminate between reversible and irreversible inhibition of TPase, 150, 100, and 50 μm KIN59 were exposed to different TPase concentrations (0.005, 0.004, 0.003, 0.0025, 0.002, 0.001, and 0.0005 unit) in a 100-μl reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Conversion of dThd to Thy was evaluated as described above. In the kinetic assays, where the inhibitory effect of the test compounds was evaluated at varying concentrations of inorganic phosphate (Pi), the compounds were tested at concentrations ranging from 75 μm to 400 μm, in the presence of 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 mm Pi. The (saturating) dThd concentration was kept fixed at 1000 μm. The reaction mixture (100 μl) was then incubated for 20 min with 0.005 unit of TPase, after which the tubes were heated to 95 °C before cooling and HPLC analysis. In the kinetic assays, where the inhibition of TPase enzymatic activity was evaluated at varying concentrations of dThd, the compounds were tested at concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 μm, in the presence of 125, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 μm dThd. The concentration of inorganic phosphate was kept constant at 25 mm. The analysis of the dThd-to-Thy conversion was performed as described above. Cell Proliferation Assays—MBEC were seeded in 24-well plates at 10,000 cells/cm2. After 16 h, the cells were incubated in fresh medium in the presence of the test compounds, as indicated under “Results” (see Fig. 7). On day 5, the cells were trypsinized and counted by a Coulter counter (Harpenden Hertz, UK). CAM Assay in Fertilized Chicken Eggs—The in vivo CAM angiogenesis model was performed as described (23Liekens S. Neyts J. De Clercq E. Verbeken E. Ribatti D. Presta M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5057-5064PubMed Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C when 3 ml of albumen was removed (to detach the shell from the developing CAM), and a window was opened on the eggshell exposing the CAM. The window was covered with cellophane tape, and the eggs were returned to the incubator until day 9 when the compounds were applied. The compounds were placed on sterile plastic discs (Ø, 8 mm), which were allowed to dry under sterile conditions. A solution of cortisone acetate (100 μg/disc; Sigma) was added to all discs to prevent an inflammatory response. A loaded and dried control disc was placed on the CAM ∼1 cm away from the disc containing the test compound(s). Next, the windows were covered, and the eggs were further incubated until day 11 when angiogenesis was assessed. At day 11, the membranes were fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Janssen Chimica, Geel, Belgium), the plastic discs were removed, and the eggs were kept at room temperature for 2 h. A large area around the discs was cut off and placed on a glass slide. To determine the number of blood vessels, a grid containing three concentric circles with diameters of 4, 5, and 6 mm was positioned on the surface of the CAM that was previously covered by the disc. Next all of the vessels intersecting the circles were counted. A two-tailed paired Student's t test was used to assess the significance of the obtained results. Histological Examination of Angiogenesis in the CAM Assay—For histological examination of the TPase-induced angiogenic response, a modified CAM assay was used. Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs (30 for each experimental series) were incubated at 37 °C at constant humidity. On day 3 of incubation a square window was opened in the eggshell after removal of 2-3 ml of albumen. The window was sealed with a glass, and the eggs were returned to the incubator. On day 8, 1-mm3 sterilized gelatin sponges (Gelfoam Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) were placed on top of the growing CAM, according to the method of Ribatti et al. (24Ribatti D. Gualandris A. Bastaki M. Vacca A. Iurlaro M. Roncali L. Presta M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The sponges were loaded with either 10 μl of TPase (Sigma), 250 nmol of KIN59, or 10 μl of TPase with 250 nmol of KIN59. CAMs were examined daily until day 12 and photographed in ovo with a stereomicroscope equipped with a camera system (Olympus Italia, Milan, Italy). On day 12, blood vessels, entering the sponges within the focal plane of the CAM, were counted by two observers in a double-blind fashion at 50× magnification. The mean values ± standard deviation (S.D.) for vessel counts were determined for each analysis. CAMs were then fixed in ovo in Bouin's fluid, dehydrated in graded ethanol, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned at 7 μm according to a plane parallel to their free surface, and stained with a 0.5% aqueous solution of toluidine blue (Merck). For microscopic quantification of the angiogenic response, a planimetric method of point counting was used, as previously described (24Ribatti D. Gualandris A. Bastaki M. Vacca A. Iurlaro M. Roncali L. Presta M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Inhibitory Effect of KIN59 and Related Compounds against Purified E. coli and Human Recombinant TPase—The inhibitory activity of KIN59 and KIN56 against TPase was evaluated in the presence of 100 μm dThd as the natural substrate. The TPase-catalyzed conversion of dThd to Thy was inhibited by KIN59 at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 44 ± 3 and 67 ± 20 μm, respectively, when purified E. coli and human TPase were used as the enzyme source. The IC50 values for the closely related compound KIN56 were 232 ± 28 and 351 ± 27 μm, respectively, that is at 5-fold higher concentrations than required for KIN59. To reveal whether KIN59 inhibits the E. coli and human TPases in a reversible or irreversible manner, KIN59 was added at fixed concentrations of 150, 100, and 50 μm to duplo-dilutions of TPase. Should the compound act as an irreversible inhibitor of TPase, equimolar drug concentrations would completely annihilate the enzymatic activity, whereas lower enzyme concentrations would be fully inactivated by KIN59, resulting in an inhibition line parallel with the control enzyme activity curve in the absence of inhibitor. If the inhibition of TPase by KIN59 is reversible, both the inhibition line and the control enzyme activity curve should converge on the intersection (zero) point of the abscissa/ordinate graph. As evident from Fig. 2, the latter kinetics was obtained. Thus, KIN59 behaved as a reversible inhibitor against both E. coli and human TPases. The kinetic parameters, including the Ki values and the nature of TPase inhibition by KIN59, were also determined in the presence of varying concentrations of dThd (at saturating concentrations of potassium phosphate) and in the presence of varying concentrations of potassium phosphate (at saturating concentrations of dThd) (Fig. 3). KIN59 emerged as a potent inhibitor of E. coli TPase with Ki values of 39 μm against dThd and 146 μm against phosphate, resulting in Ki/Km values of 0.039 and 0.10, respectively. Surprisingly, the compound inhibited the enzyme reaction in a noncompetitive fashion both with respect to dThd and to phosphate (Fig. 3). This means that KIN59 does not bind to either the dThd or phosphate-binding sites of the enzyme. A similar noncompetitive interaction was observed between human TPase and KIN59 (data not shown).Fig. 3Lineweaver-Burk plots of E. coli TPase inhibition by KIN59, in the presence of variable concentrations of dThd (upper panel) and phosphate (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Inhibition of Angiogenesis in the CAM Assay—The kinetic results obtained for KIN59 against TPase indicate that this compound might interact with a yet unidentified site in the enzyme, different from the dThd- and Pi-binding sites. To evaluate whether the interaction of KIN59 with TPase is sufficient to abrogate the angiogenic activity of TPase, we studied the effect of KIN59 (and its structurally related adenosine derivative KIN56) on TPase-induced neovascularization in the CAM assay (Figs. 4 and 5). We previously showed that 10 units of a commercial batch of pure E. coli TPase significantly stimulates the formation of new blood vessels on the CAM of fertilized chicken eggs (19Liekens S. Bilsen F. De Clercq E. Priego E.M. Camarasa M.J. Perez-Perez M.J. Balzarini J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After 2 days of exposure to TPase, allantoic vessels developed radially toward the stimulus in a “spoked wheel” pattern (Fig. 4, compare A with B). The effect of TPase on the CAM has also been quantified (Fig. 5A) with an average stimulation of 44 ± 10% as compared with control CAMs (p < 0.001). The addition of TPase + 250 nmol of KIN59 resulted in a complete inhibition of TPase-induced angiogenesis (Fig. 4, C and D). Indeed, KIN59 not only annihilated the stimulatory effect of TPase, it also efficiently inhibited the formation of normal CAM vessels in the absence of exogenously added TPase (i.e. normal blood vessel development that occurs between day 9 and 11) (Fig. 5A). Thus, only big veins (that were already present at day 9 when the compounds were added) were visible after microscopic evaluation of the CAM at day 11 (i.e. 44% stimulation by TPase versus 89% inhibition by TPase in the presence of KIN59) (Fig. 5A). No signs of toxicity or inflammation could be observed at and immediately around the site of drug exposure. At 100 nmol, KIN59 inhibited angiogenesis in the CAM by 32 ± 13% (Fig. 5A). A significant inhibitory effect of TPase-induced angiogenesis was still noted at 50 nmol/disc of KIN59, i.e. 24% inhibition versus 44% stimulation for TPase alone (p < 0.001). Only at 10 nmol/disc, there was no significant inhibition of TPase-induced neovascularization by KIN59 (+26% ± 9; not significant) (Fig. 5A). It should be noted that inosine did not inhibit the enzymatic activity of TPase nor TPase-induced neovascularization in the CAM assay. These results indicate that the presence of the trityl group at the 5′-position of inosine is required for the anti-TPase and anti-angiogenic activity of KIN59 (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Inhibition of TPase-induced angiogenesis in the CAM assay by KIN59. At day 9 of incubation, discs containing either TPase or TPase plus test compound were applied onto the CAM. At day 11, the percentage of stimulation (positive values) or inhibition (negative values) of blood vessel formation was determined (see “Experimental Procedures”). The effect of different amounts of KIN59 on TPase-induced angiogenesis is shown in A. B, change in vascular density of CAM in the presence of 250 nmol of various test compounds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Therefore, we evaluated the activity of another 5′-O-tritylated purine nucleoside, KIN56 (5′-O-4,4′-dimethoxytrityl-2′-deoxyadenosine), in the CAM assay (Fig. 5B). KIN56, at 250 nmol, was able to cause a complete inhibition of capillary formation, i.e. 53% of the treated CAMs (TPase + KIN56) were avascular. However, the remaining 47% of the CAMs showed inflammation and were characterized by many disorganized vessels. In these cases, blood vessel formation could not be reliably scored, because of the inflammation. Also here, the free nucleoside, 2′-deoxyadenosine, at a concentration of 250 nmol/disc, did not inhibit TPase-induced angiogenesis, confirming the importance of the 5′-O-trityl group for the anti-angiogenic activity of these nucleoside analogues (data not shown). The multisubstrate analogue inhibitor TP65, which is equally as potent as KIN59 in inhibiting the enzymatic activity of TPase, was included as a reference compound (19Liekens S. Bilsen F. De Clercq E. Priego E.M. Camarasa M.J. Perez-Perez M.J. Balzarini J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TP65 afforded, at 250 nmol/disc, a complete inhibition of the typical radial pattern of blood vessels, induced by exogenously added TPase, without affecting normal angiogenesis (Fig. 5B). Histological Analysis of TPase-induced Neovascularization in the CAM Assay—Several variants of the CAM assay have been described. The method used above is reliable and quantitative but does not distinguish at day 11 between newly formed vessels and tho"
https://openalex.org/W2048997084,"Dynamin is a GTP-binding protein whose oligomerization-dependent assembly around the necks of lipid vesicles mediates their scission from parent membranes. Dynamin is thus directly involved in the regulation of endocytosis. Sumoylation is a post-translational protein modification whereby the ubiquitin-like modifier Sumo is covalently attached to lysine residues on target proteins by a process requiring the concerted action of an activating enzyme (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), a conjugating enzyme (ubiquitin carrier protein), and a ligating enzyme (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase). Here, we show that dynamin interacts with Sumo-1, Ubc9, and PIAS-1, all of which are members of the sumoylation machinery. Ubc9 and PIAS-1 are known ubiquitin carrier protein and ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase enzymes, respectively, for the process of sumoylation. We have identified the coiled-coil GTPase effector domain (GED) of dynamin as the site on dynamin that interacts with Sumo-1, Ubc9, and PIAS-1. Although we saw no evidence of covalent Sumo-1 attachment to dynamin, Sumo-1 and Ubc9 are shown here to inhibit the lipid-dependent oligomerization of dynamin. Expression of Sumo-1 and Ubc9 in mammalian cells down-regulated the dynamin-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, whereas dynamin-independent fluid-phase uptake was not affected. Furthermore, using high resolution NMR spectroscopy, we have identified amino acid residues on Sumo-1 that directly interact with the GED of dynamin. The results suggest that the GED of dynamin may serve as a scaffold that concentrates the sumoylation machinery in the vicinity of potential acceptor proteins.

The results suggest that the GED of dynamin may serve as a scaffold that concentrates the sumoylation machinery in the vicinity of potential acceptor proteins. The protein dynamin is an important component of the endocytic machinery in cells (1Praefcke G.J.K. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5 (G. J. K.): 133-147Google Scholar, 2Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Google Scholar). Dynamin isoforms are thought to mediate their functions by virtue of their ability to aid in the scission of vesicles from membranes (3McNiven M.A. Cao H. Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 115-120Google Scholar). Mammalian dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 have been shown to have a role in the scission of clathrin-coated vesicles and in the budding of caveolae (4Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Google Scholar). The dynamin family can be considered to include classical dynamins as well as the dynamin-like mitochondrial division proteins Dnm1, Mgm1, and Fzo1 and the interferon-inducible Mx and guanylate-binding proteins, which have been shown to possess antiviral activities (5Haller O. Kochs G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 710-717Google Scholar). The yeast Vps1 and plant ARC5 and ADL proteins also belong to this family of GTP-binding proteins (6van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Google Scholar). True dynamins are modular proteins characterized by the presence of an N-terminal GTP-binding domain, a contiguous “middle domain” of ill defined function, and a lipid-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; PRD, prolinerich domain; GED, GTPase effector domain; SH3, Src homology 3; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; SD, synthetic dropout; oNPG, o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PH, pleckstrin homology; PRD, prolinerich domain; GED, GTPase effector domain; SH3, Src homology 3; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; SD, synthetic dropout; oNPG, o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. domain, followed by a coiled-coil “assembly” domain and a proline-rich domain (PRD). Other dynamin-like proteins, e.g. Mx, lack the pleckstrin homology and proline-rich domains. The GTPase domain is the most highly conserved domain within members of the dynamin family. The coiled-coil assembly domain has been shown to mediate the assembly of dynamin into oligomers (7Okamoto P.M. Tripet B. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10277-10286Google Scholar) and has also been shown to possess an assembly-stimulated GTPase-accelerating property for the GTPase domain. The oligomerization of dynamin is critical for its function in mediating the process of endocytosis (8Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Google Scholar). Dynamin-mediated endocytosis is critical for synaptic vesicle recycling in the central nervous system and for cell-surface receptor endocytosis in all cells of an organism. GTP-bound dynamin is thought to assemble in the form of rings around the necks of budding vesicles; a conformational change in the dynamin collar is currently thought to aid the scission of the vesicle from the parent membrane. Dynamin may be considered to catalyze this change either by recruiting effector enzymes like endophilin (9Schmidt A. Wolde M. Thiele C. Fest W. Kratzin H. Podtelejnikov A.V. Witke W. Huttner W.B. Soling H.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 133-141Google Scholar, 10Song B.D. Schmid S.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1369-1376Google Scholar) that have lipid-modifying activity or by an intrinsic mechanochemical function (11Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Google Scholar). Whatever the exact mode of dynamin function in the facilitation of endocytic vesicle scission, it is clear that the assembly and GTP-binding properties of dynamin are critical to the process of endocytosis in vivo.Dynamin mediates endocytosis in concert with various other molecules, viz. amphiphysin, endophilin, etc. Almost all the currently identified dynamin-interacting molecules engage the C-terminal PRD of dynamin. The other domains of dynamin are also known to participate in dynamin function by mediating intramolecular interactions within the dynamin molecule and/or intermolecular interactions within dynamin homo-oligomers. The middle domain has been shown to interact with the coiled-coil GTPase effector domain (GED) of dynamin (12Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Newman-Smith E.D. Pishvaee B. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14942-14947Google Scholar). The GED is also known to interact with the N-terminal GTP-binding domain of dynamin (13Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Google Scholar) and to act as an internal GTPase-activating factor for dynamin. In addition, the GED is thought to interact with the GED of other dynamin molecules, aiding oligomerization of dynamin (8Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Google Scholar). The PH domain of dynamin interacts with phosphatidylinositol lipids, thereby targeting dynamin to the plasma membrane (14Vallis Y. Wigge P. Marks B. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 257-260Google Scholar), and may also interact with the βγ-subunit complex of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (15Lin H.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27979-27982Google Scholar). Additionally, the function of dynamin is potentially regulated by phosphorylation by multiple kinases (16Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 701-710Google Scholar). The PRD of dynamin contains many sites that engage SH3 domains. The SH3 domains of the tyrosine kinase pp60c-src, amphiphysin, endophilin, Grb2, intersectin, Abp1, syndapin, mixed lineage kinase, p85, phospholipase Cγ, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase are known to interact with the PRD of dynamin (17Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Google Scholar). Additional non-SH3 interactors of dynamin are α-adaptin (18Wang L.H. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Google Scholar) and nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (19Baillat G. Gaillard S. Castets F. Monneron A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18961-18966Google Scholar). Recently, auxilin and Hsc70 have been identified as the first non-PRD interactors of dynamin (20Newmyer S.L. Christensen A. Sever S. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 929-940Google Scholar).This study was designed to uncover hitherto unidentified interactors of dynamin using yeast two-hybrid analysis (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar). We biased our search by using dynamin lacking the C-terminal PRD (dynaminΔPRD) as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. A human brain cDNA library was used to screen for interactors of dynaminΔPRD. This has led to the identification of several putative interactors of dynamin. Here, we characterize the interaction of dynamin with members of the sumoylation cascade. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification mechanistically similar to ubiquitination. Sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) is a 101-amino acid protein that has the potential (like ubiquitin) to covalently attach to lysine side chains in target molecules (22Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Google Scholar, 23Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Google Scholar, 24Melchior F. Schergaut M. Pichler A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 612-618Google Scholar, 25Mueller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Google Scholar). This covalent attachment of Sumo is mediated by a cascade of enzymes known as the E1 (activating), E2 (conjugating), and E3 (ligating) enzymes. The 101-amino acid Sumo polypeptide is proteolytically processed by a C-terminal hydrolase to a 97-amino acid moiety ending in a diglycine motif. This mature form of Sumo forms a thiol ester linkage with a cysteine residue in the activating E1 enzyme (the SAE1/2 heterodimer in humans) and is subsequently transferred to the E2 enzyme (Ubc9) to form another thiol ester linkage. The activated Sumo is ultimately attached to an available lysine residue in an acceptor polypeptide through the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine residue of Sumo and an ϵ-amino group of the lysine. This last step often requires the participation of E3 ligases, three of which PIAS (protein inactivator of activated STAT proteins), RanBP2, and Pc2 are currently known to participate in the process of sumoylation (26Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Google Scholar).Several proteins that are not known to be sumoylated are known to interact with Sumo. There are reports of noncovalent interaction of the nucleocapsid proteins of the Tula and Hantaan hantaviruses with Sumo-1 (27Kaukinen P. Vaheri A. Plyusnin A. Virus Res. 2003; 92: 37-45Google Scholar, 28Maeda A. Lee B.H. Yoshimatsu K. Saijo M. Kurane I. Arikawa J. Morikawa S. Virology. 2003; 305: 288-297Google Scholar). Also, noncovalent association of Sumo-1 with the Rad51 and Rad52 proteins has been shown to have a regulatory role in homologous recombination in mammalian cells (29Li W. Hesabi B. Babbo A. Pacione C. Liu J. Chen D.J. Nickoloff J.A. Shen Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1145-1153Google Scholar).In this study, we show that the endocytic protein dynamin interacts noncovalently with members of the sumoylation machinery and that this interaction inhibits the oligomerization of dynamin. Consistent with this effect, we found that overexpression of Sumo in mammalian cells abrogates dynamin-dependent endocytosis. We have narrowed down the region of interaction with the sumoylation machinery to be the GED of dynamin and, by high resolution structural mapping using NMR, identified the amino acid residues on Sumo-1 responsible for the interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of Bait—Amino acids 1–753 of human dynamin-1 were PCR-amplified from pTM1-hDyn1 (provided by Dr. Alexander van der Bliek, UCLA) using primers 5′-CCCGAATTCATGGGCAACCGCGGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGAAGCTTGGGCGTGCTGACGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into the pBS-SK vector between the EcoRI and HindIII sites. From here, the dynamin-1ΔPRD cDNA was excised using EcoRI and SalI and subcloned into the pLexA yeast expression vector (Clontech). The construct was confirmed by multiple restriction digests and DNA sequencing. This clone was used for screening a human brain cDNA library cloned into the pB42AD vector (Clontech). Other control plasmids and the host yeast strain were also provided in the Matchmaker yeast two-hybrid kit procured from Clontech.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The yeast strain supplied with the kit and used in this study is EGY48 (MATα, his3, trp1, ura3, LexAop(x6)-LEU2), a reporter host strain carrying a wild-type LEU2 gene under the control of LexA operators. Yeast cells were grown or maintained in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose) or synthetic dropout (SD) medium lacking the appropriate nutrients to maintain the selection. Yeast cells were transformed using the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method as described (30Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar). First, EGY48 cells were transformed with the p8oplacZ plasmid (β-galactosidase reporter plasmid), and the transformants were maintained on SD/Glu/Ura– plates. For transformation of the bait plasmid, EGY48(p8oplacZ) colonies were grown in SD/Glu/Ura– medium and subcultured later in YPD medium. Using the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method, competent cells were made and transformed with 1 μg of pLexA-hDyn1ΔPRD and 60 μg of salmon sperm DNA. These transformants were selected and maintained on SD/Glu/Ura–/His– plates. For library screening, the target plasmid library was sequentially transformed into EGY48-(p8oplacZ+pLexA-hDyn1ΔPRD). Library DNA corresponding to 3 × 106 colony-forming units was transformed, and positive clones were screened on SD/Gal/raffinose/Ura–/His–/Trp–/Leu– plates. The positive clones obtained were further narrowed in number by control transformations, and final clones were examined for lacZ reporter gene expression using a colony lift filter assay.Isolation and Characterization of Positive Clones—Plasmid DNA was extracted from yeast cells using glass beads, and positive clones in the pB42AD vector were rescued by transforming the DNA into Escherichia coli strain KC8. (This strain has a defect in trpC, which can be complemented by the TRP1 gene in pB42AD.) Clones thus obtained were sequenced for their identity and re-tested in yeast two-hybrid assays for interaction with the human dynamin-1ΔPRD bait plasmid. Using NCBI BLAST, the identity of each clone was assigned. The screen yielded full-length Sumo-1 and PIAS-1-(396–651) cloned into the pB42AD plasmid. The cDNA for Ubc9 (obtained from Prof. Ronald T. Hay, University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, Scotland) was amplified using primers 5′-CCCGAATTCATGTCGGGGATCGC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATGAGGGCGCAAACTTCTTGG-3′ and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI-cut pB42AD yeast expression vector.o-Nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (oNPG) Assay—The strength of protein-protein interactions observed in yeast cells was quantitated by oNPG assays as described below. 5 ml of cultures for yeast cotransformants were grown overnight in SD medium + 2% glucose, subcultured in 3 ml of SD medium + 2% galactose and 1% raffinose with 5% inoculum, and allowed to grow at 30 °C for 8–10 h. oNPG assays were performed in the A600 nm ∼ 0.5–1.0 range following the Clontech protocol. Briefly, cells were pelleted and washed with 1.5 ml of Z buffer (16.1 g/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, 5.5 g/liter NaH2PO4·H2O, 0.75 g/liter KCl, 0.246 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, pH 7.0) and later resuspended in 300 μl of Z buffer. 100 μl of resuspended cells were aliquoted in fresh tubes and subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. To these tubes were added 700 μl of Z buffer + 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol and 160 μl of oNPG (4 mg/ml), followed by incubation at 30 °C for color development. 400 μl of 1 m Na2CO3 were added to stop the reaction. Color development in the supernatant was measured at A420 nm after centrifuging the tubes at full speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min.Interaction of Dynamin with Sumo-1, Ubc9, and PIAS-1—The cDNA for Sumo-1 flanked by BamHI and XhoI sites was amplified and ligated into the pGEXKG vector. This was used to express GST-Sumo-1 in bacteria. GST-PIAS-(396–651) was expressed in bacteria from pGEX-4T1 into which amino acids 396–651 of PIAS-1 amplified from pB42AD-PIAS with flanking EcoRI and XhoI sites had been ligated. The plasmid pGEX-2T-hUbc9 expressing GST-Ubc9 was a kind gift of Prof. Ronald T. Hay. For pull-down assays, GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences); the beads were then incubated with bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml) to block unreacted sites on the beads. Rat brain lysate was prepared by homogenizing 0.3–0.5 g of rat brain tissue in 2.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors in a Dounce homogenizer and spinning the suspension at 20,800 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant thus obtained was used as rat brain lysate. In a typical pull-down reaction, ∼20 μg of recombinant protein-coated beads were incubated with 200–300 μl of rat brain lysate for 30 min with end-overend rotation at 4 °C. Beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100; boiled in 5× Laemmli buffer; and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was processed for Western transfer, and the membranes were probed with anti-dynamin-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).GTP Hydrolysis Assays—GTP hydrolysis by dynamin was assessed using [γ-32P]GTP. Dynamin from rat brain was purified by virtue of its affinity for the SH3 domain of amphiphysin by the method of Stowell et al. (11Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Google Scholar). For assembly-stimulated GTPase assays, 0.2 μm dynamin in TMND buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was incubated with 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (Serva Feinbiochemica, Heidelberg, Germany) for 30 min on ice. Various amounts of Sumo-1 or Ubc9 were then added to the mixture, which was further incubated for 30 min on ice. GTP hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of 200 μm GTP (containing [γ-32P]GTP) and allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. The total reaction volume was 75–100 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 600 μl of acidified 7% charcoal slurry, and the extent of GTP hydrolysis was measured by counting Pi release in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Incubation of dynamin with Sumo-1 or Ubc9 before the addition of phosphatidylserine showed the same results.Oligomerization Assays—Oligomerization of Dynamin was assessed by the sedimentation assay (31Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Google Scholar). Dynamin, phosphatidylserine, and either Sumo-1 or Ubc9 were incubated as described above in TMND buffer. The reactions (total volume of 150 μl) were then centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Ti-42.2 rotor at 4 °C. The supernatants were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the total protein from the supernatant and pellet fractions was then visualized by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The Sumo-1 and Ubc9 proteins used in the oligomerization and GTPase assays were expressed in E. coli as hexahistidine-tagged proteins expressed from the pQE32 (QIAGEN Inc.) and pET28a(+) (Novagen) vectors, respectively.Expression of Sumo-1 and Ubc9 in Mammalian Cells—The cDNA for Sumo-1 was PCR-amplified with BamHI and XhoI ends and ligated into the pcDNA3 vector. The resultant pcDNA3-Sumo-1 clone was digested with SacI to subclone Sumo-1 into the GFP expression vector pEG-FPC1. Ubc9 was amplified with EcoRI and XhoI ends and ligated into the pcDNA3 vector. The resultant pcDNA3-Ubc9 clone was digested with EcoRI and XhoI to subclone Ubc9 into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pEGFPC2 vector to yield GFP-Ubc9. For rescue experiments, a pcDNA3 construct of full-length rat dynamin-1 (a gift of Dr. Pietro de Camilli, Yale University) was used. pcDNA3-c-Myc was prepared by inserting a linker encoding the c-Myc epitope into the HindIII and BamHI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. The GED (EcoRI/SalI fragment) was subcloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-c-myc.The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line TRVb-1 (with the hamster transferrin receptor knocked out and stably expressing the human transferrin receptor) (32Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Google Scholar) was maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml Geneticin. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes (with cover-slip bottoms) 36 h before transfection. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) with 1.0 μg of DNA following the manufacturer's instructions. 24–36 h post-transfection, cells were assayed for internalization of fluorescently labeled transferrin or RNase A.Endocytosis Assays—Alexa 568-conjugated transferrin was made up to 10.5 ng/ml in labeling medium (Ham's F-12 medium containing, 0.3 mg/ml NaHCO3, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)). Transfected TRVb-1 cells were incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated transferrin for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then cooled on ice, and the excess label was washed with ice-cold buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). Fluorescent transferrin was removed from its receptor at the cell surface by multiple washes with ice-cold acid rinse buffer containing 25.5 mm citric acid, 24.5 mm trisodium citrate, 280 mm sucrose, and 0.01 mm deferoxamine mesylate (pH 4.0). Cells were fixed at room temperature with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in buffer A for 20 min, rinsed twice with buffer A, and used for imaging.RNase A internalization assays were performed as described (33Haigis M.C. Raines R.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 313-324Google Scholar). Briefly, Alexa 555-conjugated RNase A was made up to 10 μm in labeling medium. Transfected cells were incubated with labeled RNase A for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were cooled on ice, washed twice with ice-cold buffer A, and fixed as described above.Microscopy and Image Processing—Confocal imaging was carried out on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope equipped with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope, factory set dichroics, and lasers. Fluorescence images of cells were recorded under sequential excitation and emission conditions for all probes in a given experiment. All images were processed for background correction, and those of multiple labeled cells for cross-talk correction were processed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA).Deletion Analysis of Dynamin—To generate different domains of dynamin, PCR amplification was performed, and a set of overlapping domains of dynamin was constructed using primer A (5′-CCCGAATTCATGGGCAACCGCGGC-3′), primer B (5′-GTGGAGGAATTCAAGAACTTCCG-3′) primer C (5′-GCAACGAATTCAACAAGAAGAAGACTTCAGG-3′), primer D (5′-CCGGAATTCGCCTCCTTCCTGAGGGCTGG-3′), primer E (5′-CTTCTGTCGACTCTGGTTGCTCC-3′), primer F (5′-GGTCTCGAGGGCTTTCTC-3′), and primer G (5′-GGAATTAGCTTGACTGCAGG-3′) in the indicated combinations: GTPase + middle domain (amino acids 1–505), primers A and E, middle domain (amino acids 313–505), primers B and E; middle domain + PH domain (amino acids 313–636), primers B and F; middle domain + PH domain + GED (amino acids 313–753), primers B and G; PH domain (amino acids 507–636), primers C and F; PH domain + GED (amino acids 507–753), primers C and G; and GED (amino acids 618–753), primers D and G. The PCR products were purified and digested with EcoRI/XhoI or Eco-RI/SalI and ligated into compatible ends of the pLexA yeast expression vector.NMR Spectroscopy—For NMR studies, labeled proteins were prepared from E. coli BL21 cells harboring the GST-Sumo-1 expression clone grown in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and 13C-labeled glucose. The culture was induced for protein expression at A600 nm ∼ 0.6 with 100 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 20 h at 28 °C. The harvested culture was lysed in TEND buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing lysozyme and protease inhibitors. The lysed cells were sonicated and spun at 100,000 × g for 45 min to obtain a clear supernatant. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h to allow binding of overexpressed recombinant protein. The beads were then washed, and protein was eluted from the column using 20 mm reduced glutathione in TEND buffer (pH 8.0). Protein was dialyzed overnight to remove free glutathione and then subjected to digestion by thrombin to clip off the GST tag. Pure Sumo-1 was obtained by repeatedly passing the digest on the glutathione-Sepharose column.For NMR experiments, singly labeled (15N) and doubly labeled (13C and 15N) Sumo-1 proteins were prepared as described above. The purity and monomeric or oligomeric state of the protein and the homogeneity of the sample were tested by SDS-PAGE analysis and capillary electrophoresis. The proteins were concentrated to ∼1 mm and exchanged with TEND buffer (pH 7.4) by ultrafiltration using a 3-kDa cutoff membrane. The final volume of the sample was ∼550 μl and contained 10% (v/v) D2O. Using these proteins, different NMR experiments, viz. two-dimensional 15N HSQC and NOESY and three-dimensional HNN and HN(C)N (34Panchal S.C. Bhavesh N.S. Hosur R.V. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 135-147Google Scholar, 35Bhavesh N.S. Panchal S.C. Hosur R.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14727-14735Google Scholar), NOESY-HSQC (36Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gorenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6150-6156Google Scholar), total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC (37Grzesick S. Bax A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Google Scholar), CBCANH (38Grzesick S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 201-207Google Scholar), CBCACONH (39Grzesick S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Google Scholar), and HNCO (40Kay L.E. Ikura M. Tscudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 89: 496-514Google Scholar), were recorded on a Varian 600-MHz NMR spectrometer at 27 °C for resonance assignment and structure determination.For NMR characterization of the Sumo-GED interaction, 1:1 and 1:2 complexes of Sumo-1 (15N-labeled) with unlabeled GED were prepared by adding unlabeled GED in small aliquots to a sample of ∼1 mm Sumo-1. Two-dimensional HSQC spectra were recorded for both the complexes and were superimposable. This indicated that the interaction was tight on the NMR time scale and stoichiometric; and hence, no further addition of GED was required.RESULTSIdentification of the Members of the Sumoylation Cascade as Interactors of Dynamin—To identify new interactors of the 100-kDa GTP-binding protein dynamin, a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out. Since most known interactors of dynamin so far characterized have been identified to interact with the C-terminal PRD of dynamin, we biased our search by using truncated dynamin-1 (lacking the C-terminal PRD) as bait in the screen. A human brain cDNA library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid technique to search for interactors of truncated dynamin (referred to as dynaminΔPRD). The screen identified many potential interactors. Two of the clones isolated from the screen encoded full-length Sumo-1,"

Herein, we report that the human SHP promoter (hSHP) is activated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), which regulates the expression of various genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Overexpression of SREBP-1 activated the human but not mouse SHP promoter, although SREBP-2 had little effect on the SHP promoter in CV-1 cells. Serial deletion reporter assays revealed that SREBP-1-responsive region is located within the sequences from –243 to –120 bp in the hSHP promoter. DNase I footprinting, gel shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SREBP-1 binds directly to the hSHP promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis made it clear that the hSHP promoter activation by SREBP-1 is mostly mediated by the SRE1 (–186 to –195 bp) in the hSHP promoter, which is not conserved in the mouse SHP promoter. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SREBP-1c/ADD-1 induced SHP mRNA expression and repressed CYP7A1 expression in HepG2 cells. Finally, we found that a four-nucleotide deletion (–195CT-GAdel) in the hSHP promoter, which is reported to be associated with altered body weight and insulin secretion in human, coincides with the SRE1. This mutation strongly decreased both basal and SREBP-1 dependent activities of the hSHP promoter, because of the reduced binding of SREBP-1 to the mutated SRE1. Overall, our results demonstrate a differential regulation of human and mouse SHP promoters by SREBP-1. We propose a possible role of SREBP-1 in the species differential regulation of cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis via a novel mechanism of up-regulation of the hSHP gene expression.

The very broad range of receptors sensitive to inhibition by SHP suggests a central role for SHP in modulation of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Although the mechanisms underlying this repressor function remain unclear, recent results demonstrate that SHP can compete with coactivators for binding to the AF-2 surface (7Lee Y.K. Dell H.

In addition, a direct transcriptional repression domain contributes significantly to the inhibitory function of SHP. SHP is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including heart, brain, liver, spleen, adrenal gland, small intestine, and pancreas (2Borgius L.J. Steffensen K.R. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol.

The farnesoid X receptor-mediated SHP gene induction has been shown to inhibit the activity of orphan nuclear receptor liver receptor homologue 1, a positive regulator of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene expression, which is a rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid biosynthesis. LXRα, which is activated by metabolites of cholesterol, has been shown to activate the mouse and rat but not human CYP7A1 gene promoters by direct binding to conserved LXR response element, was lacking in human CYP7A1 promoter (19Peet D.J.

Kemper J.K. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which in turn represses CYP7A1 gene expression. This report gives another example of the interspecies difference in the regulation of CYP7A1 gene expression. However, loss-of-function studies of SHP demonstrated that redundant pathways independent of the SHP-mediated pathway are implicated in the negative feedback regulation of bile acid production (23Kerr T.A.

In addition, it was reported previously that mutations in the coding region of SHP gene are associated with mild hyperinsulinemia, moderate obesity, and decreased insulin sensitivity in human (12Nishigori H.

However, a recent report has shown that genetic variations in the SHP gene are unlikely to be predisposed to diabetes, obesity, or increased birth weight (25Mitchell S.M. Weedon M.N. Owen K.R. Shields B. Wilkins-Wall B. Walker M. McCarthy M.I. Frayling T.M. Hattersley A.T. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, it is reported that homozygous mutation (–195CTGAdel) in the SHP gene promoter may be associated with lower birth weight and insulin secretion in human (26Hung C.C. Farooqi I.S. Ong K.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of membrane-bound transcription factors that regulate cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis (27Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar, 28Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). In mammals, three SREBP isoforms have been identified that are designated SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c/ADD1, and SREBP-2. SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c/ADD1 are derived from the same gene by virtue of alternative splicing of the first exon (27Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a has a longer transcription-activating domain and is a more potent transcriptional activator than SREBP-1c in cultured cells and liver (29Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Nascent SREBPs reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope as precursor forms (27Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). The transcriptionally active amino-terminal segments (mature forms) are released from the precursor SREBPs by a sequential two-step cleavage process. Once cleaved, the mature forms translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoters of target genes. SREBPs regulate the transcription of many genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, such as low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase, squalene synthase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and ATP citrate-lyase (30Wang X.

SREBP-1 preferentially activates the genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (36Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) and SREBP-2 activates genes involved in cholesterol synthesis (37Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the reports that the SREBP-1c promoter is a direct target for regulation by LXR/retinoid X receptor heterodimers provided a straightforward explanation for the ability of LXR ligands to induce hepatic lipogenesis (38Schultz J.R.

Efficient transcriptional activation by SREBPs is dependent on additional transcription factors such as nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) and Sp1 (41Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Most SREBP target genes require NF-Y binding to adjacent CCAAT motifs, which are usually located within 21 bp of the SRE (43Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In vitro studies initially demonstrated that the binding of NF-Y to DNA enhanced the binding affinity of SREBP to adjacent SREs (31Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24359-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), presumably as a result of direct interaction of the two proteins (34Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Study of the LDL receptor promoter demonstrated that Sp1 also interacts with SREBP to form a more stable DNA-protein complex (42Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

In this study, we demonstrate that SREBP-1, but not SREBP-2, stimulates the hSHP promoter through its binding to SRE1, which is located in the region from –186 to –195 bp in the hSHP promoter but is not conserved in the mouse SHP promoter. We also found that a naturally occurring mutation (–195CT-GAdel) in the hSHP promoter, corresponding to SRE1 mutation, results in the complete loss of activation by SREBP-1 because of the reduced binding of SREBP-1 to the altered SRE1. In addition, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SREBP-1c/ADD1 repressed CYP7A1 expression by induction of SHP expression in HepG2 cells. Our results suggest that SREBP-1 can be involved in the species differential regulation of CYP7A1 gene expression via direct stimulation of the hSHP promoter. Plasmids and DNA Construction—SREBP expression plasmids pCSA10, pCMVhSREBP-1c 436, pCS2, and p5xSRE-tk/Luc were described previously (35Moon Y.A. Lee J.J. Park S.W. Ahn Y.H. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30280-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the cDNA encoding SREBP-1c/ADD1–403 for adenovirus recombinant was described previously (45Seo J.B.

The wild-type and mutant reporter plasmids of the hSHP promoter were cloned into the pGL2-basic plasmid (Promega) using restriction enzymes and specific primers. Wild-type and serial deletion constructs were made by fusing various length of 5′-flanking sequences of the hSHP promoter to the luciferase gene at +30 (–2.2 kb/Luc, –574 bp/Luc, –355 bp/Luc, –243 bp/Luc, and –120 bp/Luc). Mutant reporters mE-box/Luc, mSRE1/Luc, mSRE2/Luc, mSRE1,2/Luc, mCCAAT/Luc, and mSp1/Luc were constructed by introducing site-directed mutagenesis into the hSHP promoter –355 bp/Luc using the primers. –195CTGAdel/Luc was made from the –574 bp/Luc by using primers. The mutated sequences are shown in Figs. 4A and 7A. SRE1 multi-copy reporters, hSHP(SRE1)x2, hSHP(SRE1)x3, and hSHP(SRE1)x4/Luc were constructed by inserting 2, 3, and 4 copies, respectively, of SRE1 fragments into the XhoI-digested pGL2-promoter plasmid (Promega). The primers used to construct SRE1 multi-copy reporters were as follows: 5′-TCGAGACTGAGGTGATATCAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTGATATCAC CTCAGTC-3′. SRE1-CCAAT/Luc, SRE1/Luc, and CCAAT/Luc reporters were constructed by inserting a single copy of double-stranded oligonucleotides into the XmaI- and XhoI-digested pGL2-promoter plasmid. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: SRE1-CCAAT, 5′-CCGGGACTGAGGTGATATCACAGCTGCCCAATGCCC-3′; SRE1, 5′-CCGGGACTGAGGTGATATCAC-3′; and CCAAT, 5′-CCGGGCCCAATGCCC-3′. pcDNA3/HA-ADD1 was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment encoding the N terminus (403 amino acids) of SREBP-1c/ADD1 into EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pcDNA3/HA vector.Fig. 7Naturally occurring mutation in SRE1 drastically reduced the hSHP promoter activity and DNA binding affinity by SREBP-1.A, naturally occurring mutation (–195CTGAdel) in the hSHP promoter abolished the SREBP-1 dependent activation of the hSHP promoter. HepG2 cells were transfected with 200 ng of wild type (–574bp/Luc) or mutant type (–195CTGAdel/Luc) hSHP promoter reporter together with 100 ng of expression plasmids encoding SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, SREBP2, or empty vector. Approximately 40 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized against β-galactosidase activity. B, the oligonucleotide sequences of wild-type (nucleotides –203 to –163 containing SRE1 and SRE2) and mutant (–195CTGAdel) probes used for the gel retardation assay. C, naturally occurring mutation in the hSHP promoter markedly diminished the binding ability of SREBP-1 to DNA. 32P-labeled wild type (–203 to –163, lanes 1–6) and –195CT-GAdel (lanes 7–12) probes were combined with 1 to 4 μl of SREBP-1a proteins prepared by in vitro translation system as indicated. The total amounts of proteins used in the reactions were adjusted to 4 μl by adding unprogrammed lysates, except for lanes 1 and 7. D, for unlabeled competition assays, 10-, 50-, and 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides (WT, –195CTGAdel, and LDLR-SRE) were added to the reaction containing 32Plabeled wild type SRE1 and in vitro translated SREBP-1a (2 μl), as competitors. DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Preparation of Recombinant Adenovirus—The recombinant adenovirus was prepared as described previously (46Choi Y.K. Kim Y.J. Park H.S. Choi K. Paik S.G. Lee Y.I. Park J.G. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, the cDNA encoding SREBP-1c/ADD1–403 was cloned into pAd-YC2 shuttle vector, which is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and contains bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal sequence. For homologous recombination, pAd-YC2 shuttle vector (5 μg) and a rescue vector, pJM17 (5 μg), were cotransfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. To purify pure plaques, cell culture supernatant was serially diluted in serum-free media and incubated with 293 cells at 37 °C for 1 h. An equal volume mixture of 2× medium and 1% agarose was overlaid on 293 cells. After 7 days, plaques that were well isolated were further purified and propagated in 293 cells and screened by PCR using upstream primers derived from the cytomegalovirus promoter and downstream primers from the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. Then, the recombinants were amplified in 293 cells and were purified and isolated using CsCl2 (Sigma). The preparations were collected and desalted, and titers were determined by the measurement of plaque counts. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assay—HepG2 and CV-1 cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, MD) and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Cells were split onto 24-well plates at densities of 2–8 × 104 cells/well the day before transfection. Transient transfection assays were performed using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of various reporters together with 0.2 μg of the SREBP expression vectors pCSA10, pCMVhSREBP-1c 436, and pCS2. Total DNA used in each transfection was adjusted to 1 μg/well by adding appropriate amount of pcDNA3 empty vectors, and 0.2 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmids were cotransfected as an internal control. Cells were harvested 40–48 h after the transfection for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. The luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity. DNase I Footprinting Assay—DNA fragment covering the region from –355 to –120 bp was labeled in one strand by PCR with a primer set, one of which was labeled with 32P. The sequences of the primers for PCR were 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGGCACCAATGGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCCTGGCAGGAATG-3′. Recombinant SREBP-1 proteins (1, 2, and 4 μg), purified as described in Ref. 35Moon Y.A. Lee J.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30280-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, were incubated with 3 × 105 cpm of labeled probe for 20 min on ice under the condition of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and then 50 μl of diluted DNase I solution (0.002–0.001 units/μl) was added to the DNA-protein binding reactions. After 2 min of digestion at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of stop buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.1 μg/μl glycogen. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellets were dissolved in sequencing gel loading buffer and then resolved on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide/6 m urea gel. The footprints were compared with G + A ladder produced by the chemical cleavage sequencing reaction of the same probe to determine the corresponding nucleotide sequences. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The probes used in gel shift assay cover the region from –203 to –163 bp of the hSHP promoter. Mutated sequences are shown in Figs. 4A and 7A as indicated. Double stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled probes were incubated with 1 μg of purified recombinant SREBP-1a (Fig. 4B) or 1–4 μl of in vitro translated SREBP-1a proteins (Fig. 7, C and D) in 20 μl of each reaction containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 μg of poly (dI-dC), and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. In vitro-translated SREBP-1a proteins were prepared by using a coupled transcription and translation system (TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system; Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For unlabeled competition assays, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the reactions at ∼100-fold molar excess (Fig. 4B) or 10, 50, and 100-fold molar excess (Fig. 7D). After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 250 V for 1 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the polyacrylamide gel was dried and exposed to Fuji HR-G30 X-ray film for 3 h at –70 °C with intensifying screen. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (47Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). In brief, HepG2 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3/HA-SREBP-1c/ADD1 and pcDNA3/HA empty vectors. At 30 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and harvested. For immunoprecipitation, anti-HA antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein A-Sepharose beads CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) were used. The final DNA extractions were amplified by PCR using pairs of primers. The primers used for PCR were as follows: –120/–474 bp, 5′-CCCCTGGCAGGAATG-3′ and 5′-AGGTTAGGCAAACAAGC-3′; and –880/–1200 bp, 5′-CAGCTACTCTAGAGGCTA-3′ and 5′-CATAAAGTAAGAATCTAG-3′. The PCR products were a 354-bp fragment (nucleotides –120 to –474 bp of the hSHP promoter) containing SREBP-1 response region (–243 and –120 bp) and a 320-bp fragment (nucleotides from –880 to –1200, used as a negative control).

Here, we constructed a mutant having D1 in which D1-Ala-344 was replaced with glycine (Gly) in cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The effects of this minimal change in the side group from methyl to hydrogen on the properties of the oxygen-evolving complex were comprehensively investigated using purified core particles. The mutant grew photoautotrophically, and little change was observed in the protein composition of the oxygen-evolving core particles. The Gly-substituted oxygen-evolving complex showed small but normal S2 multiline and enhanced g = 4.1 electron spin resonance signals and S2-state thermoluminescence bands with slightly elevated peak temperature. The Gly substitution resulted in distinct but relatively small changes in a few bands arising from the putative carboxylate ligand for the Mn cluster in the mid-frequency (1800-1000 cm-1) S2/S1 Fourier transform infrared difference spectrum. In contrast, the low frequency (670-350 cm-1) S2/S1 Fourier transform infrared difference spectrum was markedly changed by the substitution.

Two water molecules are oxidized to an oxygen molecule through five intermediates labeled Sn (n = 0-4), where n denotes the number of oxidizing equivalents stored. In a dark-adapted sample, a thermally stable S1 state predominates. The Sn state advances to the Sn+1 state by absorbing each photon to reach the highest oxidation state, S4, which spontaneously relaxes to the lowest oxidation state, S0, concomitant with the release of an oxygen molecule (1Joliot P.

However, the properties of OEC have not been characterized using isolated PS II preparations with the exception of a few mutants.

The PS II core particles isolated from wild-type Synechocystis cells labeled with l-[1-13C]alanine showed that several bands in the mid-frequency S2/S1 FTIR difference spectrum are affected by the labeling (30Chu H.-A. Hiller W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the isotope-affected bands can be ascribed to the α-carboxylate group of D1-Ala-344 as a ligand for the Mn cluster, although an indirect structural coupling between the Mn cluster and D1-Ala-344 cannot be excluded. Ligation of the D1-Ala-344 carboxylate to the Mn cluster was proposed based on the 3.6 Å (17Fromme P. Kern J. Loll B. Biesiadka J. Saenger W. Witt H.T. Krauss N. Zouni A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and 3.7 Å (18Kamiya N. Shen J.-R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) x-ray structural model. The C-terminal carboxylate was arranged in close proximity to a Ca ion in a recent 3.5-Å model in which a cubane-like Mn3CaO4 linked to a fourth Mn by a mono-μ-oxo bridge was proposed, although the C-terminal carboxylate was disordered and not visible in the electron density map (19Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2850) Google Scholar). It may be worthwhile to note in this context that no individual metal ion in the OEC was resolved in any reported x-ray electron density maps. The D1-A344G mutant has been reported to grow photoautotrophically (11Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although the replacement of alanine with glycine is accompanied with only the change of a side group from methyl to hydrogen, the functional and/or structural properties of the Mn cluster may be affected even by this minimal change if the C-terminal free carboxylate is involved in the ligation of the Mn cluster. In the present study, we have constructed D1-Ala-344-stop (= D1-Ser-345stop) and D1-A344G-stop mutants on a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain with histidine-tagged CP47 and have isolated active PS II core particles from them. The replacement of the C-terminal Ala with Gly had little effect on biochemical properties of OEC but led to considerable changes in functional/structural properties of the Mn cluster. These results are compatible with the proposal that the C-terminal α-COO- carboxylate of D1-Ala-344 is crucial for maintaining the intrastructure of the Mn cluster, possibly by ligating the Mn cluster. Construction of a Host Strain for Mutation—The genomic DNA from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was amplified by PCR with a specific primer set corresponding to the psbA1, psbA2, or psbA3 gene. For psbA1, a 1727-bp DNA containing 1080 bp psbA1 plus 414 bp 5′ and 233 bp 3′ flanking DNA was cloned into the plasmid pBluescript II SK+. A 0.45-kb HincII/NsiI fragment containing 40% psbA1 was replaced by a 1.4-kb fragment from the plasmid pACYC184 conferring resistance to chloramphenicol to generate the plasmid pNΔA1. For psbA2, a 1972-bp DNA containing 1053 bp 3′ 97% psbA2 plus 919 bp 3′flanking DNA was cloned into pUC19 to generate the plasmid pNA2. A 0.9-kb HincII/StuI fragment corresponding to 83% psbA2 and a part of its downstream gene, slr1312, was replaced by a 2-kb fragment of the plasmid pRL463 (a kind gift from Prof. T. Omata, Nagoya University) conferring resistance to spectinomycin to generate the pNΔA2 plasmid. For psbA3, a 1691-bp DNA containing 1080 bp psbA3 plus 326 bp 5′ and 285 bp 3′flanking DNA was cloned into the plasmid pUC19. A 0.4-kb KpnI/KpnI fragment was replaced by a 1.7-kb fragment of pACYC184 conferring resistance to tetracycline to generate the plasmid pNΔA3. The plasmids pNA1, pNA2, and pNA3 were successively transformed into the glucose-tolerant wild-type strain of Synechocystis. The resulting strain (NΔAA) was resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and spectinomycin and lacked all three psbA genes. A hexahistidine tag was introduced to the C terminus of CP47 of the wild-type and NΔAA strain as described previously (31Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to generate the wild*-type and B-His/NΔAA strain. The B-His/NΔAA strain was used for further site-directed mutagenesis. Construction of Site-directed Mutants—A 1.3-kb fragment from the plasmid pUC4K conferring resistance to kanamycin (Km) was inserted into the StuI site located 288 bp downstream of the psbA2 gene in pNA2, thus generating the plasmid pNA219. Mutations were introduced into the psbA2 gene in pNA219 using a commercial oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis kit (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). For the Ala-344-stop (= Ser-345stop) strain, the Ser-345 codon TCT was changed to a stop codon TGA. For the A344G-stop strain, the Ala-344 codon GCG and the Ser-345 codon TCT were changed to glycine GGG and the stop codon TGA, respectively. Plasmids bearing the mutations were transformed into the host strain (B-His/NΔAA), and single colonies were selected for their photoautotrophic growth ability on solid BG-11 medium containing 5 μg/ml kanamycin. Culture Conditions and Preparation of PSII Core Particles—The Synechocystis cells were photoheterotrophically grown in liquid BG-11 medium supplemented with 5 mm glucose at 30 °C under 30-50 μmol photons/m2/s in an 8-liter Clearboy (NALGENE), bubbling with air up to 7-8 μg of Chl/ml unless otherwise noted. The PS II core particles were prepared as previously described (31Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the harvested cells were disrupted using a Bead beater (Bio-Spec Products). The resulting thylakoid membranes were solubilized using n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and then the PS II particles were affinity purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Quiagen). The purified core particles were washed with a medium (medium A) containing 400 mm sucrose, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Mes-NaOH (pH 6.0) supplemented with 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 and suspended in medium A after extensive washing with medium A. Protein Composition—The PS II core particles were solubilized using 1% SDS and then electrophoresed in an SDS-PAGE with a 16-22% gradient gel containing 7.5 m urea (32Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 1233-1239Google Scholar). A sample corresponding to 0.8 μg of Chl was applied to each lane. Peptide bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The apparent molecular mass of a resolved protein was estimated by comigrating a molecular mass standard (Bio-Rad). Measurements—Mid-frequency (1800-1000 cm-1) FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS 66v/S spectrophotometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector (EG&G Optoelectronics D316/6). Low frequency (650-350 cm-1) FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bomen MB102 spectrophotometer equipped with a Si bolometer (Infrared, HDL-5) as previously described (31Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The PS II core suspension (∼40 μg of Chl) was mixed with 1 μl of sodium ferricyanide solution (100 mm stock) as an electron acceptor. The sample suspensions deposited on either a 20-mmϕ BaF2 disk (mid-frequency) or an AgCl disk (low frequency) were partially desiccated and then rehydrated. The sample temperature was maintained within ± 0.03 °C using a homemade cryostat. The sample cores were illuminated with a flash provided from a frequency-doubled Nd3+:YAG laser (Spectra Physics INDI-50, 532 nm, pulse width 6-7 ns) with flash energy of ∼10 mJ/cm2 at the sample surface. Single beam spectra were accumulated at 4-cm-1 resolution for 15 s in the mid-frequency (20 scans) or in the low frequency region (10 scans) before and after excitation, and light - dark spectra were calculated. 116-145 mid-frequency difference spectra or 271-284 low frequency difference spectra were averaged. Low temperature X-band ESR spectra were measured using a Bruker E580 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford-900 cryostat and a temperature controller (Oxford, ITC4). The sample cores (4 mg of Chl/ml) in a Spracil quartz ESR sample tube were illuminated at 213 K for 3 s with a cold light (Hayashi, LA-150TX) passing through a long pass filter (≥680 nm). Thermoluminescence was measured using a homemade apparatus (33Ono T.-A. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 850: 380-389Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in medium A at 250 μg of Chl/ml in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm DCMU. The sample suspension was illuminated at 0 °C with a saturating xenon flash. The O2 evolution activity was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode in medium A at 25 °C under saturating light conditions supplemented with exogenous electron acceptors, 1 mm 2,5-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone, and 2 mm potassium ferricyanide for cells or 4 mm potassium ferricyanide for core particles. Physiological and Biochemical Properties—As shown in Table I, the histidine-tagged wild-type (wild*-type) and the C-terminal extension-truncated Ala-344-stop cells grew photo-autotrophically under both low and high light conditions and evolved oxygen at rates similar to the wild-type cells. The affinity-purified PS II core particles from wild*-type and Ala-344-stop cells showed high O2 evolution capability, although the activity of the Ala-344-stop cores was slightly lower than that of the wild*-type cores, following the trend observed for O2 evolution in the cells. The A344G-stop cells grew photoautotrophically under low light conditions as previously reported (11Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and evolved oxygen at ∼90% of the rate of the Ala-344-stop cells but did not grow photoautotrophically under high light conditions. The PS II core particles from the low light-grown A344G-stop cells preserved high O2 evolution activity, but it was relatively lower (∼60%) than that from the Ala-344-stop cells. The activity was not enhanced by the further supplementation of the Ca2+ and/or Cl- to medium A.Table IPhotoautotrophic growth and PSII activities in wild-type, wild*-type, Ala-344-stop, and A344G-stop strains of Synechocystis sp.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows SDS-PAGE profiles of the PS II core particles from wild*-type (lane a), Ala-344-stop (lane b), and A344G-stop (lane c). All the core particles showed very similar protein composition in terms of the major intrinsic proteins, including CP47, CP43, D2, D1, and α subunit of cytochrome b559, and the three extrinsic proteins, including 33 kDa, cytochrome c550, and 12 kDa. The particles also showed very similar profiles in the low molecular mass-region bands (<10 kDa), although each band was diffusive and could not be individually defined. The results demonstrated that neither deletion of the C-terminal extension nor replacement of the C-terminal alanine with glycine affects the protein composition of OEC. A protein band at ∼15 kDa (lane c, asterisk) was sometimes detected with a slightly higher amount in the A344G-stop than the other cores, although the identity of the band was not defined in this study. Redox Properties of OEC—The effects of mutations on the redox properties of OEC were studied by measuring the thermoluminescence glow curve in the presence (panel A) or absence (panel B) of DCMU as shown in Fig. 2. The wild-type cells (a) showed a 37 °C (-DCMU) and a 10 °C band (+DCMU) because of the charge recombination of the S2QB- and S2QA- pair, respectively. Very similar thermoluminescence glow curves were observed in the wild*-type (b) and Ala-344-stop (c) cells. The results indicate that the attachment of the histidine tag and the deletion of the C-terminal extension do not affect the redox potential of the S2-state OEC and, thus, do not affect the Mn cluster. In contrast, the peak temperatures of the respective bands in the A344G-stop cells (d) were upshifted by ∼5 °C for the S2QB- and S2QA- pair, respectively, indicating that the redox potential of the Mn cluster for the S2/S1 couple in the A344G-stop OEC is lower than that of the control OEC. Structural Properties of the Mn Cluster—Fig. 3 shows the light-induced ESR spectra in the PS II core particles from the Ala-344-stop (a) and A344G-stop (b) cells. The sample cores were illuminated at 213 K, a temperature at which the accumulation of the S2 state is allowed. The Ala-344-stop particles showed a prominent g = 2 S2 multiline, a much smaller g = 4.1 S2 signal, and a Fe2+QA- signal at g = 1.9. The spectral features of the observed S2 ESR signals were very similar to those in the normal OEC. The A344G-stop spectrum showed a smaller multiline and much larger g = 4.1 signals compared with the Ala-344-stop spectrum, although the hyperfine structure of the multiline signal and the width and position of the g = 4.1 signal were almost identical to those of the Ala-344-stop spectrum. These results indicate that the Gly substitution induces changes in the Mn cluster that facilitate the g = 4.1 state formation. Fig. 4 shows the mid-frequency (1800-1000 cm-1) S2/S1 FTIR difference spectra of the PS II core particles from the wild*-type (a), Ala-344-stop (b, blue line), and A344G-stop (b, red line) cells. The wild*-type and Ala-344-stop spectra showed largely identical S2/S1 vibrational features, including the symmetric (1450-1300 cm-1) and asymmetric (1600-1500 cm-1) stretching modes from the putative carboxylate ligands for the Mn cluster as well as the amide I (1700-1600 cm-1) and II (1600-1500 cm-1) modes from polypeptide backbones (5Noguchi T. Ono T.-A. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 189-200Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, the A344G-stop spectrum (red line) showed a small but distinctive difference from the Ala-344-stop one (blue line) as can be clearly observed in the double difference spectrum (c) obtained by subtracting the A344G-stop from the Ala-344-stop spectrum. Several of the bands in the symmetric carboxylate stretching region (1450-1300 cm-1) were shifted in the A344G-stop S2/S1 spectrum to yield the bands at 1403(-), 1394(+), 1360(+), and 1345(-) cm-1, in spite of no change of the S2/S1 bands at 1437(+) and 1417(-) cm-1. In the 1600-1500-cm-1 region, the bands were yielded at 1565(-), 1552(+), 1521(-), and 1503(+) cm-1, which are ascribed to the changes in the asymmetric carboxylate stretching modes and/or amide II modes of the polypeptide backbones. The S2/S1 bands at 1652(+), 1642(-), and 1620(+) cm-1 in the amide I region decreased in their intensity by Gly substitution to yield the 1653(+)-, 1642(-)-, and 1623(+)-cm-1 bands in the double difference spectrum. The negative band at 1113 cm-1 assigned to the CN stretching mode of the putative histidine ligand for the Mn cluster (6Noguchi T. Inoue Y. Tang X.-S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10187-10195Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was considerably enhanced in the A344G-stop spectrum, as indicated by a distinct positive band in the double difference spectrum. Notably, no mode for the YD tyrosine was included in the double difference spectrum, indicating little contribution of the Mn-depleted PSII to the A344G-stop spectrum. Fig. 5 shows the low frequency (670-350 cm-1) S2/S1 FTIR difference spectra of the PS II core particles from the Ala-344-stop (a, blue line) and A344G-stop (a, red line) cells and the double difference spectrum (b). The Ala-344-stop S2/S1 spectrum showed prominent bands at 629(+), 617(-), 606(+), 590(+), 577(-), 403(-), and 388(-)cm-1 as well as many other medium to low intensity bands. The 590(+)- and ∼400(-)-cm-1 bands were ascribed to the vibrational modes of ferrocyanide and ferricyanide, respectively (31Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The spectrum was most comparable with the previously reported wild*-type spectrum measured under different sample conditions, but bands at 660(+), 652(-), 642(+), 374(+), 368(-), and 359(+) cm-1 had not been well resolved because of the large absorption of water (31Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The spectrum of A344G-stop (a, red line) was markedly different from that of Ala-344-stop. The double difference spectrum (b) showed prominent bands at 663(+), 648(+), 625(-), 615(-), 606(+), 384(+), 368(-), and 361(+) cm-1 as well as several minor bands at 532 cm-1 and in the 500-420-cm-1 region. Based on a study using 18O water, it has been suggested that the Mn-O-Mn cluster modes in the S2 and S1 states are responsible for the 606(+)- and 625(-)-cm-1 bands (34Chu H.-A. Sackett H. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14371-14376Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results indicate that the interactions between Mn ions in the cluster are considerably influenced by the Gly substitution. However, the Gly substitution was not observed to affect the bands at 577(-), 565(+), 554(+), and 542(+) cm-1. The 577(-)-cm-1 band has been ascribed to the skeletal vibration of the Mn cluster or the Mn-ligand(oxygen) interaction (31Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, the primary structure of the Mn cluster is thought to be little affected by the Gly substitution. The present results showed that the A344G-stop mutant grew photoautotrophically with a high O2 evolution activity and revealed no biochemical difference in the isolated PS II core complex. However, the mutant cells could not grow photoautotrophically under high light conditions. The elevated peak temperature of the S2-state thermoluminescence bands in the A344G-stop cells indicates that the oxidation potential of the S2-state Mn cluster is lower in the mutant than in the control cells. This may account for the increased susceptibility of the A344G-stop cells to high light because this change lowers the efficiency for the oxidation of the substrate water and, consequently, leads to the increase in the charge recombination probability in PS II, promoting the generation of the reactive oxygen species. The Ala-344-stop - A344G-stop double difference spectrum (Fig. 4c) showed the bands at 1403-1345 and 1565-1503 cm-1 in the carboxylate symmetric and asymmetric stretching regions, respectively. The band change induced by the Gly substitution is explained by assuming a shift of a single carboxylate group. As shown in Fig. 6, the observed double difference spectrum was reproduced by assuming the downshift of an Ala-344-stop S2/S1 band pair at 1360/1403 cm-1 (a, blue line)to 1346/1395 cm-1 (a, red line) or the downshift of an S2/S1 band pair at 1392/1404 cm-1 (b, blue line) to 1345/1360 cm-1 (b, red line). The latter (scheme b) is less likely because the presumed S2 bands were much smaller relative to the presumed S1 bands. This is, however, quite difficult to rationally explain. Alternatively, the observed band change was reproduced by the upshift of an S2/S1 band pair from 1395/1346 (or 1360/1345) cm-1 to 1403/1360 (or 1404/1392) cm-1, although the presumed shift opposes the expected trends of the ligand (5Noguchi T. Ono T.-A. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 189-200Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 35Smith J.C. Gonzalez-Vergara E. Vincent J.B. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1997; 255: 99-103Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was indicated that the symmetric stretching modes of the α-carboxylate group of the D1 C-terminal Ala-344 appear at ∼1356 cm-1 for the S1 state and at ∼1320 cm-1 for the S2 state (30Chu H.-A. Hiller W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), respectively. The downshift of the Ala-344 band has been interpreted to indicate the ligation of C-terminal carboxylate to the Mn ion, which is oxidized during the S1 to S2 transition. The lack of the C-terminal bands in the double difference spectrum shown in Fig. 4 indicates that the Gly substitution induces little change in the modes for the C-terminal carboxylate but results in a change of the other carboxylate ligand. A possible candidate of the Gly-affected modes is the carboxylate side chain mode of D1-Asp-342. This residue was assigned as a ligand for a Mn ion in the 3.5-Å x-ray structural model (19Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2850) Google Scholar) in which the CH3 group of Ala-344 is arranged toward the Mn cluster. Therefore, the replacement of CH3 (Ala) with H (Gly) can influence the strength of the coordination bond between the Asp-342 carboxylate and a Mn ion. The absence of the Gly substitution effect on the C-terminal carboxylate modes may be related to the finding that the C-terminal carboxylate was disordered and not visible in the x-ray electron density map (19Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2850) Google Scholar). Possibly, the C-terminal ligand is relatively flexible to be able to move to some extent with little change in the ligation geometry. It is of note in this context that the observed frequency difference between the asymmetric and symmetric modes (∼160 cm-1) for the putative Asp-342 carboxylate is similar to the value empirically found for the bidentate coordinate (5Noguchi T. Ono T.-A. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 189-200Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Chu H.-A. Hiller W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 38Socrates G. Infrared and Raman Characteristic Group Frequencies. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1994Google Scholar), although the x-ray model indicated a unidentate coordinate of Asp-342 (19Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2850) Google Scholar). According to Fig. 6a, the putative Asp-342 carboxylate band is downshifted by 43 cm-1 upon the S2-state formation, suggesting oxidation of the ligating Mn ion or a change in ligation structure during the S1 to S2 transition. Taking into account the possible ligation of the Ala-344 C-terminal carboxylate to the Mn ion that changes in oxidation state during the S1 to S2 transition (30Chu H.-A. Hiller W. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 42: 3152-3166Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it may be assumed that the carboxylate side chain of Asp-342 and the α-carboxylate of Ala-344 participate in the ligation of the Mn ion that is oxidized upon the S2 formation. Most of the bands in the low frequency S2/S1 difference spectrum were changed upon Gly substitution as seen in Fig. 5. The affected bands possibly included the S2/S1 modes of the Mn-O-Mn stretching vibration of the Mn cluster at 606(+)/625(-) cm-1 (34Chu H.-A. Sackett H. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14371-14376Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), Mn-COO- bending modes of putative carboxylate ligands (36Chu H.-A. Gardner M.T. O'Brien J.P. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4533-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the ring torsion mode of histidine residues (37Hasegawa K. Ono T.-A. Noguchi T. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 4253-4265Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the amide IV (40% O = C-N bending) and amide VI (C = O bending) modes of polypeptide backbone (38Socrates G. Infrared and Raman Characteristic Group Frequencies. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1994Google Scholar), and ligand-dependent Mn-O modes at 532-420 cm-1 (31Kimura Y. Mizusawa N. Ishii A. Yamanari T. Ono T.-A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13170-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 39Visser H. Dubé C.E. Armstrong W.H. Sauer K. Yachandra V.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11008-11017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Gly substitution resulted in marked changes in the bands in the 400-350-cm-1 region, frequencies that include the stretching vibrations between the Mn ion and the ligands (O and/or N) (40Chu H.-A. Hillier W. Law N.A. Babcock G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These marked spectral changes upon Gly substitution suggest a gross structural change in the Mn cluster. Nevertheless, there are relatively insignificant changes in the mid-frequency region of the spectrum except for the putative Asp-342 mode. Interestingly, the D1-D170H OEC Synechocystis showed prominent changes in the low frequency S2/S1 spectrum (660-500 cm-1) but limited changes in the mid-frequency (1800-1200 cm-1) spectrum (20Chu H.-A. Debus R.J. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2312-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the different manifestation of the Gly substitution in the midand low frequency spectra is that the mid-frequency bands include the modes, which are not the direct ligands to the Mn cluster. Such indirect structural coupling may be less sensitive to intrastructural changes of the Mn cluster. The observed structural changes of the Mn cluster induced by the Gly substitution suggest that Ala-344 is crucial for maintaining the intrastructure of the Mn cluster as a ligand. Nevertheless, the present FTIR results do not preclude the possibility that the C-terminal Ala-344 carboxylate is located close to the Ca ion of the Mn3CaO4 cubane-like cluster core as proposed by the recent x-ray structural model (19Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (2850) Google Scholar). In this case, the present results suggest that Ca may participate in controlling the structural changes of the Mn cluster during the S1 to S2 transition and the C-terminal Ala is involved in this Ca-dependent function, although it is not clear how it is achieved at present. As shown in Fig. 3, ∼70% of the total A344G-stop OEC existed in the S = 5/2 g = 4.1 state, whereas more than 90% OEC existed in the S = 1/2 multiline state in the control Ala-344-stop. Some difference in the electronic structure within the Mn cluster has been proposed to be responsible for the appearance of these two states (41Kusunoki M. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. 2. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 297-300Google Scholar, 42Boussac A. Girerd J.-J. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6984-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The change in the intrastructure of the Mn cluster may induce considerable alterations in the low frequency modes of the Mn cluster with much smaller or little change in the mid-frequency modes indirectly coupled with the Mn cluster. The Sr2+-substituted OEC with an enhanced g = 4.1 signal showed the normal-like mid-frequency S2/S1 difference spectrum (43Kimura Y. Hasegawa K. Ono T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5844-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the markedly altered low frequency spectrum (34Chu H.-A. Sackett H. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14371-14376Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, little change of the mid-frequency S2/S1 spectrum has been reported upon conversion from the multiline to the g = 4.1 state by IR illumination (44Onoda K. Mino H. Inoue Y. Noguchi T. Photosyn. Res. 2000; 63: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A possible difference between these two S2 ESR states is a valence exchange between strongly antiferro-magnetic Mn(IV) and Mn(III) (41Kusunoki M. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. 2. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 297-300Google Scholar, 42Boussac A. Girerd J.-J. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6984-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The valence exchange may alter the Mn-Mn and/or Mn-ligand interactions that affect the low frequency modes but scarcely influence the mid-frequency modes."
https://openalex.org/W2035034282,"Using X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy at liquid helium temperatures, the Cu(II) coordination geometry at the active site of bovine and human copper,zinc-superoxide dismutases (bSOD1 and hSOD1) treated with H2O2 and bicarbonate ( HCO3−) was examined. The time course EPR of wild type human SOD1 (WT hSOD1), W32F hSOD1 mutant (tryptophan 32 substituted with phenylalanine), and bSOD1 treated with H2O2 and HCO3− shows an initial reduction of active site Cu(II) to Cu(I) followed by its oxidation back to Cu(II) in the presence of H2O2. However, HCO3− induced a Trp-32-derived radical from WT hSOD1 but not from bSOD1. The mutation of Trp-32 by phenylalanine totally eliminated the Trp-32 radical signal generated from W32F hSOD1 treated with HCO3− and H2O2. Further characterization of the free radical was performed by UV irradiation of WT hSOD1 and bSOD1 that generated tryptophanyl and tyrosyl radicals. Both proton (1H) and nitrogen (14N) ENDOR studies of bSOD1 and hSOD1 in the presence of H2O2 revealed a change in the geometry of His-46 (or His-44) and His-48 (or His-46) coordinated to Cu(II) at the active site of WT hSOD1 and bSOD1, respectively. However, in the presence of HCO3− and H2O2, both 1H and 14N ENDOR spectra were almost identical to those derived from native bSOD1. We conclude that HCO3−-derived oxidant does not alter significantly the Cu(II) active site geometry and histidine coordination to Cu(II) in SOD1 as does H2O2 alone; however, the oxidant derived from HCO3− (i.e. carbonate anion radical) reacts with surface-associated Trp-32 in hSOD1 to form the corresponding radical.

It has been proposed that the bicarbonate ( HCO3−), a ubiquitous anion present in high concentrations (∼25 mm) in biological systems, may enter the active site and be oxidized to form the carbonate anion radical, CO3−⋅, which can diffuse out and oxidize other substrates in the bulk solution (3Liochev S.I.

E-Cu(II)−O.H+HCO3−→E-Cu(II)+CO3·¯+H2O (Eq. 3) Previously, we reported that HCO3− enhances the peroxidase activity of human Cu,Zn-SOD (hSOD1) in a concentration-dependent manner, causing protein aggregation through Trp-32-derived oxidation products (14Zhang H. Andrekopoulos C. Joseph J. Karunakaran C. Karoui H. Crow J.P. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24078-24089Google Scholar). Recently, Elam et al. (15Elam J.S. Malek K. Rodriguez J.A. Doucette P.A. Taylor A.B. Hayward L.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21032-21039Google Scholar) proposed an alternative mechanism for HCO3−-mediated peroxidase activity and inactivation of SOD1 via an enzyme-associated peroxycarbonate ( HCO4−) intermediate, which apparently oxidized the histidine coordinated to Cu(II) at the active site causing its inactivation (15Elam J.S. Malek K. Rodriguez J.A. Doucette P.A. Taylor A.B. Hayward L.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21032-21039Google Scholar). It was proposed that the active species ( HCO4− or CO3−) formed during the peroxidase activity is enzyme-associated and non-diffusible (15Elam J.S. Malek K. Rodriguez J.A. Doucette P.A. Taylor A.B. Hayward L.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21032-21039Google Scholar). The changes in geometry and coordination that occur at the Cu(II) site during the HCO3−-dependent SOD1 peroxidase activity have not yet been investigated directly. To obtain a better understanding of the interaction between the histidine ligands and the oxidant generated at the active Cu(II) site during SOD1 peroxidase activity, we used the low temperature EPR and ENDOR techniques that can directly probe the paramagnetic metal ion at the active site, the coordinating ligands containing the NMR active nuclei, and the enzyme-derived free radical. Although EPR is used to detect and characterize unambiguously paramagnetic metal ions at the active site in metalloenzymes, the EPR spectra are, in general, inhomogeneously broadened due to unresolved g-anisotropy and hyperfine couplings from the metal ion and the ligand nuclei (e.g. nitrogen) linked to the metal ion. In such cases, electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) can be used to probe the NMR-active nuclei that are coordinated to the paramagnetic center (16Abragam A. Bleaney B.B. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Transition Ions. Dover Publications, New York1986Google Scholar, 17Hoffman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3575-3578Google Scholar, 18Reinhard H.

Acta. 1998; 273: 131-141Google Scholar). Low temperature ENDOR has been used previously to determine the copper-histidine coordination in Cu,Zn-SOD (18Reinhard H. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Viezzoli M.-S. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 8806-8812Google Scholar, 21Scholl H.-J. Hüttermann J. Viezzoli M.-S. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1998; 273: 131-141Google Scholar). In this study, using the low temperature X-band EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy, we investigated the geometry and coordination of the Cu(II) active site as well as the structure of the free radical generated during SOD1 peroxidase activity. Results from this study show that H2O2 drastically alters the copper-histidine coordination at the active site and is inhibited partially by HCO3−. During HCO3−-dependent peroxidase activity, the Trp-32 located on the surface of hSOD1 was oxidized to the corresponding Trp-32 radical. The copper-bound histidines His-44 and His-46 in bSOD1 and His-46 and His-48 in WT hSOD1 are affected predominantly due to oxidation by H2O2 only in the absence of HCO3−. These findings are relevant to understanding oxidant-mediated site-specific damage, oxidative inactivation of the enzyme, and the covalent aggregations of WT hSOD1 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis SOD1 mutants. Materials—Bovine Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Tyrosine, tryptophan, hydrogen peroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydrogen phosphate, and DTPA were purchased from Sigma. Expression and Purification of Human SOD1—The wild type human and W32F mutant Cu,Zn-SOD (Cu(II) 97%; Zn(II) 108%) were expressed and purified as described previously (14Zhang H. Andrekopoulos C. Joseph J. Karunakaran C. Karoui H. Crow J.P. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24078-24089Google Scholar). The SOD1 mutations were created by a two-cycle polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis protocol described by Zhao et al. (22Zhao L.J. Zhang Q.X. Padmanabhan R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 218-227Google Scholar) using mutagenic primers to introduce the desired mutants and cloned subsequently into a pET-3d expression system (Novagen, Madison, WI). EPR Measurements—A typical reaction mixture (200 μl) for EPR measurements consisted of SOD1 (30 μm), H2O2 (1 mm), and HCO3− (25 mm) in a phosphate buffer (100 mm) containing DTPA (100 μm). The X-band EPR of Cu(II) and free radical were recorded at liquid helium and liquid nitrogen temperatures on a Bruker E500 ELEXYS spectrometer with a 100-kHz field modulation equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 helium flow cryostat and a DM_0101 cavity. Incubation mixtures (200 μl) containing SOD1 and H2O2 were transferred to a 4-mm quartz EPR tube (Wilmad) and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for EPR analysis. EPR spectral parameters were extracted from the spectra using the QPOWA program (23Belford R.L. Belford G.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1973; 59: 853-854Google Scholar) based on the successful fitting to the following orthorhombic spin Hamiltonian as shown in Equation 4 (16Abragam A. Bleaney B.B. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Transition Ions. Dover Publications, New York1986Google Scholar), H=β(gzSzBz+gxSxBx+gySyBy)+AzIzSz+AxIxSx+AyIySy (Eq. 4) where β is the Bohr magneton; gx, gy, and gz and Ax, Ay, and Az are the components with respect to the principal axes of the g-tensor and the hyperfine tensor. Spectrometer conditions were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.63 GHz; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 5 G; receiver gain, 85 dB; time constant, 0.01 s; conversion time, 0.08 s; sweep time, 83.9 s; and microwave power, 100 μW. For UV irradiation studies, bovine or human SOD1 (30 μm) in a phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (0.1 mm) was irradiated at indicated time intervals with UV light using an EiMac VIX 300 UV 300 X Xenon arc source and water as filter. ENDOR Measurements—X-band ENDOR spectra were recorded on a Bruker E500 ELEXYS spectrometer using an ENDOR/triple accessory (Bruker) cavity. ENDOR spectra were recorded by fixing the magnetic field at an EPR resonance and by applying saturating microwave power partially while sweeping the NMR transition with a radio frequency source. 1H and 14N ENDOR spectra were recorded at 8 K at the field positions shown in Fig. 4A, inset (vide infra). The EPR spectrum was saturated partially with 6.33 mW (15 dB) of microwave power, and the ENDOR spectra were recorded at 9.47 GHz with a 200-kHz modulation depth, 100-W radio frequency power, and 1500 scans at field position I and 5000 scans at field positions II and III, respectively. Simulations of 14N interactions in ENDOR spectra were done by DDPOWHE program (24Telser J. Horng Y.-C. Becker D.F. Hoffmann B.M. Ragsdale S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 182-183Google Scholar) using the following spin Hamiltonian as shown in Equation 5 (16Abragam A. Bleaney B.B. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Transition Ions. Dover Publications, New York1986Google Scholar), H=β·B·g·S+∑i=1n[−gNβNB·I^+S·A·I^+I^·Q·I^] (Eq. 5) where B is the external magnetic field and Ai and Qi correspond to the hyperfine and quadrupole tensors, respectively, of nucleus i. Ai is described by its three principal values (Aixx, Aiyy, and Aizz) and the Euler angles (αi, βi, γi) that transform its principal axis system (x″, y″, z″) to that of g(x′,y′,z′). To simulate the resulting spectra, each nitrogen spectrum was multiplied by a factor chosen such that their sum gave the best fit to the experimental data (25Flores M. Wajnberg E. Bemski G. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2107-2115Google Scholar). For protons with a spin of I = ½, the ENDOR transition frequencies are given to first order by Equation 6 (16Abragam A. Bleaney B.B. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Transition Ions. Dover Publications, New York1986Google Scholar), ν±=|νH±AH/2| (Eq. 6) where AH is the orientation-dependent nuclear hyperfine coupling constant and νH is the nuclear Larmor frequency. If νH > AH/2 as is usually the case for protons in biological systems, the ENDOR spectrum consists of a hyperfine-split doublet centered around the Larmor frequency. For νH < AH/2 as is the case for nuclei with small nuclear Larmor frequencies, the ENDOR spectrum consists of a Larmor-split doublet centered at AH/2. For a quadrupolar nucleus such as 14N (I = 1) where the ligand nuclei have a spin greater than ½, the ENDOR pattern is further split into 2I lines given by the first order resonance frequencies as shown in Equation 7 (16Abragam A. Bleaney B.B. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Transition Ions. Dover Publications, New York1986Google Scholar), ν±(m)=|νN±AN/2+3PN(2m−1)/2| (Eq. 7) where m is the spin state of the lower two energy levels, which are involved in the transition given by –I + 1 ≤ m ≤ I. This hyperfine splitting is governed by PN, the orientation-dependent quadrupole coupling constant (26Hoffmann B.M. DeRose V.J. Doan P.E. Gurbiel R.J. Houseman A.L.P. Telser J. Berliner L.J. Reuben J. EMR of Paramagnetic Molecules: Biological Magnetic Resonance. 13. Plenum Press, New York1993: 151-214Google Scholar). The Effect of H2O2 and Bicarbonate on the EPR Spectra of the Active Site Cu(II) in Human and Bovine SOD1—The EPR spectra of bovine SOD1, WT hSOD1, and mutant W32F hSOD1 along with the computer simulations (dotted lines) are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the g-tensor (gx = 2.030, gy = 2.090, and gz = 2.268) and the Cu(II) hyperfine splitting (Az = –395.0 MHz) parameters (27Banci L. Bencini A. Bertini I. Luchinat C. Piccioli M. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 29: 4867-4873Google Scholar, 28Lieberman R.A. Sands R.H. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 336-344Google Scholar), it is evident that the Cu(II) active site geometry is similar in all cases. The precise determination of hyperfine tensor parameters, Ax and Ay, was hindered due to spectral broadening in this region as a result of close g values and lower hyperfine coupling. The Euler angles of α = 85° and β = 20° that describe the relative orientations of g- and A-tensors were obtained from simulating EPR spectra of W32F hSOD1, WT hSOD1, and bSOD1. Generally, the non-coincidence of g- and A-tensors and low anisotropy of Az-tensor element of all SOD1 indicates the presence of low symmetry at the Cu(II) active site (29Swalen J.D. Johnson B. Gladney H.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1970; 52: 4078-4086Google Scholar, 30Attanasio D. J. Magn. Reson. 1977; 26: 81-91Google Scholar). Large g- and A-strains indicating the distribution of g- and A-tensors due to the conformational heterogeneity of SOD1 were required to simulate the observed spectra. The time-dependent EPR spectra obtained from incubations containing the WT hSOD1, W32F hSOD1, and bSOD1 and H2O2 in the absence (left) and presence of HCO3− (right) along with computer simulations (dotted lines) are shown in Fig. 2. Although it is probable that a mixture of several species is formed during the reaction with H2O2, we have simulated the EPR spectra based on the spin Hamiltonian parameters of two predominating species with one corresponding to the native SOD1 and the other corresponding to the Cu(II) species, characterized by less rhombic parameters (gx = 2.047, gy = 2.055, gz = 2.268, Az = –420 MHz). In the presence of HCO3−, the native enzyme parameters were found to be dominant, whereas in the absence of HCO3−, the less rhombic parameters were predominant for simulations. In the presence of H2O2, the Cu(II) signal intensity of WT hSOD1 slowly decreased up to 15 min because of the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and then increased in intensity because of reoxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) (Fig. 2). The Cu(II) hyperfine lines are also broadened possibly due to oxidation of His-46 (or His-44) and His-48 (or His-46) by the enzyme-derived oxidant, E-Cu(II)-•OH. However in the presence of HCO3−, the EPR signal intensity of Cu(II) decreased significantly at 1 min and later increased until 30 min. The Cu(II) hyperfine signals reappeared much like the native enzyme, indicating that the Cu(II) active site geometry remained more intact in the presence of HCO3− and H2O2 as compared with the Cu(II) active site geometry in the presence of H2O2 alone. In the presence of H2O2 and HCO3−, a new EPR signal appeared in the free radical region (Fig. 2, indicated by an arrow), which grew in intensity until 30 min and then decreased. The P½ values were calculated to be ∼0.072 mW at 30 K and 0.32 mW at 77 K, suggesting that the tryptophan-derived radical saturates at a relatively low microwave power. As the EPR spectra obtained in the presence of 95% N2 and 5% CO2 were similar (not shown), we conclude that the free radical formed probably is carbon-centered and not oxygen-centered (31DeGray J.A. Gunther M.R. Guth R.-T. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2359-2362Google Scholar). As with WT hSOD1, the Cu(II) signal intensity of W32F hSOD1 decreased initially but grew with time because of rapid oxidation of Cu(I) by H2O2. In the presence of HCO3−, the EPR signal intensity decreased but not to the same extent as did WT-SOD1. However, no free radical signal was detected from W32F SOD1 (Fig. 2, right panel). This confirms that the free radical detected from incubations containing WT hSOD1, H2O2, and HCO3− was derived, most probably, from Trp-32. Effect of UV on WT and W32F Human SOD1 and Bovine SOD1—Irradiation of WT hSOD1 and bSOD1 with UV light induced tryptophanyl and tyrosyl radicals. Typical EPR spectra obtained from UV-irradiated hSOD1 and bSOD1 and measured at 8 K are shown in Fig. 3. The UV irradiation of W32F hSOD1 under similar conditions did not induce the free radical signal (Fig. 3, bottom panel). This finding suggests that the free radical probably is derived from Trp. Upon expanding the free radical region, hyperfine features were resolved (Fig. 3, insert). To identify the nature and structure of the free radical, we used the data published previously (32Bleisfuss G. Kolberg M. Potsch S. Hofbauer W. Bittl R Lubitz W. Graslund A. Lassmann G. Lendzian F.

Open table in a new tab Probing of Copper-Histidine Coordination by ENDOR during SOD1 Peroxidase Activity—The histidyl protons at the active Cu(II) site in SOD1 show ν+ and ν– absorptions centered around νH that are split by their hyperfine coupling constants (18Reinhard H. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Viezzoli M.-S. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 8806-8812Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows the time course of proton (1H) ENDOR spectra from histidines coordinated to Cu(II) at the active site of bSOD1 in the presence of H2O2 and/or HCO3− obtained at the field positions I, II, and III indicated in Fig. 4A (inset). The proton signal (marked a in Fig. 4A) from His-44 is absent in the presence of H2O2 alone (18Reinhard H. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Viezzoli M.-S. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 8806-8812Google Scholar). However, the proton ENDOR spectra of bovine SOD1 treated with H2O2 in the presence of HCO3− remained virtually unchanged (Fig. 4A). The time course of the 14N ENDOR spectra from histidines liganded to Cu(II) of bovine SOD1 with H2O2 and/or HCO3− is shown in Fig. 4B. The spectra for the field position I were simulated (Fig. 4B, dotted line) using the published parameters for native bSOD1 by Reinhard et al. (18Reinhard H. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Viezzoli M.-S. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 8806-8812Google Scholar) based on the superposition of the Az and Ax features. As shown previously (18Reinhard H. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Viezzoli M.-S. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 8806-8812Google Scholar), the following two features became evident. (i) For the Az direction, there are two types of nitrogen signals, Nz(1) (His-46(44) and His-48(46)) and Nz(2) (His-63(61) and His-120(118)). However, the two values are overlapping at this orientation to give only a single set of lines, Nz(1,2) (Fig. 4B at field position II). (ii) For the Ax direction, two sets of 14N signals, i.e. Nx(1) and Nx (2) were used for simulation as shown in Fig. 4B at field position III. In the presence of HCO3− and H2O2, there was an excellent fit between the experimental ENDOR and the computer simulations using the values obtained by Reinhard et al. (18Reinhard H. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Viezzoli M.-S. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 8806-8812Google Scholar). From these findings, we conclude that the copper-bound His is not affected greatly in the presence of HCO3− and H2O2. However, in the presence of H2O2 alone, the triplet signal in the low frequency region was absent (Fig. 4B at field position I). The triplet signal has been assigned previously to the His-46(44) and His-48(46) nitrogens (18Reinhard H. Kappl R. Hüttermann J. Viezzoli M.-S. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 8806-8812Google Scholar). Thus, the two coordinated nitrogens of His are altered with H2O2 treatment, and the geometry is relaxed slightly, resulting in a lower Cu(II) hyperfine coupling (an Az value of 420 MHz) compared with the pure tetragonal axial symmetric systems, viz. copper tetraphenylporphyrin and copper phthalocyanin with Az values of 631 and 637 MHz, respectively (36Greiner S.P. Rowlands D.L. Kreilick R.W. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 9132-9139Google Scholar). However, in the presence of HCO3−, there was only a minimal change in the spectra, indicating that the active site geometry was not affected greatly under these conditions. The lower Cu(II) hyperfine Az value coupled with an unusually large value for the 14N quadrupole tensors (Fig. 4) used for simulation (as compared with an axial Cu(II) site (36Greiner S.P. Rowlands D.L. Kreilick R.W. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 9132-9139Google Scholar, 37Scholl H.-J. Huttermann J. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 9684-9691Google Scholar)) indicates a low symmetry for the Cu(II) active site in the presence of HCO3−. Using EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy, we investigated the copper coordination geometry of human and bovine SOD1 treated with H2O2 and HCO3−. The results indicate that, in the presence of H2O2, the copper coordination geometry became less rhombic presumably because of oxidative modifications of two coordinated histidines. However, in the presence of H2O2 and HCO3−, the ENDOR pattern was identical to that of native SOD1, suggesting that the active site copper geometry was affected minimally. In the presence of HCO3− and H2O2, a free radical signal attributable to Trp-32 was induced from WT hSOD1. Tryptophan-derived Free Radical from Human SOD1 Peroxidase Activity—Previous studies on peroxidase activity of SOD1 and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis SOD1 mutants revealed that HCO3− is absolutely essential for SOD1/H2O2-induced hydroxylation of 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide and oxidation of several substrates, viz. urates, ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline]-6-sulfonic acid), γ-tocopherol, dichlorodihydrofluorescein, and others, which are not accessible to the Cu(II) site through the narrow active site channel, as shown in Fig. 1 (4Liochev S.I.

Akaike T. Kohno M. Ando M. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25371-25377Google Scholar). Early on, it was proposed by Hodgson and Fridovich (1Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5298Google Scholar, 2Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Google Scholar) that the reaction between H2O2 and SOD1 could generate a copper-bound hydroxyl radical that reacts with HCO3− to form a diffusible oxidant, CO3−⋅. This radical was proposed to diffuse out of the active site and cause oxidation of several substrates outside of the active site (5Singh R.J. Goss S.P.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12912-12917Google Scholar, 6Zhang H. Joseph J. Gurney M. Becker D. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1013-1020Google Scholar, 7Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C.

However in the absence of HCO3−, there was no significant peroxidase activity. Recently, an alternate mechanism for HCO3−-mediated peroxidase activity and inactivation of SOD1 via an enzyme-bound non-diffusible reactive intermediate, HCO4−, was proposed to explain the HCO3−-enhanced enzyme inactivation (15Elam J.S. Malek K. Rodriguez J.A. Doucette P.A. Taylor A.B. Hayward L.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21032-21039Google Scholar). The proposed reactive intermediate species formed at the Cu(II) active site was presumed to oxidize the coordinated histidines in the presence of HCO3−. The present EPR data of WT hSOD1 and bSOD1 in the presence of H2O2 showed that the site-specific oxidation of active site histidines was dependent on the ratio between the bicarbonate and phosphate concentrations (data not shown). The appearance of a tryptophan-derived radical formed from WT hSOD1 and not from W32F hSOD1 is consistent with the reaction between CO3−⋅ radical and tryptophan 32 on the surface. The CO3−⋅ radical reacts rapidly with Trp or Tyr residues ( kTrp/CO3·¯=7.0×108 M−1 s−1; kTyr/CO3·¯=4.5×107 M−1 s−1) than with histidine ( kHis/CO3·¯=5.6×106 M−1 s−1). This may explain in part the partial protection of the Cu(II) active site of SOD1 in the presence of H2O2 and HCO3− as shown in Fig. 2 (right panel). Further characterization of the UV-induced radical at 8 K with resolved hyperfine features and their EPR computer simulation parameters (Tables I and II) clearly 2Radiation Chemistry Data Center, Notre Dame Radiation Laboratory, South Bend, IN (allen.rad.nd.edu/RCDC/RCDC/html). supports the formation of the Trp and Tyr radicals. The hyperfine splittings in Trp and Tyr radicals arise mainly from the β-methylene hydrogens as shown in Equations 8 and 9 (40Sahlin M. Graslund A. Ehrenberg A. Sjoberg B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 366-369Google Scholar, 41Stone E.W. Maki A.H. J. Chem.

Phys. 1962; 37: 1326-1333Google Scholar), and θ is the dihedral angle between the Hβ–Cβ bond and the p-orbital axis of C1, perpendicular to the plane of the aromatic ring. The dihedral angles (θ) in the Trp radical in human SOD1 (9Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 181-217Google Scholar) (from Protein Data Bank accession code 1SPD) and in the Tyr radical in bovine SOD1 (10Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Iqbal Z. Cayabyab A. Hung W.Y. Getzoff E.D. Hu P. Herzfeldt, B. Roos R.P. et al.Science. 1993; 261: 1047-1051Google Scholar) (from Protein Data Bank accession code 2SOD) were obtained from the x-ray crystal structure data. Using these θ values, the Aβ1H and Aβ2H were calculated and used for the simulation. The best fit anisotropic g and the hyperfine couplings of Trp and Tyr radicals in human SOD1 and bovine SOD1 are given in Tables I and II. Direct Probing of the Cu(II) Active Site by ENDOR—As shown in Fig. 2, the time-dependent EPR spectra of the SOD1/H2O2/HCO3− are broadened inhomogeneously, making it impossible to obtain hyperfine parameters from the coordinating histidine ligands. In contrast, the ENDOR spectroscopic technique enabled us to probe the Cu(II) active site and obtain additional hyperfine information from the coordinating histidines. Elam et al. (15Elam J.S. Malek K. Rodriguez J.A. Doucette P.A. Taylor A.B. Hayward L.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21032-21039Google Scholar) propose that the enzyme-associated non-diffusible oxidant, viz. HCO4−/CO3−·, formed at the active site reacts rapidly with the copper-bound histidines, resulting in HCO3−-enhanced enzyme inactivation during peroxidase activity (15Elam J.S. Malek K. Rodriguez J.A. Doucette P.A. Taylor A.B. Hayward L.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21032-21039Google Scholar). However, the present ENDOR data show that the coupled proton signals and the triplet signal due to Cu(II)-bound His in the 1H and 14N ENDOR spectra are present in the presence of HCO3− and H2O2 (Fig. 4, A and B). In the absence of HCO3−, the ENDOR spectra obtained from solutions containing Cu,Zn-SOD and H2O2 show drastic changes with regard to histidine at the active site geometry (Fig. 4, A and B). The ENDOR/EPR results reveal the following. (i) HCO3− preserves the copper coordination to histidine that is damaged by H2O2. (ii) The oxidant formed at the active site in the presence of HCO3−/H2O2 diffuses out of the active site and oxidizes Trp-32 to the Trp radical. In conclusion, using the low temperature EPR and ENDOR, we showed that H2O2 drastically alters the copper-histidine coordination at the active site that was partially inhibited by HCO3−. The observation of a Trp radical formed at the surface by EPR from the site-specific oxidation of Trp suggests that the active oxidant formed from HCO3− is diffusible, contrary to what had been proposed earlier (15Elam J.S. Malek K. Rodriguez J.A. Doucette P.A. Taylor A.B. Hayward L.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21032-21039Google Scholar), and clearly rules out the generation of “free hydroxyl radical” or an “enzyme-bound HCO4−” reactive intermediate in the active site. The proposed mechanism based on a site-specific inhibition of the damage of copper-bound histidine, CO3−⋅ radical generation, and its scavenging by antioxidants may lead to a better understanding of the oxidative hypothesis proposed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Understanding how GATA factors regulate development requires the elucidation of genetic circuits that control expression of GATA factor target genes and the GATA factors themselves. The C-terminal zinc finger of dual zinc finger GATA factors recognizes a simple DNA motif (WGATAR) (17Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Google Scholar, 18Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol.

In contrast, the N-terminal zinc finger mediates interactions with the friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1) 1The abbreviations used are: FOG-1, friend of GATA-1; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ER-GATA-1, estrogen receptor hormone binding domain fusion to GATA-1; FBS, fetal bovine serum; G1E, GATA-1 null proerythroblast-like cell line; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; MAE, mouse aortic endothelial; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; NK, neurokinin; NK-B, neurokinin-B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; YSEC, yolk sac endothelial cell(s); GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: FOG-1, friend of GATA-1; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ER-GATA-1, estrogen receptor hormone binding domain fusion to GATA-1; FBS, fetal bovine serum; G1E, GATA-1 null proerythroblast-like cell line; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; MAE, mouse aortic endothelial; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; NK, neurokinin; NK-B, neurokinin-B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; YSEC, yolk sac endothelial cell(s); GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. coregulator (21Tsang A.P.

Vandergon T.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2238-2247Google Scholar). Despite the high frequency of WGATAR in genomes, analyses of GATA-1 and GATA-2 binding to chromatin by quantitative ChIP analysis have revealed an exquisite specificity of chromatin occupancy. For example, the β-globin locus contains greater than 250 GATA motifs, but GATA-1 only occupies motifs within hypersensitive sites 1–4 of the β-globin LCR and within a subset of the β-globin promoters (24Johnson K.D. Grass J.D. Boyer M.E. Kiekhaefer C.M. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11760-11765Google Scholar, 25Letting D.L. Rakowski C. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1334-1340Google Scholar). Despite the more than 80 GATA motifs within the GATA-2 locus, GATA-1 only occupies motifs within a restricted upstream region (26Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Google Scholar, 27Pal S. Cantor A.B. Johnson K.D. Moran T. Boyer M.E. Orkin S.H. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 980-985Google Scholar). Thus, despite there being abundant GATA motifs within chromatin, including motifs that are conserved from mouse to humans, the vast majority of these motifs are not occupied by GATA factors in cells. ChIP analysis (27Pal S. Cantor A.B. Johnson K.D. Moran T. Boyer M.E. Orkin S.H. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 980-985Google Scholar) has also revealed GATA-1 occupancy at sites previously implicated as being GATA-1 targets: the aminolevulinate synthase-2 promoter, hypersensitive site 1 of the GATA-1 locus, and hypersensitive site –26 of the α-globin locus (28Surinya K.H.

The determinants of GATA factor recognition of chromatin are unknown, but presumably neighboring cis-elements, intrinsic features of GATA motifs, and the chromatin environment are crucial. Considering the lack of knowledge of these determinants, one cannot predict whether a given GATA motif will be occupied in vivo. Thus, establishing the ensemble of GATA factor target genes that control hematopoiesis cannot be accomplished solely by delineating the distribution of conserved GATA motifs. Genetic complementation analysis with a GATA-1 fusion to the estrogen receptor hormone binding domain in G1E cells has proven to be a powerful approach for defining GATA-1 target genes (27Pal S. Cantor A.B. Johnson K.D. Moran T. Boyer M.E. Orkin S.H. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 980-985Google Scholar, 33Rylski M. Welch J.J. Chen Y.Y. Letting D.L. Diehl J.A. Chodosh L.A. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5031-5042Google Scholar). The G1E cell line was derived from GATA-1-null embryonic stem cells, and G1E cells recapitulate the phenotype of adult bone marrow proerythroblasts (34Weiss M.J. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide array analysis in this system revealed that a similar number of genes is activated and repressed by ER-GATA-1 (33Rylski M. Welch J.J. Chen Y.Y. Letting D.L. Diehl J.A. Chodosh L.A. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5031-5042Google Scholar). Although GATA-1 was known to confer activation and repression in a context-dependent manner, it was surprising that a similar number of genes was activated and repressed, since few GATA-1-repressed genes were known. However, since gene-profiling analysis identifies both direct and indirect target genes, it is crucial to use other approaches, such as ChIP, to determine whether a given gene is a direct target. Insights into the mechanism of GATA-1-mediated repression have arisen from the observation that GATA-1 and GATA-2 have reciprocal expression patterns during hematopoiesis (1Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3368-3376Google Scholar). Consistent with this expression pattern, targeted deletion of GATA-1 resulted in up-regulation of GATA-2 (3Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Google Scholar, 34Weiss M.J. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Google Scholar). These results suggested that GATA-1 represses GATA-2 transcription. Since a mutant of GATA-1 impaired in binding FOG-1 was inefficient in repressing GATA-2 (22Crispino J.D. Lodish M.B. MacKay J.P. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 219-228Google Scholar), FOG-1 functions in the repression mechanism. We provided evidence for a direct repression mechanism in which GATA-1 displaces GATA-2 in a FOG-1-dependent manner from an upstream region of the GATA-2 locus (26Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Google Scholar, 27Pal S. Cantor A.B. Johnson K.D. Moran T. Boyer M.E. Orkin S.H. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 980-985Google Scholar). This GATA switch was temporally coupled with expulsion of the histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein from GATA-2 regulatory elements and broad deacetylation throughout the GATA-2 locus. We hypothesized that GATA-1 binding instigates a bimodal repression mechanism consisting of the GATA switch coupled with domain-wide deacetylation. To assess whether the bimodal repression mechanism is used by GATA-1 to repress other loci, we asked whether GATA-2 occupies the Nab2 (nerve growth factor-activated factor-binding protein 2) locus and whether GATA-1 displaces GATA-2. Nab2 was identified by gene profiling analysis as a GATA-1-repressed gene (33Rylski M. Welch J.J. Chen Y.Y. Letting D.L. Diehl J.A. Chodosh L.A. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5031-5042Google Scholar). Nab2 encodes a corepressor for the early growth regulator family of transcription factors, which mediate mitogen-induced cell proliferation (35Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Google Scholar, 36Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Golda T. Stanton J.J. Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6010-6019Google Scholar). Whereas extensive ChIP analysis throughout the Nab2 locus failed to identify sites occupied by GATA-1 and GATA-2, GATA-1 and GATA-2 occupancy was detected at intron-7 of the nearby Tac-2 gene, which encodes a NK-B proprotein (37Masu Y. Nakayama K. Tamaki H. Harada Y. Kuno M. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1987; 329: 836-838Google Scholar, 38Gerard N.P. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20455-20462Google Scholar). These results are discussed with respect to the underlying transcriptional mechanism and the consequences of GATA factor-mediated control of Tac-2 transcription. Cell Culture—G1E cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 2% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2 units/ml erythropoietin, 120 nm monothioglycerol (Sigma), 0.6% conditioned medium from a Kit ligand-producing Chinese hamster ovary cell line and 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen).

Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) and mouse aortic endothelial (MAE) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) containing 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS. Yolk sac endothelial cells (YSEC) were maintained in M200 medium (Cascade Biologics) supplemented with low serum growth supplement (Cascade Biologics) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. MAE cells were spontaneously immortalized from a BALB/c mouse but retain a normal endothelial cell phenotype (40Gumkowski F. Kaminska G. Kaminska M. Morrissey L.W. Auerbach R. Blood Vessels. 1987; 24: 11-23Google Scholar). YSEC were derived from a hypervascular transgenic mouse expressing the fps/fes protooncogene (41Lu L.S. Wang S.J. Auerbach R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 10: 14782-14787Google Scholar). However, they are not tumorigenic and exhibit a normal endothelial phenotype. Primary Erythroid Cell Isolation—Bone marrow cells were flushed from the hind limbs of young female C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) mice into PBS (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in PBS containing 2% FBS. The cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated TER119 or the appropriate isotype control antibodies (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 20 min at 4 °C with regular mixing at the concentrations recommended by the supplier. The cells were washed twice in PBS prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorting on a Vantage SE instrument (BD Biosciences) with a 488-nm argon laser. After sorting, TER119+ cells (∼20% of bone marrow cells) and TER119–cells were collected in PBS and concentrated by centrifugation. RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen). For ex vivo human erythropoiesis experiments, adult human erythroblasts were cultured from peripheral blood CD34+ cells as previously described (42Wojda U. Noel P. Miller J.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 3005-3013Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from these cells on culture days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 using Trizol. The isolated RNA was further processed by DNase I treatment (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Adult human reticulocytes were isolated from 20 ml of peripheral blood in heparin following a process of leukodepletion. Leukocytes were concentrated by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, forming a disc (buffy coat) at the plasma-red cell interface. Both the plasma and buffy coat were removed, and the cells were washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. At the third wash, reticulocytes were concentrated by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the top 700-μl reticulocyte-rich fraction was added to 4 ml of ice-cold PBS. This red cell suspension was layered on top of a column consisting of ∼4.5 ml of 2 parts cellulose (C-8002; Sigma) and 1 part sigmacell type 50 microcrystallin cellulose (S-5504; Sigma) in normal saline. The red cells were eluted by gently centrifuging the column at 1000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 min. This leukodepleted eluate (∼2.5 ml) was washed three times in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. Finally, the reticulocyte-enriched eluted cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. RNA was extracted with TRI reagent (T-9424; Sigma). Antibodies—Rat anti-GATA-1 (N-6, sc-265) and rabbit anti-GATA-2 (H-116, sc-9008) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against murine FOG-1 was described previously (21Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A. Fujuwara Y. Yu C. Weiss M.J. Crossley M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used as the secondary antibody for the GATA-1 ChIP analysis. Preimmune sera served as controls for all antibodies. Quantitative Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were grown in media containing 15% FBS with or without 1 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma) for various times as specified in the figure legends. Protein-DNA cross-linking was conducted by treating cells with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 0.4% (1% for FOG-1) for 10 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. Glycine (0.125 m) was added to quench the reaction, and real time PCR-based quantitative ChIP was conducted as described (24Johnson K.D. Grass J.D. Boyer M.E. Kiekhaefer C.M. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J.

Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was purified with Trizol. cDNA was prepared by annealing RNA (1 μg) with 250 ng of a 1:5 mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers at 68 °C for 10 min. This was followed by incubation with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) combined with 10 mm dithiothreitol, RNasin (Promega), and 0.5 mm dNTPs at 42 °C for 1 h. cDNA synthesis reactions were diluted to a final volume of 100 μl and heat-inactivated at 98 °C for 10 min. Reactions (25 μl) contained 2.5 μl of cDNA, 12.5 μl of SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, CA), and the appropriate primers. Product accumulation was monitored by SYBR Green fluorescence. Control reactions lacking RT yielded very low signals. Relative expression levels were determined from a standard curve of serial dilutions of G1E cDNA samples, and measurements were made under conditions in which signals were in the linear range. Real Time RT-PCR Primers—Real time RT-PCR primers were as follows: mouse GAPDH, TGCCCCCATGTTTGTGATG (forward) and TGTGGTCATGAGCCCTTCC (reverse); mouse Stat-6, CATAAGGTGGCACCATGGC (forward) and GCCATGGTGCCACCTTATG (reverse); mouse Nab2, GAGTGTTGTCCCTCATGCAGAA (forward) and TTCTGCATGAGGGACAACACTC (reverse); mouse Q8K2N3, TTCCTCCTCGGACTGACACTGT (forward) and CGATTAAGAGAGAGGCCACGAT (reverse); mouse Myo-1a, TCTTGTCGATGAAGCCGGTC (forward) and ACCGGCTTCATCGACAAGA (reverse); mouse Tac-2, GACGGAGGCAGCTGATAGAGA (forward) and TCTCTATCAGCTGCCTCCGTC (reverse); mouse Tac-1, GCAGAAGATGCTCAAAGGGCT (forward) and AGCCCTTTGAGCATCTTCTGC (reverse); mouse Nab1, CTGGCCAGGCAGGTTTCTC (forward) and TGGCACAGATTCCTGGAAGTC (reverse); mouse NK1, TTGTCATCTGGGTCCTGGCT (forward) and GTAGATCAGCACAGTCACACAGATGT (reverse); mouse NK2, ACCTGGCACTCTTCTGGCTG (forward) and GAAAGCAAGCCGGAATCCA (reverse); mouse NK3, CCAGAAGGTCCCAAGCAACAT (forward) and TGGGAAACAGTACACCAGGATG (reverse); human HPRT, ATTGGTGGAGATGATCTCTCAACTTT (forward) and GCCAGTGTCAATTATATCTTCCACAA (reverse); human TAC-3, TAAGGAGCCACAGGAGGAGGT (forward) and CCCTCCAGAGATGAGTGGCTT (reverse); human Nab2, CATCATCTATGGCCGTTTCGA (forward) and TTGGCGGGACAAAGAGAAGA (reverse); human β-globin, TCCTGAGGAGAAGTCTGCCGT (forward) and GGAGTGGACAGATCCCCAAAG (reverse); human GATA-1, TGGCCTACTACAGGGACGCT (forward) and CATATGGTGAGCCCCCTGG (reverse); human GATA-2, CCAGCTTCACCCCTAAGCAG (forward) and CCACAGTTGACACACTCCCG (reverse). Quantitation of cAMP Levels—MAE and YSEC cells (1 × 106) were resuspended in growth medium containing either 250 μm IBMX (Calbiochem), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX + 10 μm forskolin (Sigma), or IBMX + 50 μm NK-B (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by aspiration of the medium. Cells were washed with PBS and were lysed in 500 μl of HCl (0.1 n, 10 min). Cell lysates (100 μl) were assayed for cAMP using a Direct cAMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Assay Designs, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) after acetylation as recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, the cAMP assay utilizes a 96-well microtiter plate in which anti-cAMP antibody is immobilized. Cell lysates or cAMP standards are added in the presence of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated cAMP, and after a colorimetric reaction with phosphatase substrate, absorbance is measured at 405 nm under conditions of linearity. Tac-2 Transcription Is GATA-1-dependent and Is Induced upon Erythroid Differentiation—A previous microarray analysis revealed that the murine Nab2 gene (Fig. 1A) is repressed upon tamoxifen treatment of GATA-1-null G1E cells stably expressing ER-GATA-1 (G1E-ER-GATA-1) (33Rylski M. Welch J.J. Chen Y.Y. Letting D.L. Diehl J.A. Chodosh L.A. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5031-5042Google Scholar). Based on our previous analysis of the mechanism by which GATA-1 represses GATA-2 transcription (26Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Google Scholar, 27Pal S. Cantor A.B. Johnson K.D. Moran T. Boyer M.E. Orkin S.H. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 980-985Google Scholar), we aimed to compare the mechanism of GATA-1-mediated repression of GATA-2 and Nab2 to uncover principles for how GATA factors repress transcription. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that ER-GATA-1 repressed Nab2 by ∼4-fold (Fig. 1B), consistent with the microarray data (33Rylski M. Welch J.J. Chen Y.Y. Letting D.L. Diehl J.A. Chodosh L.A. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5031-5042Google Scholar). Since the 3′-end of Stat-6 abuts the 3′-end of Nab2 (Fig. 1A) (44Svaren J. Apel E.D. Simburger K.S. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.A. Milbrandt J. Genomics. 1997; 41: 33-39Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that ER-GATA-1 might activate Stat-6 transcription, thereby creating transcriptional interference (45Eszterhas S.K. Bouhassira E.E. Martin D.I. Fiering S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 469-479Google Scholar) or antisense transcripts (46Tufarelli C. Stanley J.A. Garrick D. Sharpe J.A. Ayyub H. Wood W.G. Higgs D.R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 157-165Google Scholar) that repress Nab2. However, Stat-6 mRNA was detected in G1E cells, and activation of ER-GATA-1 did not affect Stat-6 mRNA levels. We also tested whether the downstream genes, Myo-1a, Q8K2N3, and Tac-2 were regulated by ER-GATA-1. Q8K2N3 and Myo-1a were expressed but were unaffected by ER-GATA-1 activation, whereas Tac-2 mRNA was highly induced. Thus, ER-GATA-1 reciprocally regulates two nearby genes within an endogenous chromosomal region. Interestingly, Tac-2 encodes pro-NK-B, which is processed to yield NK-B (47Severini C. Improta G. Falconieri-Erspamer G. Salvadori S. Erspamer V. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 285-322Google Scholar). NK-B is expressed in neuronal tissues (48Kotani H. Hoshimaru M. Nawa H. Nakanishi S. Proc. Natl.

To determine whether Tac-2 is expressed in other erythroid cells, quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure Tac-2 mRNA in erythroid cell lines and in primary murine and human erythroid cells. Tac-2 expression was induced by tamoxifen in G1E-ER-GATA-1 but not G1E cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that ER-GATA-1 mediated the induction. Tac-2 was expressed in uninduced MEL cells, and expression was induced ∼2 fold upon Me2SO-induced erythroid maturation (Fig. 2A). GATA-1 expression is similar in uninduced and induced MEL cells. 2S. Pal and E. H. Bresnick, unpublished data. Tac-2 was also expressed in primary murine Ter119+ erythroid cells isolated from bone marrow (Fig. 2A). The major adult β-globin gene, βmajor, and Tac-2 shared a similar pattern of expression, being repressed in G1E cells, induced by tamoxifen in G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells, induced upon MEL cell maturation, and expressed in Ter119+ cells (Fig. 2A).

They share a common modular architecture with a central collagen sequence ranging from 14 to 16 Gly-X-Y repeats flanked by polyproline/hydroxyproline stretches and short terminal domains that show a conserved cysteine pattern (CXXXCXXXCXXX-CXXXCC). The minicollagen cysteine-rich domains are believed to function in a switch of the disulfide connectivity from intra- to intermolecular bonds during maturation of the capsule wall. The solution structure of the C-terminal fragment including a minicollagen cysteine-rich domain of minicollagen-1 was determined in two independent groups by 1H NMR. The corresponding peptide comprising the last 24 residues of the molecule was produced synthetically and refolded by oxidation under low protein concentrations. Both presented structures are identical in their fold and disulfide connections (Cys2-Cys18, Cys6-Cys14, and Cys10-Cys19) revealing a robust structural motif that is supposed to serve as the polymerization module of the nematocyst capsule.

Minicollagens of nematocysts in Hydra, corals, and other cnidaria are very unusual proteins with structural properties not shared by other invertebrate or vertebrate collagens. From both the N and C terminus of the collagen triple helix emerge three polyproline-II-type helices, which consist of 5–23 proline or hydroxyproline residues (1Vollmer S.V. Palumbi S.R. Science. 2002; 296: 2023-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Wang W. Omori M. Hayashibara T. Shimoike K. Hatta M. Sugiyama T. Fujisawa T.

Each of the polyproline-II-type helices is terminated by a small Cys-rich domain termed minicollagen Cys-rich domain (MCRD). 1The abbreviations used are: MCRD, minicollagen Cys-rich domain; NOWA, nematocyst outer wall antigen; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HBTU, O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetremethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; HOBt, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; DIEA, N,N-diisopropylethylamine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl; EGF, epidermal growth factor.1The abbreviations used are: MCRD, minicollagen Cys-rich domain; NOWA, nematocyst outer wall antigen; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HBTU, O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetremethyluronium hexafluorophosphate; HOBt, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; DIEA, N,N-diisopropylethylamine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Boc, t-butoxycarbonyl; EGF, epidermal growth factor. The N- and C-terminal MCRDs are homologous and share the cysteine pattern CXXXCXXXCXXXCXXXCC. A small propeptide region preceding the N-terminal MCRD is cleaved off during expression, and mature minicollagen has a rather symmetrical appearance with closely similar structural elements at both sides. This bipolar nature of minicollagen is unique among all other known collagens (4Bateman J.F. Lamande S.R. Ramshaw J.A.M. Comper W.D. Collagen Superfamily. Extracellular Matrix.

Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar) and suggests a special function. A unique function of minicollagen is also suggested by its restricted appearance in the capsule wall of nematocysts. Nematocysts are complex explosive organelles, which basically consist of a capsule, an inverted tubule armed with spines, and an operculum. The tubule is connected to the capsule wall and is twisted in many turns inside the osmotically charged capsule matrix. Following stimulation, the internal tube is expelled, the osmotic pressure is released, and the capsule contents including toxins are released at the tubule end. This specialized form of exocytosis proceeds with ultrafast rates and accelerations comparable to those of a fired bullet (8Holstein T. Tardent P. Science. 1984; 223: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The capsule wall resists more than 150 atmospheres of osmotic pressure in the charged state. For Hydra nematocysts it consists mainly of two proteins, minicollagen and nematocyst outer wall antigen (NOWA) (9Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Özbek S. Pertz O. Schwager M. Lustig A. Holstein T. Engel J. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The two proteins can be dissolved from capsule preparations only under reducing conditions. Already at a time when the amino acid sequence of minicollagens was unknown it was found that these collagens formed disulfide cross-linked polymers that were insoluble in SDS but easily soluble in the presence of a reducing agent (12Lenhoff H.M. Kline E.S. Hurley R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 204-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Blanquet R. Lenhoff H.M. Science. 1966; 154: 152-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Following the discovery of a family of minicollagens (3Kurz E.M. Holstein T.W. Petri B.M. Engel J. David C.N. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1159-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and recombinant expression of minicollagen-1 (9Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) it was found that the proteins are expressed in a soluble precursor form present in the endoplasmic reticulum and post-Golgi vacuoles in Hydra. They are converted to the disulfide-linked assembly form of the nematocyst wall upon wall compaction, during which a dense and well defined capsule wall is formed (9Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The morphological changes, a loss of accessibility to antibodies against minicollagen-1, and a parallel loss of solubility under non-reducing conditions suggested a close link between disulfide polymerization and the condensation of wall proteins. Both processes provide an explanation for the unusually high tensile strength of the mature nematocyst wall. Minicollagen-1 of Hydra recombinantly expressed in mammalian cells contains internal disulfide bonds in its MCRDs but no interchain disulfide cross-links between chains (9Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The trimeric collagen molecules dissociated into single chains when heated to 45 °C under non-reducing conditions (10Özbek S. Pertz O. Schwager M. Lustig A. Holstein T. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49200-49204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reduction did not influence this transition temperature, indicating that only the collagen domain is responsible for trimerization. Recombinant minicollagen-1 was found to form aggregates in electron micrographs but no disulfide bridges were formed spontaneously under in vitro conditions (9Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This material behaved like the precursor form in vivo and could be solubilized by SDS or other denaturants under non-reducing conditions. It was therefore concluded that disulfide isomerases or other external parameters are required for a disulfide reshuffling process by which internal disulfide bridges are converted to intermolecular links (14Özbek S. Engel U. Engel J. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). More recent results suggest that the structural function of minicollagens in wall hardening is complemented by NOWA (11Engel U. Özbek S. Engel R. Petri B. Lottspeich F. Holstein T.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Altogether 10 domains were identified in this protein, namely a SCP-domain (see Smart data base, smart.embl-heidelberg.de, smart00198), a C-type lectin domain (CTLD, smart00034), and eight C-terminal domains with homology to the MCRDs. In particular, the pattern of six cysteines is shared by the corresponding domains in NOWA and minicollagen. The presence of homologous Cys-rich domains in both proteins suggested a joint function in disulfide-mediated polymerization. Supportive evidence was obtained by the analysis of breakdown products of native nematocyst capsules after limited sonification without reduction. 2S. Özbek, E. Pokidysheva, M. Schwager, T.

Milbradt, L. Moroder, J. Engel, and T. W. Holstein, manuscript in preparation. Minicollagen and NOWA formed disulfide cross-linked units that, like the entire capsule, were readily dissolved under even mild reducing conditions. Disulfide reshuffling processes and the formation of disulfide-linked complexes are common mechanisms in the extracellular space, and some recently explored systems may be referenced (15Mullen G.E. Kennedy M.N. Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Leifer C.A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3919-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Wieringa R. De Vries A.A.

The minicollagen/NOWA system may stand as a prototype for the controlled formation of a highly stable matrix layer by disulfide linkage. To understand the assembly mechanism, the three-dimensional structure of the MCRDs involved is needed. The core of the MCRD consists of only 20 residues with 6 closely positioned Cys residues. At the start of this study it was not known whether the very small domains were autonomous or stable but only as part of a larger structure. The disulfide connections were also not known and could not be explored by limited proteolysis because of the lack of suitable cleavage sites. These problems were approached by solving the structure of the C-terminal Cys-rich domain of minicollagen-1 by NMR spectroscopy. A new fold was found, with disulfide connections between Cys2 and Cys18, Cys6 and Cys14, and Cys10 and Cys19. Oxidative folding occurs at high rates in the presence of an oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione redox buffer with formation of almost exclusively one single isomer. A highly conserved Pro residue located between Cys10 and Cys14 induces and probably directs correct disulfide connections. The presented structure proposes likely candidates for disulfide reshuffling supposed to be a key reaction during nematocyst morphogenesis. Preparation 1—The 6xStBu protected peptide Ac-PCPPVCVAQCVPTCPQYCCPAKRK-NH2 was synthesized on Fmoc-Rink-Amide polyethylene glycol-dimethylacrylamide copolymer resin by the Fmoc/tBu strategy using double couplings with Fmoc-Xaa-OH/HBTU/HOBt/DIEA (4:4:4:8), intermediate Fmoc cleavage with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide, and acetic anhydride/DIEA (4:8) for N-terminal acetylation. After resin cleavage/deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/H2O/thioanisole/1,2-ethanedithiol (82.5:5:5:5:2.5) the product was isolated by reverse phase-HPLC: yield = 6%; HPLC: tR = 12.5 min (>98%); electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry: m/z = 1055.0 [M+3H]3+; 1581.8 [M+2H]2+; Mr = 3162.31 calculated for C136H230N32O29S12. The Cys-protecting groups were cleaved in trifluoroethanol/H2O with tributylphosphine (60 eq) at room temperature for 5 h, and the resulting fully deprotected peptide was oxidized at pH 8.0 in the presence of GSSG/GSH (9 eq, 10:1) under air atmosphere at 7 °C. The crude product was purified by preparative size exclusion column chromatography, yield: 20%; HPLC: tR = 12.3 min (>98%); electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry: m/z = 1314.8 [M+2H]2+, 876.4 [M+3H]3+; Mr = 2627.23 calculated for C112H176N32O29S6. Preparation 2—The linear peptide was synthesized with an ABI 433A synthesizer. Couplings were carried out on a Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-polyethylene glycol-polystyrene resin (Perseptive Biosystems, 0.21 mmol/g) using Fmoc amino acids (Fmoc-Arg(Pbf), Fmoc-Lys(Boc), Fmoc-Tyr(tBu), Fmoc-Cys(trityl), and Fmoc-Gln(trityl)) (Anaspec). HATU (O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1.1.3.3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, (Perseptive Biosystems) (4.0 eq.)/diisopropylethylamine mediated peptide couplings. The peptide was cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid containing thioanisole (5% v/v), ethanedithiol (3% v/v), and anisole (2% v/v). After precipitation in diethylether, the crude peptide was purified by preparative HPLC (Vydac® C18, 10–15 μm, 300 Å, 250 × 50 mm, W.R. Grace, Columbia, MD). The peptide was characterized by electrospray ionization/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. A mass of 2590.9 Da was determined, and the expected amino acid composition was found. The lyophilized purified peptide was dissolved in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.0, containing 100 mm NaCl at a concentration of 0.02 mm. Folding was allowed to proceed under N2 for 72–96hat4 °C. Oxidation was induced by changing the pH to 8.0–8.1 with saturated Tris and the addition of reduced and oxidized glutathione (10:1 molar ratio) to a final concentration of 1 mm. The solution was exposed to air at 4 °C for 4–10 days. Oxidation was stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to give a pH of 1.3. The oxidized peptide was purified by preparative HPLC. The yield of oxidized peptide was 103 mg (16% of theoretical yield). Mass spectroscopy of the oxidized peptide showed a molecular mass of 2585.1 Da. Structure 1—NMR experiments for conformational analysis were carried out at 283 K on Bruker DRX500, DMX750, and DX900 spectrometers using a 3 mm sample of the peptide dissolved in a H2O/D2O (9:1) mixture at pH 3.5. Resonance assignments were performed according to the method of Wüthrich (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). 173 experimental interproton distance constraints were extracted from two-dimensional-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (39Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachman P. Ernst R.R.J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4805) Google Scholar) experiments with mixing times between 75 and 200 ms. Five hydrogen bonds were identified from temperature shifts and 1H/2H exchange. Acceptor carbonyl groups were identified in initial structure calculations. The nuclear Overhauser effect intensities were converted into interproton distance constraints using the classifications of very strong, 1.7–2.3 Å; strong, 2.2–2.8 Å; medium, 2.6–3.4 Å; weak, 3.0–4.0 Å; very weak, 3.2–4.8 Å, and the distances of pseudo atoms were corrected as described by Wüthrich (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Distance geometry and molecular dynamics-simulated annealing calculations were performed with the INSIGHTII 98.0 software package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) on Silicon Graphics O2 R5000 computers (SGI, Mountain View, CA) as described recently (25Milbradt A.G. Kerek F. Moroder L. Renner C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2404-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In brief, one hundred structures were generated by distance geometry and refined with molecular dynamics-simulated annealing steps. The experimental constraints were applied at every stage of the calculations. The coordinates and structural restraints have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under accession number 1SOP. Structure 2—The chemically synthesized C-terminal MCRD of minicollagen-1 was purified after oxidation according to purification procedure 2. The determination of the NMR structure (PDB accession number 1SP7) was carried out in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 15 °C by using homonuclear and heteronuclear techniques and information from weak alignment (44Meier S. Häussinger D. Pokidysheva E. Bächinger H.P. Grzesiek S. FEBS Lett. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Structure representations were generated with MOLMOL (43Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51–55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6450) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) equipped with 12-mm Epon double-sector cells in an An-60 Ti rotor. The MCRD was analyzed in 5 mm Tris buffer, pH 7, either without salt or with 100 mm NaCl at 20 °C. The peptide concentrations were adjusted to 0.2–0.8 mm. Sedimentation equilibrium scans were carried out at 48,000 rpm. Molecular masses were evaluated from ln A versus r2 plots, where A is the absorbance at 277 nm and r is the distance from the rotor center. A partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g was used for all calculations. The MCRD Constitutes a Conserved Sequence Module in Nematocyst Minicollagens and in NOWA—The sequence of minicollagen-1 with domain indications and the alignment of cysteine-rich domains from different minicollagens and NOWA are represented in Fig. 1. Minicollagen-1 consists of an N-terminal MCRD, N-terminal polyproline region, a central collagen sequence, and a shorter C-terminal polyproline stretch followed by a C-terminal MCRD (Fig. 1A). The preceding propeptide is cleaved off during the recombinant expression of minicollagen-1 and probably also in Hydra (9Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As already mentioned in the Introduction the overall sequence homology of the Cys-rich domains is not very high, but the cysteine pattern is identical for all minicollagens and for the eight C-terminal domains of NOWA with the only variation being in the number of residues spacing the first two Cys residues. The sequence of the C-terminal minicollagen-1 MCRD, which has been investigated in the present study, is underlined and the numbering of residues corresponds to the synthetic peptides used in this study (Fig. 1B). Beside the cysteines there is only one conserved residue, which is Pro12 (Fig. 1B, shown in purple). Peptide Synthesis and Oxidation—As the MCRD occurs in different molecular contexts, at the N- and C-terminal extensions of minicollagen molecules as well as eight times repeated at the C terminus of NOWA, we speculated that it might constitute an isolated domain with the capacity of independent folding. Peptide synthesis was carried out for the C-terminal MCRD of minicollagen-1 starting with the last proline residue of the C-terminal polyproline stretch and including the charged C terminus of the full-length molecule. The formation of disulfide bonds occurs in the presence of a redox buffer at 100 μm peptide concentrations to avoid aggregation by intermolecular disulfide bonds (see “Experimental Procedures”). The final product showed a single peak in mass spectroscopic analysis with the reduced and oxidized MCRDs having a difference in molecular weight of 6 Da, thereby strongly indicating the formation of three intramolecular disulfide bonds (Table I). Disulfide bonds can be shown to be all intramolecular in mass spectroscopic analysis. Analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed the absence of significant aggregation or multimerization in solutions from 0.2 to 0.8 mm total peptide concentration (Table I), which was further supported by 1HN NMR T2 relaxation times of more than 100 ms at 25 °C indicative of the prevalence of a monomeric state in solutions of 1.6 mm MCRD.Table IMolar masses of the C-terminal MCRD peptide of minicollagen-1Molar mass UCMolar mass MSMolar mass calculatedg/molg/molg/molMCol1hC reduced25912592MCol1hC oxidized2700 ± 300aAverage of five determinations in the concentration range of 0.2-0.8 mm; S.D. is indicated.25852586a Average of five determinations in the concentration range of 0.2-0.8 mm; S.D. is indicated. Open table in a new tab The NMR Structure of the MCRD—The solution structure of the MCRD was determined independently from two separate peptide preparations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both structures show an identical tightly packed globular fold (Figs. 2 and 3), which consists of a short N-terminal α-helix between Val5 and Gln9 followed by an inverse γ-turn (Gln9-Val11), a type I β-turn (Val11-Cys14), and a type III β-turn (Pro15-Cys18). Thus cysteines 6, 10, 14, and 18 are directly located in turns, whereas cysteine 2 is located in a proline-rich N-terminal sequence, and cysteine 19 is oriented presumably by the β-III turn and a C-terminal proline. All proline residues in the MCRD are in trans conformation as evidenced by specific nuclear Overhauser effects.Fig. 3Stereo view of the same conformer as in Fig. 2 in ribbon presentation. Only structure 2 is shown. Cysteines and disulfide bonds are shown in yellow and Pro12 is in aquamarine. Disulfide bonds (Cys2-Cys18, Cys6-Cys14 and Cys10-Cys19) as well as the conserved Pro12 are indicated in ball-and-stick representation. Dashed lines indicate the hydrogen bonds identified by MOLMOL. These are bonds between Val5 (O) and Gln9 (HN), Val11 (O) and Cys14 (HN), and Pro15 (O) and Cys18 (HN). The first H-bond belongs to the α-helix, others belong to the three different turns. Pro12 induces a β I turn from residues 11 to 14. All proline residues in the structure can be shown to be in trans conformation from experimental nuclear Overhauser effect distance information.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The only conserved residue Pro12 (Fig. 1B) imposes a β-I turn topology on residues 11–14 because of its fixed ϕ angle of –60°. Hydrogen bonds are established in the turns between Val5 (O) and Gln9 (HN), Gln9 (O) and Val11 (HN), Val11 (O) and Cys14 (HN), and Pro15 (O) and Cys18 (HN) (Fig. 3), respectively, as derived both from the calculated structures and from the slow 1H/2H exchange upon lyophilization of MCRD and redissolving in 2H2O. The positively charged C terminus of Lys22, Arg23, and Lys24 is flexibly disordered and does not contribute to the MCRD structure (Fig. 2). The first disulfide bond, Cys2-Cys18, clasps the N and C termini of the domain, whereas the Cys6-Cys14 bond connects the N-terminal α-helix to the type I β-turn starting with Val11, thus forming the core of the MCRD structure. The third disulfide bond Cys10-Cys19 is more exposed to the C-terminal surface of the domain and constrains the polypeptide backbone into two consecutive turns. The more surface-exposed N- and C-terminal disulfide bridges represent the most likely candidates for intermolecular disulfide exchange reactions. Complete reduction of the disulfide bonds with an excess of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride at pH 7.5 results in a complete unfolding without retaining local conformational preferences as well assessed by 1H NMR. Reoxidation of reduced MCRD with an excess of oxidized glutathione at pH 7.5 proceeds extremely fast and is completed within 2 h as observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 4). This is presumably because of the small domain size and the effect of Pro12 upon disulfide bridge formation (see Discussion). Fluorescence spectroscopy allows the monitoring of the refolding due to the quenching of Tyr17 fluorescence by a nearby disulfide bridge and yields a folding half-time of 1.5 h at pH 8 upon oxygen saturation of the solution in agreement with NMR data (not shown). Model of Trimeric Minicollagen-1—It has already been mentioned that minicollagen-1 at native conditions appears to be a non-covalent trimer. A schematic representation of the trimeric minicollagen molecule including the connections of the N- and C-terminal MCRDs to the polyproline type II helices is shown in Fig. 5. A model of trimeric minicollagen-1 was proposed earlier (9Engel U. Pertz O. Fauser C. Engel J. David C.N. Holstein T.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3063-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in which the MCRD was assumed to have a linear structure. After elucidation of the structure of the MCRD we are now able to draw a schematic model in scale with the known dimensions of the collagen triple helix and the polyproline-II helix (4Bateman J.F. Lamande S.R. Ramshaw J.A.M. Comper W.D. Collagen Superfamily. Extracellular Matrix. Molecular Components and Interactions. 2. Harwood Academic Publisher, Amsterdam1996Google Scholar). An open question is the geometry of the connections between the collagen and polyproline parts of the molecule and between MCRDs and polyprolines, respectively. The angles and flexibility at the junction sequence APLP in the N terminus and the single Ala spacer in the C terminus (Fig. 1, shown in black) or by any Pro residue that potentially can occur in cis conformation are not known. The lack of association between MCRDs even at relatively high concentrations would suggest that they also do not associate in minicollagen without the help of an isomerase or another catalytic system. Polyproline or polyhydroxyproline-II helices are also known to be monomeric. For these reasons the polyproline arms with their MCRD heads are displayed as non-interacting entities in Fig. 5. This is confirmed by previous biochemical data showing that minicollagen-1 trimers are not disulfide-cross-linked and the triple helix is stabilized solely by the collagen sequence composition (10Özbek S. Pertz O. Schwager M. Lustig A. Holstein T. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49200-49204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ways that MCRDs are linked to the main molecule are shown schematically (Fig. 5, red arrows) in the upper (N-terminal) and the lower (C-terminal) part of Fig. 5. The polyproline-II helices approach the MCRDs from the N terminus for the C-terminal domain and from C terminus for the N-terminal domain. The connections between the polyproline-II helices and the MCRDs might alter the accessibility of particular disulfide bridges in the MCRD. As can be seen from the comparison of Figs. 3 and 5, in the N-terminal MCRD the Cys10-Cys19 disulfide is less exposed. An opposite situation is observed in the C terminus where the polyproline-II stretch hides the Cys2-Cys18 bridge. Accordingly the suggested candidates for intermolecular disulfide exchange are Cys2-Cys18 for the N-terminal and Cys10-Cys19 for the C-terminal MCRD. Small Cys-rich domains are widely distributed building blocks of extracellular proteins in essentially all phyla including plants and bacteria. The most abundant domain type is the epidermal growth factor domain (EGF, smart00181). Including its variants EGFca (smart00179) and EGF-like (smart0001) several thousands of different EGF-domains are known in proteins of different functions. In most cases EGF domains are arranged in arrays with other domains. Laminin (20Engel J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10643-10651Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and fibrillin (21Handford P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) are two of very many examples. Many Cys-rich domains, however, also exist as single autonomous proteins, and the epidermal growth factor domain is a well known example. This fact provides a bridge to the numerous low molar mass Cys-rich proteins, which are also products of larger precursor forms but express their function as toxins, antimicrobial peptides, or other small bioactive agents. Variations of sequences, cysteine patterns, and three-dimensional structures are, however, very large for this diverse class of small proteins, and clear"
https://openalex.org/W2106258536,"Granzymes are trypsin-like serine proteases mediating apoptotic cell death that are composed of two genetically distinct subfamilies: granzyme A-like proteases resemble trypsin in their active site architecture, while granzyme B-like proteases are quite distinct. Granzyme B prefers substrates containing P4 to P1 amino acids Ile/Val, Glu/Met/Gln, Pro/Xaa, and aspartic acid N-terminal to the proteolytic cleavage. By investigating the narrow extended specificity of the granzyme B-like proteases the mediators of their unique specificity are being defined. The foci of this study were the structural determinants Ile99, Tyr174, Arg192, and Asn218. Even modest mutations of these residues resulted in unique extended specificity profiles as determined using combinatorial substrate libraries and individual fluorogenic substrates. As with other serine proteases, Ile99 completely defines and predicts P2 specificity, primarily through the binding constant Km. Asn218 variants have minor effects alone but in combination with mutations at Arg192 and Ile99 alter P2 through P4 extended specificity. For each variant, the activity on its cognate substrate was equal to that of granzyme B for the same substrate. Thus, mutations at these determinants change extended selectivity preferentially over catalytic power. Additionally Asn218 variants result in increased activity on the wild type substrate, while the N218A/I99A variant disrupts the additivity between P2 and P4 specificity. This defines Asn218 not only as a determinant of specificity but also as a structural component required for P2 and P4 independence. This study confirms four determinants of granzyme B extended substrate specificity that constitute a canon applicable to the study of the remaining family members.

Cytotoxic lymphocytes serve as the major immune system defense against virally and tumor-infected cells (1Hudig D. Gregg N.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 882-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). They efficiently initiate apoptosis in the target cell by the directional release of cytotoxic granules containing the granzyme family of serine proteases, the pore-forming protein perforin, and proteoglycans (2Trapani J.A. Genome Biol. 2001; 2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The granzymes are trypsin-like serine proteases expressed as preproproteases. The pre region targets them to the granules where activation occurs through the proteolytic processing of the pro region by dipeptidyl protease 1 (3Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Granzyme B homologues have been located on rat, mouse, and human chromosomes 14 in a tightly linked gene cluster with chymase, cathepsin G, rat mast cell protease, and granzymes C through H (11Heusel J.W.

Despite the homology, these proteases have five identified or predicted primary specificities and unique substrates (13Kam C.M. Hudig D. Powers J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The specific interactions that determine these narrow extended substrate specificities may occur through a constellation of amino acids located on the highly variable loops surrounding the active site (14Hof P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and their optimization for specific recognition of one to two amino acids has been demonstrated. Compared with trypsin, the granzyme B-like serine proteases are missing the disulfide-linked cysteines at 191 and 220, have a truncated loop containing a cis-Pro at amino acid 224, and have the primary S1 specificity determinant translocated to amino acid 226. This amino acid is Arg in granzyme B, and it makes a salt bridge interaction with the P1-Asp of the substrate (22Waugh S.M. Harris J.L. Fletterick R. Craik C.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutating 226 to Asp results in a protease with P1 basic specificity against ester substrates (23Caputo A. Parrish J.C. James M.N. Powers J.C. Bleackley R.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the successful efforts to alter trypsin to chymotrypsin specificity required grafting entire active site loops and second shell mutagenesis (19Hedstrom L. Szilagyi L. Rutter W.J.

Thus the primary binding site in the granzyme B proteases exhibits remarkable accommodation, and engineering the P1 specificity is perhaps less difficult. In this subfamily, S1 has evolved to the chymase preference for aromatic amino acids Phe and Tyr (16McGrath M.E. Mirzadegan T. Schmidt B.F.

This study seeks to demonstrate, through site-directed mutagenesis, the role of amino acids identified by the crystal structure of rat granzyme B in the selective modification of its specificity. The contributions of subfamily-specific amino acids were probed with a series of variants constructed along the active site binding cleft. Eight single and three combination variants were designed with substitutions at Tyr174, Ile99, Arg192, and Asn218. We used P1 to P4 positional scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries (PSSCLs) 3The abbreviations used are: PSSCL, positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; pNA, p-nitroanilide; ACC, 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; OtBu, tert-butoxy; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. of substrates to screen each variant for changes in specificity and designed individual substrates to probe kinetic activity through Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The steady state kinetic constants reveal the extent of the specificity changes and are used to dissect the effect of each mutation on the selectivity of granzyme B.

The QuikChange mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. All oligonucleotide primers and the Pichia pastoris expression system were purchased from Invitrogen.

Alignment of Granzyme B Subfamily Serine Proteases—Rat granzyme B 4The amino acid sequence of rat granzyme B is found under the NCBI accession number NP_612526 or Swiss-Prot accession number 18291. was used as a query to find related granzyme and granule proteases from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) using PSI-BLAST (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Anang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) and HSSP (31Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 9: 56-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). The sequences were aligned using ClustalW 8.1. The three-dimensional structure of rat granzyme B in a complex with ecotin (81IEPD84) was used to determine amino acids with side chain atoms within 4 Å of the substrate amino acid side chains. Amino acids were also evaluated that contact small molecule inhibitors in the human granzyme B, chymase, cathepsin G, and rat mast cell protease II structures. 5The atomic coordinates of the analyzed structures are available from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank under the following identification numbers: rat granzyme B, 1FI8; human granzyme B, 1FQ3 and 1IAU; chymase, 1PJP and 1KLT; cathepsin G, 1AU8 and 1CGH; and rat mast cell protease II, 3RP2. Variants of Rat Granzyme B—The wild type, R192A, and R192E rat granzyme B constructs were prepared as described previously (10Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Additional variants of wild type rat granzyme B were constructed using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). The following 5′ to 3′ primers were made to introduce point mutations into the pPICZαA plasmid (mutations are underlined): I99A, CCA GCG TAT AAT TCT AAG ACA GCC TCC AAT GAC ATC ATG CTG; I99F, CCA GCG TAT AAT TCT AAG ACA TTC TCC AAT GAC ATC ATG CTG; I99R, CCA GCG TAT AAT TCT AAG ACA AGA TCC AAT GAC ATC ATG CTG; Y174A, GT GAG TCC TAC TTA AAA AAT GCT TTC GAC AAA GCC AAT GAG ATA; N218A, GGC ATC GTC TCC TAT GGA CAA GCT GAT GGT TCA ACT CCA CGG GCA; N218T, GGC ATC GTC TCC TAT GGA CAA ACT GAT GGT TCA ACT CCA CGG GCA. Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing with primers to the 5′ alcohol oxidase and 3′ alcohol oxidase regions. The resulting plasmid was transformed into X33 cells and selected with Zeocin (Invitrogen). All granzyme B variants were expressed and purified to homogeneity by the wild type protocol (10Harris J.L.

Activity was monitored in the supernatant using 1 μm Ac-AAD-pNA during expression. Following purification each variant was exchanged into a buffer containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 100 mm NaCl, quantified by absorbance at 280 nm (A280 = 22,900 m-1 cm-1), titrated with wild type or M84D ecotin (10Harris J.L.

Positional Scanning Synthetic Combinatorial Libraries—Both the completely diversified and P1-Asp PSSCLs were measured into Microfluor black 96-well plates (DYNEX Technologies, Chantilly, VA) and diluted to a final concentration of 250 μm. Thus the tetrapeptide substrates in each pool are at a concentration far below the expected Km of the variant protease, and the initial rates are proportional to the specificity constant kcat/Km. The granzyme B variants were assayed for activity against Ac-IEPD-AMC and diluted in granzyme activity buffer (50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) to concentrations between 50 nm and 1 μm that yielded PSSCL activity levels approximately equal to 50 nm wild type granzyme B. Initially each variant was assayed in the P1 sublibrary of a tetrapeptide complete diverse PSSCL. 6Y. Choe, in preparation. It consists of 20 spatial arrayed pools of 8000 fluorogenic tetrapeptide ACC substrates where the P1 amino acid is fixed (cysteine was deleted and norleucine (2-aminohexanoic acid) was included), while the P2, P3, and P4 amino acids consist of equimolar amino acid mixtures. To increase the signal to noise ratio and reduce the number of assayed peptide substrates, the P1-Asp 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-based PSSCL used to profile caspases and human (9Thornberry N.A.

Each sublibrary consists of 19 pools containing 361 peptides, one each for the spatially addressed amino acids (cysteine and methionine are deleted, and d-alanine and norleucine (2-aminohexanoic acid) are included). Enzymatic activity in the PSSCL was assayed for 1 h at 30 °C on a SpectraMAX Gemini fluorometric plate reader (Amersham Biosciences), and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was analyzed with the SOFTmax PRO software (Version 3.1.1, Amersham Biosciences). Excitation and emission were measured at 380 and 450 nm, respectively. Synthesis of ACC Substrates—Rink resin-conjugated ACC-Asp(OtBu)-Fmoc was subjected to standard solid phase peptide synthesis, acylated, and cleaved by trifluoroacetic acid (32Chan C. White D.P. Fmoc Solid Phase Synthesis: a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar). The resulting substrates were purified to homogeneity by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 column (Vydac, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) with a 20–60% gradient of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, 95% acetonitrile. The molecular weight of each substrate was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The concentration of each substrate stock solution was verified by total hydrolysis of the ACC or AMC leaving group using saturating amounts of wild type granzyme B. Briefly a measured amount of each substrate was exposed to saturating amounts of enzyme, and the total fluorescence was measured over multiple days until all of the substrate was hydrolyzed. Individual Kinetic Measurements—Individual kinetic measurements were performed using a SpectraMAX Gemini fluorometric plate reader. Each protease was diluted to between 50 nm and 1 μm in assay buffer. All ACC substrates were diluted in Me2SO to between 5 and 500 μm, while AMC substrates were diluted to between 20 and 2000 μm. Each assay contained less than 5% (v/v) Me2SO. Enzymatic activity was monitored every 15 s at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively, for a total of 10 min. Rates of substrate hydrolysis were determined using the SOFTmax PRO data analysis software (Version 3.1.1, Amersham Biosciences) and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kaleidagraph (Version 3.5, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). When the apparent Km values for a substrate were greater than 2.2 mm, only kcat/Km was reported. The substrates were assayed for hydrolysis by granzyme B and variants at least twice in duplicate.

Amino acid 226 has been identified as the primary determinant of P1 specificity, and the determinants His57, Leu172, Phe191, Gln180, and Tyr215 vary between two or fewer amino acids in the subfamily or are absolutely required for catalytic activity (24Hedstrom L.

Thus many potential determinants of specificity from crystallographic studies can be excluded from mutagenic studies because of known structural characteristics independent of extended specificity. Initial activity in the complete diverse PSSCL indicated that all granzyme B variants specifically and uniquely hydrolyzed substrates containing P1 aspartic acid (data not shown). This result is consistent with the strict specificity of granzyme B for aspartic acid (29Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The complete diverse library is made up of 16,000 sublibrary member substrates per well where P1 is aspartic acid in just 1/20 of them. By fixing the P1 amino acid and profiling with a P1-Asp-AMC PSSCL, the number of sublibrary member substrates was decreased to 400 per well increasing the signal to noise ratio. Since the focus of the PSSCL was to report alterations in substrate specificity, the reported activity in each well of the library is shown as a fraction of the highest rate at the substrate position. This format highlights the specificity changes upon mutation but masks the relative activity of each subsite. PSSCL Reveals Extended Specificity Changes upon Mutagenesis—The PSSCL was used to profile the specificity changes for each variant. Initially alanine substitution was used to detect the importance of each amino acid to the specificity profile of granzyme B. The I99A variant had a large effect on the PSSCL specificity profiles at the P2 position. The mutation increased the hydrolysis of P2-Phe or -Tyr substrates and reduced the hydrolysis of non-hydrophobic side chains without altering the P3 or P4 profiles (Fig. 2). Activity for the P2 amino acid Phe was 9 times the activity for Pro in the PSSCL and extended to tetrapeptide substrates where the specificity constants, kcat/Km, for Ac-IEPD-AMC and Ac-IEFD-AMC were 5-fold different, 57 and 268 m-1 s-1, respectively (Table I).Table ISpecificity constants for granzyme B variants Steady state kinetic specificity constants (kcat/Km) for Ac-IEPD-AMC and one contrasting substrate illustrate the magnitude of specificity alteration for the variants.

Asn218 was replaced with Ala to probe the role of the hydrogen bond observed between the amino group of Asn218 and the carboxyl group of the ecotin Glu83 in the three-dimensional structure (22Waugh S.M. Harris J.L. Fletterick R. Craik C.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). N218A granzyme B did not change the P2 or P4 specificity profiles but decreased the preference for PSSCL substrates with Glu at the P3 position, broadened the number of accepted P3 amino acids to include Ser and Ala, and increased the preference for Met and Gln (Fig. 2). Hydrolysis of Ac-IKPD-AMC (where boldface denotes the amino acid that is different from the wild type sequence) by N218A granzyme B was increased >2-fold compared with wild type activity from 99 to 220 m-1 s-1, whereas hydrolysis of Ac-IEPD-AMC was reduced from 3300 to 2200 m-1 s-1 (Table I). Finally the Y174A variant exhibited no alteration in the PSSCL profile preferring the canonical P4-Ile, P3-Glu, and P2-Pro sequence (Fig. 2). Instead the specificity constant for Y174A granzyme B was ∼10-fold less than the wild type (470 versus 3300 m-1 s-1). Because the specificity did not change despite the enlargement of the S4 pocket, the Y174A mutation probably does not play a direct role in the selection of the P4 amino acid. The alanine mutations revealed extensive alterations in substrate specificity except at the P4 position where Ile and Val continued to dominate, so a series of variations based on subfamily homology was designed. The I99R and I99F variants test amino acids found in other members of the granzyme subfamily. Phe99 occurs in the human homolog of rat granzyme B, while Arg99 is found in granzymes A and C (Fig. 1B). The I99F variant retains the wild type granzyme B preference for Ile-Glu-Pro by the PSSCL, but there is an increase in the specificity of P4-Leu substrates (Fig. 3). The preference for P4-Ile versus P4-Leu tetrapeptide substrates is reduced to 2.6-fold for I99F granzyme B where the specificity constants are 510 and 200 m-1 s-1, respectively (Table I). In the variant I99R, a hydrophobic preference at P2 appears, but it is less apparent than that in the I99A variant. Here Pro and Phe tetrapeptide substrates are hydrolyzed with similar specificity constants (330 and 505 m-1 s-1, respectively). Asn218 was replaced to probe the role of the hydrogen bond between it and the carboxylate group of Glu82 in ecotin. Mutations were designed to test this interaction individually and in combination with mutations of Arg192. The N218T variant had decreased preference for the PSSCL substrates containing Glu at the P3 position, a broader number of accepted P3 amino acids including Ser and Ala, and increased preference for Met and Gln (Fig. 3). The mutation did not change the P2 or P4 profiles. However, the hydrolysis of Ac-IEPD-AMC was faster by the N218T variant than by the wild type protease. Ala was the most preferred P3 amino acid, while the specificity constant for basic amino acids such as Lys remained less than 10-fold the value for Glu (600 versus 6200 m-1 s-1) (Table II). The R192A/N218A variant had no change at P2 and P4, an increased preference for Ala and Ser at P3 (Fig. 4), and a slight preference for Glu over Lys. This variant also had lo"

In both clones, the transposon had integrated into the locus encoding a homologue of human ALG12, which encodes a dolichyl-P-Man: Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl-α6-mannosyltransferase. Conventional knock-out of ALG12 in a wild-type background gave an identical phenotype to the mariner mutants, and biochemical analysis confirmed that they have the same defect in the N-linked oligosaccharide synthesis pathway. To our surprise, both mariner mutants were homozygous; the second allele appeared to have undergone gene conversion by the mariner-targeted allele. Subsequent experiments showed that the frequency of gene conversion at the ALG12 locus, in the absence of selection, was 0.25%.

The medical and economic relevance of Trypanosoma brucei and the many peculiarities of this differently evolved parasite (1Cross G.A.M. Int. J.

Among the many important adaptations that occur during the life cycle of T. brucei, the change of its surface coat is crucial. In the infectious bloodstream and metacyclic forms, the cell surface is covered by the variant surface glycoprotein. Upon differentiation in the tsetse (Glossina), variant surface glycoprotein is shed and replaced by members of the procyclin family of GPI 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ALG, asparagine-linked glycosylation; ConA, concanavalin A; IR, inverted repeat; LOH, loss of heterozygosity; OSL, oligosaccharide-lipid; ORF, open reading frame; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; PNGase F, N4(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F; RNAi, RNA interference; PP, pyrophosphoryl; HF, hydrogen fluoride.1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ALG, asparagine-linked glycosylation; ConA, concanavalin A; IR, inverted repeat; LOH, loss of heterozygosity; OSL, oligosaccharide-lipid; ORF, open reading frame; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; PNGase F, N4(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F; RNAi, RNA interference; PP, pyrophosphoryl; HF, hydrogen fluoride.-anchored glycoproteins. There are two major classes of procyclins, dubbed EP- and GPEET-procyclins, according to the sequence of amino acid repeats that comprise about 50% of the protein (4Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schurch N. Butikofer P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). EP-procyclins contain up to 30 Glu-Pro repeats, whereas GPEET-procyclins have five or six Gly-Pro-Glu-Glu-Thr repeats followed by the sequence (Glu-Pro)3-Gly (5Roditi I. Carrington M. Turner M.J.

In T. brucei Lister 427, the EP-procyclin isoforms are encoded by the EP1, EP2, and EP3 genes (4Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schurch N. Butikofer P. Mol. Biochem.

Butikofer P. Engstler M. Jelk J. Roditi I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the major advances in reverse genetics approaches to study T. brucei (14Clayton C.E. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 372-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Beverley S.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), tools that would allow large scale functional analysis of its genome are urgently needed. Even though African trypanosomes undergo some so far uncharacterized forms of genetic exchange in the tsetse salivary glands (16Tait A. Masiga D. Ouma J. MacLeod A. Sasse J. Melville S. Lindegard G. McIntosh A. Turner M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), just the fact that this only happens in the fly severely restricts its application to genetic analysis. On the other hand, transposon mutagenesis could potentially provide a valuable tool for forward genetics in T. brucei. Members of the mariner/Tc1 superfamily are probably the most widespread DNA transposons in nature (17Hartl D.L. Lohe A.R. Lozovskaya E.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 337-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Hartl D.L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 471-476PubMed Google Scholar). Transposition occurs via a nonreplicative cut-and-paste mechanism, in which a staggered double-stranded break at each end of the transposable element releases it from the donor DNA molecule, freeing it to be ligated into a staggered cut at the target site (19Dawson A. Finnegan D.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 225-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transposition is independent of host-specific factors (20Lampe D.J. Churchill M.E.A. Robertson H.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5470-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), which has allowed mariner to be used for gene disruption in a variety of organisms, including Leishmania (21Gueiros-Filho F.J. Beverley S.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), nematodes (22Bessereau J.L. Wright A. Williams D.C. Schuske K. Davis M.W. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and vertebrates (23Fadool J.M. Hartl D.L. Dowling J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5182-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Sherman A. Dawson A. Mather C. Gilhooley H. Li Y. Mitchell R. Finnegan D. Sang H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 1050-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have used the MosI mariner transposon from Drosophila mauritiana (25Medhora M. Maruyama K. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1991; 128: 311-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 1.3-kb transposon is flanked by 28-bp inverted repeats and encodes a single protein of 345 amino acids, the transposase. MosI integrates at a TA dinucleotide, which is duplicated upon insertion (reviewed in Ref. 17Hartl D.L. Lohe A.R. Lozovskaya E.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 337-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). By expressing MosI transposase constitutively, from a chromosomally integrated gene, and supplying a transposable donor cassette on a single-copy autonomously replicating plasmid (26Patnaik P.K. Kulkarni S. Cross G.A.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2529-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we were able to build a system that gives a high transposition efficiency in cell populations of unlimited size, which would not be possible if the system depended upon transient transfection of the mariner components. As a test of the system, we decided to select mutants that resisted the cytotoxic effects of concanavalin A (ConA), which binds to the N-glycans on the EP1 and EP3 procyclins and kills procyclic T. brucei via an unknown mechanism that resembles programmed cell death in metazoa (27Welburn S.C. Dale C. Ellis D. Beecroft R. Pearson T.W. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pearson T.W. Beecroft R.P. Welburn S.C. Ruepp S. Roditi I. Hwa K.Y. Englund P.T. Wells C.W. Murphy N.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ConA has been used to isolate glycosylation mutants of T. brucei after chemical mutagenesis (29Hwa K.Y. Acosta-Serrano A. Khoo K.H. Pearson T.W. Englund P.T. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but the lack of methods for genetic mapping prevented the mutated genes from being identified. From a T. brucei population selected for mariner transposition events, we isolated and characterized two independent mutants, in which the transposon had disrupted a previously uncharacterized ORF at different sites. The ORF encodes a probable orthologue of the ALG12 mannosyltransferase. Mutations at the asparagine-linked glycosylation (ALG) pathway are the origin of a number of severe inherited human diseases, known collectively as congenital disorders of glycosylation (30Aebi M. Hennet T. Trends. Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cloning of human ALG12 showed that mutation in this locus is the underlying cause of a new subtype of congenital disorders of glycosylation, type I (31Chantret I. Dupre T. Delenda C. Bucher S. Dancourt J. Barnier A. Charollais A. Heron D. Bader-Meunier B. Danos O. Seta N. Durand G. Oriol R. Codogno P. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25815-25822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of both ALG12 alleles in wild-type T. brucei produced the same phenotype as the mariner mutants. The N-glycan precursor in wild-type T. brucei is Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol, whereas ALG12 mutants make a smaller precursor, Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. Constructs and Cell Lines—One copy of the MosI transposase coding sequence from pBluescribe M13+/MosI (25Medhora M. Maruyama K. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1991; 128: 311-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was targeted to the TUBULIN locus on chromosome I of wild-type procyclic T. brucei of the Lister 427 strain by transfection with NotI-linearized pSgl29, which was derived by several cloning steps from a version of the TUBULIN-targeting construct pHD309 (32Wirtz E. Hartmann C. Clayton C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3887-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) containing a puromycin resistance gene in place of hygromycin phosphotransferase. The donor transposon cassette, pSgl33 (see Fig. 1A), is a derivative of the single-copy autonomously replicating T. brucei plasmid pT13-11 (26Patnaik P.K. Kulkarni S. Cross G.A.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2529-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As an intermediate step, pBSMos1Hyg was made by cloning the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, flanked by 5′ and 3′ ACTIN-derived splicing and polyadenylation signals (the SmaI-StuI fragment of pHD309), into the SalI site in the transposase ORF of pBluescribe M13+/MosI. The XhoI-HindIII fragment from pBSMos1Hyg was blunt end-cloned into the EcoNI site of pT13-11 to create pSgl33. ALG12 knock-out constructs were made by PCR amplifying 300 bp of genomic sequences flanking the ALG12 ORF and inserting selectable marker cassettes between them. The neomycin (pSgl39) and hygromycin (pSgl41) cassettes, both containing ACTIN-derived splicing and polyadenylation signals, were obtained by SmaI-StuI digestions of pLew114 and pHD309 (33Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), respectively. Bloodstream and procyclic ALG12 null mutants were obtained by sequentially transfecting wild-type T. brucei with NotI-linearized pSgl39 and pSgl41. Elimination of the ALG12 gene was confirmed by Southern hybridization. Trypanosomes were cultivated and transfected as previously described (32Wirtz E. Hartmann C. Clayton C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3887-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). DNA Analysis—Southern analysis was carried out according to standard protocols (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Approximately 2 μg of genomic DNA was run on an 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by standard procedures. The probes were generated using a Prime-It II kit (Stratagene) with gel-purified DNA. Hybridization and washing of membranes were carried out at 65 °C in a hybridization oven (Hybaid). Post-hybridization washes were for 30 min at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS. The hybridization signals were detected by autoradiography. For pulsed field gel electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA, agarose blocks of the different cell lines were prepared as described previously for mammalian cells (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at a final cell concentration of 2 × 108 ml–1. The parasites were resuspended in LB (0.10 m EDTA, pH 8, 0.010 m Tris-HCl, 0.020 m NaCl) and mixed with 1 volume of 1.6% low melting point agarose (Sigma) in LB. Lysis was carried out by two sequential treatments with 1% lauroyl sarcosine and 1 mg ml–1 proteinase K in LB for 48 h at 50 °C. Electrophoresis was performed in a contour clamped homogeneous electric field apparatus (CHEF DRII; Bio-Rad). Saccharomyces cerevisiae (New England Biolabs), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Bio-Rad), and Hansenula wingei (Bio-Rad) chromosomes were electrophoresed concurrently. The electrophoresis parameters were 1% agarose, 1400–700-s linear ramped pulse times, 144 h, 2.5 V cm–1, 0.5× TBE (0.045 m Tris borate, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) with buffer recirculation at 15 °C. The chromosome bands were visualized by staining with 0.5 mg ml–1 ethidium bromide. The gels were blotted onto Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by standard procedures. Transfer, hybridization, and washing of membranes were carried out as described above. Identification of Mariner Genomic Insertion Sites—Genomic DNA from hygromycinR clones was isolated, digested with HindIII, self-ligated under dilute conditions, and then used as template in PCRs, using primers SG3 (GGCAAATACTTTGAATAA, beginning 67 bp from the mariner 3′ inverted repeat (IR)) and SG4 (TTTATGACAATCGATAAA, beginning 49 bp from the mariner 5′ IR) with the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The resulting PCR products were purified, sequenced, and analyzed by a BLAST search of T. brucei sequence data bases. ConA Screening—6 × 107 transposase-expressing procyclic trypanosomes were transfected with the mariner donor plasmid (pSgl33) and amplified for 9 days in the presence of 50 μgml–1 G418. Approximately 4 × 108 G418R cells were washed and resuspended in SDM-79 containing 25 μgml–1 of hygromycin. The cells were grown for 10 days to allow expression of mutant phenotypes. The culture (100 ml) was treated with 2 μg ml–1 of ConA (Sigma) overnight and then centrifuged (50 × g for 5 min) to eliminate large clumps of cells. One round of ConA addition, centrifugation, and recovery for a few days in the absence of ConA is considered a “treatment.” We performed one more treatment with 2 μg ml–1 of ConA, five with 5 μg ml–1 of ConA, and one with 10 μg ml–1 of ConA. The entire procedure took approximately 1 month. Identification of TbALG12 Gene—The hygromycin and ConA-resistant cells were cloned, and the mariner integration sites were determined as described above, except that a different pair of primers was used: SG16 (CGGCACGAAACTCGACATGTTGACTGCACT, beginning 161 bp from the mariner 5′ IR) and SG17 (CGAAGACGCCGAACTGCAAGCATTATTGGA, beginning 872 bp from the mariner 3′ IR). The inverse PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) after A-tailing (performed according to the manufacturer's directions). The cloned DNA was sequenced and analyzed as described above. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Radiolabeling of Oligosaccharide-Lipids—Hypotonic lysates of wild-type, ALG12+/–, ALG12–/–, and mariner ConAR trypanosomes were prepared as described (35Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), except that tunicamycin was omitted during preparation of the membranes. For labeling oligosaccharide-lipid (OSL) and other glycolipids, we used a protocol designed for GPI synthesis (35Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thawed cell lysates (1 ml) were washed twice with 10 ml of HKML buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 μg ml–1 leupeptin) by centrifugation (4,550 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The membranes (1 × 108 cell equivalents) were suspended in HKML buffer and incubated for 1–2 min at 27 °C with 5 mm MnCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Mannose-containing glycolipids were pulse-labeled by transferring the membranes (5 × 107 cell equivalents) into another tube containing GDP[3,4-3H]Man (0.5 μCi ml–1, 18.3 Ci mmol–1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 2 mm UDP-GlcNAc for 5 min and chased with 1 mm nonradioactive GDP-Man for 20 min at 27 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) to give a final CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v), and the lipids were extracted for 10 min in a bath sonicator. After centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g, the insoluble debris was re-extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v) under sonication and recentrifuged. The pool of organic supernatants was dried under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids were extracted by adding 100 μl of n-butanol and 100 μl of water. After a quick centrifugation, the organic upper phase was saved, and the lower aqueous phase was re-extracted twice with 100 μl of water-saturated n-butanol. The pooled organic phases were then dried in a SpeedVac concentrator and resuspended in 10 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v) for thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 TLC plates (Merck), where lipids were resolved using the same solvent. For glycan analysis, the samples were fractionated on a predried TLC silica gel 60 (Merck) by running three times with n-butanol/acetone/water (6:5:4, v/v/v). For autoradiography, the plates were sprayed with En3Hance (DuPont) and exposed to x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences) at –80 °C. Mild Acid Hydrolysis of OSL—Dried [3H]Man-labeled lipids were resuspended in 100 μlof0.1 m HCl and heated at 100 °C. After 10 min, the tubes were cooled to 0 °C, and the released glycans were separated from glycolipids. n-Butanol (100 μl) was added, and the sample was equilibrated twice with 100 μl of water-saturated n-butanol. Glycans, in the aqueous phase, were dried in a SpeedVac and dissolved in 40% 1-propanol for TLC analysis using n-butanol/acetone/water (6:5:4, v/v/v). MALDI-TOF-MS Analysis of Procyclins—For mass spectrometry, procyclins were purified from 2 × 108 freeze-dried parasites by sequential extraction with organic solvents (7Acosta-Serrano A. Cole R.N.

To remove GPI anchors from the procyclins, the dry butanolic extracts were treated with 25 μlof48% aqueous hydrofluoric acid for 14 h at 0 °C. After treatment, the samples were immediately frozen in dry ice ethanol, dried in a SpeedVac, and resuspended in 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot (∼0.5 μl; ∼5 × 106 parasite equivalents) was co-crystallized with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix and analyzed in a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager Elite mass spectrometer (7Acosta-Serrano A.

To confirm assignments, HF-treated samples (2 μl, ∼2 × 107 parasite equivalents) were submitted to mild acid hydrolysis with 40 mm trifluoroacetic acid for 15 min at 100 °C, and an aliquot was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS as described above (7Acosta-Serrano A.

Enzymatic Deglycosylation of Procyclin Polypeptides—Aqueous HF-treated (∼5 × 107 parasite equivalents) procyclins from wild-type, ALG12+/–, ALG12–/–, and mariner ConA mutants were deglycosylated with 250 units of peptide N4(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs) in 10 μl of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 2 h. To confirm the presence of a terminal N-acetyllactosamine group in procyclins from ALG12–/– and mariner Con-A mutants, aqueous HF-treated proteins (∼5 × 107 parasite equivalents) were incubated with a mixture of 1 unit ml–1 of bovine testis β-galactosidase (GLYKO) and 10 units ml–1 of jack bean β-hexosaminidase (GLYKO) in 100 mm of sodium citrate, pH 4.5, at 37 °C for 18 h. After digestion, the samples were desalted using a ZipTip containing C18 silica (Millipore Corp.), as described by the manufacturer, and an aliquot was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS as described above. Transposition in T. brucei—To circumvent the low transfection efficiency of T. brucei, we started with the objective of establishing permanent cell lines that could be amplified prior to selecting for transposition and screening or selecting for specific phenotypes. The approach that we used was to split the two components of mariner, creating a donor transposon containing a selectable marker that could only be expressed after transposition into a transcribed region of a chromosome and providing tranposase activity in trans. Some early experiments that failed to result in transposition included attempts to mobilize a chromosomally integrated transposon cassette by placing a chromosomally integrated copy of transposase under the control of an inducible promoter. On the other hand, co-transfection of separate plasmids encoding the transposase and a donor cassette resulted in transposition into the genome, so it was clear that, in principal, mariner could function in T. brucei. The approach that achieved our objectives was to create a cell line in which the mariner transposase gene was integrated into the TUBULIN locus on chromosome I, where it is constitutively expressed by read-through transcription, and cloning the donor element into pT13-11, an autonomously replicating single-copy episome (26Patnaik P.K. Kulkarni S. Cross G.A.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2529-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), creating pSgl33 (Fig. 1A). pSgl33 is stable under G418 selection but does not confer hygromycin resistance; HYG is in the opposite orientation to the direction of transcription, which originates from the single EP-1 procyclin promoter that drives NEO expression. Transposase-expressing trypanosomes were transfected with pSgl33 and amplified in the presence of G418, which was subsequently replaced by hygromycin, and the cells were distributed into multi-well plates. Hygromycin-resistant clones were observed at a frequency of ∼5% (240 cells were distributed per 24 wells in a typical experiment, yielding ∼12 clones/plate). Southern analysis of these clones suggested that the donor element had transposed to different regions of the genome (data not shown). The mariner integration sites from several clones were recovered by inverse PCR. Sequence analysis (Fig. 1B) showed that they all contained the mariner cassette flanked by a TA dinucleotide and sequences that were absent from the donor plasmid DNA but were represented in the T. brucei genome data base. ConA Screening and Identification of the TbALG12 Gene—To test the potential for isolating specific mutants with this system, we chose to screen procyclic T. brucei for resistance to ConA, which was expected to identify genes involved in N-glycosylation. T. brucei mutants with reduced ConA binding had been isolated after chemical mutagenesis (29Hwa K.Y. Acosta-Serrano A. Khoo K.H. Pearson T.W. Englund P.T. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36Hwa K.Y. Khoo K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but, although these mutants were biochemically characterized, the genetic defect responsible for the altered phenotype could not be identified. The transposase-expressing cell line was transfected with donor plasmid pSgl33, and the population was amplified under G418 selection. The G418-resistant population was then washed, split, and grown either in the absence or presence of 25 μg ml–1 of hygromycin for 10 days to allow full expression of any mutant surface glycoproteins before adding ConA. After the sixth cycle of ConA treatment, only the cells growing in the presence of hygromycin no longer agglutinated. After two more cycles of ConA treatment, an analysis of ConA binding by flow cytometry confirmed the low affinity of the surviving cells for ConA. Preliminary DNA analysis (data not shown) suggested that we had a mixed population of mutants that were resistant to both hygromycin and ConA. After cloning by limiting dilution, Southern blot analysis of individual clones showed two patterns (data not shown). One clone (F and L) of each type was selected for further characterization. Once the integration site in clone F was amplified, cloned, and sequenced, primers were made to amplify the flanking sequences of the targeted ORF and the ORF itself. DNA analysis (Fig. 2A) showed that the plasmid-derived transposable cassette had integrated into the same gene in both clones. More surprising was the absence of bands characteristic of the wild-type allele in both mutants (see below). The insertion site in clone F was a TA dinucleotide in the middle of the gene, whereas the insertion in clone L had occurred in a TA located 7 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon (Fig. 2B). BLAST searching identified the target as an unannotated ORF on chromosome II. The disrupted ORF appeared to be an orthologue of the human ALG12 gene, which encodes dolichyl-P-Man: Man7GlcNAc2-PP-dolichyl α6-mannosyltransferase (31Chantret I. Dupre T. Delenda C. Bucher S.

The predicted amino acid sequences of T. brucei, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, budding yeast, fission yeast, mouse, and human ALG12 are aligned in Fig. 3. TbALG12 has 38 and 33% similarity with S. cerevisiae and human ALG12, respectively. Motif 1 (TKVEESF) is conserved only in the ALG12 family of α6-mannosyltransferases, whereas motif 2 (the sequence HKEXRF flanked by hydrophobic regions) also occurs in the α2-mannosyltransferases (37Oriol R.

The primary cross-link was to the peptide spanning amino acid residues 2–31 of β-tubulin, but the specific amino acid could not be identified. Indirect studies indicated that cross-link formation occurred between cysteine 12 and the thiazole moiety of dolastatin 10. An equipotent analog of dolastatin 10, lacking the thiazole ring, did not form an ultraviolet light-induced cross-link to β-tubulin. Preillumination of tubulin with ultraviolet light, known to induce cross-link formation between cysteine 12 and exchangeable site nucleotide, inhibited the binding of [5-3H]dolastatin 10 and cross-link formation more potently than it inhibited the binding of colchicine or vinblastine to tubulin. Conversely, binding of dolastatin 10 to tubulin inhibited formation of the cross-link between cysteine 12 and the exchangeable site nucleotide. Dithiothreitol inhibited formation of the β-tubulin/dolastatin 10 cross-link but not the β-tubulin/exchangeable site nucleotide cross-link. Modeling studies revealed a highly favored binding site for dolastatin 10 at the + end of β-tubulin in proximity to the exchangeable site GDP. Computational docking of an energy-minimized dolastatin 10 conformation at this site placed the thiazole ring of dolastatin 10 8–9 Å from the sulfur atom of cysteine 12. Dolastatin 15 and cryptophycin 1 could also be docked into positions that overlapped more extensively with the docked dolastatin 10 than with each other.

This result was consistent with the observed binding properties of these peptides. The subunit protein of microtubules, the αβ-tubulin heterodimer, has a number of ligand-binding sites. These include the exchangeable and nonexchangeable GTP-binding sites and at least three reasonably well characterized sites that bind antimitotic drugs. The electron crystallographic model of the tubulin sheet polymer formed in the presence of zinc and paclitaxel and composed of antiparallel protofilaments has provided relatively detailed information about the locations of the nucleotide-binding sites and the paclitaxel site on the αβ-dimer (1Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar). In contrast, drugs that inhibit tubulin polymerization will not bind to structurally normal tubulin protofilaments, so their binding sites have only been approached indirectly through biochemical and genetic techniques. For example, without exception, drugs that bind in the colchicine site inhibit formation of a sulfhydryl cross-link between Cys-239 and Cys-354 of β-tubulin (2Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These two cysteine residues are also alkylated by A ring chloroacetyl derivatives of thiocolchicine (3Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boyé O.

Cys-239 and Cys-354 are near the interface between the subunits (1Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar), and such a location for the colchicine site would explain the ability of different photoactive groups attached to the colchicine B ring to preferentially alkylate either the α- or the β-subunit (5Williams R.F. Mumford C.L. Williams G.A. Floyd L.J. Aivaliotis M.J. Martinez R.A. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13794-13802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Floyd L.J.

A large number of structurally diverse compounds, including many unusual peptides and depsipeptides, interfere with the binding of vinca alkaloids to tubulin. Despite near total inhibition of vinca alkaloid binding, many of these drugs display noncompetitive patterns when the data they yield are examined by the classic formulas of enzyme kinetic analysis, whereas other inhibitors display competitive patterns. We have suggested that the noncompetitive inhibitors bind near the vinca site, interfering sterically with vinca alkaloid binding to tubulin, and we have proposed that this region of tubulin be called the vinca domain (7Bai R. Pettit G.R. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17141-17149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region of tubulin appears to be close to the exchangeable GTP site on β-tubulin, based on two observations. First, a unique sulfhydryl cross-link can be formed in nucleotide-depleted tubulin, between Cys-12 and, probably, Cys-211 (1Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar, 2Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 8Little M. Ludueña R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, direct photoaffinity labeling of tubulin by exchangeable site guanosine nucleotide leads to alkylation primarily of Cys-12 (9Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and secondarily of Cys-211 (10Bai R. Ewell J.B. Nguyen N.Y. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12710-12714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All vinca domain drugs that have been examined inhibit the formation of the Cys-12/Cys-211 cross-link, with vinblastine having the weakest effect (2Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Roach M.C. Ludueña R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12063-12071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bai R. Roach M.C.

Second, all compounds that inhibit vinca alkaloid binding to tubulin also inhibit nucleotide exchange on β-tubulin (7Bai R. Pettit G.R. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17141-17149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bai R. Paull K.D. Herald C.L. Malspeis L. Pettit G.R. Hamel E. J. Biol.

Vinblastine, however, only weakly inhibits nucleotide exchange (16Huang A.B. Lin C.M. Hamel E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1239-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and rhizoxin is moderately inhibitory (7Bai R. Pettit G.R. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17141-17149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There have been several published studies in which crosslinks were induced between a vinca domain drug and tubulin. By direct photoaffinity labeling with vinblastine (17Wolff J. Knipling L. Cahnmann H.J. Palumbo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2820-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and with two photoactive derivatives of vinblastine (18Safa A.R. Hamel E. Felsted R.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Nasioulas G. Grammbitter K. Himes R.H. Ponstingl H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), there was greater labeling of α-tubulin than β-tubulin, ranging from 57 to 75% of the incorporated radiolabel being in the α-subunit. A photoaffinity analog of maytansine was incorporated in about a 4:5 ratio into α- and β-tubulin, respectively (20Sawada T. Kato Y. Kobayashi H. Hashimoto Y. Watanabe T. Sugiyama Y. Iwasaki S. Bioconjugate Chem. 1993; 4: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). More specific labeling of β-tubulin has also been observed. A photoreactive vinblastine analog specifically labeled a peptide containing residues 175–213 (21Rai S.S. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14707-14713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and a photoreactive rhizoxin derivative labeled a peptide containing residues 363–379 (22Sawada T. Kobayashi H. Hashimoto Y. Iwasaki S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have been studying the interaction of the marine peptide dolastatin 10 (Fig. 1) with tubulin. Besides potent cytotoxicity, dolastatin 10 inhibits microtubule assembly, induces formation of ring and spiral polymers of tubulin, noncompetitively inhibits the binding of vinca alkaloids to tubulin, and inhibits nucleotide exchange on β-tubulin. With radiolabeled dolastatin 10, we showed that the peptide bound tenaciously to tubulin, with negligible dissociation during gel filtration chromatography. The nominal Kd value for binding of drug to tubulin was about 25 nm. The binding was reversible, however, because an active analog could displace radiolabel from tubulin. The ability of dolastatin 10 to induce aberrant assembly reactions was so potent that we were not able to demonstrate binding of the radiolabeled drug to any tubulin species smaller than 200 kDa (7Bai R.

Synthesis of [5-3H]Dolastatin 10—Dolastatin 10 was first converted to 5-bromo-dolastatin 10. The dolastatin 10 (30 mg) was dissolved in 0.2 ml of acetic acid with 40 mg of silver trifluoroacetate. A solution of bromine in acetic acid (0.114 mmol in 0.6 ml) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 18 h at ambient temperature. Chloroform (2 ml) was added, and the solution was filtered through celite. The solvents were removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue was chromatographed on a DuPont Zorbax ODS column (0.75 × 26 cm), which was developed with 10 mm triethylamine in 75% methanol at 1 ml/min. The column effluent was monitored at 240 nm. The solvent fraction containing the largest peak, with a retention time of 33 min, was concentrated to dryness, and 2.6 mg of product was obtained. The 1H NMR spectrum, when compared with that of dolastatin 10, showed collapse of a doublet at δ 7.4, corresponding to the hydrogen atom at C-4, to a singlet, indicating bromination at C-5 on the thiazole ring. The 5-bromo-dolastatin 10 was dissolved in 0.3 ml of ethyl acetate containing 25 μl of triethylamine and 2 mg of 10% paladium on carbon. The reaction mixture was exposed to carrier-free tritium gas at 630 mm Hg for 2 h at ambient temperature. The catalyst was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was exchanged three times with ethanol. The crude product was chromatographed on a 5 × 20 cm silica gel 60F plate with 3:2 acetone/hexane. The dolastatin 10 band was eluted from the silica with 1:1 CHCl3/ethanol. The solvent was removed by evaporation under vacuum, and the residue was redissolved in 50 ml of ethanol. The product was 96% pure and its mobility identical to that of dolastatin 10 by TLC and HPLC. Specific activity was 5.4 Ci/mmol, and the yield was 20.7 mCi. The 3H NMR spectrum showed a doublet at δ 7.29, J = 3 Hz, indicating that the tritium was at C-5 in the thiazole ring. Back exchange for 24 h at ambient temperature in pH 7 phosphate buffer showed 0.2% exchangeable tritium. Synthesis of [phenyl-4-3H]Auristatin-PE—An analog of auristatin-PE (2.5 mg), with a chlorine atom at C-4 in the phenyl ring (prepared as described in Ref. 24Pettit G.R. Srirangam J.K. Barkoczy J. Williams M.D. Boyd M.R. Hamel E. Pettit R.K. Hogan F. Bai R. Chapuis J.-C. McAllister S.C. Schmidt J.M. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1998; 13: 243-277PubMed Google Scholar), was mixed with 1.5 mg of 10% paladium on carbon and 2 μl of triethylamine in 0.4 ml of ethyl acetate under nitrogen at ambient temperature and exposed to carrier-free tritium gas for 4 h. The catalyst was removed by filtration, and the solution was back-exchanged four times with ethanol on a vacuum line. The crude material was chromatographed on an analytical 20 × 20-cm silica gel 60F TLC plate with acetone/hexane/methanol 5:4:1. The band corresponding to auristatin-PE was collected and eluted from the silica with 1:1 CHCl3/ethanol. The TLC mobility of the radiolabeled material was identical with that of nonradiolabeled auristatin-PE. Material from two identical procedures was combined, and HPLC indicated that the radiopurity of the combined product was 81%. The pooled material was applied to a Waters 8 × 10 C8 Novapak radial compression column, which was developed with 10 mm triethylamine in 75% methanol. Column flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the effluent was monitored at 230 nm. The fractions containing [3H]auristatin-PE were combined, and the solvent was removed by evaporation to yield 18.6 mCi of product with a specific activity of 8.46 Ci/mmol. Radiopurity by HPLC and TLC was 98 and 99%, respectively, with mobilities identical with those of nonradio-labeled auristatin-PE. Photolabeling of Tubulin with [3H]Dolastatin 10—Reaction mixtures contained 1.0 mg/ml (10 μm) tubulin, 10 μm [3H]dolastatin 10 (or, in some experiments, 10 μm [3H]auristatin-PE), 0.1 m Mes (pH of 1.0 m stock solution adjusted to pH 6.9 with NaOH), and 0.5 mm MgCl2. In some experiments, as indicated, other components were included in reaction mixtures, and incubations prior to exposure to UV light were as described for individual experiments. Reaction mixtures with volumes up to 0.25 ml, with volumes between 0.25 and 1.0 ml, and with volumes over 1.0 ml were placed in wells in Costar polystyrene tissue culture plates, with well diameters of 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 cm, respectively. Samples were placed on ice at a distance of 10 cm from the UV lamp and exposed to 254 nm light for times as indicated. Light intensity at 10 cm was 2.5 mW/cm2. Measurement of Ligand Bound to Tubulin (Total Bound and Covalently Bound)—The centrifugal gel filtration method, as described previously (32Hamel E. Lin C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11060-11069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used, except that all centrifugations were for 4 min at 2,000 rpm in a Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge equipped with a GH-3.8A horizontal rotor. The Sephadex G-50 (superfine) columns were prepared in tuberculin syringes. When total binding of a ligand was measured, aliquots of the reaction mixture were applied directly to the pre-centrifuged Sephadex, which had been swollen in a solution containing 0.1 m Mes (pH 6.9) and 0.5 mm MgCl2. When covalently bound ligand was measured, the reaction mixture was mixed with 1.5 parts of 8 m guanidine HCl, and aliquots of the resulting solution were applied to syringe columns containing Sephadex that had been swollen in 4 m guanidine HCl. Each assay mixture was evaluated in triplicate, and both radiolabel and protein in column filtrates were measured. Peptide Sequencing—Samples for sequencing were radiolabeled as described above, although in some experiments the tubulin and [3H]dolastatin 10 concentrations were increased to 25 μm. Reaction mixtures were initially incubated for 15 min at room temperature (22 °C) and subsequently irradiated for 5–10 min on ice. Two volumes of ethanol were added to precipitate the tubulin. This removed the noncovalently bound, soluble dolastatin 10. The protein was harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and either dried under vacuum for later use or immediately dissolved in 75% formic acid. Formic acid digestion (96 h at 37 °C in the dark), cyanogen bromide digestion, peptide recovery by lyophilization, peptide separation by SDS-PAGE, transfer of resolved peptides to PVDF membranes, and automated Edman degradation were performed as described previously (4Bai R. Covell D.G. Pei X.-F. Ewell J.B. Nguyen N.Y. Brossi A. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40443-40452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), except that after formic acid digestions the peptides were dissolved in the Tricine/SDS sample buffer solution instead of concentrated Tris buffer. PVDF membranes were sprayed with EN3HANCE, which was allowed to dry for 15 min prior to exposure to the Biomax MR film. Autoradiograms were prepared over a 5–7-day exposure at -70 °C. Molecular Modeling—Modeling consisted of identifying acceptable conformations for the docked ligands, scanning the solvent-accessible surface of the tubulin dimer (1Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar) for potential binding sites, and computational docking of the candidate ligands to these sites. Conformations of dolastatin 10, dolastatin 15, and cryptophycin 1 were obtained by sampling the lowest energy geometries derived from in vacuo minimization and molecular dynamics using the CVFF force field of the Discover2002 tool in the Accelrys molecular package (BIOSYM, MSI). A sample set of the five lowest energy conformations for each molecule was selected for docking studies. Candidate docking sites were identified using a method developed for assigning docking sites of ligands against their Protein Data Bank crystal structures (see Ref. 33Young B.L. Jernigan R.L. Covell D.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar for details). Briefly, the method scans the solvent-accessible surface of the electron crystallographic structure of the tubulin dimer (1Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1811) Google Scholar) using a set of residue-based molecular probes that had been identified previously as the crystal packing geometries of proteins within the Protein Data Bank (34Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (28253) Google Scholar). Each surface point is scored according to the energy associated with docking each of the molecular probes at that point. Calculated binding strengths are then scored by summing the interaction energies for the most favorable binding interactions within this suite of molecular probes. By using this method, potential binding sites are identified for subsequent docking. The interaction energies of this method are derived from extensive study of residue-residue-based potentials (35Miyazawa S. Jernigan R.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 36: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and, as such, represent coarse assessments of candidate binding sites. This method proved effective in correctly assigning binding sites in subsequent studies (36Bewley C.A. Gustafson K.R. Boyd M.R. Covell D.G. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 37Covell D.G. Smythers G.W. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2064-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Docking studies were completed with a computational method developed for placing candidate ligands into possible binding sites. Previous calibration of this procedure found the correct binding position for over 93% of the known crystal complexes studies at the time of analysis (38Wallqvist A. Jernigan R.L. Covell D.G. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1881-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Wallqvist A. Covell D.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 25: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Docking is achieved in three successive steps, each with increasing demands for scoring acceptable binding positions. The initial step is sufficiently crude, so that all candidate binding sites on the tubulin dimer can be scanned for docking. Following this step, candidate binding sites with the greatest predicted binding strength are passed along for more exact placement into each potential binding site. Completion of all computational steps for docking yields the minimum energy position for each test molecule into its most favorable binding location. 2The molecular coordinates for all binding conformations described in this paper are available on request to D. G. Covell at [email protected]. Direct Photoaffinity Labeling of Tubulin by [3H]Dolastatin 10 and Identification of the Predominant Radiolabeled Peptide—We decided to explore the potential of the direct photoaffinity labeling technique for providing information about the dolastatin 10-binding site on tubulin based on the successful studies with colchicine (17Wolff J. Knipling L. Cahnmann H.J. Palumbo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2820-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), paclitaxel (40Rao S. Horwitz S.B. Ringel I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and GTP (9Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only in the latter case was a specific amino acid residue, Cys-12 of β-tubulin, identified, and Shivanna et al. (9Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that exposure of tubulin to ultraviolet radiation resulted in generation of sulfhydryl free radicals as the reactive species. Table I summarizes our initial experiments, in which we found that about 8% of the bound [3H]dolastatin 10 reacted covalently with tubulin, and this covalent reaction, as well as the total binding reaction, was substantially inhibited by preincubating the tubulin with a 5-fold molar excess of two highly active analogs of dolastatin 10, auristatin-PE (24Pettit G.R.

The cross-linking reaction therefore appeared to be largely specific and to require initial binding of the peptide to the protein.Table IInhibition of total and covalent binding of dolastatin 10 to tubulin by dolastatin 10 analogs Each 0.65-ml reaction mixture contained 10 μm tubulin, 0.1 m Mes (pH 6.9), 0.5 mm MgCl2, and, if present, 50 μm auristatin-PE or 50 μm (19aR)-isodolastatin 10. The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 22 °C, and 10 μm [3H]dolastatin 10 was added. After an additional 15 min at 22 °C, the reaction mixtures were exposed to UV light on ice as described in the text for 5 min. A 0.2-ml aliquot of each reaction mixture was mixed with 0.3 ml of 8 m guanidine HCl. Triplicate 0.15-ml aliquots from the original reaction mixture and from the aliquot mixed with the denaturant were applied to syringe columns prepared in 0.1 m Mes, 0.5 mm MgCl2 or in 4 m guanidine HCl, as appropriate. Averages obtained from three independent experiments are shown. In these experiments the average total binding of [3H]dolastatin 10 was 0.52 mol/mol tubulin and of covalently bound [3H]dolastatin was 0.040 mol/mol tubulin.Peptide addedTotal dolastatin 10 boundDolastatin 10 cross-linked to tubulin% inhibition ± S.D.Auristatin-PE81 ± 463 ± 4(19aR)-Isodolastatin 1070 ± 1058 ± 6 Open table in a new tab In the experiments summarized in Table I and elsewhere in this study, the stoichiometry of cross-linking ranged from 0.040 to 0.054 mol of dolastatin 10/mol of tubulin. Whereas this stoichiometry is relatively low compared with the results obtained by direct photoaffinity labeling with exchangeable site GDP or GTP (Refs. 9Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D.

https://openalex.org/W2105833375,"Notch is a phylogenetically conserved transmembrane receptor that is required for many aspects of animal development. Upon ligand stimulation, a fragment of Notch is released proteolytically and enters the nucleus to form a complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag1) and activate transcription of Notch-CSL target genes. The physical structure of the Notch-CSL complex remains unclear, however, clouding the interpretation of previous efforts to correlate Notch structure and function. We have, therefore, characterized the binding of Drosophila CSL (called Suppressor of Hairless, or Su(H)) to the intracellular domain of Drosophila Notch both in vitro and in vivo. We report the identification of two Su(H) binding regions in Notch. The first is in the juxtamembrane region (the “RAM” domain). The second is just C-terminal to the Notch ankyrin repeats, overlapping or identical to two previously proposed nuclear localization sequences, in a domain we term PPD (potential phosphorylated domain). The ankyrin repeats themselves do not bind to Su(H); however, they substantially enhance binding of Su(H) to the more C-terminal region. Consistent with this picture, removal of either the Ram or PPD binding sites, separately, modestly reduces Notch activity in vivo, whereas removal of both renders Notch severely defective. These results clarify the relationship between Notch and CSL, help to explain the importance of the ankyrin repeats in Notch signaling, and reconcile many apparently contradictory results from previous Notch structure/function studies. Moreover, they suggest a second function for the Notch nuclear localization sequence elements.

Moreover, they suggest a second function for the Notch nuclear localization sequence elements. The Notch pathway is a phylogenetically conserved signaling mechanism that mediates cell-cell communication events in the development of nearly all metazoan organisms that have been examined. Homologues of Notch have been found in echinoderms, ascidians, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. In all those organisms the Notch pathway is essential for a variety of developmental processes involving intercellular communication, including asymmetric cell-fate decisions, formation of boundaries in developmental fields, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar). It is thought that the Notch pathway exerts these pleiotropic effects through a common signaling pathway involving the interaction of a few core elements: a signal, DSL (Delta, Serrate, LAG-2), a receptor, Notch (sometimes called LNG for LIN-12, Notch, GLP-1), and a DNA-binding protein, CSL 1The abbreviations used are: CSL, CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag1; Su(H), Suppressor of Hairless protein.

(CBF-1, Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)), LAG-1), with its co-activator, Mam (Mastermind, MAML). Interaction of Notch with its ligand DSL initiates a series of proteolytic events at the membrane that ultimately result in the release of the intracellular domain of Notch (Nicd) (for review, see Ref. 2Lai E.C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 200-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The free Notch intracellular domain then translocates into the nucleus where it forms a transcription control complex in association with CSL and Mam, binding to target genes that bear CSL binding sites and activating their transcription.The intracellular domain of Drosophila Notch is large, 937 amino acids, and contains a variety of signaling domains and binding sites for regulators and effectors (for a schematic representation see Fig. 1A). It starts with the juxtamembrane RAM domain, which contains a conserved nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence. RAM also contains a high affinity binding site for the PTB domain of Numb (3Guo M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1996; 17: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), involved in the trafficking of the receptor, particularly for endocytosis (4Berdnik D. Torok T. Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Knoblich J.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and degradation (5McGill M.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 13: 619-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) constitute a domain (ANK) that is essential to all Notch functions described so far and which is highly conserved throughout the entire metazoan Notch family (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar). The molecular function of ANK remains elusive, but it includes a binding site for Deltex, a protein that is required for full Notch activity in vivo (10Matsuno K. Ito M. Hori K. Miyashita F. Suzuki S. Kishi N. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Okano H. Development. 2002; 129: 1049-1059PubMed Google Scholar, 11Matsuno K. Go M.J. Sun X. Eastman D.S. Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

A domain that we have called in this study PPD for potential phosphorylated domain follows ANK. It contains a large number of serines and threonines in consensus phosphorylation motifs for various kinases (13Foltz D.R. Santiago M.C. Berechid B.E. Nye J.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1006-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 14Foltz D.R. Nye J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), two stretches of basic residues with NLS homologies, and a transcriptional activation capability (15Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Kidd S. Lieber T. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The more C-terminal part of the Notch intracellular domain contains a glutamine-rich region (OPA) and a PEST region involved in regulating the half-life of the protein (17Rechsteiner M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1988; 27: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In mouse and nematode the PEST region is phosphorylated in vivo and becomes a binding site for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Sel-10 (for review, see Ref. 18Lai E.C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 74-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).The association of Notch with CSL is thought to be the key to Notch signaling, since it is CSL that determines what genes are bound and activated by the Notch/Mam/CSL complex (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar), but the physical basis for this association remains unclear. The RAM domain was first identified as the primary binding domain for CSL in mammalian Notch (19Tamura K. Taniguchi Y. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Tun T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Mutation of a span of conserved residues in this region prevents in vitro binding of CBF-1 with mouse Notch (19Tamura K. Taniguchi Y. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Tun T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, in mammalian cultured cells, RAM-deleted Notch derivatives retain Notch activity, suggesting either the presence of other CBF-1 sites or some CBF-1-independent activity (15Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Aster J.C. Robertson E.S. Hasserjian R.P. Turner J.R. Kieff E. Sklar J. J. Biol.

Development. 1999; 126: 1689-1702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More definitively, in Drosophila, RAM-deleted Notch derivatives still provide significant Su(H)-dependent activity (22Fortini M.E. Rebay I. Caron L.A. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nature. 1993; 365: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23Lieber T. Kidd S. Alcamo E. Corbin V. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1949-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Su(H) may interact in vitro with the ankyrin repeats of Drosophila Notch (24Fortini M.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1994; 79: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and indeed, in contrast to the RAM domain, the ANK repeats are essential for all CSL-dependent Notch functions in all studied organisms. However, the binding of CSL proteins to the ANK region seems to be very much weaker than the binding to the RAM domain (25Tani S. Kurooka H. Aoki T. Hashimoto N. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1373-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and has not even been detectable in all studies. Moreover, no CSL binding site has been specifically mapped to this part of the protein. Very recently, it has been shown in mammalian cells that the presence of the protein Mastermind (Mam) interacting with the ANK domain can reinforce the interaction between CBF-1 and RAM-deleted Notch derivatives (26Nam Y. Weng A.P. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21232-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).To clarify the structure of the Notch/Su(H)-signaling complex and its relationship to the sequence of the receptor, we have mapped Su(H) binding sites on Drosophila Notch in vitro, in Drosophila cells, and in extract of Drosophila embryos. We identified two Su(H) binding regions within the intracellular domain of Drosophila Notch. One is in the RAM domain and confirms the conservation of a strong CSL binding site in the juxtamembrane region of the intracellular domain. A second Su(H) binding region is more complex and was found just C-terminal to the ankyrin repeats, within the domain we called PPD. The ankyrin repeats themselves do not bind directly to Su(H), but they substantially enhance binding of Su(H) to the PPD region and may be linked to Su(H)indirectly in vivo via a bridging adaptor protein (27Roehl H. Bosenberg M. Blelloch R. Kimble J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7002-7012Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The Ram and PPD sites each contribute to Notch function in vivo, and deletion of both regions severely reduces Notch activity. Together, these data allow us to reconcile a great deal of seemingly conflicting data on the function of Notch domains and the effects of Notch mutations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructionsBriefly, constructs were obtained as follows.GST-Su(H)—To create a baculovirus construct for the expression of GST fusion proteins, the GST coding sequence, polylinker region, and stop codons of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 transfer vector (Pharmingen) to create the vector pVL-GST. pGEX-KG-Su(H) (provided by Posakony (29Bailey A.M. Posakony J.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2609-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar)) was cut EcoRI and HindIII (blunt) and subcloned into pVL-GST cut EcoRI and XbaI (blunt).Notch Fragments—His-tagged Notch fragments RAM and OPA were PCR-amplified and subcloned between the NheI and BglII sites of pRSET A and have been previously described (30Giniger E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The other similar constructs of this study, RAMΔA, RAMΔB, RAMΔC, RAMΔD, ANK, ANK-PPD, and the different PPD-OPA derivatives, N1766–2262 and N1779–2262, were made the same way. In each case, a stop codon was introduced after the final amino acid, and the amplified fragment was fully sequenced.pT7/C1 EGFP and pT7/C1 EGFP-PPD—pT7/C1 EGFP was derived from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) with the addition of a T7 promoter. pT7/C1 EGFP-PPD was obtained by subcloning pRSET-ANK-PPD-cut BamHI and PstI into pT7/C1 EGFP-cut BglII and PstI.pUAS FLAG-N1766 and pUAS FLAG-N1779 —The constructs were obtained after amplification by PCR of a fragment from pUAS N1–2262 (provided by C. S. Wesley (31Wesley C.S. Saez L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) with the addition in 5′ of a BglII site, a Drosophila initiation of translation sequence, and three FLAG tags in-frame with amino acid 1766 or 1779 and the sequence ending in 1962 at the XhoI site. The amplified fragments were sequenced and then subcloned into pUAS N1790 (provided by S. Kidd (16Kidd S. Lieber T. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)) cut by BglII and XhoI.pUAS NFL Wild Type—To get the pUAS Notch(full length) wild type we cleaned the stop mutation of pUAS N1–2262 (31Wesley C.S. Saez L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by replacing its XhoI/XbaI fragment by the one from pUAS, N1790 (16Kidd S. Lieber T. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).pUAS Su(H)-HA—The triple HA tag was derived from the vector pIRES-hrGFP2a (Stratagene), cut with XhoI and BstEII (blunt), and subcloned into pBS-SK-cut XhoI and KpnI (blunt). Su(H) was PCR-amplified from pBS-KS-Su(H) (provided by F. Schweisguth (32Schweisguth F. Posakony J.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 1199-1212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)) with a KpnI site in front of the ATG and a XhoI site in place of the stop codon, putting it in-frame with the three HA tags. The KpnI-XbaI insert was fully sequenced before being subcloned into pUAS.MutagenesisAll the deletions or mutations in the Notch derivatives were done by directed mutagenesis according to the protocol of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, for all the mutations in the RAM domain, the NheI-NcoI fragment of pUAS N1–2262 was subcloned into pRSET and then mutagenized. For all the mutations in the PPD domain, the XhoI-NarI fragment of pUAS Nintra1790 was subcloned into BS-SK and then mutagenized. All the mutagenized fragments were fully sequenced before being re-subcloned in their appropriate backbones (pUAS Notch(full length) wild type, pUAS N1766 or N1779, pRSET N1766 or N1779, etc.).Recombinant ProteinBaculovirus—Baculovirus stocks were produced by cotransfecting into SF9 insect cells pVL-GST or pVL-GST-Su(H) plasmids along with a mixture of AcNPV DNA according to the manufacturer's procedures (BaculoGold™, Pharmingen).Purification—GST and GST-Su(H) fusion protein expressed in SF9 were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, 36 h post-infection with baculovirus expressing pVL-GST or pVL-GST-Su(H), SF9 cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate. After 30 min of gentle agitation at 4 °C and 30 min of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, the supernatant was diluted with lysis buffer lacking NaCl to reduce NaCl to 125 mm. Preblocked glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the lysate and incubated for 1 h with gentle rocking. Beads were washed 4 times in lysis buffer, 50 mm NaCl and stored in the presence of 2 mm azide. GST and GST-PTB purified from bacteria have been previously described (30Giniger E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).In Vitro Binding AssayNotch fusion proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TNT, Promega) and following the manufacturer's protocol. As indicated, some of the constructs (ANK-PPD derivatives) were digested and purified before being in vitro transcribed and translated. Binding of in vitro translated polypeptides or fly extracts to GST fusion proteins was performed as previously described (30Giniger E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Cell ExtractsDrosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cells were obtained from Invitrogen and maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented in 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin according to the manufacturer's instructions.The cells were transfected with calcium phosphate as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 3 × 106 S2 cells were plated in a 35-mm plate in 3 ml and grown for 20 h before being transfected with 1 μg of each plasmid as indicated and 1 μg of pRK241 (actin-Gal4, from R. Kostriken and P. O'Farrell) to allow the expression of the UAS constructs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 300 μl of ice-cold 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v:v), 10% glycerol (v:v), 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 30 min of gentle agitation at 4 °C and 30 min of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, the supernatants were collected as whole cell extracts.Transgenic Fly Strains and Fly ExtractsTransgenic Strain—Germ line transformation was performed using standard procedures. w1118 flies were injected with UAS constructs at 1 mg/ml and Delta2-3 helper plasmid at 0.5 mg/ml.Other Fly Strains—The strong mutant allele Notch[55e11] (from E. H. Grell and Y. N. Jan) was used as the background for transgene rescue experiment. GAL4 drivers for various experiments were 69B (A. Brand) (expression throughout the embryonic ectoderm), scabrous-GAL4 (C. S. Goodman) (expression in neuroectoderm and its derivatives), and hairy-GAL4 (S. Parkhurst) (expression in every other segment of the early embryo).Whole Embryo Lysates—UAS expressing flies were crossed to 69B to obtain expression in embryos. F1 embryos were collected on grape juice plates O/N (∼18 h at 25 °C), harvested with 0.7% NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100 (NaCl/Triton), dechorionated with 50% bleach, washed with NaCl/Triton, and transferred to an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer. Embryos were then washed twice with cold H2O and once with cold lysis buffer. Embryos were suspended with 3 volumes of 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v:v), 10% glycerol (v:v), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed with 25 strokes of an ice-cold A pestle followed by 25 strokes with a cold B pestle. Embryo lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 14,000rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as whole embryo extracts.Immunoprecipitation and Western BlotAntibodies—Antibodies, their sources, and the concentrations used for Western blotting (WB) and immunoprecipitation (IP) were as follows: anti-Notch (C17.9C6, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa)), 1:50 (WB), 30 μl/IP; anti-HA.11 (16B12, Covance) 1/2000 (WB) 0.5 μl/IP; anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) 1/1000 (WB), 0.5 μl/IP. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary (Jackson Laboratories) was used at 1:10,000 (WB), Rb anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) was used at 1 μg/5 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads.Immunoprecipitation—Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were blocked with lysis buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, prebound with Rb anti-mouse IgG, and washed 2×. Extract was thawed on ice (if previously frozen), and 5 μl of protein A/Rb anti-mouse beads was added per IP sample (typically 200 μl of extract, diluted to 350 μl final volume) for pre-clearing. Sample was rocked at 4 °C for 1 h, then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm 10 min. Supernatant was removed, added to the appropriate primary antibody, and rocked at 4 °C for 1 h; 5 μl of protein A/Rb anti-mouse beads were added per IP sample and rocked for 2 h. Beads were spun down for 5 s in a microcentrifuge, unbound material was removed, and the beads were washed 3× with lysis buffer. Beads were then boiled in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer.Western Blot—Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (6.5% 29:1 acrylamide:bis) were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 90 min in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% nonfat milk and were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 3 h. After washing with PBST, secondary antibodies diluted in PBST were applied for 30 min. The membranes were finally washed with PBST, developed with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and exposed to Kodak Biomax MR Films. For densitometry quantification, non-saturated chemiluminescence-exposed film were scanned, and densitometry analysis was performed with NIH Image Software.Immunohistochemistry and ImmunofluorescenceEmbryos were collected at 25 °C, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and stained with antibodies by standard methods. Whole mount embryos visualized by horseradish peroxidase histochemistry were examined with a Nikon Optiphot microscope using Nomarski optics and photographed with a digital camera (Coolscan). Fluorescently labeled embryos were examined by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS). Antibodies used were: anti-Notch C17.9C6 (1:50), rat anti-Elav (1:20), and anti-Sex Lethal (1:50), Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; anti-FLAG M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.; 1:300); anti-β-galactosidase (Cappel; 1:10,000). For in situ detection of nuclear Notch protein, we used TSA amplification (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) of the Notch signal, detected with DTAF-streptavidin.RESULTSSu(H) Interacts with Two Separate Regions of Nicd in Vitro—To map the Su(H) interaction region(s) within the Drosophila Notch intracellular domain (Nicd) in vitro, we purified GST-Su(H) fusion protein produced in SF9 cells infected by recombinant baculovirus, and we in vitro translated and 35S-labeled different functional regions of the Notch intracellular domain (Fig. 1A). We tested those various regions for their ability to bind to GST-Su(H) on glutathione beads (Fig. 1B). The RAM domain is sufficient to bind efficiently to GST-Su(H) (Fig. 1B, lane 1), whereas it does not bind to GST alone (data not shown). This indicates that the RAM domain of Drosophila Notch, just like the RAM domain of vertebrate Notch (19Tamura K. Taniguchi Y. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Tun T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), contains an interaction surface for CSL. We also found that a fragment containing both ANK and PPD bound to Su(H) (Fig. 1B, lane 3) with similar efficiency as RAM. Furthermore, a fragment containing both PPD and OPA bound to GST-Su(H), although very weakly (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Because neither the ANK domain alone (containing the full seven ankyrin repeats (8Zweifel M.E. Leahy D. Hughson J.F.M. Barrick D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Lubman O.Y. Korolev S.V. Kopan R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 619-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) nor the OPA domain alone bound to Su(H) (lanes 2 and 5), we suspected that the PPD domain was the region of interaction and tested that hypothesis by creating a fusion protein between PPD and EGFP (Fig. 1C). Whereas EGFP did not bind at all to GST-Su(H), EGFP-PPD bound GST-Su(H) about as well as did PPD-OPA (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2). These data suggest that the PPD domain can interact with Su(H), but somehow this interaction is strongly improved by the presence of the ANK domain. Together, these data suggest the existence of two separate Su(H) binding sites within Drosophila Nicd, one in the PPD domain that is sensitive to the presence of the ankyrin repeats and one in the RAM domain.Molecular Characterization of the Su(H) Binding Site within the RAM Domain of Notch—To narrow down the location of the Su(H) binding site within the RAM domain of Notch, we divided that domain into four subregions (A, B, C, and D, see Fig. 2A) and tested the ability of the deleted forms of RAM to bind to GST-Su(H) (Fig. 2B). All subdomains except A were dispensable for Su(H) binding (Fig. 2B). The A subdomain is highly conserved between species and includes a strong match to the previously described CBF-1 binding region in the RAM domain of mammalian Notch (19Tamura K. Taniguchi Y. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Tun T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1416-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Therefore, we introduced a triple point mutant WFP to LLA at position 1776–1778 in the Drosophila RAM domain. As in mammals, this mutation in the RAM domain of Drosophila Notch prevented binding to Su(H) (Fig. 2B, lane 8, middle panel). In contrast, it did not prevent the binding of a different Notch-interacting protein, a fusion protein between GST and the PTB domain of Disabled (DAB), that we have shown previously to interact with RAM (30Giniger E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and that also binds to the RAM A subregion (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 7, and 8, lower panel).Fig. 2Molecular characterization of the Su(H) binding site in the RAM domain of Notch. A, schematic representation of the different constructs tested in B. The RAM domain was subdivided in four regions, and derivatives were deleted for those regions (Δ, with corresponding amino acid numbers) and were tested for their binding to GST-Su(H) and to a fusion of GST to the PTB domain of the Drosophila Disabled protein (GST-DAB(PTB)). Binding was performed as described for the experiments of Fig. 1. The amino acid sequence of the triple point mutation, RAM*, is also shown, and its position is indicated by a vertical, striped bar.

https://openalex.org/W2081951067,"Bz-423 is a 1,4-benzodiazepine with selective lymphotoxic properties and potent therapeutic activity against lupus-like disease in autoimmune mice. In NZB/W lupus-prone mice, Bz-423 specifically kills germinal center B cells, which are the cells that drive disease both in this model and in human systemic lupus erythematosus. In this report, the mechanistic basis for the selective action of Bz-423 is investigated. We show that Bz-423-induces superoxide as an immediate early response and that this reactive oxygen species is more effective as a second messenger death signal in B cells activated by B cell receptor stimulation compared with resting cells. As a result, low [Bz-423] that are not cytotoxic to non-stimulated cells kill stimulated cells in synergy with anti-immunoglobulin M antibodies. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that Bz-423 extends the rise in intracellular calcium that accompanies anti-immunoglobulin M stimulation, and this effect mediates the synergistic death response. Because B cell hyperactivation and altered calcium signaling is a distinguishing feature of autoreactive lymphocytes in lupus, the mechanism by which Bz-423 induces apoptosis preferentially targets disease-causing cells on the basis of their activation state. Thus, molecules like Bz-423 could form the basis for new and selective anti-lupus agents.

Katz J.B. Paul E. Aranow C. Lustgarten D. Scharff M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 731-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although immunosuppressive, lymphotoxic drugs are effective for many patients, these drugs cause life-threatening side effects that account for a notable portion of lupus-related deaths (2Rubin L.A. Urowitz M.B. Gladman D.D. Q. J. Med. 1985; 55: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, agents with greater selectivity against disease-causing lymphocytes could significantly advance the treatment of SLE and related disorders. Because lymphocyte toxicity is an established treatment modality, it offers a starting point to develop new classes of therapeutic molecules. Toward this end, a library of 1,4-benzodiazepines was previously screened for cytotoxic members against Ramos B cells, a neoplastic B cell line with a germinal center (GC) phenotype (3Blatt N.B. Bednarski J.J. Warner R.E. Leonetti F. Johnson K.M. Boitano A. Yung R. Richardson B.C. Johnson K.J. Ellman J.A. Opipari Jr., A.W. Glick G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These studies led to the identification of Bz-423 (Fig. 1), a pro-apoptotic molecule whose mechanism of action depends upon an increase in intracellular superoxide (O2·¯), produced as a result of the interaction of Bz-423 with a mitochondrial molecular target (3Blatt N.B. Bednarski J.J. Warner R.E. Leonetti F. Johnson K.M. Boitano A. Yung R. Richardson B.C. Johnson K.J. Ellman J.A. Opipari Jr., A.W. Glick G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Comparison of Bz-423 with benzodiazepines used clinically and ligands of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor reveals the unique cytotoxicity of this compound against B cells in vitro (3Blatt N.B. Bednarski J.J. Warner R.E. Leonetti F. Johnson K.M. Boitano A. Yung R. Richardson B.C. Johnson K.J. Ellman J.A. Opipari Jr., A.W. Glick G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based upon its lymphotoxic properties in vitro, we explored the cytotoxic properties of Bz-423 in two animal models of SLE, the MRL-lpr and the (NZB x NZW)F1 (NZB/W) mouse strains. Lupus-like disease in MRL-lpr mice is T-cell-dominated and is linked to defective Fas signaling. These defects allow a population of autoreactive CD4+ T cells to expand instead of undergoing apoptosis in response to physiologic cues (4Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 5Watson M.L. Rao J.K. Gilkeson G.S. Ruiz P. Eicher E.M. Pisetsky D.S. Matsuzawa A. Rochelle J.M. Seldin M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In these animals, treatment with Bz-423 specifically reduced activated CD4+ cells (6Bednarski J.J. Warner R.E. Rao T. Leonetti F. Yung R. Richardson B.C. Johnson K.J. Ellman J.A. Opipari Jr., A.W. Glick G.D. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, an expanded population of activated B cells within GCs mediates disease in NZB/W mice. These activated B cells drive autoantibody production and pathogenicity that ultimately results in lupus nephritis (7Dixon F.J. Andrews B.S. Eisenberg R.A. McConahey P.J. Theofilopoulos A.N. Wilson C.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1978; 21: S64-S67Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Shlomchik M.J. Craft J.E. Mamula M.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Administering Bz-423 to NZB/W mice selectively targeted activated GC B cells and reduced the number and size of GCs. These mice also had reduced autoantibody levels and improved glomerulonephritis. Although a complete molecular explanation for the abnormal GC persistence in NZB/W mice is not yet known, current evidence implicates defects in normal tolerance mechanisms, including defective B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) (9Kozono Y. Kotzin B.L. Holers V.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4498-4503PubMed Google Scholar). In normal immune BALB/c mice, Bz-423 neither decreased viability nor increased apoptosis of splenic lymphocytes nor affected physiologic GC responses. Thus, at therapeutic doses, Bz-423 selectively kills disease-causing cells. Because GC-derived cells have also been shown to mediate disease pathogenesis in human SLE, we were particularly interested in understanding the mechanistic basis for the selectivity of Bz-423 in these cells. B cells acquire and maintain a GC phenotype through a process that depends upon stimulation of BCR. GC homeostasis also depends upon BCR-coupled apoptosis, which is defective in SLE and NZB/W mice (10Guzman-Rojas L. Sims-Mourtada J.C. Rangel R. Martinez-Valdez H. Immunology. 2002; 107: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that BCR stimulation might be involved in enhancing sensitivity to Bz-423, resulting in the selectivity observed in the NZB/W studies. Therefore, we embarked on a line of investigation testing the hypothesis that BCR stimulation facilitates killing by Bz-423. Reagents—Bz-423 was synthesized as described previously (11Bunin B.A. Plunkett M.J. Ellman J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4708-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Unless noted, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. Dihydroethidium (DHE), was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Manganese(III)meso-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin (MnTBAP) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin M (IgM) was obtained from ICN (Aurora, OH); soluble goat Fab2 anti-human IgM was obtained from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL); anti-human CD40 monoclonal antibody clone 5C3 was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Animals, Primary B Cells, Cell Lines, and Culture—6-week-old female Balb/C mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were euthanized and the spleens were removed for analysis. Splenocytes were obtained by mechanical disruption with isotonic lysis of red blood cells. B cell-rich fractions were prepared by negative selection using magnetic cell sorting with CD4, CD8a, and CD11b-coated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Ramos cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and l-glutamine (290 μg/ml). Media for primary cells also contained 2-mercaptoethanol (50 μm). In vitro studies were performed in media containing 2% FBS and 0.5% Me2SO. Analysis of Lymphoid Cell Markers—Surface markers were detected with fluorescent-conjugated anti-Thy 1.2 (1 μg/ml, PharMingen) and/or anti-B220 (1 μg/ml, PharMingen). Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). B Cell Stimulation—Cell lines were stimulated with soluble goat Fab2 anti-human IgM (1 μg/ml) and/or purified anti-human CD40 (2.5 μg/ml). Primary mouse B cells were stimulated with affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgM (20 μg/ml, ICN) immobilized in culture wells and/or soluble purified anti-mouse CD40 (clone HM40-3, 2.5 μg/ml, PharMingen). Bz-423 was added 10 min before stimuli were applied. Inhibitors were added 30 min prior to Bz-423. Determination of Synergy—Synergistic effects upon cytotoxicity between Bz-423 and anti-IgM were evaluated using isobologram analysis as described previously (12Gessner P.K. Toxicology. 1995; 105: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Tallarida R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 865-872PubMed Google Scholar). For this analysis, two series of dosage curves were obtained. First, using fixed concentrations of Bz-423, the EC50 values (i.e. the concentration at which 50% of the cells are dead) of anti-IgM were measured. Then, at fixed concentrations of anti-IgM, the EC50 values of Bz-423 were obtained. These EC50 values were used to construct isobolograms. Detection of Cell Death and Intracellular ROS—Cell viability, hypodiploid DNA, and O2·¯ were measured by flow cytometry staining with propidium iodide (PI) and DHE, as described previously (3Blatt N.B. Bednarski J.J. Warner R.E. Leonetti F. Johnson K.M. Boitano A. Yung R. Richardson B.C. Johnson K.J. Ellman J.A. Opipari Jr., A.W. Glick G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Concentration [Ca2+]i Using Fura 2—The cell-permeable acetoxymethyl ester form of Fura 2 (2.5 μm, Fura 2-AM) was added to Ramos cells (107/ml) in loading buffer (1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% FBS). Fura 2-AM is retained in the cell after being de-esterified by esterases in the cytoplasm; when excited at two alternate wavelengths (340 and 380 nm), the ratio of fluorescence emission at 510 nm is related to [Ca2+]i independently of intracellular dye concentration. After incubating 30 min at 37 °C to load with Fura 2, cells were washed and then resuspended in loading buffer at 106/ml; 200 μl (2 × 105 cells) were added per well to a 96-well plate. As indicated, cells were pre-incubated with Bz-423 or solvent control for 2 min, warmed to 37 °C, and anti-IgM (1 μg/ml) was added, immediately after which fluorescence (510 nm) was monitored every 15 s over 8 min using a microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence specific to Fura 2 was calculated as the difference between the fluorescence intensities from Fura 2-loaded cells and unloaded cells. The maximal fluorescence at 380 nm determined by the addition of ionophore Br-A23187 (2 μg/ml) and minimum fluorescence at 340 nm determined by the addition of EGTA (35 mm) to Br-A23187-treated cells were used to calculate [Ca2+]i as described (14Hirst R.A. Harrison C. Hirota K. Lambert D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 114: 31-39PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of [Ca2+]i within Single Cells using Flow Cytometry—Ramos cells (107/ml) were incubated (30 min, 37 °C) with the cell-permeable fluorescent dye Fluo-3 AM (4 μg/ml) in loading buffer (1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% FBS) containing Pluronic (0.02%) and Probe-necid (4 μm). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in loading buffer at 106/ml. Cell suspensions were incubated with Bz-423 for 10 min at room temperature, warmed to 37 °C, then analyzed on the flow cytometer continuously for 10 min with the temperature maintained at 37 °C. [Ca2+]i was calculated as described previously based upon maximum Fluo-3 fluorescence (determined by the addition of 2 μg/ml Br-A23187) and minimum fluorescence (determined by addition of 35 mm EGTA to Br-A23187-treated cells). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was conducted by using the SPSS software package. All data are presented as mean ± S.D. BCR-stimulation Sensitizes Cells to Bz-423—B cells acquire and maintain a GC phenotype through a process that depends upon stimulation of BCRs (10Guzman-Rojas L. Sims-Mourtada J.C. Rangel R. Martinez-Valdez H. Immunology. 2002; 107: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To account for the selective GC reduction in the treated NZB/W mice, we postulated that BCR stimulation facilitates killing by Bz-423. To test this hypothesis, primary B cells were isolated by negative selection from splenocytes harvested from Balb/C mice. B cell-enriched isolates (>95% B220+/Thy1.2-) were incubated with immobilized polyclonal anti-IgM to extensively cross-link BCRs. This strong stimulus expectedly provoked AICD in ∼40% of cells (Fig. 2, white bars). When added alone, Bz-423 (4 μm) killed 20% of the cells (black bars). When Bz-423 (4 μm) was combined with anti-IgM, killing was greater than with either agent alone (gray bars). Cells were also co-stimulated during these treatments with antibody specific for CD40, because CD40 stimulation is a GC cell-survival signal linked with lupus pathogenesis (15Choi Y.S. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Cheng G. Schoenberger S.P. Curr. Dir. Autoimmun. 2002; 5: 51-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of anti-CD40, killing by anti-IgM alone was completely abrogated (40% killing decreased to 5%; see Fig. 2) and the response to Bz-423 was also decreased (20 to 9%.) Interestingly, however, the response to Bz-423 plus anti-IgM was not reduced to the same extent by CD40 (anti-IgM alone, 5%; Bz-423 alone, 9%; anti-IgM plus Bz-423, 38% killing). These data indicate that in primary B cells given a survival stimulus through CD40, BCR and Bz-423 cooperate to increase cytotoxic effects. Because primary B cells can not be maintained in culture over long periods of time, we chose to further investigate synergy in the immortalized, follicular B cell lymphoma Ramos cell line. Ramos cells are an Epstein-Barr virus-negative B cell lymphoma line and express surface markers and Bcl-6 consistently with a GC phenotype (17Klein G. Giovanella B. Westman A. Stehlin J.S. Mumford D. Intervirology. 1975; 5: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 18Moriyama M. Yamochi T. Semba K. Akiyama T. Mori S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More importantly, because Ramos cells mount an apoptotic response to BCR ligation like GC cells (19Kim D. Hur D.Y. Kim Y.S. Lee K. Lee Y. Cho D. Kang J.S. Kim Y.I. Hahm E. Yang Y. Yoon S. Kim S. Lee W.B. Park H.Y. Kim Y.B. Hwang Y.I. Chang K.Y. Lee W.J. Hum. Immunol. 2002; 63: 576-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 20Cragg M.S. Zhang L. French R.R. Glennie M.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), this line was suitable to examine the synergy between Bz-423 and BCR stimulation on cell death. Soluble anti-IgM Fab2 dose-dependently killed Ramos cells (Fig. 3A). When used at limiting concentrations (<1 μg/ml), anti-IgM Fab2 had very little effect upon their survival. When anti-IgM Fab2 (1 μg/ml) was applied together with increasing concentrations of Bz-423, the death response of Ramos cells to Bz-423 increased. Compared with cells treated with Bz-423 alone or Bz-423 plus a control antibody, the dose-response of Bz-423 in the presence of anti-IgM Fab2 shifted to lower concentrations (Fig. 3B). Anti-CD40 did not change the response of these cells to either Bz-423 alone or the Bz-423-anti-IgM Fab2 combination (data not shown). Isobolograms were used to confirm that Bz-423 in combination with anti-IgM Fab2 produce an effect whose magnitude is significantly increased relative to each individual agent. The concentrations of Bz-423 and anti-IgM Fab2 that each result in 50% death were plotted as axial points, and the straight line connecting these points was drawn to represent the dose pairs that would produce this effect additively (Fig. 3C). When actual combinations of Bz-423 and anti-IgM Fab2 producing 50 ± 5% killing were plotted, the points fell below this line, confirming that BCR stimulation plus Bz-423 have a super-additive or synergistic effect upon cell death in Ramos cells. Together, these results indicate that Bz-423 significantly increased activity in activated B cells, which may account for the therapeutic response observed in lupus mice. Bz-423 Augments Fab2-induced Apoptotic Signaling—To understand the basis for the synergistic death response, we probed the mechanism of cell death engaged in Ramos cells by a synergistic combination of Bz-423 (5 μm) and anti-IgM Fab2 (1 μg/ml). To confirm that apoptosis was being induced, we treated Ramos cells with doses of reagents equipotent at inducing cell death (i.e. 10 μm Bz-423 alone, 10 μg/ml anti-IgM Fab2 alone, or 5 μm Bz-423 plus 1 μg/ml anti-IgM Fab2) and examined the cellular morphology. Each treatment resulted in cytoplasmic vacuolization, nuclear condensation, and plasma membrane blebbing, which is consistent with apoptosis (Fig. 4A, and data not shown). Next, we examined other signaling events that have been shown to be involved in cell death induced by Bz-423 or anti-IgM. O2·¯ is rapidly induced by Bz-423 and is necessary for apoptosis and cell killing by this agent. However, inducible gene and protein expression, and specific elements of the apoptotic machinery, including caspase activity and the mitochondria permeability transition (MPT) are not required for Bz-423 to kill cells (3Blatt N.B. Bednarski J.J. Warner R.E. Leonetti F. Johnson K.M. Boitano A. Yung R. Richardson B.C. Johnson K.J. Ellman J.A. Opipari Jr., A.W. Glick G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, BCR-coupled AICD requires caspase activity, the MPT, and inducible protein synthesis, and is critically mediated by an early rise in intracellular calcium (21Donjerkovic D. Scott D.W. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on these differences, we treated cells with a range of specific inhibitors to distinguish which signaling events were necessary to induce the synergistic death response. We first tested whether ROS are required for synergistic killing and whether co-treatment with anti-IgM increases the Bz-423-induced O2·¯ did not seem to account for the supra-additive death response. Cycloheximide, cyclosporin A, Z-VAD-fmk, and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) were used in similar experiments to determine whether protein synthesis, the MPT, caspases, and the influx of extracellular calcium, respectively, were necessary for synergistic killing. As expected, each of these agents protected against killing by anti-IgM Fab2 and none protected against killing by Bz-423 (see Fig. 4B). Importantly, each agent abolished the synergistic effects of the Bz-423 and Fab2 combination. These data implicate calcium influx, the MPT, and inducible protein synthesis in synergistic killing. Because each of these is a component of the apoptotic AICD pathway, these results suggest that Bz-423-induced O2·¯ modulates the death mechanism normally coupled to BCR-stimulation in such a way as to produce a supra-additive death response. Bz-423-induced ROS Affects BCR-coupled Calcium Signaling—Because increased [Ca2+]i is an immediate and integral part of BCR-coupled signaling and ROS can modulate calcium release and re-uptake mechanisms, we hypothesized that Bz-423 amplifies BCR-coupled calcium signaling by means of a ROS-dependent mechanism. [Ca2+]i increases rapidly in response to BCR stimulation, and the magnitude and duration of this increase determine the cellular response to stimulation (22Healy J.I. Goodnow C.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 645-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In some instances, more exaggerated [Ca2+]i responses are associated with B cell developmental arrest and deletion (23Cyster J.G. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1995; 2: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To measure the [Ca2+]i in anti-IgM-stimulated cells in the presence of Bz-423, Ramos cells were pre-loaded with Fura-2, treated with Bz-423 or solvent control, and then stimulated with anti-IgM. Fura-2 is a calcium indicator that undergoes a shift in maximal absorption upon binding Ca2+, allowing ratiometric determination of [Ca2+]i. Fluorescence emission at 510 nm was monitored in response excitation at 340 and 380 nm as a function of time on a microtiter plate reader. The ratio of fluorescence (340 nm/380 nm) was used to calculate the [Ca2+]i. Brief exposure to Bz-423 (5 μm) prior to treatment with anti-IgM Fab2 resulted in a higher peak [Ca2+]i that reached a maximum of 200 nm (as compared with 120 nm with anti-Fab2 alone), and the normally transient response was prolonged (Fig. 5). Even after 10 min following BCR stimulation, [Ca2+]i was ∼180 nm in the Bz-423-treated cells, whereas in control cells, the level returned to baseline (≈50 nm) within 2 min after the addition of anti-IgM Fab2. These results suggest that Bz-423 is indeed able to modulate calcium signaling induced by BCR activation. Next, we sought to evaluate whether Bz-423-induced ROS was involved in modulating [Ca2+]i. In these experiments, [Ca2+]i was measured at the single cell level, which allowed us to determine both the fraction of cells responding and the magnitude of the response within individual cells. Fluo-3 was used to make these [Ca2+]i measurements because it is a calcium-sensitive fluorophore with properties suitable for flow cytometry. To confirm that the findings obtained with Fura-2 on the plate reader could be repeated with Fluo-3, Ramos cells were loaded with Fluo-3-AM and incubated with Bz-423 or solvent control for 5 min. Fluo-3 fluorescence was measured as a function of time after the addition of anti-IgM, during which samples were maintained at 37 °C. Consistent with the results above, Bz-423 caused the magnitude and duration of the calcium response to Fab2 to increase in the majority of cells. 50% of cells reach a peak calcium level of > 8-fold over baseline, compared with 10% of control cells, and the elevation is prolonged. After 10 min, 64% of cells continued to have a fluorescent intensity above the baseline (Fig. 6). In the control cells, a rapid increase in calcium was induced by Fab2 and resolved within 3 min, after which time, > 90% of cells had fluorescence at or below the median fluorescence intensity of unstimulated cells. Thus, by contrast, the calcium response in cells treated with Bz-423 is both amplified and prolonged. BAPTA, which chelates extracellular calcium and blocks synergistic killing, was used in these experiments to determine whether the increased [Ca2+]i resulting from Bz-423 depends upon extracellular Ca2+. Fluo-3-loaded cells were pre-incubated (30 min) with BAPTA prior to Bz-423 or vehicle control. When cells pre-treated with either BAPTA were treated with Bz-423 and then anti-IgM Fab2, the increase in [Ca2+]i associated with Bz-423 was significantly blunted (Fig. 6). As well, BAPTA reduced the calcium response to anti-IgM Fab2 in the absence of Bz-423. Because vitamin E reduces Bz-423-induced O2·¯, it was used to determine the functional importance of ROS in modulating [Ca2+]i. Vitamin E also significantly reversed the effects that Bz-423 had upon anti-IgM-induced [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6). In contrast, vitamin E had no effect upon the calcium response to anti-IgM in the absence of Bz-423. Taken together, our data show that Bz-423 dramatically increases BCR-coupled calcium signaling and that Bz-423-induced ROS is critical for affecting the increase. Thus, Bz-423 plus anti-IgM produce a synergistic death response because their individual signaling pathways intersect to coordinately affect [Ca2+]i. The selectivity of Bz-423 against GC B cells in autoimmune NZB/W mice prompted these studies, which have identified synergy between the cytotoxic effects of receptor stimulation and Bz-423 in B cells. Functionally, this synergy means that B cells undergo significant apoptosis in response to amounts of Bz-423 and anti-IgM that, as single agents, are not cytotoxic. Although ROS are not necessary for BCR-coupled AICD, the O2·¯ generated by Bz-423 is critical for the synergistic response. Given that O2·¯ does not diffuse across membranes (24Gus'kova R.A. Ivanov I.I. Kol'tover V.K. Akhobadze V.V. Rubin A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and only a small fraction of superoxide is vectorially released into the intermembrane space and enters the cytosol through voltage-dependent anion channels in the outer membrane (25Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 26Han D. Antunes F. Canali R. Rettori D. Cadenas E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5557-5563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), how does O2·¯ induced in mitochondria by Bz-423 affect BCR-coupled calcium responses that are regulated by cytosolic enzymes and other organelles? O2·¯ generated within the mitochondrial matrix is converted to H2O2 by manganese superoxide dismutase in the matrix. H2O2 freely and rapidly diffuses through membranes and enters the cytosol (27Antunes F. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In the reducing intracellular environment, O2·¯, H2O2, and/or -OH (the product of H2O2 breakdown in the Fenton reaction) are able to oxidize a variety of protein and lipid moieties throughout the cell, which ultimately results in the modulation of Ca2+ signaling. Hence, it is likely that H2O2 is the ROS that mediates the observed effects. Our findings show that the synergistic response depends upon extracellular calcium. However, because calcium influx across the plasma membrane is coupled to depletion of intra-cellular calcium stores in B cells (28Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Shcheynikov N. Kurosaki T. Muallem S. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the present data do not necessarily indicate that Bz-423-induced ROS directly affects calcium channels or pumps in the plasma membrane. Although this is a possibility, extracellular calcium sources may be engaged more indirectly, through capacitative regulation. There are multiple mechanisms by which Bz-423-induced ROS might modulate Ca2+ signaling. One possibility is that Bz-423-induced ROS ultimately increases signals in the BCR-induced cell death pathway that result in sustained Ca2+ levels. Bruton's tyrosine kinase and Syk (two of several protein tyrosine kinases activated by the BCR; Ref. 29Kurosaki T. Maeda A. Ishiai M. Hashimoto A. Inabe K. Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) are candidates for points of intersection, because H2O2 induces their activation (30Qin S. Stadtman E.R. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7118-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Takano T. Sada K. Yamamura H. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2002; 4: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and each has a critical role in determining calcium signaling by phosphorylating phospholipase Cγ (32Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The BCR initially phosphorylates and activates Syk as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase generates the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate that mediates membrane recruitment of Bruton's tyrosine kinase which, along with Syk, phosphorylates and activates phospholipase Cγ (29Kurosaki T. Maeda A. Ishiai M. Hashimoto A. Inabe K. Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) generated by phosphorylating phospholipase Cγ raises [Ca2+]i by binding to InsP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, depleting stores within the ER and triggering influx through the plasma membrane (33Bijsterbosch M.K. Rigley K.P. Klaus G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bruton's tyrosine kinase is a particularly appealing candidate, because when Bruton's tyrosine kinase is persistently activated, for example, by point mutation in its pleckstrinhomology domain, BCR cross-linking generates a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i identical to the response observed in our experiments (34Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Alternatively, because the ER lies close to the mitochondria, ROS emanating from the mitochondria might directly regulate Ca2+ release channels in the ER (ryanodine receptors and InsP3 receptors) or alter mechanisms that normally lower [Ca2+]i such as re-uptake by the Ca2+-ATPase in the ER (35Kourie J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1-C24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium-specific channels and pumps are sensitive to modulation by ROS either through direct oxidation of sulfhydryl groups located on the ion transport proteins (36Cai S. Sauve R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 158: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 37Jeulin C. Dazy A.C. Marano F. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 443: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), peroxidation of membrane phospholipids (38Burton K.P. Morris A.C. Massey K.D. Buja L.M. Hagler H.K. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1990; 22: 1035-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), or inhibition by lower ATP levels (39DiPolo R. Beauge L. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2002; 80: 43-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Bz-423-induced ROS could also modulate ER channels in a more indirect manner, using cytochrome c as a messenger to the ER. A recent description (40Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) of the interplay between calcium and cytochrome c coordinating mitochondrial-ER interactions and driving apoptosis provides another explanation for the exaggerated calcium response and insight into how increased calcium may trigger apoptosis. Boehning et al. (40Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) identified small-scale release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in response to agents including staurosporine and ceramide. Because Bz-423 acts directly on mitochondria, it is conceivable that it also causes a similar cytochrome c release. Boehning et al. then showed that the small amount of cytochrome c released is sufficient to bind to and promote calcium conductance through InsP3 receptors in the ER. The released calcium feeds back to the mitochondria, triggering a coordinate permeability transition and massive cytochrome c release from all mitochondria in the cell, ultimately engaging the caspase-dependent death machinery. It is possible that in an analogous fashion, the direct actions of Bz-423 on the mitochondria lead to a similar early, small-scale cytochrome c response that contributes to the increased BCR-induced calcium release by sensitizing InsP3 receptors. Because [Ca2+]i is fundamental for B cell activation, proliferation, and apoptosis, it is not surprising that the changes in calcium signaling effected by Bz-423 are functionally important. Among the parameters that influence BCR-driven apoptosis, the magnitude of the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by receptor ligands is directly correlated with the apoptotic outcome induced by BCR stimulation (41Grafton G. Goodall M. Gregory C.D. Gordon J. Cell. Immunol. 1997; 182: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the magnitude and duration of the intracellular calcium response to BCR ligation precisely determines the differential triggering of the transcriptional regulators nuclear factor-κB, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, nuclear factor of activated T cells, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase that ultimately dictate the characteristics of a cellular response (42Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to influencing BCR-coupled calcium signals in AICD, Bz-423 may modulate other B cell responses to antigen receptor stimulation. In summary, we have demonstrated that the cytotoxic, immunomodulatory agent Bz-423 synergizes with BCR stimulation, and it is likely that this effect accounts (at least in part) for the selectivity observed in vivo. Considering that other receptors on B cells, which are effectively targeted by therapeutic antibodies presently in clinical use, are also coupled to calcium signals (for example the CD20 B cell-specific surface molecule targeted by Rituxan; Ref. 43Chinn P. Braslawsky G. White C. Hanna N. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2003; 52: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), it may be possible to exploit Bz-423 for cancer chemotherapy. Our findings suggest how the properties of Bz-423 could provide therapeutic utility for autoimmunity, and current efforts are aimed at evaluating these possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W2114718801,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis-specific HOP1, which encodes a core component of synaptonemal complex, plays a key role in proper pairing of homologous chromosomes and processing of meiotic DNA double strand breaks. Isolation and analysis of hop1 mutants indicated that these functions require Cys371 of Hop1 embedded in a region (residues 343–378) sharing homology to a zinc finger motif (ZnF). However, the precise biochemical function of Hop1, or its putative ZnF, in these processes is poorly understood. Our previous studies revealed that Hop1 is a DNA-binding protein, showed substantially higher binding affinity for G4 DNA, and enhances its formation. We report herein that ZnF appears to be sufficient for both zinc as well as DNA-binding activities. Molecular modeling studies suggested that Hop1 ZnF differs from the previously characterized natural ZnFs. The zinc-binding assay showed that the affinity for zinc is weaker for C371S ZnF mutant compared with the wild type (WT) ZnF. Analysis of CD spectra indicated that zinc and DNA induce substantial conformational changes in WT ZnF, but not in C371S ZnF mutant. The results from a number of different experimental approaches suggested that the DNA-binding properties of ZnF are similar to those of full-length Hop1 and that interaction with DNA rich in G residues is particularly robust. Significantly, WT ZnF by itself, but not C371S mutant, was able to bind duplex DNA and promote interstitial pairing of DNA double helices via the formation of guanine quartets. Together, these results implicate a direct role for Hop1 in pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis.

Significantly, WT ZnF by itself, but not C371S mutant, was able to bind duplex DNA and promote interstitial pairing of DNA double helices via the formation of guanine quartets. Together, these results implicate a direct role for Hop1 in pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. For faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, each chromosome must recognize, pair, and recombine with its correct partner. This is achieved by a string of rather poorly defined processes. However, it has become increasingly apparent that, prior to segregation, homologous chromosomes undergo a series of biochemical changes that increase their compaction (1Scherthan H. Loidl J. Schuster T. Schweizer D. Chromosoma. 1992; 101: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), reorganize their orientation in the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 2Hiraoka Y. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and resolve spatial and topological issues among and within themselves (3von Wettstein D. Rasmussen S.W. Holm P.B. Annu. Rev.

In many eukaryotes, pairing culminates in synapsis, wherein homologous chromosomes are physically linked along their entire lengths by a meiosis-specific proteinaceous structure called the synaptonemal complex (SC) 1The abbreviations used are: SC, synaptonemal complex; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CD, circular dichroism; DTT, dithiothreitol; form I DNA, negatively supercoiled DNA; form II DNA, nicked circular double-stranded DNA; form III DNA, linear double-stranded DNA; WT, wild-type; ZnF, zinc-finger motif; FBA, filter binding assay.1The abbreviations used are: SC, synaptonemal complex; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CD, circular dichroism; DTT, dithiothreitol; form I DNA, negatively supercoiled DNA; form II DNA, nicked circular double-stranded DNA; form III DNA, linear double-stranded DNA; WT, wild-type; ZnF, zinc-finger motif; FBA, filter binding assay. (reviewed in Ref. 3von Wettstein D. Rasmussen S.W. Holm P.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 331-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that genetic exchange between homologous chromosomes occurs in this context, which is facilitated by the formation of chiasmata (6Sym M. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analysis reveals that the SC is composed of two lateral elements, one on each homologue, and a central element that, in turn, are linked by transverse elements (7Roeder G.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 8Zickler D. Kleckner N. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 603-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar).The precise mechanism by which the SC components facilitate pairing of meiotic chromosomes is unclear. However, observations of presynaptic alignment and the display of substantial levels of homologue pairing in asynaptic organisms implicate a role for SC in maintaining rather than initiating pairing of homologues (reviewed in Ref. 7Roeder G.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In addition, homologous chromosomes interact with each other during genetic exchange in the absence of SC. These interactions are not prerequisites for pairing; rather, they are believed to contribute to the maintenance of pairing. Consistent with these observations, numerous yeast mutants that are deficient in homologous recombination do not completely lack pairing, although the amount of pairing is decreased and synapsis is defective in these mutants (9Loidl J. Klein F. Scherthan H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1191-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Weiner B.M. Kleckner N.

Genetics. 1995; 141: 75-86PubMed Google Scholar).In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genetic analyses have identified mutants defective in meiotic chromosome synapsis, some of which produce strong asynaptic phenotypes and abnormal SC structures (7Roeder G.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2600-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 8Zickler D. Kleckner N. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 603-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). The genes that encode SC components include HOP1, HOP2, RED1, ZIP1, ZIP2, and ZIP3 (12Hollingsworth N.M. Byers B. Genetics. 1989; 121: 445-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hollingsworth N.M.

Cell. 1998; 94: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HOP1, which specifies a component of lateral element of SC, is required for proper pairing of meiotic chromosomes (13Hollingsworth N.M. Goetsch L. Byers B. Cell. 1990; 61: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), whereas the HOP2 gene product quells synapsis between non-homologous chromosomes (19Leu J.-Y. Chua P.R. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Like Hop1, Red1 is a major component of SC lateral elements (20Smith A.V. Roeder G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Hop1 colocalizes with Red1 to discrete sites on axial elements, which serve as precursors to lateral elements; however, Hop1 dissociates as these elements become incorporated into mature SCs (20Smith A.V. Roeder G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The Zip1 protein localizes along the lengths of synapsed meiotic chromosomes and serves as a major component of the central regions of SC (16Sym M. Engebrecht J. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1993; 72: 365-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Zip2 and Zip3 are present on meiotic chromosomes at discrete foci that correspond to the sites where synapsis initiates, and these proteins are required for the proper assembly of Zip1 along meiotic chromosomes (18Agarwal S. Roeder G.S. Cell. 2000; 102: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the functions of any of the SC proteins in chromosome pairing has not been established. In this regard, we reported that Hop1 protein is a structure-specific DNA-binding protein (21Muniyappa K. Anuradha S. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and that it is capable of promoting synapsis between a pair of double-stranded DNA helices (22Anuradha S. Muniyappa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2378-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Importantly, the interaction between double-stranded DNA helices occurs in a G4 DNA-dependent manner (22Anuradha S. Muniyappa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2378-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies revealed a biochemical function for Hop1, first for any SC component, in interstitial pairing of meiotic chromosomes.Zinc fingers (ZnF) are among the most ubiquitous protein domains found in eukaryotic organisms. The variant forms of ZnFs are distinguished by the arrangement of conserved zinc binding ligands: the most common configurations are CCHH, CCCC, CCHC, or CHCC motifs. The Cys2/His2 ZnFs fold into ββα structure by Zn2+ binding. The ZnF structure is stabilized by Zn2+ coordination of conserved histidine and cysteine residues and hydrophobic interaction among other residues in the ZnF. ZnFs function as recognition elements for interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins with high affinity (reviewed in Ref. 23Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons previously identified a motif (348CX2CX19CX2C374) (hereafter referred to as ZnF motif) in Hop1 (13Hollingsworth N.M. Goetsch L. Byers B. Cell. 1990; 61: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Freidman D.B. Hollingsworth N.M. Byers B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 449-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reminiscent of the Cys2/Cys2 type ZnF found in eukaryotic transcription factors (25Johnston M. Dover J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2401-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Cys2/Cys2 motif of Hop1 appears to be crucial for its function in meiosis, because a single mutation of C371S within the putative ZnF renders the hop1 mutant allele defective in sporulation and meiosis (13Hollingsworth N.M. Goetsch L. Byers B. Cell. 1990; 61: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Freidman D.B. Hollingsworth N.M. Byers B. Genetics. 1994; 136: 449-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ZnFs are often sequence-specific DNA-binding motifs, we asked whether Hop1 ZnF might bind DNA in a specific fashion. In this study, we have taken a biochemical approach to delineate the role of putative ZnF implicated in Hop1 function. Intriguingly, we find that Hop1 ZnF displays all of the known activities of full-length Hop1 protein. Together, these results implicate a direct role for Hop1 in meiotic chromosome pairing, processing of meiotic double-strand breaks, and recombination.MATERIALS AND METHODSPeptides, DNA, and Enzymes—The wild type Hop1-putative ZnF and its corresponding mutant peptide were obtained from Genemed Synthesis, Inc. The peptides were dissolved in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT, and their concentrations were determined at A275 nm (ϵ275 of Tyr = 1420 m–1 cm–1 and ϵ275 of Cys = 145 m–1 cm–1). The oligonucleotides were procured from Microsynth, Switzerland. Their sequences are as follows: 4G3, AATTCTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGG; 6G3, AATTCTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGTGGGTGTGG; OX-1T, ACTGTCGTACTTGATATTTTGGGGTTTTGGGGAATGTGA. T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from Invitrogen. The oligonucleotides or the top strand of the duplex DNA was labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Free ATP was removed by gel filtration using a Sephadex G50 column (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). The labeled strand of each duplex was annealed with an equimolar amount of unlabeled complementary strand. The annealing mixture was electrophoresed on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 89 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 1 mm EDTA. Duplex DNA was excised from the gel, eluted into TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA), and precipitated with 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 3 volumes of 95% ethanol. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in a minimum volume of TE buffer. G4 DNA using 4G3 and OX-1T oligonucleotides were prepared and isolated as described previously (21Muniyappa K. Anuradha S. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Circular single-stranded DNA and negatively superhelical DNA (form I) were prepared from bacteriophage M13 as described previously (27Cunningham R.P. Dasgupta C. Shibata T. Radding C.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 223-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Linear DNA (form III) was prepared by cleaving M13 form I DNA with BamHI as specified by the manufacturer.Radioactive Zinc Blotting Assay—Increasing concentrations of WT Hop1 ZnF or its corresponding C371S mutant peptide were vacuum-blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter strip, which was presoaked in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT). The blot was then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h followed by three washes of 15 min each with binding buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl). Subsequently, it was incubated with 40 μCi of 65ZnCl2 (specific activity, 138.66 mCi/g, Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai, India) in buffer B for 1 h at 24 °C. The unbound 65Zn was removed by washing the membrane three times with buffer B for 20 min. In the competition experiments, the indicated concentrations of metal ions were present in the buffer during all steps. The blot was then dried and visualized by autoradiography. The bands were quantified using the UVItech gel documentation system with UVI-BANDMAP software, and the values obtained were plotted using Graph pad Prism software.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm ZnCl2 and indicated concentrations of 32P-labeled DNA (duplex or single-stranded or G4 DNA) and Hop1 WT or mutant peptide. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and analyzed as described previously (28Kironmai K.M. Muniyappa K. Friedman D. Hollingsworth N.M. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1424-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on either 0.8% agarose or 8% polyacrylamide gels at 4 °Cin45 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 1 mm EDTA at 10 V/cm for 4 h. DNA-binding reactions with G4 DNA were analyzed as described (21Muniyappa K. Anuradha S. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Assays for G4 DNA formation were performed as described (21Muniyappa K. Anuradha S. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing concentrations of Hop1 WT or mutant peptides were incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (48-mer) and analyzed as described (21Muniyappa K. Anuradha S. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assays—Nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm; Sartorius) were treated with 0.5 m KOH for 30 min at 4 °C and washed extensively with filter binding assay (FBA) buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl) prior to use. Increasing concentrations of the Hop1 WT or mutant peptide and the indicated DNA substrate were mixed in 20 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, a 10-μl aliquot was applied onto a nitrocellulose filter (for determination of total radioactivity), and the remaining 10 μl was diluted into 0.8 ml of cold FBA buffer. The diluted samples were applied onto KOH-treated filters under vacuum and immediately washed with 5 ml of cold FBA buffer. The filters were dried, and the bound radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation. The data were analyzed by non-linear regression equation using the GraphPad Prism software. The peptide concentration at half-maximal binding yielded the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for various DNA substrates.Circular Dichroism Measurements—All the CD measurements were made on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter with constant nitrogen purge. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C in a 2-mm path length cell with a resolution of 0.2 nm over the wavelength range of 200–250 nm. Each spectrum represented the average of two scans. For Zn2+ titration experiments, increasing concentrations of ZnCl2 were added to a solution containing WT peptide (25 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. CD spectra were recorded at each point of titration following 5 min of incubation after the addition of Zn2+. The spectra were then corrected by subtraction of spectra obtained with buffer in the presence or absence of ZnCl2. To determine the dissociation constant for the peptide-zinc interaction, the changes in molar ellipticity at a single wavelength were plotted against the total zinc ion concentration. The zinc ion concentration required for half-maximal change in ellipticity yielded the Kd value.In DNA-binding experiments, increasing concentrations of various DNA substrates were added to a solution containing WT or mutant peptide (50 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. The spectra were recorded following 10 min of incubation after each addition of DNA. The spectra obtained for peptide·DNA complex were corrected by subtracting the spectra for DNA alone. The molar ellipticity (Θ) values were obtained using the conversion factor of 100/Cl, where C is the peptide concentration (molar), and l is the path length (centimeters).DNA Synapsis Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 10 pmol of indicated 32P-labeled duplex DNA were incubated with Hop1 WT or mutant peptide at the indicated concentrations for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of proteinase K (0.2 mg/ml), SDS (0.2%), and KCl (0.1 m). Following incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, samples were loaded onto an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 45 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) containing 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA at 10 V/cm at 24 °C for 4 h. The products were visualized by autoradiography.Dimethyl Sulfate Interference Assay—Partial methylation of 32P-labeled 48-bp duplex DNA containing a (G/G)8 stretch was carried out with 0.1% dimethyl sulfate in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) at 30 °C for 2 min (21Muniyappa K. Anuradha S. Byers B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Anuradha S. Muniyappa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2378-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of stop buffer (1.5 m sodium acetate, pH 7, 1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 25 μg of yeast tRNA/ml) and 300 μl of ethanol. DNA was precipitated with ethanol, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in TE buffer. A synapsis assay was carried out with partially methylated duplex DNA as described above. The duplex DNA and synapsis product were excised from the gel and eluted into TE buffer. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and subjected to cleavage by incubation with 1 m piperidine at 90 °C for 20 min. Samples were evaporated to dryness, and the pellets were resuspended in 90 μl of water. This procedure was repeated three times. The pellets were dissolved in a solution containing 80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH, and 0.1% each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Samples were denatured at 100 °C for 10 min and kept on ice, and equal amounts of DNA (in terms of radioactivity) were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The gel was electrophoresed at 1800 V for 2 h, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The bands were quantified in the UVItech gel documentation system, using UVI-BANDMAP software.Modeling of the Zinc Finger Peptides—The Gene Threader Fold Recognition server (29Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) was used to search for folds with maximum similarity to the Hop1 putative ZnF. The best fold was used to thread the structure of peptides and visualized using the Biodesigner program (created by Piotr Rotkiewicz, 2001, version 0.7).RESULTSTo explore the role of the ZnF motif in the mechanism of Hop1 function, we used four different approaches. First, the biochemical activity of WT ZnF in conjunction with its C371S mutant was assessed for their intrinsic affinity for zinc in zinc-binding assays. Second, these peptides were then examined for their ability to interact with DNA and promote pairing of DNA double helices. Third, interactions were substantiated using circular dichroism (CD) measurements by monitoring the conformational changes in the ZnF and filter-binding assays. Fourth, methylation interference experiments identified specific nucleotide residues involved in Hop1 ZnF promoted pairing of DNA double helices via the formation of G quartets.Generation and Characterization of Hop1 ZnFs—To explore whether the putative Hop1 ZnF is biologically active, we generated two peptides (36-mer, residues 343–378): wild-type (WT) encompassing the putative ZnF and its corresponding C371S mutant (mutation is highlighted with an asterisk, Fig. 1A). A typical zinc finger is ∼30 amino acid residues long and is folded into a compact domain with a carboxyl-terminal α-helix containing invariant Cys/His residues coordinated through zinc to the Cys/His of β-sheet at the amino-terminal end (30Lee M.S. Gippert G.P. Soman K.V. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Science. 1989; 245: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 31Klevit R.E. Herriot J.R. Horvath S.J. Proteins. 1990; 7: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although Hop1 ZnF is of similar length, its secondary structure differs from the previously characterized natural ZnFs. In particular, the positions of α-helix and β-sheet are inverted in the Hop1 ZnF (Fig. 1B). The schematic structure shows that the amino-terminal amino acids of Hop1 ZnF fold into the α-helical structure, whereas the residues at the carboxyl-terminal end fold into the β-sheet. As shown in Fig. 1B, a pair of cysteine residues reside in the α-helix, and an identical number in the β-sheet of the ZnF. Compared with the WT ZnF, its corresponding C371S mutant exhibits a substantially deviant secondary structure (Fig. 1C). The C371S mutant peptide formed a short α-helix, which appears to be inadequate to fold into the zinc-binding domain, suggesting that Cys371 plays a key role in contributing to the overall structural integrity of Hop1 protein. This is not surprising, because the energy associated with the coordination of zinc ion is known to facilitate folding of ZnFs (32Pan T. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Parraga G. Horvath S.J. Eisen A. Taylor W.E. Hood L. Young E.T. Klevit R.E. Science. 1988; 241: 1489-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).Zinc Binding by Hop1 ZnF—Because the Hop1 ZnF is shown to be essential for its function in vivo (13Hollingsworth N.M. Goetsch L. Byers B. Cell. 1990; 61: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the WT and its corresponding C371S mutant peptides were assessed for their ability to bind 65Zn in zinc blot assays (34Schiff L.A. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4195-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Treich I. Riva M. Sentenac A. J. Biol.

The radioactive zinc blot assays have been used to demonstrate zinc-binding efficiencies to a variety of proteins and their mutants (37Donalson I.M. Friesen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13780-13788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of WT Hop1 ZnF and its corresponding C371S mutant were subjected to the zinc blot assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” Briefly, increasing concentrations of the WT Hop1 ZnF and its corresponding C371S mutant were spotted on a strip of nitrocellulose paper. It was then incubated with 65Zn, washed with excess buffer to remove the unbound 65Zn, and subjected to autoradiography. The amount of 65Zn bound to WT and mutant ZnF is shown in Fig. 2A. The results suggest that binding of 65Zn by the WT ZnF is linear, whereas the C371S mutant ZnF bound increasing amounts of 65Zn in the 2–10 μm range and then reach a plateau (Fig. 2B). However, it is not clear whether this represents a background activity of nonspecific zinc ion binding, or it possesses a weak but specific zinc-binding activity. The ZnFs often bind other divalent cations (38Vallee B.L. Galdes A. Adv. Enzymol. 1984; 56: 283-431PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of binding of 65Zn to the Hop1 ZnFs was examined in the presence of nonradioactive Zn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+. Whereas the binding activity was not affected by the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+, several metal ions that are capable of tetrahedral coordination decreased binding of 65Zn to the WT Hop1 ZnF to varying extents (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2WT Hop1 ZnF displays high affinity while the C371S mutant reduced affinity for 65Zn. A, 65Zn blot assay. Increasing concentrations of the WT or mutant peptide was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with 65Zn as described under “Materials and Methods.” E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) was used as negative control. B, quantification of zinc binding. The autoradiogram shown in Fig. 2A was scanned, and the data are plotted against the peptide concentration. C, competition of 65Zn binding by divalent metal ions. Wild type peptide (4 μg) was blotted onto nitrocellulose filter in multiple sets. Each strip was incubated with 65ZnCl either in the absence (none) or presence of competitor metal ions at 2indicated concentrations. Blots were washed and visualized by autoradiography. D, determination of the dissociation constant of peptide·Zn2+ complex. The ellipticity values at 222 nm are plotted against the Zn2+ concentration. The Kd value was obtained from non-linear regression analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Zinc Induces Conformational Changes in Hop1 ZnF—It is possible to assess metal ion binding to synthetic peptides by examining conformational changes in the secondary structure using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in the far-UV region in the range of 175–260 nm (39Johnson Jr., C.W. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the 36-mer peptides can fold into ZnFs, changes in their secondary structure were monitored in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of Zn2+. In the presence of Zn2+, WT Hop1 ZnF displayed significant conformational changes in secondary structure, which led to the conversion of random coil to the ordered state (data not shown).

We demonstrated recently that estrogen resistance in NWP cells was associated with the overexpression of two proteins, a nonreceptor-related, dominant-negative-acting estrogen response element (ERE)-binding protein (ERE-BP) and an intracellular estradiol-binding protein (IEBP). Based on the N-terminal sequences of tryptic fragments of IEBP isolated from a 17β-estradiol (E2) affinity column we cloned a full-length cDNA for IEBP from the estrogen-resistant NWP cell line, B95-8. Subsequent sequence analysis revealed 87% sequence identity between the deduced peptide for IEBP and human Hsp27. When hormone-responsive, wild-type Old World primate (OWP) cells were transiently transfected with IEBP cDNA, E2-directed ERE reporter luciferase activity was reduced by 50% compared with vector only-transfected OWP cells (p < 0.0018). When IEBP and ERE-BP were cotransfected, ERE promoter-reporter activity was reduced by a further 60% (p < 0.0001). Electrophoresis mobility shift analyses showed that IEBP neither bound to ERE nor competed with the estrogen receptor (ER) for binding to ERE. However, there was evidence of protein-protein interaction of IEBP and ERα; IEBP was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-ERα antibody in wild-type cells stably transfected with IEBP. A specific interaction between ERα and IEBP was confirmed in glutathione S-transferase pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays. Data indicate that the Hsp27-related IEBP interacts with the ligand binding domain of the ERα. In summary, by inhibiting the ERα-E2 interaction, IEBP acts to squelch ERα-directed ERE-regulated transactivation and promote estrogen resistance in NWP cells.

A central point of distinction between NWPs and OWPs resides in the fact that NWPs display relative resistance to adrenal, gonadal, and vitamin D sterol/steroid hormones (1Brown G.M. Grota L.J.

The precise mechanism for this remains unclear but does not involve aberrant expression of nuclear receptors for specific steroid hormones (12Reynolds P.D. Pittler S.J. Scammell J.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 465-472PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chun R.F. Chen H. Boldrick L. Sweet C. Adams J.S. Am. J.

Metab. 1995; 6: 160-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Instead, hormone resistance in NWP cells appears to be the result of epigenetic factors, which result either in low affinity receptorsteroid binding kinetics or attenuation of receptor-DNA interaction. For example, studies of glucocorticoid resistance in NWP cells have shown increased expression of the heat shock protein (Hsp)90-associated FK506-binding immunophilin FKBP51, which inhibits ligand binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GR) (15Denny W.B. Valentine D.L. Reynolds P.D. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). By contrast, vitamin D resistance in NWPs appears to be caused by aberrant expression of a dominant-negative-acting vitamin D response element-binding protein (VDRE-BP), the protein being homologous to human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A (hnRNPA) (16Chen H. Hu B. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35557-35564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Estrogen resistance in NWP is associated with the overexpression of two proteins, a nonreceptor-related estrogen response element (ERE)-binding protein (ERE-BP) (17Chen H. Arbelle J.E. Gacad M.A. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Chen H. Hu B. Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31352-31357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and an intracellular estradiol-binding protein (IEBP) (19Chen H. Hu B. Huang G.H. Trainor A.G. Abbott D.H. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Gacad M.A. Chen H. Arbelle J.E. LeBon T. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8433-8440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ERE-BP is a member of hnRNPC-like family and acts to squelch estrogen receptor (ER)-ERE transactivation by competing with the ER for binding to ERE (16Chen H. Hu B. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35557-35564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Chen H. Arbelle J.E. Gacad M.A. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). IEBP is a member of the Hsp27 family and is overexpressed in female and male estrogen-resistant NWP cells and tissue (19Chen H. Hu B. Huang G.H. Trainor A.G. Abbott D.H. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In recent studies we have sought to clarify the molecular function of these intracellular- and response element-binding proteins. Although ERE-BP and its vitamin D counterpart, VDRE-BP, appear to fulfill dominant-negative, cis-acting functions, the actions of IEBP are less clear. With regard to IEBP we considered two countervailing hypotheses to explain the function of this protein. One postulate held that IEBP competes with the ER for binding of its ligand 17β-estradiol (E2) thus squelching E2-ER-directed signaling. The opposing hypothesis held that IEBP aids in delivery of E2 to the ER and promotes estrogen action in the cell. The latter view holds true with the intracellular vitamin D-binding protein (IDBP) and the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), where IDBP overexpression increases 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR-directed transactivation (21Wu S. Ren S. Chen H. Chun R.F. Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 14: 1387-1397Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether IEBP acts in a fashion analogous to IDBP we have cloned the candidate IEBP cDNA from estrogen-resistant NWP cells. In functional studies we demonstrate that, unlike its vitamin D counterpart, IEBP acts to squelch E2-ER-mediated transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IEBP can cooperate in a dominant-negative mode with the ERE-BP by acting as an intracellular repository for E2 and/or by association with the ligand binding domain of the ER, thereby blocking its transactivating potential. In either case, the net effect is to interrupt ER-ER homodimerization, thereby legislating hormone resistance. These data suggest that the regulation of E2-ER signaling by IEBP is an important prereceptor determinant of estrogen action. Cell Culture and Postnuclear Extracts—All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The estrogen-resistant NWP cell line B95-8, derived from the hormone-resistant common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium. The estrogen-responsive OWP breast cell line 6299, derived from a rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific Irvine, CA). Cell culture conditions and postnuclear cell extraction were performed as described previously (22Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1264-1267PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, confluent cultures were preincubated up to 48 h in medium containing 10 nm E2 prior to harvest and preparation of extracts. Molecular Cloning of the IEBP—Based on the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal tryptic peptide (RVPFSL) of IEBP, we designed an IEBP-specific sense oligonucleotide primer and its reversion antisense primer for 5′- and 3′-RACE. Poly(A)+ RNA (2.5 μg) from B95-8 cells was used as the template to generate the 5′- and 3′-ends of the IEBP cDNA with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Second-strand cDNA synthesis and adapter ligation were performed as instructed in the enclosed manual. The adapterligated cDNA was then used as template for annealing adapter- and IEBP-specific primers for the RACE reaction: 5′-CGCAGGAGCGAGAAGGGGACGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGTCCCCTTCTCGCTCCTGCG-3′ for the 5′- and 3′-RACE of IEBP, respectively. A cDNA for the IEBP was generated by end-to-end amplification using specific 5′- and 3′-primers. The amplified products were then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5/His/TOPO expression vector and sequenced by the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Sequencing Core Facility using dye terminator cycle sequence reactions on ABI automated sequencers. Transient Transfections—5 × 105 estrogen-resistant NWP B95-8 or estrogen-responsive OWP breast 6299 cells were seeded into 6-well plates in phenol red-free medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum and allowed to proliferate to 80–90% confluence. Transfections were performed in triplicate with the following combinations of DNA preparations to a maximum final concentration of 20 μg DNA/ml in LipoTAXI solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA): (i) 5.5 μg of ERE-luciferase reporter plasmid; (ii) 0.5 μg of ERα expression plasmid (pRShER); (iii) 5.0 μg of IEBP or ERE-BP plasmid (in cDNA3.1/V5/His/TOPO vector); (iv) 5.0 μg of β-galactosidase expression construct as internal control; and (v) pGEM-3z vector DNA as carrier (Promega, Madison, MI). An equal volume of 20% fetal calf serum-supplemented, antibiotic-free medium was added to each well 5 h after transfection followed by the addition of 10 nm E2. After an additional 48 h at 37°C, the cells were lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. Generation of Cell Lines Overexpressing the IEBP—E2-responsive OWP 6299 breast cells were incubated with 5.0 μg of pcDNA3.1/V5/His/TOPO IEBP plasmid in LipoTAXI solution for 5 h followed by the addition of an equal volume of 20% fetal calf serum-supplemented medium. After incubation overnight, cells were split (1:10 ratio) and incubated with fresh medium containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin-selective antibiotic G418 sulfate (Invitrogen). This medium was replaced every 3–4 days until stable colonies formed. Single colonies were picked, transferred into a new dish, and incubated with medium containing the selection antibiotic G418 until confluence was attained. Ligand Binding Analysis—Specific [3H]E2 binding was measured in postnuclear extracts of vector alone and the three IEBP stably transfected cell lines. Briefly, postnuclear extracts isolated as described above were reconstituted in NaCl-containing ETD buffer (pH 8.0) to achieve a final salt concentration of 0.5 m NaCl and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 nm [3H]E2 in the presence or absence of 0.1–100 nm unlabeled competitive ligand. Protein-bound [3H]E2 was separated from unbound sterol by incubation with dextran-coated charcoal. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. Western Blot Analysis—Denatured cell extracts were subjected to electrophoresis using 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (16Chen H. Hu B. Allegretto E.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35557-35564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated with monoclonal anti-human Hsp27 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for another 1 h prior to detection of antibody-reactive proteins with chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml of aprotinin, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) by incubation on ice for 10 min. The resulting lysates were then disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 23-gauge needle, and cell supernatants were obtained by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min). Aliquots of supernatant (containing 50 μg of protein each) were then incubated with anti-ERα or anti-Hsp27 antibody overnight at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz) was added and incubated at 4 °C for another 1 h. The protein mixtures were then washed by repeated centrifugation in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (four times) and phosphate-buffered saline (once). The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. After boiling, samples were analyzed by 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analyses were then carried out using anti-ERα and anti-Hsp27 antibodies and visualized by ECL. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The full-length ERα cDNA was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGGGAATTCCATATGACCATGACCCTCCACACCAAAGCATCAGGG-3′ and 5′-GCCAGGGGGATCCTCAGACTGTGGCAGGGAAACCCTC-3′. The ERα cDNA was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI site of GAL4 DNA binding domain vector (GAL4 DNA-BD/ER). The full-length human Hsp27 cDNA was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-GCCGAATTCGCCCAGCGCCCCGCACTTTT-3′ and 5′-CCCCTCGAGGGTGGTTGCTTTGAACTTTATTTGAG-3′. The IEBP cDNA was cloned into EcoRI and XhoI site of GAL4 DNA activation domain vector. GAL4 DNA-BD/ER was cotransformed with the GAL4 DNA-AD/Hsp27 plasmid using a Yeast Transformation System 2 kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions; some of the plates were treated with water (control), 10–100 nm E2, or 10–100 nm tamoxifen. GST Pull-down Assay—A GST fusion protein with the ligand-binding domain of ERα (residues 246–595) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Postnuclear extracts were applied to the GST beads and incubated for 1 h. The loaded GST-extract mixture was then washed repetitively (five times) with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and resuspended in 2 × SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Denatured protein were resolved on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with appropriate antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and visualized by ECL. Statistics—Where indicated, experimental means were compared statistically using an unpaired Student's t test. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of IEBP cDNA—In previous studies we identified and characterized tryptic fragments of an E2 affinity column-purified protein that corresponded to the putative IEBP in NWP B95-8 cells (19Chen H. Hu B. Huang G.H. Trainor A.G. Abbott D.H. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To clone the cDNA corresponding to this protein we used degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of tryptic peptides (see “Experimental Procedures”) to carry out RACE generation of candidate cDNAs. Analysis of the resulting deduced amino acid sequence for IEBP (Fig. 1) revealed 87% sequence identity to the human Hsp27 and 40 and 44% sequence identity to small Hsp-related human α-crystallin A and B, respectively (Fig. 2; 23Pasta S.Y.

Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44214-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The greatest degree of sequence identity among the NWP IEBP, human Hsp27, and the α-crystallins (Fig. 2) was observed in two places (shaded areas in Fig. 1), at residue positions 26–34 near the N terminus and in the central portions, α-crystallin cores (residue positions 101–138) of the molecule. The greatest sequence identity (94%) between IEBP and Hsp27 was found in the middle of the two molecules. This region of IEBP and Hsp27 bears (i) a portion of a sequence homologous to the ATP binding/ATPase domain characteristic of all heat shock proteins (26Bhattacharyya T. Karnezis A.N. Murphy S.P. Hoang T. Freeman B.C. Phillips B. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), residue positions 65–116, underlined, Fig. 1); (ii) a region of sequence homology (residue positions 147–181, underlined, Fig. 1) that retains 18–35% sequence identity with the proximal reaches of the substrate binding domains of human Hsp90 and Hsp70 families (26Bhattacharyya T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); and (iii) a 16-amino acid-long region from residue positions 107 to 122 (superior dotted line, Fig. 1), which exhibits 38% sequence identity to the ligand binding domain of the human ERα (27Tamrazi A. Carlson K.E. Daniels J.R. Hurth K.M. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 12: 2706-2719Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28Greene G.L. Gilna P. Waterfield M. Baker A. Hort Y. Shine J. Science. 1986; 231: 1150-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that there was no LXXLL motif in this region of either IEBP or Hsp27 prototypical of a steroid hormone receptor (29Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J. Weber L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4127-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no tryptic peptides bearing a high degree of sequence identity with any of the known ER gene products or their naturally occurring, alternatively spliced derivatives (30Witek A. Ginekol. PolMar. 2003; 74: 246-251PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ferro P. Forlani A. Muselli M. Pfeffer U. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 12: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar) were identified from E2 affinity chromatography. These data suggest that the E2 affinity support was interactive with the ERα-like ligand binding domain of the IEBP.Fig. 2Degree of sequence identity among members of the sHsp family. The high degree of sequence identity between IEBP and human Hsp27 suggests that IEBP is the NWP homolog of Hsp27.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Functional Characterization—As stated above, purification of IEBP using E2 affinity chromatography confirmed its capacity for E2 binding (19Chen H. Hu B. Huang G.H. Trainor A.G. Abbott D.H. Adams J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) but did not elucidate the functional relevance of this protein in NWP cells. Therefore, experiments were carried out to clarify whether the transient overexpression of IEBP in NWP cells antagonized, facilitated, or did nothing to estrogen-induced transactivation (Fig. 3). As expected, estrogen-responsive OWP cells demonstrated a significant increase in ERE-directed reporter activity when exposed to an ER-saturating concentration of E2. When estrogen-responsive OWP cells were transiently cotransfected with IEBP cDNA as well as an ERE-promoter-reporter construct, ERE-directed luciferase activity was reduced 50% compared with vector alone-transfected OWP cells. Despite the down-regulation of reporter activity under the influence IEBP expression, transfected cells retained some responsiveness to E2. Transient overexpression of the known, NWP dominant-negative-acting ERE-BP (18Chen H. Hu B. Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31352-31357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in estrogen-responsive OWP cells also suppressed ERE-mediated transcription. When IEBP and ERE-BP were cotransfected there was an additive decrease in ERE-luciferase reporter activity to only 11% of basal activity. Similar results were also obtained after stable transfection of IEBP into OWP cells (Fig. 4A); increased expression of IEBP in each of the three subclones was confirmed by Western blot analyses using an anti-human Hsp27 antibody (data not shown). Promoter-reporter data showed that ERE-luciferase activity was decreased 2–3-fold in the presence of constitutively overexpressed IEBP compared with wild-type, vector alone-transfected cells (left panel, Fig. 4A). As with the transient transfectants (Fig. 3), this effect was only partially abrogated by pretreatment with E2 (right panel, Fig. 4A). Because they represented a stable resource for IEBP, the IEBP stable transfectant variants were useful models for assessment of specific E2 binding by IEBP. Data presented in Fig. 4B revealed variable but significantly increased E2 binding in postnuclear extracts of all three IEBP stable transfected OWP clones compared with control cells, with maximal displacement being greatest in the clone 1 cells, which exhibited the most profound squelching of basal and E2-stimulated ERE-luciferase activity. In each case the concentration of E2-required to achieve half-maximal displacement of [3H]E2 from IEBP was between 0.1 and 1.0 nm (Fig. 4B). Evidence for an Intracellular ERα-IEBP (Hsp27) Interaction—Analysis of both transient and stable transfectants indicated that IEBP acted to squelch ERE-directed transcription. Data presented in Fig. 4B suggest that this may be caused by competition of ERα and IEBP for ligand. However, it is also possible that IEBP interrupted ER-ERE-regulated transcription by a dominant-negative interaction with the ERα, the ERE, or both. To determine whether IEBP functions as a direct competitor with ERα for ERE binding, we carried out electrophoresis mobility shift analyses (EMSAs) using an idealized ERE as probe with (i) recombinant human ERα; (ii) ERE-BP purified by ERE-DNA affinity chromatography from postnuclear extracts of estrogen-resistant NWP cells (18Chen H. Hu B. Gacad M.A. Adams J.S. J. Biol.

Unlike the ERα, which demonstrated specific, anti-ERα“supershiftable” ERE binding in EMSA, the IEBP-containing clone 1 extract exhibited no ERE binding (7th lane, Fig. 5A). Data in Fig. 5B demonstrate that the addition of 100 nm E2 to the IEBP-containing EMSA reaction mixtures did nothing to alter the lack of an IEBP-ERE interaction; the positive control for these experiments was another NWP protein, the ERE-BP, which is known to interact in a specific manner with the consensus ERE (18Chen H.

To determine whether IEBP might participate in the ERα·ERE probe complex, anti-Hsp27 antibody was added to the reaction mixture for EMSA (4th and 5th lanes, Fig. 5C). The ERα·ERE complex was supershifted, indicating that anti-Hsp27-reactive protein (i.e. IEBP) was likely part of the ERα·ERE probe complex. However, unlike the addition of anti-ERα antibody to ERα·ERE complex, which resulted in a supershift of the entire ERα·ERE complex (fifth lane, Fig. 5A), there was residual ERα·ERE complex that was not supershifted upon addition of anti-Hsp27 antibody. Preliminary data (not shown) indicate that failure to achieve a “complete supershift” with anti-Hsp27 antibody results from an Hsp27-mediated reduction in the affinity of the ERα for ERE probe. Finally, the addition of E2 to the reaction mixture did little to alter the mobility of anti-Hsp27 antibody-IEBP·ERα·ERE complex, although there was some indication that the addition of E2 did diminish the inte"

Recently, the enzymes from mouse and rat were found to be localized at plasma membranes as a type II integral membrane protein, occasionally being detached from the cells after proteolytic processing of the NH2-terminal anchoring region (Tani, M., Iida, H., and Ito, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 10523–10530). We report here that conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues in the COOH-terminal tail are indispensable for the correct folding and localization, and enzyme activity of neutral ceramidase. Truncation of four, but not three, amino acid residues from the COOH terminus of rat neutral ceramidase resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity as well as cell surface expression in HEK293 cells. Point mutation analysis revealed that Ile758, the 4th amino acid residue from the COOH terminus, and Phe756 are essential for the enzyme to function. The truncated and mutated enzymes were found to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapidly degraded without transportation to the Golgi apparatus. Treatment of the cells expressing the aberrant COOH-terminal enzyme with MG-132, a specific inhibitor for the proteasome, increased the accumulation of the enzyme in the ER, indicating that the misfolded enzyme was degraded by the proteasome. It was also found that the COOH-terminal tail was indispensable for the enzyme activity and correct folding of the prokaryote ceramidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating that the importance of the COOH-terminal tail of the enzyme has been preserved through evolution.

Both Cer and Sph have been shown to induce growth arrest and apoptosis (1Pettus B.J. Charlfant C.E. Hannun Y.A. Biochem. Biophys.

Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Consequently, the balance of the cellular contents of Cer/Sph/S1P is thought to regulate the diversity of cellular responses.Ceramidase (CDase, EC 3.5.1.23) is an enzyme that cleaves the N-acyl linkage of Cer to produce Sph and free fatty acid (4Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three categories of CDases: acid, neutral, and alkaline, are clearly distinguished not only by their catalytic pH optima, but also their primary structures (5Ito M. Okino N. Tani M. Mitsutake S. Kita K. Futerman A.H. Ceramide Signaling. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2003: 41-48Google Scholar). Neutral CDase, which shows an optimum pH of 6.5–8.5, has been cloned from bacteria (6Okino N.

Accumulating evidence suggests that neutral CDase regulates the intracellular content of Cer and thereby Cer-mediated signaling. For example, an increase of Cer caused by the IL-1β-stimulated hydrolysis of SM was gradually normalized by up-regulation of neutral CDase as detected in mRNA and de novo synthesis levels after long term treatment with IL-1β, showing the function of neutral CDase as a cytoprotective enzyme in mesangial cells exposed to inflammatory stress (11Franzen R.

In contrast, nitric oxide (NO) down-regulates the protein expression of neutral CDase via a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism in renal mesangial cells, resulting in an increase of Cer after treatment of the cells with NO (12Franzen R. Fabbro D. Aschrafi A. Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46184-46190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Very recently, the targeted expression of neutral CDase was found to reverse the retinal degradation by normalizing the Cer level in Drosophila arrestin and phospholipase C mutants (13Acharya U. Patel S. Koundakjian E. Nagashima K. Han X. Acharya J.K. Science. 2003; 299: 1740-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These results suggest that neutral CDases may be suitable targets in the therapeutic management of cytokine-induced inflammation and retinal degeneration.Although the primary structure of neutral CDase is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals (8Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Tanigawa T. Izu H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11229-11234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the subcellular localization of the enzyme is quite different depending on its origin. Mammalian neutral CDases are present at the plasma membrane as a type II integral membrane protein, occasionally being detached from cells after proteolytic processing of the NH2-terminal anchoring region (14Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas the bacterial and invertebrate enzymes are solely secretory proteins (7Yoshimura Y. Okino N. Tani M. Ito M. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Okino N. Tani M. Imayama S. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14368-14373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may stem from whether a Ser/Thr-rich domain (mucin box) is present downstream of the NH2-terminal signal/anchor sequence of the enzyme, because all mammalian CDases possess a mucin box, whereas the bacterial and invertebrate enzymes do not, and a mutant mammalian CDase lacking the mucin box or possible O-glycosylation sites in the mucin box was secreted into the medium instead of localizing at the cell surface (14Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Very recently, a change in the COOH-terminal region of acid CDase was identified to be a novel mutation in Farber disease in which Cer is accumulated in lysosomes due to the inactivation of acid CDase (16Zhang Z. Mandal A.K. Mital A. Popescu N. Zimonjic D. Moser A. Moser H. Mukherjee A.B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that two conserved amino acid residues, Phe and Ile/Val, in the COOH-terminal domain were completely conserved in neutral CDases from bacteria to humans. Thus, we examine the role of the conserved COOH-terminal tail of neutral CDases using mammalian and bacterial enzymes. In conclusion, we demonstrated that two conserved amino acids in the COOH-terminal tail are indispensable for the correct folding and localization, and enzyme activity of neutral CDase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Anti-Rab6 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. S.

All other reagents were of the highest purity available.CDase Assay—The hydrolysis and reverse hydrolysis activities of neutral CDase were measured using C12-NBD-Cer (for the hydrolysis reaction) and NBD-dodecanoic acid and Sph (for the reverse hydrolysis reaction) as substrates (18Tani M.

Wild-type CDase tagged with FLAG at the NH2 terminus and Myc at the COOH terminus (FLAG-tagged CDase) was constructed as reported (14Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The truncation mutants were constructed by PCR as described below. COOH-terminal fragments were amplified with a 5′ primer (5′-TTGATGAAGCAAAGCCTG-3′) and a 3′ primer with a stop codon (double underlined) and a XhoI restriction site (underlined): 5′-AGACTCGAGCTATTCAAATGCTAGTATGACAGCAG-3′ (for Δ11 CDase), 5′-AGACTCGAGCTAAGGGGAAGAAATTCCTTCAAA-3′ (for Δ6 CDase), 5′-AGACTCGAGCTAAAAAGGGGAAGAAATTCCTTCA-3′ (for Δ5 CD-ase), 5′-AGACTCGAGCTATTCAAAAGGGGAAGAAATTCC-3′ (for Δ4 CDase), 5′-AGACTCGAGCTAAATTTCAAAAGGGGAAGAAATT-3′ (for Δ3 CDase). These fragments were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and subcloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) containing FLAG-tagged CDase cDNA. Site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type CDase was carried out by the amplification of COOH-terminal fragments with a 5′ primer (5′-TTGATGAAGCAAAGCCTG-3′) and a 3′ primer with a XhoI restriction site (underlined): 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGTAGTGACACGTTCAAAAGGGGAA-3′ (for I758R CDase), 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGTAGTGACATCTTCAAAAGGGGAA-3′ (for I758D CDase), 5′-ACTCGAGAGTAGTGACAAATTCAAAAGGGGAA-3′ (for I758F CDase), 5′-ACTCGAGAGTAGTGACAACTTCAAAAGGGGAA-3′ (for I758V CDase), 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGTAGTGACAATTTCATCAGGGGAA-3′ (for F756D CDase), 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGTAGTGACAATTTCACGAGGGGAA-3′ (for F756R CDase), 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGTAGTGACAATTTCAATAGGGGAA-3′ (for F756I CDase) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGAGTAGTGACAATTCGAAAAGGGGAA-3′ (for E757R CDase) (double underline shows the location of mutations). These fragments were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and subcloned into the vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) containing wild-type CDase cDNA. To obtain a plasmid vector containing Pseudomonas neutral CDase and the mutant DNA, DNA fragments were prepared by PCR using a 5′ primer containing a NheI site (5′-AAAGCTAGCATGTCACGTTCCGCATTCACC-3′) and a 3′ primer with a XhoI restriction site: 5′-TTTCTCGAGGGGAGTGGTGCCGAGCACCTC-3′ (for Pseudomonas wild type), 5′-ACTCGAGGGGAGTGGTGCCGAGATCCTCGA-3′(for Pseudomonas V665D), 5′-TCTCGAGTTACACCTCGAAGGAGCGGGTC-3′ (for Pseudomonas Δ5), and 5′-TCTCGAGTTACTCGAAGGAGCGGGTCGAG-3′ (for Pseudomonas Δ6) (double underline shows a stop codon). These fragments were digested with NheI and XhoI, and subcloned into the vector pET-23a (Novagen). Pseudomonas wild-type and V665D constructs were tagged with poly(His), but Δ5 and Δ6 were not because of the insertion of a stop codon at the COOH terminus. The sequences of these constructs were verified with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Japan; model 377).Cell Culture and cDNA Transfection—HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney cells, were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 60 μg/ml of kanamycin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. cDNA transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE™ Plus (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.Preparation of Culture Supernatants and Cell Lysates—At 18 h after transfection with the CDase cDNA, the medium was replaced with serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, 500 μl/well on 24-well plates) and cultured for an additional 24 h. The cell culture medium was collected and subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant, supplemented with a 1:10 volume of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 1% Triton X-100 and 33 μg/ml of proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin), was used as cell supernatant. Cells attached to the culture plate were rinsed with PBS and then lysed by adding 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 3.3 μg/ml of the proteinase inhibitors described above. Lysates were collected by pipette and used as cell lysates.Protein Assay, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting—Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar).

After treatment with 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody for 1 day at 4 °C. After a wash with T-TBS, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h. After another wash with T-TBS, the ECL reaction was performed for 5 min as recommended by the manufacturer, and chemiluminescent signals were visualized with an ECL™ mini-camera (Amersham Biosciences).Immunocytochemistry and Fluorescence Microscopy—Transfected cells were cultured on cover glass and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After rinsing with PBS and 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, cells were permeabilized, if necessary, by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After treatment with blocking buffer (5% skim milk in PBS) for 15 min, the samples were incubated with primary antibody (diluted 1:1000 with blocking buffer) at 4 °C for 1 day followed by Cy3-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Immunostained samples were examined with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Digital Eclipse C1, Nikon, Japan).Generation of Polyclonal Antibodies against Pseudomonas Neutral CDase—The rabbit antiserum against the Pseudomonas neutral CDase was raised against a full-length CDase (residues 1–646, Ref. 6Okino N.

To obtain the recombinant CDase, 1 ml of overnight culture was inoculated into 200 ml of LB in the presence of 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and incubated at 25 °C. After a 20-h incubation, isopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5 mm ABSF. The insoluble fraction (inclusion bodies) was precipitated by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min), lysed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Gelcode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce). The CDase band was cut out and subjected to electroelution. The protein obtained was used for immunization.Expression of Pseudomonas Neutral CDase and the Mutants—E. coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS cells transformed with a plasmid vector containing Pseudomonas neutral CDase and the mutant DNA were grown at 25 °C for 16 h in 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 35 μg/ml of chloramphenicol with shaking. Then, isopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to trigger transcription. After an additional 1 h culture at 25 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3.3 μg/ml of the proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin), and sonicated. After sonication, the solution was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant obtained was used as the crude enzyme solution.RESULTSAlignment and Truncation of COOH-terminal Region of Neutral CDases—Although the primary structure of neutral CDase is highly conserved from bacteria to humans, the enzyme is classified into two prototypes; bacteria/invertebrate and mammalian types. The latter possesses a Ser/Thr-rich mucin-like domain (mucin box) downstream of the NH2-terminal signal/anchor sequence while the former does not (Fig. 1A). The mucin box was shown to retain the enzyme on the plasma membranes as a type II integral membrane protein. Thus mucin box-deleted mutant enzymes and bacteria/invertebrate enzymes were found to be secreted into the culture medium (7Yoshimura Y. Okino N. Tani M. Ito M. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol.

In this study, we found that two amino acid residues, Phe and Ile/Val, in the COOH-terminal tail were completely conserved in both two types of the enzyme (Fig. 1A). To address the role of the conserved COOH-terminal tail, COOH-terminal-truncated mutant enzymes lacking 11, 6, 5, 4, and 3 amino acid residues from the COOH terminus, respectively, were constructed and expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B, Δ11, Δ6, Δ5, Δ4, Δ3). Wild-type and truncated enzymes were tagged with FLAG at the NH2 terminus. As shown in Fig. 2A, all truncated CDases except Δ3 lost the enzyme activity as measured in terms of the hydrolysis (a) and synthesis (b) of Cer. The enzyme activity of wild-type and Δ3 CDases was found in cell lysates as well as the medium (Fig. 2B). Western blotting analysis of the cell lysate using anti-FLAG antibody revealed that the wild-type and Δ3 CDases showed two protein bands having a molecular mass of 133 kDa and 113 kDa (Fig. 2B). The 133-kDa protein seems to be a mature form in the Golgi and the 113-kDa protein, developing form in the ER (9Mitsutake S. Tani M. Okino N. Mori K. Ichinose S. Omori A. Iida H. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26249-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A 130-kDa mature form was also detected in the culture medium of wild-type and Δ3 CDases when stained with anti-neutral CDase antibody (Fig. 2B). This secretory CDase is likely to be generated by processing of the NH2-terminal signal/anchor sequence from the mature form (14Tani M. Iida H. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10523-10530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, no mature forms were detected in the cell lysate or medium of Δ11, Δ6, Δ5, and Δ4 enzymes. These results suggest that the truncated CDases except Δ3 were not transported from the ER to the Golgi and lost enzyme activity.Fig. 2Expression of wild-type and COOH-terminal-truncated rat neutral CDases in HEK293 cells.

As shown in Fig. 3A, wild-type and Δ3 CDases were located at plasma membranes while Δ11, Δ6, Δ5, and Δ4 enzymes were likely to be retained in the ER and not be transported to the plasma membrane. Since human neutral CDase was reported to localize in mitochondria (10El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we examined whether wild-type and truncated enzymes from rat were expressed in mitochondria. In this experiment, GFP with a mitochondria-targeting signal (mitochondria-GFP) was used as a marker for mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 3B, wild-type, Δ4, and Δ3 CDases were not co-localized with GFP-mitochondria, indicating that the rat enzymes are not transported to mitochondria under the conditions used in this study. In conclusion, the removal of more than three amino acid residues from the COOH terminus of rat neutral CDase resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity and correct subcellular localization. The truncated enzymes lacking 232, 89, 56, and 23 amino acid residues from the COOH terminus showed no enzyme activity either (data not shown).Fig. 3Subcellular localization of wild-type and COOH-terminal-truncated rat neutral CDases. A, HEK293 cells overexpressing the CDases were fixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and then stained with anti-FLAG antibody followed by anti-mouse IgG-Cy3. The arrows indicate the expression of CDase at the plasma membrane. B, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid vector containing CDase and that containing pCMV/Myc/mitochondria (Invitrogen) as a mitochondrial marker. Cells were fixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and stained with anti-FLAG antibody followed by anti-mouse IgG-Cy3. Left and center panels show the expression of CDase and mitochondria-GFP. Merged images are shown in the right panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects of Point Mutation of the Conserved Amino Acids in the COOH-terminal Tail on Enzyme Activity and Intracellular Localization—The truncated enzyme Δ3 retained the activity whereas Δ4 did not. Therefore, Ile758 of the rat enzyme, the 4th amino acid residue from the COOH terminus, is likely to be integral to the enzyme activity and correct subcellular localization (Fig. 1A). In addition to Ile758, Phe756 is also conserved in all enzymes (Fig. 1A). Thus, we examined the effects of point mutations of Ile758 and Phe756 on enzyme activity and subcellular localization. All mutant and wild-type enzymes were tagged with Myc at the COOH terminus and expressed in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, replacement of Ile758 with Asp or Arg almost completely abolished the enzyme activity. On the other hand, no decrease in enzyme activity was observed when Ile758 was replaced with Val, which is conserved in all neutral CDases except the rat enzyme. Replacement of Ile758 with Phe decreased the enzyme activity to 20% in comparison with wild-type CDase. Western blotting analysis using anti-Myc antibody detected the 113-kDa ER form, but not the 133-kDa mature form, in the cell lysates when I758D and I758R mutants were overexpressed in HEK293 cells. No enzyme activity or protein band of I758D and I758R was found in the medium. Similarly, F756D and F756R, but not F756I, showed no enzyme activity in cell lysates and culture medium. Correspondingly, the 133-kDa and 130-kDa mature forms were not found in the cell lysate and culture medium, respectively. The replacement of Phe756 with Ile had little effect. Next, the cell surface distribution of the enzyme was examined with (permeable condition) or without (unpermeable condition) Triton X-100 treatment. Mutants I758D, I758R, F756D, and F756R, all of which lost enzyme activity completely, were not stained with anti-Myc antibody under unpermeable conditions, indicating they were not expressed on the surface of cells (Fig. 4B, lower panels). However, under permeable conditions these mutant CDases were detected in the ER at almost the same level as the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4B, upper panels). The cell surface expression of the mutants I758F and F756I is somewhat lower than that of the wild-type and I758V enzymes. This result is well consistent with the enzyme activity levels. No reduction in enzyme activity or cell-surface expression was observed when Glu757, a non-conserved amino acid, was replaced with Arg (control experiment). In summary, these results clearly indicate that the conserved amino acid residues in the COOH-terminal tail, Ile758 and Phe756, are integral to the activity and correct subcellular localization of the enzyme. It is noteworthy that Ile758 or Phe756 can be changed with another hydrophobic, but not a charged, amino acid without a marked loss of enzyme activity.Fig. 4The enzyme activity, expression, and intracellular localization of wild-type and point-mutated rat neutral CDases in HEK293 cells. A, enzyme activity and expression of the CDase in HEK293 cells. Cells were transfected with a plasmid vector containing wild-type or point-mutated CDase cDNA. The cell lysates and the culture supernatants were used to measure the neutral CDase activity with C12-NBD-Cer as a substrate, and the protein expression was determined by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody. B, intracellular localization of the CDase. Cells transfected with a plasmid vector containing wild-type or point-mutated CDase cDNA were fixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100 (+) or not (–), and stained with anti-Myc antibody.View Large Image"
