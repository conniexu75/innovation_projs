https://openalex.org/W2040014098,"Biofilms are surface-attached microbial communities with characteristic architecture and phenotypic and biochemical properties distinct from their free-swimming, planktonic counterparts. One of the best-known of these biofilm-specific properties is the development of antibiotic resistance that can be up to 1,000-fold greater than planktonic cells. We report a genetic determinant of this high-level resistance in the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have identified a mutant of P. aeruginosa that, while still capable of forming biofilms with the characteristic P. aeruginosa architecture, does not develop high-level biofilm-specific resistance to three different classes of antibiotics. The locus identified in our screen, ndvB, is required for the synthesis of periplasmic glucans. Our discovery that these periplasmic glucans interact physically with tobramycin suggests that these glucose polymers may prevent antibiotics from reaching their sites of action by sequestering these antimicrobial agents in the periplasm. Our results indicate that biofilms themselves are not simply a diffusion barrier to these antibiotics, but rather that bacteria within these microbial communities employ distinct mechanisms to resist the action of antimicrobial agents."

https://openalex.org/W1982390307,"The promise of tremendous computational power, coupled with the development of robust error-correcting schemes, has fuelled extensive efforts to build a quantum computer. The requirements for realizing such a device are confounding: scalable quantum bits (two-level quantum systems, or qubits) that can be well isolated from the environment, but also initialized, measured and made to undergo controllable interactions to implement a universal set of quantum logic gates. The usual set consists of single qubit rotations and a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, which flips the state of a target qubit conditional on the control qubit being in the state 1. Here we report an unambiguous experimental demonstration and comprehensive characterization of quantum CNOT operation in an optical system. We produce all four entangled Bell states as a function of only the input qubits' logical values, for a single operating condition of the gate. The gate is probabilistic (the qubits are destroyed upon failure), but with the addition of linear optical quantum non-demolition measurements, it is equivalent to the CNOT gate required for scalable all-optical quantum computation."
https://openalex.org/W1985381446,"Compartments1 in food webs are subgroups of taxa in which many strong interactions occur within the subgroups and few weak interactions occur between the subgroups2. Theoretically, compartments increase the stability in networks1,2,3,4,5, such as food webs. Compartments have been difficult to detect in empirical food webs because of incompatible approaches6,7,8,9 or insufficient methodological rigour8,10,11. Here we show that a method for detecting compartments from the social networking science12,13,14 identified significant compartments in three of five complex, empirical food webs. Detection of compartments was influenced by food web resolution, such as interactions with weights. Because the method identifies compartmental boundaries in which interactions are concentrated, it is compatible with the definition of compartments. The method is rigorous because it maximizes an explicit function, identifies the number of non-overlapping compartments, assigns membership to compartments, and tests the statistical significance of the results12,13,14. A graphical presentation14 reveals systemic relationships and taxa-specific positions as structured by compartments. From this graphic, we explore two scenarios of disturbance to develop a hypothesis for testing how compartmentalized interactions increase stability in food webs15,16,17."

https://openalex.org/W2060111610,"Grafting of Schwann cell-seeded channels into hemisected adult rat thoracic spinal cords has been tested as a strategy to bridge the injured cord. Despite success in guiding axonal growth into the graft, regeneration across the distal graft-host interface into the host spinal cord was limited. We hypothesized that chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycoforms deposited at the gliotic front of the interface constitute a molecular barrier to axonal growth into the host cord. Because CS glycoforms deposited by purified astrocytes in vitro were removable by digestion with chondroitinase ABC, we attempted to achieve likewise by infusion of the enzyme to the host side of the interface. By 1 month post-treatment, significant numbers of regenerating axons crossed an interface that was subdued in macrophage/microglia reaction and decreased in CS-immunopositivity. The axons extended as far into the caudal cord as 5 mm, in contrast to nil in vehicle-infused controls. Fascicular organizations of axon-Schwann cell units within the regenerated tissue cable were better-preserved in enzyme-treated cords than in vehicle-infused controls. We conclude that CS glycoforms deposited during gliosis at the distal graft-host interface could be cleared by the in vivo action of chondroitinase ABC to improve prospects of axonal regeneration into the host spinal cord."

https://openalex.org/W2120780444,"The capacity of the flavan-3-ols [(-)-epicatechin (EC) and (+)-catechin (CT)] and a B dimeric procyanidin (DP-B) to modulate phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced NF-kappaB activation in Jurkat T cells was investigated. The classic PMA-triggered increase in cell oxidants was prevented when cells were preincubated for 24 h with EC, CT, or DP-B (1.7-17.2 microM). PMA induced the phosphorylation of IKKbeta and the subsequent degradation of IkappaBalpha. These events were inhibited in cells pretreated with the flavonoids. PMA induced a 4.6-fold increase in NF-kappaB nuclear binding activity in control cells. Pretreatment with EC, CT, or DP-B decreased PMA-induced NF-kappaB binding activity and the transactivation of the NF-kappaB-driven gene IL-2. EC, CT, and DP-B inhibited, in vitro, NF-kappaB binding to its DNA consensus sequence, but they had no effect on the binding activity of CREB or OCT-1. Thus, EC, CT, or DP-B can influence the immune response by modulating NF-kappaB activation. This modulation can occur at early (regulation of oxidant levels, IKK activation) as well as late (binding of NF-kappaB to DNA) stages of the NF-kappaB activation cascade. A model is presented for possible interactions between DP-B and NF-kappaB proteins, which could lead to the inhibition of NF-kappaB binding to kappaB sites."

https://openalex.org/W2073916749,"The extinction of the dodo (Raphus cucullatus L.; Fig. 1) is commonly dated to the last confirmed sighting in 1662, reported by Volkert Evertsz on an islet off Mauritius. By this time, the dodo had become extremely rare - the previous sighting having been 24 years earlier - but the species probably persisted unseen beyond this date. Here we use a statistical method to establish the actual extinction time of the dodo as 1690, almost 30 years after its most recent sighting."
https://openalex.org/W1991470747,"We investigated cell death during glucose deprivation in rat cardiomyocyte-derived H9c2 cells. Electron microscopic analysis revealed accumulation of autophagic vacuoles during glucose deprivation. The addition of 3-methyladenine or LY294002, which are known to inhibit autophagosome formation, reduced cell death while Z-VAD-FMK, a caspase inhibitor, slightly affected cell death. Thus, cell death during glucose deprivation is not type I programmed cell death (apoptotic cell death) but type II programmed cell death (autophagic cell death). Moreover, we found that both insulin-like growth factor-I and the adenovirus-mediated overexpression of wild-type class I PI 3-kinase accelerated cell death as well as accumulation of autophagic vacuoles during glucose deprivation while dominant-negative PI 3-kinase reduced these phenomena. The results indicate that IGF-I/PI 3-kinase accelerates the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and subsequent autophagic cell death during glucose deprivation, revealing the opposing role of IGF-I/PI 3-kinase in two distinct types of programmed cell death (apoptotic and autophagic cell death)."
https://openalex.org/W2104310404,"E-selectin mediated cell-cell adhesion plays an important role in inflammatory processes and extravasation of tumor cells. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induces E-selectin gene and protein expression in primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC) and in an endothelial cell line (EA.hy-926). As shown by ELISA and FACS analyses, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., lovastatin) impair the TNF-alpha stimulated increase in E-selectin protein expression. Similar results were obtained for E-selectin mRNA expression and promoter activity, indicating that the effect of lovastatin is based on inhibition of gene expression. The effective inhibitory concentration of lovastatin was in a physiologically relevant range (IC50<0.1 microM). Lovastatin-mediated block of TNF-alpha induced E-selectin expression is due to inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation rather than farnesylation. Down-regulation of Rho signaling by coexpression of dominant-negative Rho mutants (i.e RhoA, RhoB and Rac) impaired TNF-alpha driven E-selectin gene expression, indicating Rho signaling to be essential for transcriptional activation of the E-selectin gene. Inhibition of E-selectin expression by lovastatin gives rise to a significant reduction in TNF-alpha stimulated adhesion of colon carcinoma cells to HUVEC. Furthermore, low concentration of lovastatin (i.e., < or =1 microM) attenuated TNF-alpha induced tumor cell invasion in vitro. The data support the view that statins might be clinically useful in protection against E-selectin mediated metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2089863639,"The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates apoptosis chiefly by controlling mitochondrial membrane permeability. It has previously been shown that the BH4 domain of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL is essential for the prevention of apoptotic mitochondrial changes, including the release of cytochrome c and apoptotic cell death. We have previously reported that BH4 peptide fused to the protein transduction domain of HIV-1 TAT protein (TAT-BH4) significantly inhibits etoposide-induced apoptosis in a cell line. This time, we investigated whether TAT-BH4 peptide was cytoprotective in ex vivo and in vivo rodent models. Intraperitoneal injection of TAT-BH4 peptide greatly inhibited X-ray-induced apoptosis in the small intestine of mice and partially suppressed Fas-induced fulminant hepatitis. In addition, this peptide markedly suppressed heart failure after ischemia–reperfusion injury in isolated rat heart, probably by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings demonstrate that TAT-BH4 peptide exerts anti-apoptotic activity both in vivo and ex vivo, and imply that it may be a useful therapeutic agent for diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W1967405376,"Overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also called scatter factor (SF), and its receptor c-Met are associated with poor prognosis for cancer patients. In particular, breast cancer cells can produce HGF that acts in a paracrine as well as in an autocrine manner. Therefore, HGF and c-Met are putative targets for cancer therapy. To explore HGF/c-Met signaling in breast cancer, we have generated transgenic mice expressing HGF specifically in mammary epithelium under the transcriptional control of the whey acidic protein (WAP) gene promoter. WAP-HGF transgenic females developed hyperplastic ductal trees and multifocal invasive tumors after several pregnancies, some of which progressed to lung metastases. Tumors produced HGF and displayed phosphorylated c-Met, which correlated with increased Akt as well as c-myc activation. A high growth rate, as demonstrated by Ki67 nuclear antigen staining, and a lack of progesterone receptor were characteristic of the tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed areas of osteopontin (Opn) expression in WAP-HGF tumors and lung metastases in agreement with a previously reported role for Opn in invasive growth. We suggest that these mice may serve as a new breast cancer model for the evaluation of the effects of unscheduled HGF expression in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2039172739,"Immunoglobulin G (IgG) binds specific antigens, and IgG-antigen complexes primarily activate immune cells and the complement system. These immune reactions are known to affect neural functions through the production and release of mediators such as cytokines. The high affinity IgG receptor FcgammaRI, but not the low affinity receptors FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII, was expressed on the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, especially small- or medium-sized neurons. IgG bound to DRG neurons and made a complex with antigen there. Ragweed pollen bound to nerve fibers in the skin of sensitized mouse in situ. The formation of IgG-ragweed pollen complex increased the concentration of Ca2+ ions in the DRG neurons. This increase was inhibited by a Ca2+ chelator, L- and N-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers, and anti-FcgammaRI antibody. IgG-antigen complex released substance P from DRG neurons, which was inhibited by L- and N-type Ca2+ channel blockers. Thus, IgG and antigen combine on primary sensory neurons to directly activate them, which may be a novel type of immune-neuron linkage."
https://openalex.org/W2105828029,"An enhanced activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha-receptor (PDGF-Ralpha) or the PDGF beta-receptor (PDGF-Rbeta), is involved in the development of proliferative diseases. We have previously demonstrated that green tea catechins containing a galloyl group in the third position of the catechin structure interfere with PDGF-BB-induced mitogenic signaling pathways by inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF-Rbeta. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are unknown. Using human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and porcine endothelial cells (AEC) stably transfected with PDGF-Ralpha and -beta, respectively, we demonstrate that EGCG preferably inhibited PDGF-BB isoform-mediated signal transduction pathways and cell proliferation. To elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms of the inhibitory effects of EGCG, we studied the distribution of incorporated EGCG into cellular compartments after subcellular fractionation. Interestingly, most (85%) of the EGCG was found in the cytoplasmic fraction, whereas only ~2% was found within the cell plasma membranes. However, no alteration of membrane fluidity has been observed after treatment of VSMC with 50 microM EGCG. Binding studies with [125I]-PDGF-BB on EGCG-treated VSMC demonstrated that the specific binding of PDGF-BB was completely abolished. Moreover, when [125I]-PDGF-BB was incubated with VSMC in the presence of EGCG, a 50% reduction of cellular [125I]-PDGF-BB binding was observed. Our findings suggest that plasma membrane incorporated EGCG or soluble EGCG directly interacts with PDGF-BB, thereby preventing specific receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2126159176,"Screening systems for ecdysteroid mimetic or antiecdysteroid substances in plant extracts or libraries of synthetic compounds are commonly based on the observation of morphological and/or growth responses in insect cell lines. Because these responses are slow and require careful monitoring, existing screening systems are considered limited regarding their applicability to analysis in high-throughput (HT) formats. Here we describe the generation of transformed silkmoth (Bombyx mori) cell lines that respond to the addition of ecdysone-like substances through the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the appearance of green fluorescence. Because tests consist of three simple steps, i.e., 1) distribution of transformed cells in microtiter plates; 2) addition of compounds/extracts at different concentrations; and 3) quantification of fluorescence intensity by a fluorescence plate reader, they can be performed quickly and be easily adapted to a HT format. The generated reporter cell lines are used for the screening of extracts from available plant collections for the presence of compounds with ecdysone mimetic or antagonistic activities as well as for monitoring subsequent activity during enrichment and purification steps. The same cell lines are also used here for the determination of structure-activity relationships among available synthetic dibenzoylhydrazine derivatives. Finally, for the identified agonists, we show that their activity as determined by the cell-based screening assays parallels their bioactivity in growth inhibition and toxicity assays carried out on live insects."
https://openalex.org/W2120331429,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) exert via glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Emerging evidence indicates that an inflammatory process is involved in dopaminergic nigro-striatal neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease. We here report that the GR deficiency of transgenic (Tg) mice expressing GR antisense RNA from early embryonic life has a dramatic impact in ""programming"" the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The GR deficiency of Tg mice exacerbates MPTP-induced toxicity to dopaminergic neurons, as revealed by both severe loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive nigral neurons and sharp decreases in striatal levels of dopamine and its metabolites. In addition, the late increase in dopamine oxidative metabolism and ascorbic acid oxidative status in GR-deficient mice was far greater than in wild-type (Wt) mice. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was sharply increased in activated astrocytes, macrophages/microglia of GR-deficient as compared with Wt mice. Moreover, GR-deficient microglia produced three- to fourfold higher nitrite levels than Wt mice; these increases preceded the loss of dopaminergic function and were resistant to GR the inhibitory effect of GC, pointing to peroxynitrites as candidate neurotoxic effectors. The iNOS inhibitor N6-(1-iminoethyl)-L-lysine normalized vulnerability of Tg mice, thus establishing a novel link between genetic impairment of GR function and vulnerability to MPTP."
https://openalex.org/W2037407888,"Adenosine deaminase (ADA) can localize to the cell surface through its interaction with CD26. Using CD26-transfected cells, we demonstrate that cell surface ADA (ecto-ADA) can regulate adenosine receptor engagement by degrading extracellular adenosine (Ado) to inosine. This ability was dependent upon CD26 expression, the extent of CD26 saturation with ecto-ADA, and the kinetics of the cAMP response. Thus, the cAMP response was markedly decreased when CD26-transfected cells were incubated with an exogenous source of ADA to increase ecto-ADA expression. The ability of ecto-ADA to inhibit the cAMP response was demonstrated by treatment with the specific ADA inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin. This inhibited the ability of ecto-ADA to degrade Ado and increased the cAMP response. Although CD26 expression on human thymocytes was low compared with that of CD26-transfected cells, it was saturated with ecto-ADA. When thymocytes incubated at high densities (to mimic the situation in tissues) were exposed to exogenous adenosine, the cAMP response was dramatically decreased by ecto-ADA. We conclude that ecto-ADA has the potential to regulate adenosine receptor-mediated cAMP responses in vivo in tissues with CD26+ cells and sufficient cell death caused by apoptosis or inflammation to provide a source of ADA to bind to CD26."
https://openalex.org/W2074213205,"Aberrant overexpression of the c-rel protooncogene is associated with lymphoid malignancy, while c-rel deletion produces severe lymphoproliferative defects and immunodeficiency. To investigate the mechanism of c-rel-induced proliferation and cell cycle progression in B lymphocytes, we have compared signaling events elicited through the BCR in c-rel-/- and wild-type B cells. BCR stimulation of c-rel-/- B cells fails to induce proper cyclin expression, resulting in G1 phase arrest, but it is unclear whether these defects are in fact secondary events of decreased B-cell survival, since c-rel deletion also affects the expression of antiapoptotic genes such as bcl-xL. Here, we use the bcl-xL transgene to correct the viability of c-rel-deficient B cells, and show that the inhibition of apoptosis does not necessarily confer hyperproliferation of B cells activated through the BCR. c-rel-/- B cells still fail to enter the S phase despite improved survival by bcl-xL overexpression, suggesting that c-Rel-associated cell cycle progression is dependent on more than just enhanced cell viability. Overexpression of cyclin E protein, however, can cooperate with Bcl-xL to restore cell cycle progression to c-rel-/- B cells via induction of the cyclin-CDK/Rb-E2F pathway. Furthermore, we show that c-Rel can directly regulate transcription of the e2f3a promoter/enhancer, which is then likely to lead to transcriptional activation of the cyclin E promoter by E2F3a. Hence, these studies provide clear evidence that control of lymphocyte proliferation via c-Rel is linked to a cyclin-dependent process, and suggest that c-Rel not only activates antiapoptotic signaling but also the induction of cell cycle progression."

https://openalex.org/W1971498878,"The Gal/GalNAc lectin (Gal-lectin) of Entamoeba histolytica is a surface molecule involved in parasite adherence to host cells and is the most promising subunit vaccine candidate against amoebiasis. As macrophages are the major effector cells in host defense against amoebas, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which Gal-lectin activates macrophage. Microarray analysis showed that Gal-lectin up-regulated mRNAs of several cytokines and receptor genes involved in proinflammatory responses. The mechanism whereby the Gal-lectin regulates Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) expression in macrophages was studied. Native Gal-lectin increased TLR-2 mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent fashion; peak response occurred with 1 microg/ml after 2 h stimulation. By immunoflourescence, enhanced surface expression of TLR-2 was observed after 12 h. With the use of nonoverlapping anti-Gal-lectin monoclonal antibodies that map to the carbohydrate recognition domain, amino acid 596-1082 was identified as the TLR-2 stimulating region. The Gal-lectin increased TLR-2 gene transcription, and the half-life of the mRNA transcripts was 1.4 h. Inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB suppressed TLR-2 mRNA induction by the Gal-lectin. Moreover, cells pretreated with an inhibitor of p38 kinase (SB 208530) inhibited Gal-lectin induced TLR-2 mRNA expression by 40%. We conclude that the Gal-lectin activates NF-kappaB and MAP kinase-signaling pathways in macrophages culminating in the induction of several genes including TLR-2 and hypothesize that this could have a significant impact on macrophage activation and contribute to amoebic pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2110703406,"Hearing impairment, which is the most prevalent sensory deficit of human beings, needs a breakthrough in therapeutic technologies. One technology is the usage of a vector system to reach the inner ear, and another is by a therapeutic molecule. Here we developed a novel gene therapy strategy by combining hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) with hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E) vector. When HVJ-E containing human HGF gene was injected intrathecally into the cerebrospinal fluid via cisterna magna of rats, the vector reached the inner ear region, and human HGF gene expression was detected in the spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) of the inner ear. Expression of endogenous rat HGF and its receptor, c-Met, was also induced in SGCs by human HGF. Kanamycin treatment results in hearing impairment by inducing degeneration of hair cells (HCs) and apoptosis of SGCs in rats. By HGF gene transfer before kanamycin treatment, both loss of HCs and apoptosis of SGCs were prevented. Furthermore, hearing function, evaluated by auditory brainstem response, was maintained at a normal level. When HGF gene transfer was performed 2 wk after kanamycin treatment, hearing impairment was significantly recovered. These results indicate a novel and effective therapeutic strategy against sensorineural hearing impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2127999710,"MLL gene fusions are the hallmark of more than 70% of therapy-related leukemias (t-ML) associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors (e.g., etoposide) and cause leukemia in murine transgenic models. To determine whether Mll genomic fusions can occur after exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors, we developed a long-distance inverse PCR DNA-based assay for chimeric Mll fusions in mouse embryonic stem cells. We detected Mll fusions at a higher frequency following 100 µM etoposide for 8 h (16×10‒6 cell−1) than in no-drug controls (1.0×10‒6 cell−1, P=0.0002) or after treatment with a comparably cytotoxic exposure to the antimicrotubule drug vincristine (1.0×10‒6 cell-1, P=0.0047). The fusion points in Mll chimeric products induced by etoposide were localized to a 1.5 kb region between exons 9 and 11, analogous to the MLL breakpoint cluster region in human leukemia. All 49 Mll fusion partners analyzed matched known genomic murine sequences, with 40 (82%) matching annotated genes covering eighteen murine autosomes. One partner was Runxl, the murine homologue of the transcription factor AML-l, a target of human translocations in therapy-related leukemia. These findings indicate that etoposide triggers the formation of Mll gene fusions, a critical step for the development of treatment-induced leukemic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2145068950,"The protein-based changes that underlie the cell biology of apoptosis have been extensively studied. In contrast, mRNA- and polysaccharide-based changes have received relatively little attention. We have combined transcriptome and glycome analyses to show that apoptotic endothelial cell cultures undergo programmed changes to RNA transcript abundance and cell surface polysaccharide profiles. Although a few of the transcriptome changes were protective, most appeared to prepare cells for apoptosis by decreasing the reception and transduction of pro-survival signals, increasing pro-death signals, increasing abundance of apoptotic machinery, inhibiting cellular proliferation, recruiting phagocytes to regions of cell death, and promoting phagocytosis. Additional transcriptomal changes appeared to alter the synthesis and modification of cell surface glycosaminoglycans. The resultant reduced abundance of sulphated cell surface glycosaminoglycans may further promote cell death by inhibiting the presentation of extracellular matrix-tethered survival factors to their receptors on dying cells. We propose that the transcriptome and glycome regulation presented here synergize with previously described protein-based changes to guide the apoptotic program."
https://openalex.org/W1975522565,"c-Fos is a multifunctional transcription factor that is involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. c-Fos is rapidly induced by a variety of hormones, growth factors and other extracellular stimuli, resulting in cell-specific responses. One potential mechanism underlying the cell-specific effects of c-Fos may be its ability to regulate gene expression through interaction with tissue-restricted transcription factors. We report here that c-Fos interacts with the cell-specific GATA proteins to potentiate their ability to transactivate target promoters, via GATA-binding sites. c-Fos is recruited to GATA proteins through direct interaction with their N-terminal activation domain. Neither the leucine zipper nor the DNA-binding domain of c-Fos is required for physical interaction with GATA proteins. Instead, a C-terminal domain located between amino acids 235 and 296, which is conserved in FosB but not in the nontransforming Fos family members, FosB/SF or Fra-1, is essential for c-Fos-GATA interaction. These data suggest that c-Fos may act as an inducible cofactor for cell-specific transcription factors and unravel a novel mechanism for transcriptional regulation by c-Fos, independent of the well-studied AP-1 pathway. The results also raise the possibility that dysregulated interaction with cell-specific transcription factors may be an important component in cellular transformation by nuclear oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W2124588770,"Previously we demonstrated that genetic deficiency of the cyclooxygenases (COX-1 or COX-2) altered keratinocyte differentiation in mouse skin [Tiano et. al. (2002) Cancer Res. 62, 3395-3401]. In this study, we show that topical application of SC-560 (a COX-1 selective inhibitor) or celecoxib (COX-2 selective) to TPA-treated wild-type skin caused fivefold increases in the number of basal keratinocytes expressing the early differentiation marker keratin 1 (K1). In contrast to skin, COX-2 not COX-1 was the major isoform expressed in cultured primary keratinocytes. COX-1 was predominantly expressed in detached, differentiated cells, whereas COX-2 was found in the attached, proliferating cells. High Ca++ medium induced K1 and COX-1 in wild-type keratinocytes but did not change COX-2 expression. As observed in skin, COX-1-/- and COX-2-/- primary keratinocytes expressed fivefold more K1 than wild-type cells. K1 levels in cultured wild-type keratinocytes were also increased by treatment with celecoxib and indomethacin. However, unlike its in vivo effect, SC-560, possibly due to low COX-1 expression in cultured mouse keratinocytes, did not increase K1 levels. Furthermore, no increases in apoptotic cell numbers were observed in COX-deficient keratinocytes or COX-inhibitor treated wild-type cells. Thus, a major effect of COX inhibitors and COX-deficiency is the induction of keratinocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1999828494,"MAGI-1 and CASK are membrane-associated guanylate kinases of epithelial junctions. MAGI-1 is localized at tight junctions in polarized epithelial cells, whereas CASK is localized along the lateral membranes. We obtained the KIAA0769 gene product through the yeast two-hybrid screening using MAGI-1 as a bait and named it Carom. Carom has a coiled-coil domain in the middle region, and two src homology 3 domains and a PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding motif in the C-terminal region. Carom binds to the fifth PDZ domain of MAGI-1 and the calmodulin kinase domain of CASK in vitro. MAGI-1 and CASK bind to the distinct sequences in the C-terminal region of Carom, but still compete with each other for Carom binding. The study using a stable transformant of Madine Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing GFP-Carom revealed that Carom was partially overlapped by MAGI-1 in MDCK cells, which have not yet established mature cell junctions, but became separated from MAGI-1 and colocalized with CASK in polarized cells. Carom was highly resistant to Triton X-100 extractions and recruited CASK to the Triton X-100-insoluble structures. Carom is a binding partner of CASK, which interacts with CASK in polarized epithelial cells and may link it to the cytoskeleton."
