https://openalex.org/W2020197554,"The forest of a small watershed-ecosystem was cut in order to determine the effects of removal of vegetation on nutrient cycles. Relative to undisturbed ecosystems, the cut ecosystem exhibited accelerated loss of nutrients: nitrogen lost during the first year after cutting was equivalent to the amount annually turned over in an undisturbed system, and losses of cations were 3 to 20 times greater than from comparable undisturbed systems. Possible causes of the pattern of nutrient loss from the cut ecosystem are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2121174626,"A 7100-year tree-ring chronology has been developed for bristlecone pine, Pinus aristata Engelm., in the White Mountains of east-central California by the addition of data from long-dead specimens to the 4600-year record from living trees. These dendrochronological studies have major applications to climatic interpretations, radiocarbon analysis, and the dating of past events. The great age of these trees and the esthetic appeal of both the trees and their environment are drawing increasing numbers of visitors to the bristlecone pine areas. Concern is expressed for the preservation of this ancient wood."

During at least the last several million years, and perhaps during much of the Cenozoic, the trench has not been affected by an oceanic crust thrusting under the continent."
https://openalex.org/W1973163208,"Frequency-wave number spectra of microseisms were obtained by use of a set of short-period and long-period seismometers at LASA (Large Aperture Seismic Array, Montana). At times of relatively high microseismic activity short-period (shorter than 5 seconds) microseisms consist of both body waves and higher-mode surface waves. From the phase velocity and direction of body waves, source areas were determined, coinciding with low-pressure regions on the weather map. At longer periods, microseisms consist of fundamental-mode Rayleigh and Love waves, the former being dominant. Most microseismic energy arrives at LASA from the northeast and the west."

https://openalex.org/W2117932014,"Dialyzed homogenates prepared from Escherichia coli, Tetrahymena pyriformis, sea anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), and mouse liver were tested for ability to transaminate 17 aminoalkylphosphonic acids with alpha-ketoglutarate. 2-Aminoethylphosphonic acid (2-AEP), which occurs naturally in Tetrahymena and anemone, was transaminated by these latter organisms more than any of the substances tested, but not by preparations from liver or E. coli. 3-Aminopropylphosphonic acid was transaminated by all preparations, but much less by Tetrahymena or anemone than was 2-AEP. 2-Amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid was transaminated by all preparations. 2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid was transaminated by three of the preparations, but not by liver. Of the other 13 substances tested, the following gave positive results: DL-1,2-diaminoethylphosphonic acid with E. coli, DL-1,2-diaminoethylphosphonic and aminomethylphosphonic acids with Tetrahymena, DL-1-aminopropylphosphonic acid with anemone, and DL-1-aminoethylphosphonic and DL-1-aminobutylphosphonic acids with liver. The significance of these transaminations is discussed."

The method is simple and rapid and can be used to date flows that erupted between 200 and approximately 200,000 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2083741130,"Palinspastic restoration of sinistral wrench faults in Britain and of dextral wrenches in Canada, starting with the palinspastic pre-continental-drift map, implies the possibility of as much as 424 kilometers of rifting between Newfoundland and Ireland. The wrench-faulting and postulated resultant rifting are of Devonian and Carboniferous age."

https://openalex.org/W3196579896,"The following editorial by C. B. Larrabee in the periodical Printers' Ink for 22 October brings questions that have long troubled scientists to the attention of the general publishing and advertising fraternities. The use of scientific-sounding but scientifically meaningless or misleading language, distortions of scientific thought and experimental results, false analogies both direct and implied—in short, the misuse of science and scientific evidence—can be found in many fields. It is good to see concrete evidence that others are also concerned with the problem."
