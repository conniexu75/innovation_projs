https://openalex.org/W1589773292,"A sialogogic peptide has been isolated from bovine hypothalami by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, and high voltage paper electrophoresis. The purity of this peptide was established by showing that the molar ratios of the constituent amino acids remained constant after high voltage paper electrophoresis at pH 1.9, 3.5, and 6.5. Its molecular weight (estimated by gel filtration) and its amino acid composition show that the peptide is an undecapeptide composed of Lys1, Arg1, Glx2, Pro2, Gly1, Leu1, Met1, and Phe2. The NH2-terminal residue is arginine. Further biological testing showed that the sialogogic peptide isolated is indistinguishable from Substance P; i.e. it stimulates contraction of the guinea pig ileum and the rat duodenum and is a potent vasodepressor. These effects are not inhibited by prior treatment of the test preparation with atropine. This report is believed to present the first complete purification of Substance P."

https://openalex.org/W1537553863,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase has been obtained from rat liver in a form that is 85 to 95% pure. The enzyme exists as two electrophoretically distinguishable isozymes, each of which is capable of existing as a monomer (51,000 to 55,000 molecular weight), dimer (110,000), and tetramer (210,000). The dimers of each isozyme will dissociate to the monomeric forms by dilution of the enzyme or by increasing the temperature from 0 to 30°."
https://openalex.org/W1504606556,"Abstract The fatty acid synthetase complex of pigeon liver has been dissociated (greater than 95%) into half-molecular weight subunits by dialyzing against Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3, containing 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol or 1 mm dithiothreitol. The dissociated enzyme has very little activity for the synthesis of palmitic acid. However, it can be reassociated by dialysis against 0.2 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The reassociated enzyme has the same sedimentation coefficient and the same specific activity for fatty acid synthesis as the untreated complex. Comparisons have been made between the complex and the mixture of subunits for each of the partial reactions of fatty acid synthesis. Acetyl- and malonyl-CoA-pantetheine transacylase activities are, respectively, 30 and 50% lower in the dissociated enzyme than in the complex. The Km(app) values for the complex and the subunits are quite similar for the reduction of S-acetoacetyl-N-acetyl cysteamine, dehydration of β-hydroxybutyryl-N-acetyl cysteamine, and the deacylation of palmityl-CoA. The Vmax values for these three reactions are also either identical for both enzyme species or approximately 30% lower for the dissociated units. The Vmax/Km(app) value for the reduction of crotonyl-N-acetyl cysteamine by the subunits is at least 50% of the value obtained with undissociated enzyme. The most significant difference between the two enzyme species is the absence of the condensation-CO2 exchange reaction (between malonyl-CoA, caproyl-CoA (hexanoyl-CoA), coenzyme-A, and NaH14CO3) in the dissociated enzyme. The transfer of acetyl and malonyl groups (from their CoA esters) to the different sites on the complex and dissociated enzyme has also been compared. The covalent binding of acetyl groups to the cysteine-SH site, which is essential for the condensation reaction, is eliminated in the dissociated enzyme, whereas the extent of transfer to the hydroxyl and the 4'-phosphopantetheine-SH sites is either unchanged or is enhanced. The covalent binding of malonyl groups to the hydroxyl of the dissociated enzyme is unaffected, whereas transfer to the 4'-phosphopantetheine is appreciably reduced. The dissociation process does not appear to have drastically altered the spatial arrangement around the active site of all of the component enzymes except those associated with the transfer of the acetyl group to the cysteine-SH site, and possibly those involved in the condensation-CO2 exchange reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1539302371,"A protein has been found in partially purified preparations of sepiapterin reductase that stimulates highly purified rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase. The stimulation is dependent on the structure of the pterin cofactor used; a large stimulation is observed with the naturally occurring cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin, a slight one with 6-methyltetrahydropterin, and none with 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin. The extent of the stimulation is minimal at low and maximal at high hydroxylase concentrations. Kinetic data suggest that the stimulating protein influences a reversible association-dissociation of the hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1564775231,"Abstract The errors of the Michaelis-Menten equation and three other approximations have been examined in relation to the true rate equation in which the depletion of free substrate by binding to the enzyme is taken into account. The true velocities and errors are computed for various concentrations of the total enzyme and the total substrate. It has been shown that, when the concentrations of the total enzyme and the total substrate both lie within 10-fold of the Michaelis constant, the error of the Michaelis-Menten equation ranges from 0.08 to 900%, whereas that of the Cha-Cha approximation, v = VS/(K + S + E), ranges from 0.7 to 34.8%, and that of the asymptote of the true curve in the reciprocal plot, v = VS/(K + E + KS/(K + E)), ranges from less than 0.1 to 58.5%."
https://openalex.org/W1594635884,"Abstract The structure of dermatan sulfate-chondroitin sulfate copolymers, isolated from horse aorta, has been examined. It was found that a large proportion of the galactosaminoglycans of this tissue was obtained as a discrete polysaccharide fraction with an l-iduronic acid to d-glucuronic acid ratio of approximately 1:2. This finding together with infrared data indicated that the polymer contained approximately equimolar proportions of the three repeating disaccharide units glucuronosyl-N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate (A), iduronosyl-N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate (B), and glucuronosyl-N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate (C). Degradation of the polymer with chondroitinase-AC yielded, in addition to a large quantity of unsaturated disaccharides, a tetrasaccharide fraction corresponding to an AB sequence in the original polymer. Degradation with testicular hyaluronidase produced a tetrasaccharide of the sequence CA, in addition to higher oligosaccharides corresponding to sequences like ABA or ABC. By sequential degradation of the dermatan sulfate-chondroitin sulfate copolymer with testicular hyaluronidase, β-glucuronidase, and chondroitinase-AC, it was possible to obtain larger fragments containing the bulk of the B units of the polymer. A detailed examination of these fragments revealed that the majority of the B units were located in clusters, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the carbohydrate-protein link. Furthermore, A units were prevalent in positions adjacent to B units, whereas the C units occurred preferentially in the center of the glucuronic acid-containing sections of the chain."

https://openalex.org/W1534243707,"Abstract The nature of the interaction between dextran sulfate and low density human plasma lipoproteins of the Sf 0 to 10 class (LDL) was investigated by modifying LDL with succinic anhydride or acetic anhydride. In the absence of divalent metal ions, the formation of insoluble and soluble dextran sulfate-LDL complexes was prevented by the acylation of approximately 16% and 25%, respectively, of the LDL free amino groups. The decrease in the positive charges of the protein moiety was primarily responsible for the interference with the complex formation. An increase in the negative charges introduced by succinylation did not interfere as extensively as the reduction in positive charges. The presence of magnesium sulfate facilitated the conversion of succinylated and acetylated lipoproteins to insoluble complex. The amount of Mg++ required for the conversion progressively increased with increases in the extent of acylation. Although the succinylated LDL required more Mg++ than the acetylated LDL, the difference was relatively small until approximately 75% of the lipoprotein amino groups was modified. A steep increase in the magnesium requirement observed upon further increase in the extent of succinylation reflected an extensive increase in negative charges due to succinylation of LDL free hydroxyl groups. The evaluation of the requirement for Mg++ by acetylated and succinylated LDL revealed the involvement of both LDL positive and negative charges in the formation of insoluble complex in the presence of divalent metal ions. Although the treatment of LDL with phospholipase C hydrolyzed as much as 56% of the phospholipids, the LDL was almost completely converted to insoluble complex in both the presence and absence of Mg++. Since minor modification by succinylation or acetylation drastically reduced the reactivity of LDL with dextran sulfate, the protein-charged groups rather than the phospholipid-charged groups seem to play the major role in the dextran sulfate-LDL interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1586573238,"Abstract The role of an S-adenosylmethionine:Δ24-sterol methyltransferase (hereafter referred to as methyltransferase) in ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol (ergosterol) biosynthesis in yeast has been investigated. Sterol substrate specificity studies indicate that 5α-cholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol (zymosterol) is the best methyl group acceptor in the methyltransferase assay. 4-Methyl sterols are very poor substrates; sterols with a fully reduced side chain (i.e. no double bond at C-24) are not methylated. A corresponding 3-ketosteroid, 5α-cholesta-8,24-dien-3-one, was methylated at a slower rate; similarly, sterols with nuclear double bonds in positions 5 or 5 and 7 were poorer substrates than zymosterol. Inhibition studies indicate that sterols with a saturated isooctyl side chain are competitive inhibitors of zymosterol in the methyltransferase reaction. Sterols that possess an alkylated side chain markedly altered the rate of methyltransfer; at low concentrations of substrate, addition of 24-alkyl-substituted sterols stimulated the methyltransferase, whereas at higher concentrations of substrate the 24-alkyl sterols were inhibitory. Conclusions regarding the sequences of nuclear and side chain reactions in ergosterol biosynthesis and the control of the methyltransferase activity are outlined."
https://openalex.org/W1528580323,"Abstract Lysostaphin is a zinc-metalloenzyme which has a molecular weight of 25,000 when determined by sedimentation equilibrium in dilute aqueous salt solutions. Combination of the sedimentation coefficient, s20,w = 2.32, and diffusion coefficient, D20,w = 7.83, gave a native molecular weight of 25,800. Sedimentation equilibrium of the protein in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, with and without 2-mercaptoethanol, gave molecular weights of 25,800 and 27,800, respectively. The molecular weight of the fully dissociated protein was also determined to be 24,500 by the technique of gel filtration in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 25,500 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. In each case, only a single protein species was shown to be present. These data indicate that the lysostaphin molecule is a single polypeptide chain. The frictional coefficient ratio for lysostaphin of 1.39 is higher than values obtained for most globular proteins. The optical rotatory dispersion spectrum was also different from that invariably observed with globular proteins and revealed no evidence of helical structure in the molecule. The amino acid composition of lysostaphin was unusual in that half-cystine was found to be absent."
https://openalex.org/W1969271754,"α-AMANITIN, a bicyclic polypeptide from the toadstool Amanita phalloides1, is known specifically to inhibit the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of mammalian cells by interaction with the enzyme rather than with the DNA template2,3. No influence of the toxin on the replication of a number of DNA or RNA-containing viruses has been found so far (ref. 4 and personal communication from L. Philipson). Actinomycin, which reacts with the DNA template and so impairs the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase reaction, depresses the multiplication of influenza viruses but does not interfere with the replication of most of the other RNA-containing viruses5–7. Because the mode of action of this antibiotic on the synthesis of influenza viruses is still obscure, we extended our studies to the action of α-amanitin on the multiplication of this virus group."
https://openalex.org/W1607877467,"Abstract The kinetics of electron transfer between the copper-containing protein azurin (Cu++/Cu+) and cytochrome 551 (Fe+++/Fe++) from Pseudomonas has been studied by rapid mixing methods. The reaction in both directions is fast; at low reagent concentrations (∼10-6 m) the apparent second order rate constant, at 20°, is about 3 x 106 m-1 sec-1 for the reaction Fe++ + Cu++ and 1.4 x 106 m-1 sec-1 for the reaction Fe+++ + Cu+. At high reagent concentrations the rates tend to reach a limiting value indicating that the reaction is not a simple second order process. The kinetics of the reactions of the reduced and oxidized forms of azurin and Pseudomonas cytochrome 551 with ferricyanide and dithionite has also been investigated. The rates of these reactions, at comparable reagent concentrations, are orders of magnitude lower than that between azurin and cytochrome 551."

https://openalex.org/W1497812649,"Abstract Formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase has been purified to near homogeneity from the thermophile, Clostridium thermoaceticum, as judged from sedimentation velocity, amino-terminal analysis, and electrophoresis. The enzyme is exceptionally stable at high temperatures, especially at pH 7.0. Ammonium or potassium ions enhance its stability between pH 6 to 9. These ions are not required for activity, however. There is little or no carbohydrate or lipid present in the enzyme. The partial specific volume calculated from the amino acid composition is 0.747 cc per g. The thermostable formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase isolated from C. thermoaceticum is somewhat more hydrophobic than the similar enzyme isolated from two mesophilic Clostridia. Although the difference in hydrophobicity is small, it may explain the higher thermal stability of the enzyme from C. thermoaceticum."
https://openalex.org/W1487894348,"Abstract A riboflavin-deficient mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae accumulates 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(1'-d-ribitylamino)pyrimidine. The labile substance was reacted with diacetyl prior to isolation, yielding 2-amino-6,7-dimethyl-4-oxo-8-(1'-d-ribityl)-4,8-dihydropteridine. This compound was isolated, purified, and identified by chromatographic and spectrometric procedures. Furthermore, 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethylpteridine and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxypteridine were isolated from the culture fluid of the mutant. 2,5-Diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(1'-d-ribitylamino) pyrimidine or a phosphoric ester of this compound appears to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of riboflavin."

https://openalex.org/W1581772763,"Abstract In the light of the kinetic studies reported in this paper, the nucleoside phosphotransferase of carrot is considered as an enzyme possessing two hydrolytic sites, binding the phosphate donor, and one transfer site, engaging the nucleoside acceptor. The purification of the protein used in these studies, with phenylphosphate as the donor and uridine as the acceptor, is described. In addition to phenylphosphate, d-ribose 5-phosphate was also used as the substrate in the study of the hydrolytic function of the enzyme. Michaelis constants for the transfer reaction were determined with phenylphosphate as the donor (Km = 3.5 mm) and uridine as the acceptor (Km = 3.5 mm). As concerns the hydrolase function, either substrate exhibited two Km values: approximately 0.7 and 3 mm for phenylphosphate, and approximately 2 and 60 mm for ribose phosphate. Uridine acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the hydrolase function, with Ki = 4.3 mm. Ribose phosphate produced a mixed type inhibition. The evidence pointing to one protein carrying both transfer and hydrolytic functions may be summarized as follows: (a) the constant specific activity of a single, homogeneous protein peak in the chromatographic eluates; (b) similar constants for uridine as acceptor of phosphate transfer and as inhibitor of hydrolysis; (c) the demonstration, in the two separate enzymic functions, of two ionizing groups in the free enzyme having identical pK values (7.0, 7.6); (d) the similarity of the pKes values recorded for the enzyme-substrate complexes in both enzymic functions. With regard to the suggestion that the enzyme possesses two hydrolytic centers, it rests, among other observations discussed in this communication, on two points: (a) the nonlinearity of the Lineweaver-Burk plots depicting the hydrolysis of phenylphosphate and ribose 5-phosphate; (b) the existence, in the free enzyme, of two ionizing groups (pK 7.0, 7.6), both binding phenylphosphate in the course of its hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1511402411,"Abstract The zymogen and enzyme forms of streptococcal proteinase were treated with the tryptophan-specific reagent 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide (HNB-Br) in 0.46 m phosphate solutions at pH 3.1. The zymogen failed to react with HNB-Br, and none of its potential activity was destroyed. The enzyme incorporated up to 1.8 HNB groups per molecule and lost a maximum of 95% its potential activity. Four peptides containing the HNB moiety were isolated from a tryptic digest of inactivated enzyme by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. The HNB-peptides were eluted together in a narrow, retarded band by 0.1 n NH4OH but were resolved into broad peaks when the eluent was 0.1 m NH4HCO3. One HNB-peptide was further purified by filtration on Bio-Gel P-4. Three of these peptides had identical amino acid compositions, and the fourth had a similar composition but 4 less residues. Two peptides contained one HNB group, and the remainder had two HNB groups. Parts of the amino acid sequences of these peptides and of their chymotryptic fragments were determined by Edman degradations and digestions with aminopeptidase M and carboxypeptidases A and B. Apparently, each major HNB-peptide came from the same segment of the enzyme, and a single tryptophan residue underwent both mono- and disubstitution. The proposed sequence around the reactive tryptophan is: His-Val-Asn-Trp-Gly-Phe-Gly-Trp(HNB1or2)-Gly(Val,Ser)Asn-Gly-Phe-Arg This proposed sequence is similar to the sequence around a tryptophan residue placed at the active site of papain by x-ray crystallography. Both proteins have a Trp-Gly-X-Gly-Trp-Gly sequence. From the data of this paper, it is proposed that streptococcal proteinase also has a tryptophan residue in its active site."
https://openalex.org/W1550838834,"Abstract The hydrodynamic parameters of the thermostable formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase from Clostridium thermoaceticum have been measured in the ultracentrifuge at 20°. s20,w0 = 9.86 ± 0.20 S; V20 = 0.752 ± 0.011 cc per g; and molecular weight = 244,000 ± 9,000. Calculations based on these parameters give a frictional ratio, f/f0 = 1.27 ± 0.11, and a Stokes radius of 53.0 ± 4.8 A. The sedimentation constant from sucrose density gradient centrifugation is 9.9 ± 0.4 S, and the Stokes radius of the enzyme from chromatography on a calibrated Sephadex G-200 column is 55.1 A. There are four subunits per 244,000 molecular weight. The fluorescence emission spectrum indicates that the tryptophans in the enzyme are in a moderately hydrophobic environment at 20°. The hydrophobicity possibly increases when the enzyme is heated to 56°, which is near the temperature optimum of the enzyme. The data show that the enzyme is not a random coil at 20 or 56°."

https://openalex.org/W1517860401,"Synthetic peptides corresponding to residues (6 through 47), (9 through 47), (10 through 47), (11 through 47), (12 through 47), (16 through 47), and (18 through 47) in staphylococcal nuclease were prepared by the Merrifield solid phase method. Whereas synthetic-(6–47) and synthetic-(9–47) are about equally effective in generating both RNase and DNase activity upon mixing with native nuclease tryptic fragment nuclease-T-(49–149), synthetic-(10–47) is only partially effective and synthetic-(11–47) through synthetic-(18–47) generate essentially no activity. Synthetic-(6–47) is also the most capable of forming a stable complex with nuclease-T-(49–149), as judged by the resistance of the DNase activity of this semisynthetic nuclease-T species to destruction by trypsin in the presence of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and Ca++, as well as by the extent of the shift and intensification of the fluorescence emission spectrum of the tryptophanyl residue in nuclease-T-(49–149). By these latter criteria, synthetic-(9–47) and synthetic-(10–47) form progressively weaker nuclease-T complexes than does synthetic-(6–47). On the other hand, all of the synthetic peptides through synthetic-(18–47) are able to bind, at least slightly, with nuclease-T-(49–149) as judged by the ability to enhance the binding of 125I-[nuclease-T-(49–149)] to antinuclease antibody. The results for these peptides, considered together with structural features in the 2 A model of nuclease elucidated by Dr. F. A. Cotton and his associates, suggest important structural functions for residues lysine 9 and glutamic acid 10 in both nuclease-T and nuclease."

https://openalex.org/W1480184944,"Abstract The hydrogen exchange kinetics of chymotrypsinogen and α-chymotrypsin have been compared under conditions in which the observed exchange rate is known to be a function of thermal unfolding and refolding rates. The results are best explained by a model which (a) does not include any major refolding of the polypeptide chain after the conversion of zymogen to active enzyme and assumes that the dynamic behaviour of the native states is, as far as hydrogen exchange can see, very little influenced by the conversion, (b) includes a difference in the nature of the unfolded states, and (c) is consistent with the fact that the number of hydrogens exchanging through thermal unfolding is 25% larger for chymotrypsin. The last point indicates that the size of the structural unit involved in reversible thermal unfolding is larger for chymotrypsin than for chymotrypsinogen."

The transport process is energy-dependent, obeys Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics, and is subject to competitive inhibition by various anions. The citrate transport process consists of a first order entry opposed by a synchronous first order exit. The specific reaction rate constant for citrate entry is 0.13 min-1 and for citrate exit is 0.23 min-1. It is concluded that citrate and isocitrate transport in isolated rat liver mitochondria is an active carrier-mediated process."
