https://openalex.org/W1888172398,"One of the most disastrous forms of collective human behaviour is the kind of crowd stampede induced by panic, often leading to fatalities as people are crushed or trampled. Sometimes this behaviour is triggered in life-threatening situations such as fires in crowded buildings; at other times, stampedes can arise during the rush for seats or seemingly without cause. Although engineers are finding ways to alleviate the scale of such disasters, their frequency seems to be increasing with the number and size of mass events. But systematic studies of panic behaviour and quantitative theories capable of predicting such crowd dynamics are rare. Here we use a model of pedestrian behaviour to investigate the mechanisms of (and preconditions for) panic and jamming by uncoordinated motion in crowds. Our simulations suggest practical ways to prevent dangerous crowd pressures. Moreover, we find an optimal strategy for escape from a smoke-filled room, involving a mixture of individualistic behaviour and collective 'herding' instinct."
https://openalex.org/W1661647511,"Oestrogen produces diverse biological effects through binding to the oestrogen receptor (ER). The ER is a steroid hormone nuclear receptor, which, when bound to oestrogen, modulates the transcriptional activity of target genes. Controversy exists, however, concerning whether ER has a role outside the nucleus, particularly in mediating the cardiovascular protective effects of oestrogen. Here we show that the ER isoform, ER alpha, binds in a ligand-dependent manner to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K). Stimulation with oestrogen increases ER alpha-associated PI(3)K activity, leading to the activation of protein kinase B/Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Recruitment and activation of PI(3)K by ligand-bound ER alpha are independent of gene transcription, do not involve phosphotyrosine adapter molecules or src-homology domains of p85alpha, and extend to other steroid hormone receptors. Mice treated with oestrogen show increased eNOS activity and decreased vascular leukocyte accumulation after ischaemia and reperfusion injury. This vascular protective effect of oestrogen was abolished in the presence of PI(3)K or eNOS inhibitors. Our findings define a physiologically important non-nuclear oestrogen-signalling pathway involving the direct interaction of ER alpha with PI(3)K."

It changes its shape as it crawls over a plain agar gel and, if food is placed at two different points, it will put out pseudopodia that connect the two food sources. Here we show that this simple organism has the ability to find the minimum-length solution between two points in a labyrinth."

https://openalex.org/W1628582474,"Recent work has demonstrated the self-assembly of designed periodic two-dimensional arrays composed of DNA tiles, in which the intermolecular contacts are directed by 'sticky' ends. In a mathematical context, aperiodic mosaics may be formed by the self-assembly of 'Wang' tiles, a process that emulates the operation of a Turing machine. Macroscopic self-assembly has been used to perform computations; there is also a logical equivalence between DNA sticky ends and Wang tile edges. This suggests that the self-assembly of DNA-based tiles could be used to perform DNA-based computation. Algorithmic aperiodic self-assembly requires greater fidelity than periodic self-assembly, because correct tiles must compete with partially correct tiles. Here we report a one-dimensional algorithmic self-assembly of DNA triple-crossover molecules that can be used to execute four steps of a logical (cumulative XOR) operation on a string of binary bits."

https://openalex.org/W1953389023,"Thermoplasma acidophilum is a thermoacidophilic archaeon that thrives at 59 °C and pH 2, which was isolated from self-heating coal refuse piles and solfatara fields1,2. Species of the genus Thermoplasma do not possess a rigid cell wall, but are only delimited by a plasma membrane. Many macromolecular assemblies from Thermoplasma , primarily proteases and chaperones, have been pivotal in elucidating the structure and function of their more complex eukaryotic homologues3,4. Our interest in protein folding and degradation led us to seek a more complete representation of the proteins involved in these pathways by determining the genome sequence of the organism. Here we have sequenced the 1,564,905-base-pair genome in just 7,855 sequencing reactions by using a new strategy. The 1,509 open reading frames identify Thermoplasma as a typical euryarchaeon with a substantial complement of bacteria-related genes; however, evidence indicates that there has been much lateral gene transfer between Thermoplasma and Sulfolobus solfataricus, a phylogenetically distant crenarchaeon inhabiting the same environment. At least 252 open reading frames, including a complete protein degradation pathway and various transport proteins, resemble Sulfolobus proteins most closely."

Northern blotting detected a major 3.1-kilobase mRNA transcript as well as a minor 4.1-kilobase transcript in all human tissues examined. In several cancer cell lines, lower levels of mRNA expression were clearly evident. The gene encoding the human enzyme was mapped to chromosome band 1p32–35.

Such repair is accomplished by activation of different metabolic processes, some involving NAD+. This indicates that the pyridine coenzyme NAD+ plays significant roles beyond its participation in redox metabolism and in various types of ADP-ribosylation. The cellular NAD+ concentration likewise appears to modulate expression of stress response proteins, including the tumor suppressor protein p53. In fact, high levels of pyridine dinucleotide reduce the time required for cellular rescue from DNA damage. Skin biopsy specimens from actinic keratoses and squamous cell carcinomas also exhibit an inverse relationship between skin NAD+ content and the severity of the malignant phenotype (1Jacobson E.L. Shieh W.M. Huang A.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 69-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of this role of NAD+ in cellular rescue from DNA damage, a better understanding of how human NAD+ biosynthesis is regulated may be of vital importance in developing effective approaches for preventing and treating cancer. For many years, we have studied NMN adenylyltransferases (NMNATs),1 which play central roles in both de novo biosynthetic and salvage pathways for nicotinamide nucleotides. These enzymes convert NMN (or nicotinic acid mononucleotide) and ATP to NAD+ (or nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide) and inorganic pyrophosphate (2Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 135-182PubMed Google Scholar), and their activity has been correlated with crucial cellular events such as mitosis and DNA synthesis (3Greenbaum A.L. Pinder S. Biochem. J. 1968; 107: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 4Solao P.B. Shall S. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, cell survival and viability appear to require NMNAT activity (5Hughes K.T. Ladika D. Roth J.R. Olivera B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because tumor cell NMNAT concentrations are very low, the enzyme represents a potential chemotherapeutic target (6Morton R.K. Nature. 1971; 181: 540-542Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Amici A. Balducci E. Natalini P. Ruggieri S. Magni G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This adenylyltransferase catalyzes the essential last step in the metabolic conversion of the potent antitumor agent tiazofurin from its prodrug form to tiazofurin adenine dinucleotide. Low tumor levels of this enzyme activity are associated with the development of drug resistance (8Jayaram H.N. Pillwein K. Lui M.S. Faderan M.A. Weber G. Biochem.

Our laboratory has purified and characterized NMN adenylyltransferases from yeast, bull testis, thermophilic bacteria, and human placenta (10Natalini P. Ruggieri S. Raffaelli N. Magni G.

We have also identified, cloned, and expressed the gene for this enzyme from Methanococcus jannaschii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Raffaelli N. Pisani F.M. Lorenzi T. Emanuelli M. Amici A.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 13-17Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), as well as from Synechocystis sp. (slr0787). The bifunctional slr0787 protein is endowed with both nudix hydrolase and NMNAT activities; and in Escherichia coli, the NAD+ biosynthesis regulatory protein NadR possesses NMNAT activity (15Raffaelli N. Lorenzi T. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Ruggieri S. Magni G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Raffaelli N. Lorenzi T. Mariani P.L. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5509-5511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As part of an ongoing study on the role of this enzyme in regulating NAD+ levels, we successfully isolated a full-length cDNA encoding NMNAT from a human placenta cDNA library. In this report, we describe human NMNAT cDNA cloning and its tissue-specific expression, levels in tumor cells, and chromosomal location. We also describe the high efficiency expression and purification of the protein in E. coli as well as its kinetic properties and metal ion effects. We purchased a human placenta cDNA library constructed in λgt11 as well as blots containing poly(A)+ RNAs from human tissues and cancer cell lines from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). Restriction endonucleases and other cloning reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA) or Promega (Madison, WI). Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) using a commercial random priming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). All other reagent-grade chemicals were obtained from standard suppliers. Human placental NMNAT was purified (13Emanuelli M. Natalini P. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Vita A. Magni G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and subjected to tryptic digestion (17Helman U. Wernstedt C. Góñez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). The resulting fragments were separated by reverse-phase liquid chromatography on an ABI 173A Capillary LC/Microblotter system. After spotting recombinant human NMNAT on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Edman sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Procise Model 491 sequencer. BLAST searches (18Altschul S.F. Warren G. Webb M. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70353) Google Scholar), conducted with NMNAT peptides (YLVPDLVQEYIEK and NAGVILAPLQR) as query sequences, revealed a full match with the predicted amino acid sequence of an expressed sequence tag cDNA (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AA307717). This clone, containing a 342-bp cDNA insert, was used to design PCR primers for the cloning of human NMNAT cDNA. We first employed PCR using a human placenta cDNA 5′-stretch λgt11 library and primers based on the expressed sequence tag sequence (HATF, 5′-TACTTGGTACCAGATCTTGTCC-3′; and HATR, 5′-CTTCTGCAGTGTTTCTCTGCAA-3′). PCR was carried out in a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s annealing (60 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). The resulting 118-bp fragment was sequenced to confirm the presence of NMNAT cDNA (see Fig. 1, sequence B, nucleotides 800–917). The 5′-part of the human NMNAT cDNA was isolated by two consecutive PCRs. A primary PCR was performed with the λgt11-specific primer V1 (5′-GAGCTCACACCAGACCAACTGGTAATG-3′) in combination with primer HATR directed upstream of sequence B (5′-CTTCTGCAGTGTTTCTCTGCAA-3′). To increase the specificity, the product of the first round of PCR was diluted 1:10 in water, and 1 μl was used as a template in a second round of PCR using the nested λgt11-specific primer V2 (5′-CAACTGGTAATGGTAGCG-3′) and the nested specific primer HATRN (5′-GGACAAGATCTGGTACCAAGTA-3′). This final combination yielded an 821-bp DNA fragment, which was cloned into the pGEM-T vector by T-A ligation for transformation of E. coli JM109 and sequenced on both strands (see Fig. 1, sequence A, nucleotides 1–821). Primers HATF and HATFN (5′-TTGCAGAGAAACACTGCAGAAG-3′), in combination with the λgt11-specific primers V1 and V2, were used to isolate the 3′-part of the cDNA sequence. The product of the second round of PCR was a 434-bp fragment, which was cloned into the pGEM vector and sequenced (see Fig. 1, sequence C, nucleotides 896–1329). To prepare a vector suitable for expression of recombinant NMNAT in E. coli, we first generated an 840-bp DNA fragment containing the coding sequence for NMNAT by PCR of the aforementioned cDNA library using primers HF (5′-CGGGGATTCATGGAAAATTCCGAGAAGACT-3′) and HR (5′-GCAGTCGACCTATGTCTTAGCTTCTGCAGT-3′). Primer HF contains a BamHI site followed by the beginning of the open reading frame; primer HR contains the end of the open reading frame followed by a SalI cleavage site. PCR (1 min of denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of annealing at 50 °C, and 1 min of elongation at 72 °C) was performed for 35 cycles with 20 pmol of each primer in a final volume of 100 μl. After electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, the amplified DNA, visible by ethidium bromide staining, was digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into BamHI-SalI-digested pT7-7 plasmid vector (19Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) to obtain the construct pT7-7-HAT. The insert was sequenced to ascertain that no mutations had been introduced during amplification. The construct was used to transform E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) for plasmid preparation and E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Transformed BL21(DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 in LB medium (50 ml) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A 10-ml portion was used to inoculate 1 liter fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 120 rpm at 37 °C. Protein production was then induced by 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After a 3-h induction at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and either used for purification or stored at −80 °C. All steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in 60 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A) and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min (crude extract). The crude extract was applied to a Matrex Gel Green A chromatography column, previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.5–2.5 m) in the equilibration buffer (Green A fraction). After adding NaCl to a final concentration of 3 m, the Green A fraction was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column, equilibrated with buffer A containing 3m NaCl. The column was washed with buffer A containing 2m NaCl and then eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (2 to 0m in buffer A). The active pool was concentrated through an Amicon YM-30 membrane (phenyl-Sepharose fraction). This fraction was injected onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 m NaCl. Active fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described below. Homogeneous fractions were pooled and used to determine substrate specificity and other catalytic properties. Enzyme activity was measured continuously by a coupled spectrophotometric assay (20Balducci E. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Amici A. Magni G. Orsomando G. Polzonetti V. Natalini P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or by HPLC (20Balducci E. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Amici A. Magni G. Orsomando G. Polzonetti V. Natalini P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Optimal reaction conditions were established by varying divalent cation concentration and buffer pH (30 mm BisTris-HCl and 30 mm Tris-HCl adjusted to the desired pH). One enzyme unit is defined as the amount that catalyzes formation of 1 μmol of NAD+/min at 37 °C. Human metaphase spreads were obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral lymphocytes of a normal donor by standard procedures. Chromosome preparations were hybridized in situ with biotinylated probes (full-length human NMNAT cDNA) labeled by nick translation essentially as described by Lichter et al. (21Lichter P. Tang-Chang C.-J. Call K. Hermanson G. Evans G.A. Housman D. Ward D.C. Science. 1990; 247: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Labeled probe (500 ng) was used for fluorescence in situ hybridization at 37 °C in 2× SSC, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 5 μg of COT1 DNA, and 3 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (10-μl volume). Post-hybridization washing was carried out at 42 °C in 2× SSC and 50% formamide (three times), followed by three washes in 0.1× SSC at 60 °C. Biotin-labeled DNA was detected with Cy3-conjugated avidin. Chromosome identification was obtained by simultaneous 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining to produce the characteristic Q-banding patterns. Blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from different human tissues and cancer cell lines were prehybridized at 68 °C for 1 h in ExpressHybTM hybridization solution. The filters were then hybridized with the 32P-labeled cDNA probe (nucleotides 89–928) at 68 °C for 16 h. After washing as recommended by the manufacturer, blots were exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C with an intensifying screen for 4 days. RNA integrity and loading were assessed with an actin probe. Human genomic DNA (10 μg) from human peripheral white blood cells was digested with ApaI,BamHI, EcoRI, PstI, or PvuII. DNA fragments were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane by the method of Southern (22Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21463) Google Scholar). A 118-bp cDNA fragment (nucleotides 800–917) was amplified with primers HATF and HATR using the pT7-7-HAT construct as a template and gel-purified. This fragment, radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using the commercial random priming kit, was used as a probe. Hybridization was performed overnight at 45 °C in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion Inc.). The filter was then washed and exposed for 48 h to x-ray film at −80 °C. Gel electrophoresis of recombinant human NMNAT was carried out by the Laemmli method (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) on 15% polyacrylamide gel. Gel filtration of recombinant human NMNAT was performed by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Using two tryptic peptide sequences from human placental NMNAT, we conducted BLAST searches of the human expressed sequence tag data base. We identified a cDNA clone (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAA307717) encoding both sequences. The insert of this clone was too short to account for the molecular mass of NMNAT (13Emanuelli M. Natalini P. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Vita A. Magni G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and we used the clone to design specific primers for PCR experiments utilizing a human placenta cDNA library. A scheme of our cloning strategy is shown in Fig. 1. The composite sequence obtained by assembling the products of PCR experiments resulted in a 1329-bp transcript consisting of an 88-bp 5′-untranslated region, an 837-bp coding region, and a 404-bp 3′-untranslated region with an incomplete AATAA polyadenylation signal (Fig. 2,upper panel). The translational initiation site (ATG), assigned to the first methionine codon (nucleotides 89–91), is in the favorable initiation context ACCATGG, thus fulfilling Kozak's criteria for initiation (25Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). An in-frame translational termination codon (TAG) occurs after nucleotide 925. The open reading frame encodes a 279-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 31,900 Da, close to that estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13Emanuelli M. Natalini P. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Vita A. Magni G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When the sequences of both tryptic peptides were aligned with the deduced amino acid sequence, there was a complete match (Fig. 2), confirming that the cloned cDNA codes for NMNAT. The hydrophobicity profile (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17170) Google Scholar) of the predicted protein (Fig. 2,lower panel) suggests the existence of several potential transmembrane regions, in agreement with the observation that NMNAT is located at the inner nuclear membrane level (27Humbert J.-P. Matter N. Artault J.-C. Köppler P. Malviya A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). As previously reported (28Hogeboom G.H. Schneider W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 197: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Reinhardt's method (34) for cytoplasmic/nuclear discrimination also suggests a nuclear localization. When the deduced amino acid sequence of NMNAT was examined for a number of structural motifs, we identified a single potential Asn-linked glycosylation site (36NGTG39) in the N-terminal region. To provide additional evidence that the isolated cDNA encodes NMNAT, we compared the deduced amino acid sequence with sequences of other known NMNATs. The human enzyme was 40% identical to the yeast enzyme and 34 and 33% identical to the two putative Caenorhabditis elegans homologs, respectively (14Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Lorenzi M. Raffaelli N. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 13-17Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There was very little similarity with respect to the prokaryotic counterparts (12Raffaelli N. Pisani F.M. Lorenzi T. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7718-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Raffaelli N. Lorenzi T. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Ruggieri S. Magni G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Raffaelli N. Lorenzi T. Mariani P.L. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5509-5511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we used the ClustalW program to obtain an optimized multiple sequence alignment of known NMNATs, including the NadR protein recently demonstrated to exhibit NMNAT activity (16Raffaelli N. Lorenzi T. Mariani P.L. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5509-5511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All proteins possess the sequence (H/T)XXH (Fig.3), which is very similar to the motif implicated in the α/β-phosphodiesterase activity of nucleotidyltransferases (29Bork P. Holm L. Koonin E.V. Sander C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this motif appears to be a part of the conserved sequence G XF XP X(T/H)XXH, which may represent a novel NMNAT motif. This region may constitute part of the enzyme's active center, but site-directed mutagenesis is needed to evaluate the role of conserved sequences in NMNAT catalysis. These efforts will be augmented by ongoing x-ray diffraction studies to obtain the enzyme's three-dimensional structure. To confirm that the isolated cDNA encodes NMNAT, we developed a bacterial expression system. An 840-bp fragment containing the complete coding sequence was PCR-amplified and cloned in the polylinker region of the expression vector pT7-7 (see “Experimental Procedures”). After nucleotide sequencing of the coding insert, the resulting plasmid pT7-7-HAT was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). Transformed bacteria were induced by treatment with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to produce the recombinant enzyme. Protein extracts were prepared from the induced bacteria and assayed for NMNAT activity. Even without isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, high NMNAT activity could be detected in BL21 cells transformed with the recombinant plasmid, whereas BL21 cells containing unmodified plasmid showed no detectable enzyme activity. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that bacteria transformed with the recombinant plasmid contained a polypeptide of the expected size, whereas crude extracts of bacteria lacking human NMNAT-coding sequence did not (Fig.4). NMNAT was isolated by three chromatographic steps (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6; and Table I). The purified recombinant protein appeared as a single band with a molecular mass of 33 kDa, agreeing with the value calculated from the deduced sequence (Fig. 4, lane 6). The N-terminal sequence of the first 18 residues of the recombinant protein exactly matched the deduced sequence. The native molecular mass of the active recombinant enzyme was determined by gel filtration to be 139 kDa. These data indicate that the recombinant enzyme is an oligomer of four identical subunits, agreeing with previous experiments on the wild-type placental enzyme (13Emanuelli M. Natalini P.

Biophys. 1992; 298: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Table IPurification of recombinant human NMNATStepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldExtract1462541.74100Green A7.0713118.55210.6Phenyl-Sepharose2.6010038.43922.1Superose 121.5880.651.03129.3 Open table in a new tab We were interested in investigating the chromosomal localization of the NMNAT gene to ascertain if it corresponded to the position of any known disease locus and to obtain insights regarding the genomic organization of the NMNAT locus. A fluorescent cDNA probe was used for in situ hybridization on metaphase chromosome spreads. The analysis showed that the NMNAT gene is located on chromosome 1p32–35 (Fig.5). The gene for the closely related enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is located on the same chromosome, albeit in a different region (1q41–42) (30Cherney B.W. McBride O.W. Chen D.F. Alkhatib H.

Genes for other enzymes in the NAD+ metabolic pathway map to different chromosomes (31Williams S.R. Goddard J.M. Martin Jr., D.W.

Yamashina I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To evaluate the distribution of NMNAT mRNA, Northern blot analyses were performed with mRNAs from various human tissues. Two messages of ∼3.1 and 4.1 kilobases, respectively, were detected with variable intensity in all examined tissues. The 3.1-kilobase mRNA was considerably more abundant (Fig.6 A). The major sites of NMNAT expression were skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and kidney, whereas organs such as thymus and spleen showed a very weak signal. The widespread distribution of NMNAT in human tissues is consistent with its essential role in cellular metabolism; with no alternative biosynthetic routes for NAD synthesis, this enzyme is vitally important. However, the wide variability of NMNAT expression suggests that, in addition to its housekeeping role in pyridine metabolism, NMNAT may play a more specific role in those tissues, such as skeletal muscle, where its level is substantially higher. Further analysis of NMNAT mRNA expression in a panel of cancer cell lines indicated that, with the exception of Burkitt's lymphoma and chronic myelogenous leukemia, the enzyme is expressed at relatively low quantities in tumor cells (Fig. 6 B). This result agrees with a previous report concerning reduced NMNAT activity in cells after malignant transformation (5Hughes K.T. Ladika D. Roth J.R. Olivera B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As reported above, two messages of different size were detected in all examined tissues. The library screening and the chromosomal localization suggest that both signals arise from the NMNAT locus since there were no data indicating the existence of a highly related gene that (cross-)hybridizes with the NMNAT probe. Currently, it is not known whether the bands of different size are alternatively spliced mRNAs from the NMNAT locus or if the larger transcript represents a mRNA retaining intron sequences. To estimate the copy number of the NMNAT gene, genomic DNA isolated from human peripheral white blood cells was digested by one of five restriction enzymes with 6-base recognition sequences: ApaI, BamHI,EcoRI, PstI, or PvuII. The genomic Southern blot prepared from these digests shows a single band in all lines (Fig. 7), suggesting that the NMNAT gene exists as a single copy/haploid in humans. This result agrees with the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments, indicating that there are no other closely related loci in the human genome. Because the functional properties of recombinant human NMNAT are of fundamental importance, we performed a detailed kinetic characterization. The activity profile of recombinant NMNAT at different pH values using 30 mm BisTris-HCl and 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer mixtures was determined. Like other NMNATs (10Natalini P. Ruggieri S. Raffaelli N.

Optimal activity occurred in the presence of 12 mmMg2+, but other metal ions can replace magnesium (TableII). Noteworthy is the very low Kapp value of the enzyme for Zn2+. The results reported above seem to indicate a similarity, with respect to the cation requirement, between human NMNAT and its thermophilic counterpart, whereas the yeast recombinant enzyme exhibits maximal activity with Ni2+ (14Emanuelli M.

Natalini P. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Vita A. Magni G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When deamido-NMN was used as the substrate, the reaction occurred at a comparable rate with respect to that measured in the presence of NMN; however, the higher Km value calculated for nicotinic acid mononucleotide, with respect to NMN, suggests that, in human as well as in other eukaryotes, the amido pathway is predominant (10Natalini P. Ruggieri S. Raffaelli N. Magni G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3725-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

The results reported above clearly indicate that the recombinant enzyme possesses a kinetic behavior indistinguishable from that of the native form. Therefore, the availability of the human cDNA encoding NMNAT should allow more detailed studies on the function and structure of this enzyme. In this regard, a further investigation on the specificity exhibited by recombinant human NMNAT will be helpful to expand our view of metabolic pathways that could involve NMNAT and to evaluate its functional role in human cellular homeostasis.

To test this hypothesis, the rapid kinetics of Ca2+ activation ofmV˙ O2, [NADH], and light scattering were evaluated in isolated porcine heart mitochondria at 37 °C using a variety of optical techniques.

Estimates of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria using optical Ca2+ indicators trapped in the matrix revealed a sufficiently rapid uptake to cause the metabolic effects observed.

The ADP and Pi levels have been proposed to serve as cytosolic signals to the mitochondria, changing in proportion to work (i.e. ATPase activity). Therefore, ADP and Pi, the key substrates for ATP production in the mitochondria, are believed to control ATP production by limiting the substrate for the synthesis reaction (5Chance B. Williams G.

The localization of creatine phosphokinase (CPK)1 at the myofilaments and the inner mitochondria space to generate creatine in the cytosol from ADP and re-derive ADP in the inner membrane space provided a logical “facilitated diffusion” of ADP to the mitochondrion. Due to its higher concentration, creatine (∼10 mm) in cytosol (24Jacobus W.E. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4803-4810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Klingenburg M. Pfaff E. Tager J. Papa S. Quagliariello E. Salter E. Regulation of Metabolic Processes in Mitochondria. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1966: 180-201Google Scholar) is thought to generate a higher “net” diffusional flux when compared with micromolar [ADP] in cytosol. This creatine kinase shuttle has been proposed in various forms over the years (for review see Ref. 26Saks V.A. Khuchua Z.A. Vasilyeva E.V. Belikova O. Kuznetsov A.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133–134: 155-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Finally, Ca2+ has also been proposed as another transducer between cytosolic work and mitochondrial metabolism; however, the mechanism of this activation is thought to occur differently than the proposed feedback models for ADP, Pi, and creatine. Work at the myofilaments and ion transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and sarcolemmal membrane pumps are thought to be stimulated by Ca2+ in parallel with mitochondrial ATP production. The activation of the contractile apparatus of the heart by Ca2+ has been well characterized (for review see Ref. 27Wier W.G. Balke C.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) as well as its effects on Ca2+ ion transport (for review see Ref. 28Hasselbach W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the mitochondria, Ca2+ has long been suggested to modulate Ca2+-sensitive dehydrogenase (10Hansford R.G. Zorov D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 359-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol.

French S. Balaban R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This parallel activation scheme relies on Ca2+ having rapid, as well as similar, kinetics for modulating work and mitochondrial metabolism.In the intact cell it is likely that all of these regulatory processes may be playing some role in the energy homeostasis. The relative importance of these different pathways might be related to the relative speed at which metabolism can respond to these cytosolic signals that could conceivably be changing simultaneously in the cell. Despite the fact that these models of mitochondrial regulation have been in the literature for many years, there is very little information on the rapid kinetics of these putative signaling molecules on oxidative phosphorylation. The purpose of this study was to determine the rapid kinetics of heart mitochondria to extramitochondrial concentrations of these putative cytosolic signaling markers. This was accomplished using isolated porcine heart mitochondria and rapid optical techniques to follow NADH, light scattering (volume), and oxygen consumption in response to step increases in these potential cytosolic signaling molecules.DISCUSSIONThese data are consistent with the notion that extramitochondrial Ca2+ can rapidly modulate mitochondrial ATP production rates within ∼200 ms. Determination of IRT for Ca2+effects on mV˙ O2, NADH, light scattering, and RHOD 2 were on the order of the chamber mixing times (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the kinetics could even be more rapid.The effects of Ca2+ onmV˙ O2 are assumed to represent the effects of Ca2+ on ATP production rate and may be caused by the matrix influx of Ca2+. These conclusions are supported by our previous observations that mitochondrial uncoupling by Ca2+ is minimal at concentrations below 600 nm (15Territo P. Mootha V. French S. Balaban R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a correlation betweenmV˙ O2 and direct measurements of ATP production has also been established in this system (15Territo P. Mootha V. French S. Balaban R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the metabolic effects observed with Ca2+, increased mV˙ O2, and [NADH] are not consistent with an uncoupling of oxygen consumption from ATP production by the influx of Ca2+ ions alone, which should decrease [NADH] while increasingmV˙ O2.Evidence that changes in matrix Ca2+ were responsible for these metabolic effects of extramitochondrial Ca2+ were obtained by the partial inhibition of these effects with RuRed, and the kinetics of matrix [Ca2+] were detected with RHOD 2. The partial inhibition of the metabolic effects of Ca2+ by RuRed as well as the partial inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by Ru360 suggests that Ruthenium Red-insensitive Ca2+ uptake mechanisms exists in this preparation. These results are similar to the recent results (45Trollinger D.R. Cascio W.E. Lemasters J.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) demonstrating a partial inhibition of mitochondria Ca2+ uptake by RuRed in intact heart cells. The nature of this RuRed-insensitive transport mechanism is unknown but is consistent with previous descriptions of the rapid uptake mode in liver mitochondria (46Gunter T.E. Buntinas L. Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 47Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Matrix Ca2+ could effect ATP production at several levels including an increase in [NADH] or Δψ driving force via CaDH activation (11McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 15Territo P. Mootha V. French S. Balaban R. Am. J.

Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current data are consistent with both of these mechanisms. The rapid increase in [NADH] observed with Ca2+ is consistent with an activation of CaDH. These data suggest that the CaDH are being activated in ∼200 ms, although taking seconds to reach maximum values (Fig. 3). This is consistent with previous data on the activation of pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases in mitochondria (49Hansford R.G. Biochem.

These results suggest that the activation of CaDH and increase in metabolic driving force through an increase in [NADH] was one of the rapid metabolic response mechanisms initiated by Ca2+.In previous work, it was shown that increases in F0F1-ATPase activity were very significant in Ca2+ activation of heart mitochondrial ATP production in the steady state (15Territo P. Mootha V. French S. Balaban R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar data have been recently obtained by skeletal muscle mitochondria (51Kavanagh N.I. Ainscow E.K. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the IRT for NADH andmV˙ O2 were similar (Figs. 2 and 4), closer inspection of the NADH andmV˙ O2 time courses revealed a monotonic increase in [NADH] (Fig. 3 B), whereas the increase in mV˙ O2was almost a simple step function at the current temporal resolution (Fig. 1 B). This result was surprising since several other studies have demonstrated a linear relationship between [NADH] andmV˙ O2 in mitochondria (44Mootha V.K. Arai A.E. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H769-H775PubMed Google Scholar, 52Koretsky A.P. Balaban R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and cells (53Balaban R.S. Dennis V.W. Mandel L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: F337-F342PubMed Google Scholar) in the steady state with varying substrate delivery. These rapid kinetic effects of Ca2+ suggest that the increase in NADH driving force alone was not linearly related tomV˙ O2, and some other factors regulating ATP production must play a role. The likely site of this activation is an increase in the F0F1-ATPase synthetic flux in conjunction with the increase in CaDH as demonstrated previously (15Territo P. Mootha V. French S. Balaban R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism of Ca2+ activation of F0F1-ATPase synthetic rate is unknown; however, Ca2+ has been shown to modify cardiac mitochondrial volumein vitro (31French S.A. Territo P.R. Balaban R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C900-C909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Halstrap and co-workers (55Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) have suggested that mitochondrial volume changes observed in liver, and stimulated by Ca2+, may play a role in activation of oxidative phosphorylation through the pyrophosphate stimulation pathway. Since matrix volume can be rapidly followed using light scattering techniques (56Chappell J.B. Br. Med. Bull. 1968; 24: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), we used this approach to evaluate whether matrix volume changes were kinetically associated with the observed metabolic effects of Ca2+. Calcium additions resulted in a rapid increase in light scattering consistent with an increase in matrix volume and were concomitant with increases in [NADH] andmV˙ O2. Similar volume effects of Ca2+ have been observed in liver (55Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 57Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. J. Biol.

It is unclear whether increases in volume are due solely to matrix Ca2+ influx or to indirect mechanisms such as the production of new matrix osmolytes, or changes in other ion permeabilities. Since net Ca2+ entry into the matrix in cardiac mitochondria is very low, with an estimated value of ∼500 mOsm (see Fig. 7), it is therefore unlikely that it represents the primary osmolyte which elicits these changes (63Carafoli E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 64Wier W.G. Lopez-Lopez J.R. Shacklock P.S. Balke C.W. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 188: 146-164PubMed Google Scholar). It is more probable that the changes observed are reflective of either elevated osmolyte production or an alteration in ion permeability of the inner membrane, where Ca2+ serves as the second messenger. The most likely ion permeability change would be for K+, as this ion plays a key role in the regulation of mitochondrial volume. Studies in liver mitochondria seem to support this contention showing that changes in volume with Ca2+ are due to specific alterations in K+ permeability (for review see Ref. 11McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). The fact that the rate of light scattering (mV˙υs ) was strongly dependent on [Ca2+], and IRT was not, may indicate that the effects of Ca2+ on light scattering were occurring much faster than the mixing time of the system resulting in the observed constant IRT value as a function of Ca2+ concentration. Despite the mechanism of Ca2+-induced volume changes, it is clear that Ca2+ additions increased mV˙υs , with the largest magnitude change occurring between 172 and 535 nm, which was consistent with the calculatedK 0.5 for [NADH] andmV˙ O2 effects with Ca2+ (∼175 nm; Table IV). Given this correlation, it is reasonable to speculate that changes in matrix volume could contribute to the stimulation ofmV˙ O2 andmV˙ NADH observed and is consistent with previous studies in rat liver mitochondria (see Ref. 55Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Further investigations are required to establish the role of matrix volume on the Ca2+ metabolic effects in cardiac mitochondria.For Ca2+ to serve effectively as a rapid modulator (i.e. stimulate or inhibit) of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the 25–600 nm concentration range, the off-kinetics (i.e. removal of Ca2+) of the process would need to be similar to the on-kinetics (i.e.addition of Ca2+) that were the focus of this study. We attempted to estimate the off-kinetics with the addition of exogenous EGTA to the chamber. This revealed that the metabolic effects of Ca2+ were in fact reversible, but the kinetics was significantly slower (1.55 ± 0.14 s, n = 6) compared with the on kinetics (0.27 ± 0.02 s,n = 43). The slower off kinetics might be due to the incomplete removal of Ca2+ by the solubility limited concentration of EGTA or the kinetics of EGTA Ca2+ binding. A more rapid and complete trap of Ca2+ is required to effectively quantitate the off-kinetics in this system. If the off-kinetics for Ca2+ transport is slow, then this phenomenon might contribute an “asymmetric” temporal response to work or hypoxia transitions observed as metabolic overshoots in heart (65Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Bulkley B.H. Gardner T.J. Gott V.L. Jacobus W.E. Circulation. 1982; 65: 561-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 66Kaplan L.J. Bellows C.F. Carter S. Blum H. Whitman G.J. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle (67Sahlin K. Soderlund K. Tonkonogi M. Hirakoba K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C172-C178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It is interesting to compare the kinetics of Ca2+ with Pi and ADP, the other putative cytosolic modulators (5Chance B. Williams G. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of mitochondrial ATP production. The direct addition of near-saturating levels of ADP or Pi alone resulted in a much slowermV˙ O2 response (>2 s) than Ca2+ additions (Fig. 2 B). This implies that the net effects of Ca2+ are occurring faster than the initiation of serial transport of ADP or Pi into the matrix and ADP phosphorylation by the F0F1-ATPase under near-optimal conditions. Similar kinetics for ADP activation of ATP production (1–2.5 s) has been reported for rat liver mitochondria (68Eisenhardt R.H. Rosenthal O. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 69Heldt H.W. Schwalbach K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These data suggest that mitochondrial ATP production is more responsive, kinetically, to changes in [Ca2+] than [ADP] or [Pi]. The delay in ATP production after the addition of ADP has been ascribed to the slow transport of ADP into the matrix space through the adenylate translocase. However, in heart mitochondria the translocase does not significantly contribute to the overall rate limitation of ATP production since uncoupled rates of respiration are similar to the State 3 rate (15Territo P. Mootha V. French S. Balaban R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C423-C435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Mootha V.K. Arai A.E. Balaban R.S. Am. J.

At State 3, even in the presence of extramitochondrial ATP, the ADP flux across the inner membrane is ∼580 nmol of ADP·nmol Cyta−1·min−1(210 nmol of O2·nmol of Cyta−1·min−1and ADP·O−1 of 2.76). By assuming a mitochondrial volume of 2.9 μl·nmol of Cyta−1 implies that the [ADP] is increasing at the rate of 200 mm·s−1, approaching the ∼0.1 mm K m for the F0F1-ATPase (71Vinogradov A.D. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 41-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in less than ∼2 ms. Thus, the delay in ATP production with ADP additions is likely due to other factors such as the buffering of ADP in the matrix (72Veech R.L. Lawson J.W. Cornell N.W. Krebs H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6538-6547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the fact that the ratio of ATP:ADP−1 is critical (73Bishop P.D. Atkinson D.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in the operation of cytochrome oxidase (74Arnold S. Kadenbach B. Eur. J.

Fitin A.F. Vasilyeva E.A. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, since the initial conditions these experiments had near-physiological levels of ATP (3.4 mm), the matrix ATP:ADP−1ratio may have played a significant role in this delayed response to ADP. If the matrix ATP was very high before the addition of ADP, the large amounts of ADP would have to be exchanged before approaching the free ATP:ADP−1 of ∼2, as observed in intact rat hearts (79Starnes J.W. Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: H799-H806PubMed Google Scholar) and human skeletal muscle (80Jeneson J.A.L. Wiseman R.W. Westerhoff H.V. Kushmerick M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The time required to reset the ATP:ADP−1 ratio could contribute to the delay observed for the ADP effect on respiration.Creatine has been suggested to be more efficient in delivering ADP to the matrix than extramitochondrial ADP alone (19Saks V.A.

Acta. 1987; 891: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this model, it has been suggested that local ADP synthesis, transfer to adenine nucleotide translocase, and subsequent respiration was preferential to simple exogenous bolus additions of ADP (81Moreadith R.W. Jacobus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 899-905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coupled to cytosolic creatine kinase, this might lead to a faster cytosolic transduction system than ADP alone. To test this hypothesis, creatine in the presence of ATP was used to generate ADP via the endogenous CPK in heart mitochondria. Using step increases of 10 mmcreatine in the presence of ATP and Pi resulted in very slow IRT responses (15.6 ± 1.2 s) using our standard conditions (buffer C). To ensure that the creatine kinase enzyme was preserved in the mitochondrial membranes, several additional studies were performed. A thiol (S-H)-reducing agent dithiothreitol (0.5 mm) was added (buffer E) to prevent auto-oxidation of the CPK complex (34Yuan G. Kaneko M. Masuda H. Hon R.B. Kobayashi A. Yamazaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Saks V.A. Khuchua Z.A. Kuznetsov A.V. Veksler V.I. Sharov V.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biophys. 1983; 220: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); however, no improvement in IRT was observed. Alternatively, chloride in excess of (>50 mm) has been implicated in the loss of CPK function, which was reasoned to be due to the detachment of CPK from the adenine nucleotide translocase complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane (29Kuznetsov A.V.

To test this possibility, experiments were performed in only 32 mmCl− as the balanced anions to Na+, Mg2+, and ATP. Under these"

To determine the function of these conserved genes, we characterized a series of isogenic mutants derived from a wild-type strain of type Ia group B Streptococcus by selectively inactivating each gene.

For pathogenic streptococci such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B Streptococcus(Streptococcus agalactiae or GBS),1 the capsular polysaccharide is a major virulence factor as well as a target for protective immunity. Therefore, considerable attention has focused on characterization of the molecular basis for polysaccharide production. Beginning with the identification of the GBS type III capsule locus over a decade ago (1Rubens C.E. Wessels M.R. Heggen L.M. Kasper D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7208-7212Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), rapid progress has been made in uncovering the genetic and biochemical basis for capsular polysaccharide expression in the streptococci. A common theme that has emerged among encapsulated Gram-negative bacteria is that the capsule locus consists of a region encoding polysaccharide-specific genes required for polysaccharide repeating unit biosynthesis flanked by groups of genes involved in broadly conserved functions such as transport and regulation (2Vimr E. Steenbergen S. Cieslewicz M. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, the capsule gene region of several polysaccharide-producing streptococci consists of a group of polysaccharide-specific genes encoding glycosyltransferases and polymerases as well as an adjacent group of genes that is conserved among several species (3Kolkman M.A.B. van der Zeijst B.A.M.

The genetic locus for the synthesis of the type Ia GBS capsule includes at least 16 open reading frames and is predicted to contain two promoters (6Yamamoto S. Miyake K. Koike Y. Watanabe M. Machida Y. Ohta M. Iijima S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5176-5184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One promoter region is upstream of the first gene, cpsIaA (Fig. 1) (6Yamamoto S. Miyake K. Koike Y. Watanabe M. Machida Y. Ohta M. Iijima S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5176-5184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR and primer extension analysis suggested that a second promoter lies between cpsIaD and cpsIaE (Fig. 1) (6Yamamoto S. Miyake K. Koike Y. Watanabe M. Machida Y. Ohta M. Iijima S. J.

On the basis of DNA sequence analysis and enzymatic assays of gene products in E. coli, functions have been assigned to many of the genes in the cluster. cpsIaE, cpsIaG, cpsIaI, and cpsIaJ appear to encode all of the specific glycosyltransferases required for biosynthesis of the type Ia polysaccharide repeating unit with the exception of the sialyltransferase, which has not yet been identified (6Yamamoto S.

Margot P. Soldo B. Karamata D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1946-1961Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Proteins encoded by homologs of cpsC and cpsD have been implicated in chain length regulation of exopolysaccharide production in R. meliloti and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Escherichia coli (21Batchelor R.A. Haraguchi G.E. Hull R.A. Hull S.I. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Becker A. Niehaus K. Puhler A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A recent report by Morona et al. (23Morona J.D. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) provided the first experimental evidence for the function of these four conserved genes in polysaccharide-producing streptococci. Nonpolar deletion mutations in any of the four genes reduced capsule production by S. pneumoniae type 19f (23Morona J.D. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CpsD was shown to be an autophosphorylating protein-tyrosine kinase, similar to Wzc in E. coli, whose phosphorylation state influences polysaccharide production (23Morona J.D. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CpsC and -B appeared to influence phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively, of CpsD (23Morona J.D. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the construction and characterization of nonpolar deletion mutants in cpsIaA, cpsIaB,cpsIaC, cpsIaD, and cpsIaE in type Ia GBS. Analysis of the mutants and their purified capsular polysaccharides provided experimental evidence for the involvement of each gene in polysaccharide elongation, export, or regulation. In addition, our data specifically identify CpsIaA as an activator of capsule gene transcription and demonstrate that CpsIaC and CpsIaD both control polysaccharide chain length. Type Ia GBS strain 515 was used as the parent strain for all mutants constructed in this report (24Wessels M.R. Paoletti L.C. Rodewald A.K. Michon F. DiFabio J. Jennings H.J. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4760-4766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GBS was grown in liquid culture in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco) supplemented with yeast extract to 0.5% (w/v) (Todd-Hewitt-yeast), on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood (Becton-Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD), or on Todd-Hewitt-yeast agar plates supplemented with antibiotics and 5% defibrinated sheep blood (PML Microbiologicals, Tulatin, OR). For continuous culture experiments, GBS was grown in a chemically defined medium as described (25Paoletti L.C. Ross R.A. Johnson K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 64: 1220-1226Google Scholar) except that glycine was not added, NaOH was added at 0.4 g/liter, and 7 g/liter of Casitone (Difco) was substituted for the amino acid mix. E. coli strain DH5α MCR (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for cloning and was grown in Luria-Bertani medium or on Luria-Bertani agar. When appropriate, the medium was supplemented with ampicillin at 100 μg/ml or with erythromycin (erm) at 1 μg/ml for GBS or 250 μg/ml for E. coli. GBS was grown either without shaking in liquid culture or in continuous culture as described previously (25Paoletti L.C. Ross R.A. Johnson K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 64: 1220-1226Google Scholar). E. coli was grown with shaking at 37 °C. Plasmid pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) is an E. coli vector used for the direct cloning of PCR products; pJRS233 is a temperature-sensitive E. coli/Gram-positive shuttle vector (26Perez-Casal J. Price J.A. Maguin E. Scott J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). pWKS30 is a low copy number cloning vector encoding ampicillin resistance (27Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated using either the Qiagen midiprep or miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. GBS chromosomal DNA was prepared as described (28O'Connor S.P. Cleary P.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1987; 156: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Restriction endonuclease digestions, DNA ligations, transformation of CaCl2-competent E. coli, agarose gel electrophoresis, and Southern hybridizations (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed using standard techniques (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). GBS electrocompetent cells were prepared as described (30Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 556-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and transformed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) as described (31Albertı́ S. Ashbaugh C.D. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For cpsIaA deletion construction, primers 275 and 276 (TableI) were used to amplify by PCR the first 126 bp of cpsIaA and 736 bp of adjacent upstream flanking sequence using GBS strain 515 chromosomal DNA as template. Primers 267 and 277 (Table I) were used to amplify the last 104 bp of cpsIaA and 1535 bp of downstream flanking DNA. Primer 277 contains 18 bp of DNA that is complementary to the sequence in primer 276. The two gel-purified PCR products containing complementary ends were mixed and amplified with primers 275 and 267 to create a 1100-bp internal deletion of cpsIaA by overlap PCR (32Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.D. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar, 33Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.D. Pease L.R.

Open table in a new tab A deletion mutant in cpsIaB was constructed as above, except that primer pairs 280 and 314 (Table I) were used to amplify the 5′-terminal 100 and 900 bp of adjacent upstream flanking DNA. Primers 284–315 (Table I) were used to amplify the 3′-terminal 100 and 900 bp of downstream flanking DNA, with primer 284 containing 26 bp of DNA that is complementary to primer 280. The cpsIaBamplification products were used in an overlap PCR with primers 314 and 315 to introduce a 500-bp deletion of cpsIaB. The 2200-bp overlap PCR product was digested with BamHI and PstI and ligated into BamHI/PstI-digested pJRS233. To construct a cpsIaC deletion, primers 252 and 253 (TableI) were used to amplify a 1900-bp fragment containing the coding sequences for cpsIaC and 600 bp of upstream and downstream flanking DNA. The cpsIaC amplification product was ligated into pGEM-T, and an internal 200-bp fragment of cpsIaC was released by digesting with XbaI and EcoRV. The 5′ overhangs were filled in using the large fragment of DNA polymerase 1 (Klenow) to create blunt ends. The plasmid was then religated to create an internal cpsIaC deletion. The 1600-bp fragment containing the cpsIaC deletion and flanking sequences was released from pGEM-T by digestion with BamHI and KpnI and ligated into BamHI/KpnI-digested pJRS233. An internal deletion of cpsIaD was constructed as described for cpsIaA and cpsIaB except that primer pairs 254 and 273 and 257 and 274 (Table I) were used to amplify the flanking PCR products, and primers 254 and 257 were used for the overlap extension reaction. The overlap amplification product was digested with BamHI and KpnI and ligated into BamHI/KpnI-digested pJRS233. For construction of an internal deletion of cpsIaE, primers 119 and 121(Table I) were used to amplify a 1900-bp fragment containing the complete coding sequence of cpsIaE. The amplification product was digested with BglII and EcoRI to remove all but the first 100 bp of cpsE and 600 bp of upstream flanking DNA. This fragment was ligated into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pWKS30 to produce pWKS30-cpsIaE containing a BamHI site at the 5′-end of the insert and an EcoRI site at the 3′-end of the insert. Primers 190 and 191 (Table I) were used to amplify a 670-bp fragment containing the last 570 bp of cpsIaE and 100 bp of downstream flanking DNA. The amplification product of the 3′-end of cpsIaE was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into EcoRI/HindIII-digested pWKS30-cpsIaEto create a 360-bp internal deletion of cpsIaE. The fragment including the cpsIaE deletion and flanking DNA was released from pWKS30-cpsIaEΔ by digestion with HindIII and XbaI and was ligated into HindIII/XbaI-digested pJRS233. Each of the cps deletion constructs in the temperature-sensitive shuttle vector pJRS233 was introduced into GBS strain 515 by electroporation, and transformants were selected by growth at 30 °C in the presence of erm. A single erm-resistant colony was used to inoculate a liquid culture supplemented with erm. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, the culture was diluted 10-fold with fresh broth containing erm and incubated at 37 °C to select organisms in which the recombinant plasmid had integrated in the cps locus of the GBS chromosome by homologous recombination (Fig.2). Dilutions of each culture were plated on medium containing erm and incubated overnight; erm-resistant colonies representing plasmid integrants were serially passaged twice on solid medium at 37 °C. Integrant strains were serially passaged at least five times in broth at 30 °C in the absence of erm; excision of the plasmid from the chromosome via a second recombination event either completed the allelic exchange or reconstituted the wild-type genotype (Fig. 2). erm-sensitive colonies were screened for the expected deletion mutation by PCR amplification using primer pairs that flank the target gene. Candidate deletion mutants were characterized by Southern hybridization analysis of HindIII-digested chromosomal DNA probed with the target gene to confirm the expected internal deletion and with pJRS233 to confirm loss of plasmid sequences from the mutant strain. For immunoblot analysis to assess type Ia polysaccharide production by potential cps deletion mutants, bacterial colonies were lifted onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell), fixed in 70% ethanol for 5 min, and blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma) (PBS-Tween). Filters were washed with PBS-Tween between subsequent steps. Type Ia polysaccharide was detected using rabbit antiserum evoked by immunization with GBS type Ia polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid (Ia-TT antiserum) (24Wessels M.R. Paoletti L.C. Rodewald A.K. Michon F. DiFabio J. Jennings H.J. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4760-4766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antiserum has been shown to be highly specific for type Ia GBS polysaccharide; it binds less well to the closely related type Ib polysaccharide but does not recognize type II or III GBS polysaccharides (24Wessels M.R. Paoletti L.C. Rodewald A.K. Michon F. DiFabio J. Jennings H.J. Kasper D.L. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4760-4766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were incubated with Ia-TT antiserum diluted 1:3000 in PBS-Tween, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (ICN/Cappel, Costa Mesa, CA) diluted 1:1000 in PBS-Tween and 5-bromo-4-chloroindolyl-3-phosphate/ nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Competition ELISA was used to quantify type Ia capsular polysaccharide production by mutant strains. Serial dilutions of a mutanolysin extract (see below) of the test strain were mixed with Ia-TT antiserum (final dilution, 1:500,000) in microtiter wells coated with type Ia polysaccharide conjugated to human serum albumin. The remainder of the ELISA procedure was performed as described (34Guttormsen H.-K. Baker C.J. Edwards M.S. Paoletti L.C. Kasper D.L. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 173: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Type Ia polysaccharide and group B carbohydrate were detected in chromatography column fractions by double diffusion in agarose using Ia-TT antiserum and antisera to group B carbohydrate, respectively (35Ouchterlony O. Prog. Allergy. 1958; 5: 1-78PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of cell-associated capsular polysaccharide produced by mutant strains, cells from a 100-ml overnight culture were washed in PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of protoplast buffer (30 mmNaHPO4, 40% sucrose (w/v), 10 mmMgCl2). Capsular polysaccharide was released from the cells by the addition of 1000 units of mutanolysin (Sigma). After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the protoplasts were removed by centrifugation at 3800 × g for 15 min. The amount of type Ia polysaccharide in the extract was determined using serial dilutions of the extract in a competition ELISA by comparison with a standard curve generated with purified type Ia capsular polysaccharide as described above. GBS wild-type strain 515 and mutant strains were grown in continuous culture as described (25Paoletti L.C. Ross R.A. Johnson K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 64: 1220-1226Google Scholar). Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS, and the capsular polysaccharide was extracted from the cell pellets by shaking at 37 °C for 30 h with 0.25n NaOH. Cell extracts were neutralized with HCl and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min. After dialysis, extracts were filtered sterile and lyophilized. Each sample was resuspended in 30 ml of 69 mm sodium borate, and the pH was raised to greater than 10 by the addition of 10n NaOH. The polysaccharide was reacetylated by the addition of 1.8 ml of acetic anhydride at room temperature; pH was maintained at 10 or higher by the addition of 10 N NaOH. The mixture was stirred for 2 h, neutralized with HCl, dialyzed, filtered sterile, and lyophilized. Samples were dissolved in 20 ml of enzyme treatment buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated with DNase (1 mg) and RNase (5 mg) overnight at 37 °C. Samples were incubated with Pronase (2 mg) at 37 °C overnight, dialyzed, and lyophilized. Polysaccharide samples were dissolved in water at a concentration of 25 mg/ml and purified by gel filtration chromatography on a 5 × 100-cm column of Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with PBS as eluant. Column fractions were screened for the presence of type Ia capsular polysaccharide and for group B carbohydrate by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion as described above. If necessary, capsular polysaccharides were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a column of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and eluted with a 0–0.4m NaCl gradient. Fractions were assayed as above. Samples were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography using a gradient system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector (model PAD2) and a pellicular anion exchange column (PA-1; 4 × 250 mm). The detector sensitivity was set at 300 nA with a 0.05-V applied pulse potential. Samples were hydrolyzed with 0.5 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 18 h for analysis of neutral and amino sugars. After the removal of trifluoroacetic acid by repeated evaporation in water, hydrolyzed samples were applied through a microinjection valve with a 50-μl loop. Neutral sugars were eluted with 20 mm sodium hydroxide at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For detection of sialic acid, samples were treated with 6% acetic acid at 80 °C for 2 h. After removal of acetic acid by repeated evaporation in water, samples were dissolved in water, applied to the column as above, and eluted with 90 mm sodium acetate and 100 mm sodium hydroxide. Purified polysaccharide samples were dissolved in deuterium oxide at a concentration of 3 mg/ml and subjected to1H NMR analysis on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) with a frequency of 500 MHz. Spectra generated by each sample at 60 °C were recorded with chemical shifts referenced relative to water resonance at 4.42 ppm. Water resonance was calibrated externally using dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate as the standard. Purified capsular polysaccharide was analyzed by gel filtration FPLC on a column of Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in PBS. Samples were eluted in the same buffer at a fl"
https://openalex.org/W2081902497,"In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that augmented [Ca(2+)] in subcellular regions or organelles, which are known to play a key role in cell survival, is the missing link between Ca(2+) homeostasis alterations and muscular degeneration associated with muscular dystrophy. To this end, different targeted chimeras of the Ca(2+)-sensitive photoprotein aequorin have been transiently expressed in subcellular compartments of skeletal myotubes of mdx mice, the animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Direct measurements of the [Ca(2+)] in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, [Ca(2+)](sr), show a higher steady state level at rest and a larger drop after KCl-induced depolarization in mdx compared with control myotubes. The peaks in [Ca(2+)] occurring in the mitochondrial matrix of mdx myotubes are significantly larger than in controls upon KCl-induced depolarization or caffeine application. The augmented response of mitochondria precedes the alterations in the Ca(2+) responses of the cytosol and of the cytoplasmic region beneath the membrane, which become significant only at a later stage of myotube differentiation. Taking into account the key role played by mitochondria Ca(2+) handling in the control of cell death, our data suggest that mitochondria are potential targets of impaired Ca(2+) homeostasis in muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1628357539,"The human genome sequence will provide a reference for measuring DNA sequence variation in human populations. Sequence variants are responsible for the genetic component of individuality, including complex characteristics such as disease susceptibility and drug response. Most sequence variants are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), where two alternate bases occur at one position1,2,3. Comparison of any two genomes reveals around 1 SNP per kilobase1,3. A sufficiently dense map of SNPs would allow the detection of sequence variants responsible for particular characteristics on the basis that they are associated with a specific SNP allele4,5,6. Here we have evaluated large-scale sequencing approaches to obtaining SNPs, and have constructed a map of 2,730 SNPs on human chromosome 22. Most of the SNPs are within 25 kilobases of a transcribed exon, and are valuable for association studies. We have scaled up the process, detecting over 65,000 SNPs in the genome as part of The SNP Consortium programme, which is on target to build a map of 1 SNP every 5 kilobases that is integrated with the human genome sequence and that is freely available in the public domain."
https://openalex.org/W2045859951,"DP178, a synthetic peptide corresponding to a segment of the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein (gp41) of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), is a potent inhibitor of viral infection and virus-mediated cell-cell fusion. Nevertheless, DP178 does not contain gp41 coiled-coil cavity binding residues postulated to be essential for inhibiting HIV-1 entry. We find that DP178 inhibits phospholipid redistribution mediated by the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein at a concentration 8 times greater than that of solute redistribution (the IC50 values are 43 and 335 nm, respectively). In contrast, C34, a synthetic peptide which overlaps with DP178 but contains the cavity binding residues, did not show this phenomenon (11 and 25 nm, respectively). The ability of DP178 to inhibit membrane fusion at a post-lipid mixing stage correlates with its ability to bind and oligomerize on the surface of membranes. Furthermore, our results are consistent with a model in which DP178 inhibits the formation of gp41 viral hairpin structure at low affinity, whereas C34 inhibits its formation at high affinity: the failure to form the viral hairpin prevents both lipid and solute from redistributing between cells. However, our data also suggest an additional membrane-bound inhibitory site for DP178 in the ectodomain of gp41 within a region immediately adjacent to the membrane-spanning domain.

The indispensability of the fusion peptide for viral infection was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (16Delahunty M.D. Rhee I. Freed E.O. Bonifacino J.S.

Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Specifically, peptides corresponding to these sequences co-crystallized as a six-helix bundle in which the N- and C-helices are arranged in a three-hairpin structure (19Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M.

Three N peptides form a coiled-coil, and the C peptides are packed in an antiparallel manner into highly conserved, hydrophobic grooves on the surface of the coiled-coil. Recently, the solution and crystal structures of the ectodomain of the Simian immunodeficiency virus gp41, consisting of those two helices as well as the loop connecting them, confirmed the interplay of the N- and C-helices (22Caffrey M.

Remarkably, DP178 blocks cell fusion and viral entry at a concentration of less than 2 ng/ml in vitro and was reported to be a promising drug for treating HIV-1-infected humans (34Kilby J.M.

In essence, this means finding the stage at which DP178 inhibits the formation of the fusion-active conformation of gp41. It was suggested that the antiviral mode of action of DP178 involves interaction with the gp41 leucine/isoleucine zipper motif (38Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 39Chen C.-H. Matthews T.J. McDanal C.B. Bolognesi D.P. Greenberg M.L. J.

However, DP178 (residues 638–673) does not contain the residues (Trp-628, Trp-631, and Ile-635) that were shown to be crucial for binding the prominent cavity in the coiled coil of gp41 (59Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Weiss and colleagues (42Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DP178 binds gp41 and inhibits envelope-mediated membrane fusion only after gp120 interacts with cellular receptors. It is currently accepted that DP178 binds to the gp41 leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence before the hairpin structure is formed (43Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 44Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Calder L.J. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Membr.

Biol. 2000; 295: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), thus preventing the HIV envelope glycoprotein from adopting a fusogenic conformation. This model is supported by the results of Blumenthal and co-workers (6Jones P.L. Korte T. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 46Muñoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), suggesting that the pre-hairpin intermediate stage appears to be induced rapidly upon interaction of gp120 with CD4 and the co-receptor, but is then relatively stable for several minutes, allowing DP178 to interact with the exposed leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence.However, DP178 was reported to inhibit redistribution of lipid and aqueous dyes as a result of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion with significantly different values of IC50 (46Muñoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Binding of DP178 to the leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence in the pre-hairpin intermediate should inhibit both lipid and aqueous redistribution, suggesting the existence of two target sites for inhibition by DP178. In an attempt to identify an additional target site for inhibition by DP178, we investigated potential interactions of DP178 with the membrane, and with the leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence within the membrane. We find that DP178 binds to the membrane and oligomerizes within, but does not interact with the leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence within the membrane. We suggest that by binding to its corresponding segment in gp41, DP178 inhibits fusion pore formation.DISCUSSIONThe striking similarities between structural motifs in various viral envelope glycoproteins led to the notion that the native conformation of gp41 is metastable and it is stabilized by gp120 (63Weissenhorn W. Wharton S.A. Calder L.J. Earl P.L. Moss B. Aliprandis E. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Upon binding of gp120 to its receptors, gp41 is free to form the more energetically favorable hairpin structure (Fig.6, a-c). The gp41 ectodomain core is a six-helix bundle composed of three helical hairpins, each consisting of an N-helix paired with an antiparallel C helix. The N-helices form an interior, trimeric coiled coil with three conserved, hydrophobic grooves; a C-helix packs into each of these grooves. This structure is believed to correspond to the core of the fusion-active state of gp41 and shows similarity to the proposed fusogenic structures of envelope fusion proteins from influenza (64Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar), Moloney murine leukemia virus (65Fass D. Kim P.S. Curr.

Synthetic C peptides (peptides corresponding to the C-helix), such as DP178 and C34, potently inhibit membrane fusion by both laboratory adapted strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 (33Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The structural features of the gp41 core suggest that an intermediate, in which the leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence is not associated with the C-heptad repeat, exists before the formation of the hairpin structure, and is the target for inhibition by C-peptides (43Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 44Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Calder L.J. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Membr.

However, no direct evidence for the existence of this pre-hairpin intermediate exists, and an alternative for the mechanism of inhibition exerted by the C-peptides, based on the observed monomer-trimer equilibrium of the simian immunodeficiency virus gp41 has been postulated (22Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Covell D.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 70Caffrey M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1904-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). According to the alternative model, gp41 exists in equilibrium between monomer and trimer. In the presence of excess inhibitory peptide, the equilibrium is driven from homotrimeric gp41 to a heterotrimer of gp41 and C-peptide. Since the peptides are only effective upon gp120 dissociation (42Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), it follows that the absence of fusogenic activity displayed by the gp41-peptide heterotrimers is due to the fact that the heterotrimers can no longer present a sufficient number of fusion peptides to the target membrane for effective fusion to take place. Another explanation could be that the homotrimer structure is required for further oligomerization. The data also suggest that the homotrimeric state is stabilized by gp120 such that heterotrimers (which would be expected to bind less tightly to gp120 since they do not possess a trimeric loop structure) cannot be formed in the presence of bound gp120 (42Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Anyway, the peptides act through a dominant-negative mechanism, in which exogenous C peptides bind to the leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence (N-helix) of gp41 and block further conformational changes needed for fusion.Figure 6DP178 inhibits HIV-1 entry at two different stages. The upper panel is based on the existence of the pre-hairpin intermediate as suggested by Kim, Wiley, and colleagues (43Chan D.C. Kim P.S.

Subsequently, the leucine/isoleucine zipper (light blue) and the C-terminal amphipathic sequences (blue) form the three-hairpin conformation (c). Binding of DP178 to the leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence can block this step (43Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 44Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Calder L.J. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Membr.

The resulting proximity of the viral and the cellular membranes within a limited area may allow lipid redistribution. Subsequent steps, not all of them defined, result in fusion between the viral and the cellular membranes. Among these steps, several membrane-bound gp41 oligomeric units interact to form a fusion pore. This step is blocked when DP178 peptide binds to the membrane-bound state of the DP178 region in gp41.The lower panel is based on the existence of a monomer-trimer equilibrium of gp41 ectodomain as suggested by Clore and colleagues (22Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Covell D.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 70Caffrey M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1904-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar): I, native state of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. Upon binding of gp120 (green) to cellular receptors (not included in the figure), shedding of gp120 and a conformational change in gp41 is induced. It is not known whether the result is the three-hairpin conformation (IIa), or a monomeric hairpin conformation (IIb) that will then trimerize. The resulting proximity of the viral and the cellular membranes within a limited area may allow lipid redistribution. Binding of DP178 to the monomeric form shifts this equilibrium toward the monomer. Subsequent steps, not all of them defined, result in fusion between the viral and the cellular membranes. Among these steps, several membrane-bound gp41 oligomeric units interact to form a fusion pore. This step is blocked when DP178 binds to the membrane-bound state of the gp41 segment that has a sequence identical to DP178.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Within each coiled-coil interface is a deep cavity, formed by a cluster of residues in the N-helix coiled coil that has been proposed to be an attractive target for the development of antiviral compounds. Chan et al. (59Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) showed that the inhibitory activity of the C-peptide C34 depends on its ability to bind to this coiled coil cavity. Moreover, examining a series of C34 peptide variants with modified cavity-binding residues, they observed a linear relationship between the logarithm of the inhibitory potency and the stability of the corresponding helical-hairpin complexes. A single mutation in the C34 peptide from Trp-631 → Gly increased the IC50 for cell fusion by about two log units. Reported inhibitory concentrations of DP178 and C34 appear to be quite similar (we find that the IC50 for solute mixing is about 4-fold higher for DP178 as compared with C34). Since DP178 lacks all three residues from the C helix (Trp-628, Trp-631, and Ile-635) which insert into the cavity, we would expect the IC50 to be at least 2 orders of magnitude higher for DP178.This conundrum has led us to postulate that there are two targets for inhibition by DP178: (i) DP178 inhibits the formation of the heterotrimeric coiled coil by interacting with the leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence in the aqueous solution; (ii) fusion pore formation is inhibited by the interaction of DP178 with the membrane-bound state of its corresponding sequence in gp41 which will enhance melting of the coiled coil soluble form. Accordingly, a mutagenesis study, which revealed that the tryptophan-rich region (overlaps with DP178, see Fig.1) must function in proximity to the membrane (71Muñoz-Barroso I. Salzwedel K. Hunter E. Blumenthal R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6089-6092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Salzwedel K. West J.T. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2469-2480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) support the notion that this region binds to the surface of the membrane. For clarity, it is worth noting that three segments in the cytoplasmic tail of gp41 may associate with the membrane (48Kliger Y. Shai Y.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13390-13397Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and our results suggest that segments in the ectodomain bind to the membrane. These studies suggest that segments both upstream and downstream of the transmembrane domain of HIV-1 gp41 associate with the membrane.Our results are consistent with the notion that C34 inhibits HIV-1-induced membrane fusion by blocking heterotrimeric coiled coil formation only. The relative low affinity of C34 to the membrane (Figs.3 and 4) does not allow it to interfere with steps that occur within the membrane. DP178 interacts with this leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence when in aqueous environment (38Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 45Kliger Y. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but this interaction cannot take place in the membrane environment (Fig. 5, open squares and open circles). On the other hand, DP178, which was found to be monomeric in aqueous solution when its concentration was less than 10 μm (38Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), forms oligomers even at 100 times lower concentration in the membrane (Fig. 5,filled squares). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that an increase in its membrane local concentration might shift gp41 closed heterotrimeric (soluble)-gp41 open bundle (membrane-bound) equilibrium toward the closed bundle soluble form. In other words, DP178 can prevent melting of the heterotrimeric hairpin complex. The fact that DP107 (a shifted version of N36) inhibited (although at higher concentrations) HIV-1-mediated cell fusion with no differences between lipid and aqueous dye redistribution (46Muñoz-Barroso I. Durell S. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Blumenthal R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) may be correlated with its inability to interact with the membrane-bound state of the segment corresponding to DP178.In the case of influenza hemagglutinin-mediated fusion, Chernomordik and co-workers (82Chernomordik L.V. Frolov V.A. Leikina E. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) have shown that at reduced envelope glycoprotein surface density there is more hemi-fusion than full fusion. In the presence of different concentrations of peptide, the effective surface density of envelope glycoprotein is reduced, giving rise to different extents of hemi-fusion as compared with full fusion. This explains the 2-fold difference between inhibition of lipid and aqueous redistribution by C34 (Fig. 2 a). However, the striking difference between inhibition of lipid versus content mixing in the case of DP178 (Fig. 2 b) leads us to propose the following mode of inhibition by DP178 (see Fig. 6).The binding of DP178 to the leucine/isoleucine zipper sequence (light blue) at an intermediate stage (Fig. 6, upper panel, b; lower panel, IIb) inhibits the formation of the heterotrimeric coiled coil. How the binding of DP178 to the membrane-bound state of its corresponding segment in gp41 actually inhibits pore formation remains an open question. We can speculate that by binding to its corresponding segment in the membrane, DP178 prevents, by a dominant negative manner, further oligomerization of gp41. This possibility implicates the presence of another intermediate in the fusion reaction that takes place after the formation of the heterotrimeric coiled coil, but before the formation of the fusion pore. Indeed, it is believed that the recruitment of several oligomeric units of the fusion proteins is needed for complete fusion to occur (83Spruce A.E. Iwata A. Almers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It determines cell fate and regulates fundamental cellular functions in response to a wide range of extracellular stimuli (1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 2Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H.

This cascade plays an essential role in diverse intracellular signaling processes including cell growth, cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The MAP kinase cascade consists of three distinct protein kinase families, including MAP kinase, MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK). MAPKKK activates MAPKK, which in turn activates MAP kinase. The MAP kinase superfamily consists of the classical MAP kinase (extracellular signal-regulating kinase, ERK) family, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, also known as stress-activated protein kinase; SAPK) family, and the p38 MAP kinase family. Each MAP kinase family is activated by different stimuli via distinct upstream kinases and controls many aspects of cellular physiology. ASK1 was identified as a MAPKKK involved in the stress-induced apoptosis-signaling cascade that activates the SEK1-JNK and MKK3/MKK6-p38 MAP kinase cascades (5Ichijo H. Nishida E.

In addition to stresses, Daxx, a Fas adapter protein, and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 activate ASK1 (6Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 282: 1860-1863Crossref Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 7Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role of ASK1 in the Fas- and TNF receptor-mediated signaling cascades. Moreover, the ASK1/JNK cascade phosphorylates and inactivates antiapoptotic Bcl-2 (8Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The epidermis is a self-renewing tissue maintained by the precise regulation of keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Differentiation is one of the most important ways by which keratinocytes form a multilayered epidermis, and the MAP kinase cascade may be integrated into this process. The ASK1 p38 MAP kinase cascade is a candidate pathway as the regulator. To prove this, the constitutively active form ASK1 (N terminus-deleted mutant, ASK1-ΔN) was introduced into cultured normal human keratinocytes using adenovirus vector (Ad). Normal human keratinocytes were cultured with MCDB153 medium supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (5 × 10−7m), ethanolamine (0.1 mm), phosphoethanolamine (0.1 mm), bovine hypothalamic extract (100 μg/ml), and Ca2+ (0.1 mm) as described previously (9Sayama K. Shirakata Y. Midorikawa K. Hanakawa Y. Hashimoto K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The analysis was performed as described previously (9Sayama K. Shirakata Y. Midorikawa K. Hanakawa Y. Hashimoto K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using a Vistra ECF kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit anti-human involucrin (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), monoclonal anti-p21 Cip1/WAF1 (6B6, PharMingen Co., San Diego, CA), and rabbit anti-ASK1 (DAV, Ref.10Tobiume K. Inage T.

The intensity of each band was quantified with ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics Inc.), referring to the control signal as one unit. Total RNA was prepared using Isogen (Nippon Gene Co., Tokyo, Japan). Ten μg of total RNA were separated in a 1.2% formaldehyde/agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with 32P-labeled cDNA corresponding to transglutaminase-1 (11Yamanishi K. Liew F.M. Konishi K. Yasuno H. Doi H. Hirano J. Fukushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal standard. The epidermis was separated from normal human skin by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline at 60 °C for 1 min, immediately followed by immersion in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Total RNA was prepared with Isogen and treated with 50 units/ml DNase 1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) at 37 °C for 30 min. Specific primers for ASK1 was produced by selecting specific nucleotide sequences from previously published sequences (5Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Tagagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using RT-PCR High Plus (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The sequences of the primer pair, product size, annealing temperature, and number of cycles were as follows: 5′-TGACAGAGTCGTTTTAGGAA-3′ and 3′-ACAAGCAAGTCGTTAGCACA-5′, 759 base pairs, 57 °C, and 25 cycles. The PCR products were sequenced to confirm the mRNA expression. Analysis was performed using the multi-probe RNase protection assay system (PharMingen Co.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotide probes were prepared by inserting the PCR-amplified human cDNA corresponding to oligonucleotides 2659–2874 of ASK1 (GenbankTM/EBI accession number D84476), 866–1133 of transglutaminase-1 (GenbankTM/EBI accession number D90287), 966–1176 of loricrin (GenbankTM/EBI accession number M61120), and 74–249 of involucrin (GenbankTM/EBI accession number M13903) into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pPMG vector. 5 μg of total RNA were hybridized with 32P-labeled riboprobe and digested with RNase. The hybridization products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel and exposed to film. GAPDH is shown as an internal standard. The intensity of each band was quantified using NIH Image, referring to the signal of the control as one unit. A reporter plasmid containing the involucrin promoter and firefly luciferase was constructed (pINV-Luc) as follows. The involucrin promoter cassette was a generous gift from Dr. Taichman (12Carroll J.M. Albers K.M. Garlick J.A. Harrington R. Taichman L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The coding region of firefly luciferase was digested from pGL3 basic (Promega Co., Madison, WI) and subcloned into the involucrin promoter cassette. The correct insertion and orientation were confirmed by sequencing. To normalize the transfection efficiency, a plasmid containing Renilla luciferase driven by herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK Promega Co.) was included in the assay. The reporter plasmids were introduced into the keratinocytes using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In each transfection, 1 μg of pINV-Luc and 0.5 μg of pRL-TK were introduced into 2 × 105 keratinocytes in 6-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were infected with the indicated Ad at an MOI of 5 and were incubated for an additional 24 h. Then the cells were harvested with 250 μl of lysis buffer (Promega Co.), and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Co.) with a luminometer (Luminescencer JNR AB-2100; Atto Co., Osaka, Japan). Transfection was performed in triplicate. The relative luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing to the Renilla luciferase activity. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. MAP kinase activity was measured with JNK and p38 kinase assay kits (BioLabs Inc., Beverly, MA). The lysate of 1 × 106 keratinocytes was immunoprecipitated with a 1:100 dilution of rabbit antibody to p38 MAP kinase and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting immunoprecipitate was then incubated with ATF-2 fusion protein at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 200 μm ATP. JNK was precipitated from the cell lysates with c-Jun fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 100 μmATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr-71 and c-Jun at Ser-63 was detected by Western blotting using a 1:100 dilution of phosphospecific ATF-2 or c-Jun. To show that equal amounts of JNK and p38 MAP kinase were precipitated, the beads were incubated with SDS sample buffer at 97 °C for 3 min and then subjected to Western blot analysis using a 1:1000 dilution of antibody to JNK and p38 MAP kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The immune complex-coupled kinase assay has been described previously (7Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed in the lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5% aprotinin. The lysates of 1 × 106 cells were immunoprecipitated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-ASK1 (DAV, Ref. 10Tobiume K. Inage T. Takeda K. Enomoto S. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) using protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed with washing buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and was subjected to kinase assay. GST·MKK6 (0.2 μg) was first incubated with the immune complex for 10 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 10 μl in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP. Thereafter, the activated complex was incubated with 0.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST·p38γKNin the same solution (final volume 20 μl) for 10 min at room temperature. Kinase reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Phosphorylation of GST·p38γKN was analyzed using a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. Involucrin-positive cells were analyzed with a cell sorter. Keratinocytes were harvested from the dishes with trypsin and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 8 min with methanol at −20 °C for 4 min and then with acetone at −20 °C for 2 min (13Okumura H. Matsumto K. Hashimoto K. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After washing with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Tween 20, the cells were reacted with a 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-human involucrin antibody (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.) and a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. The labeled cells were analyzed with a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Co.). The cell cycle distribution was analyzed using a CycleTEST™ PLUS DNA reagent kit (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclei isolated by trypsinization were stained with propidium iodide and then run on a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Co.). Apoptotic cells were stained on chamber slides with an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X in sodium citrate, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-labeled nucleotides and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescent specimens were observed by fluorescence microscopy. BrdUrd incorporation was assessed with a cell proliferation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with BrdUrd in thymidine-free culture medium for 60 min at 37 °C. BrdUrd incorporated into cellular DNA was stained with monoclonal anti-BrdUrd diluted 1:100, peroxidase anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:70, and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Two hundred cells were counted in randomly selected fields to quantify the positive cells. Each experiment was repeated three times. Paraffin-embedded normal human skin sections were stained immunohistochemically with rabbit anti-ASK1 (DAV, Ref. 10Tobiume K. Inage T. Takeda K. Enomoto S. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; diluted 1:1000) and normal rabbit IgG, using a streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase staining kit (Nichirei Co. Inc., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SB202190, SB202474, and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem International Co. (San Diego, CA), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at 2 mm and stored at −20 °C. Ad carrying ASK1-ΔN (Ad-ASK1-ΔN) was constructed as described previously (14Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). In this study, Ad expressing a bacterial β-galactosidase gene (Ad-β-gal) and no exogenous gene (Ad-1W) were used as controls to exclude the effect of Ad itself. Gene expression was found in almost all of the keratinocytes with Ad (data not shown). We infected normal human keratinocytes with Ad-ASK1-ΔN or control Ad at an MOI of 5 or 50. As expected from our previous reports, infection of Ad-ASK1-ΔN but not Ad-β-gal at a higher MOI (50) strongly induced apoptosis as determined by morphology and TUNEL staining (Fig.1). Surprisingly however, infection of Ad-ASK1-ΔN at a lower level (MOI of 5) induced dramatic morphological changes without any sign of apoptotic phenotypes. The cells became enlarged and flattened, showing a differentiated phenotype 48 h after infection with Ad-ASK1-ΔN. There were no morphological changes in keratinocytes infected with Ad-β-gal and Ad-1W at an MOI of 5 compared with no-vector (data not shown). Because, the morphology is apparently different from apoptotic cells, and the TUNEL staining was negative, we conclude that the morphological change induced by the infection of Ad-ASK1-ΔN at an MOI of 5 is not apoptosis. In the following experiments, keratinocytes were infected with Ad at an MOI of 5. In addition to the morphological changes, ASK1-ΔN expression induced differentiation markers including involucrin protein and transglutaminase-1 mRNA (Fig.2 A) as seen with 10% FCS, a potent inducer of keratinocyte differentiation (15Pittelkow M.R. Wille Jr J.J. Scott R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 86: 410-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transglutaminase-1 enzymatically cross-links its substrate proteins including involucrin and loricrin, forming a cornified envelope in terminally differentiated keratinocytes (16Thacher S.M. Rice R.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 685-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with three keratinocyte strains (data not shown). To further confirm that Ad-ASK1-ΔN infection at an MOI of 5 induces keratinocyte differentiation, the time course for protein and mRNA expression, the percentage of involucrin-positive cells, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation and the cell cycle were analyzed (Figs. 2 and 3). ASK1-ΔN protein appeared within 3 h of infection with Ad-ASK1-ΔN, reaching a maximum level at 48 h, which lasted until 72 h (Fig. 2 B). The expression of mRNA of differentiation markers including transglutaminase-1, loricrin, and involucrin significantly increased at 24 h (Fig.2 C). The increase of p21 Cip1/WAF1 , the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, occurred 6 h after infection, which was earlier than the transglutaminase-1, loricrin, and involucrin induction (Fig. 2, B and C), and reached a maximum at 24 h. The transient increase of p21 Cip1/WAF1 with differentiation is consistent with a previous report (17Missero C. Di Cunto F. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3065-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 18Di Cunto F. Topley G Calautti E. Hisao J. Ong L. Seth P.K. Dotto G.P. Science. 1998; 280: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); p21 Cip1/WAF1 expression is up-regulated in the early stage of keratinocyte differentiation and then declines in the late stages of differentiation. ASK1-ΔN expression increased the percentage of involucrin-positive cells from 5.5 to 29.1% (Fig. 2 D), which is quite similar to that seen with 10% FCS (13Okumura H. Matsumto K. Hashimoto K. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cell growth is suppressed in differentiated cells. ASK1-ΔN expression suppressed the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells from 38.7 (control) to 13.8% 48 h after the infection (Fig.3 A), indicating that cell growth declined. The cell cycle distribution of the keratinocytes 48 h after Ad infection (Fig. 3 B) indicates that ASK1-ΔN expression causes G0/G1 and G2/M arrest. Differentiated epidermal keratinocytes in vivo are in G0/G1 arrest (19van Erp P.E. Rijzewijk J.J. Boezeman J.B. Leenders J. de Mare S. Schalkwijk J. van de Kerkhof P.C. Ramaekers F.C. Bauer F.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 865-870PubMed Google Scholar). However, in cultured keratinocytes the induction of differentiation by suspension culture and FCS results in G0/G1 and G2/M arrest (15Pittelkow M.R. Wille Jr J.J. Scott R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 86: 410-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our results. G0/G1 and G2/M arrest by differentiation stimuli suggests that in cultured keratinocytes differentiation signals are not restricted to the cell cycle stage. To investigate the role of ASK1 in the regulation of involucrin expression, a luciferase assay was performed. Keratinocytes transfected with an involucrin promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (pINV-Luc) were infected with Ad at an MOI of 5. The reporter activity increased 5.5-fold with Ad-ASK1-ΔN, whereas Ad-β-gal had no effect (Fig.4), suggesting a positive role of ASK1 in the regulation of involucrin expression. All of these data (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) verify that ASK1-ΔN differentiates keratinocytes. ASK1 is a MAPKKK that activates SEK1-JNK and MKK3/MKK6-p38 MAP kinase cascades. Therefore, we examined whether the expression of ASK1-ΔN enhanced the JNK and p38 MAP kinase activities in keratinocytes. The activities of both JNK and p38 MAP kinase started to increase 6–12 h after Ad-ASK1-ΔN infection (Fig.5 A). This increase paralleled the level of ASK1-ΔN protein shown in Fig. 2 A, suggesting that ASK1-ΔN activates the SEK1-JNK and MKK3/MKK6-p38 MAP kinase cascades in keratinocytes. The involvement of p38 MAP kinase in ASK1-ΔN-induced differentiation was shown using p38 MAP kinase inhibitors: SB202190 and SB203580 (Fig.5 B). They significantly reduced the induction levels of transglutaminase-1, loricrin, and involucrin mRNA mediated by ASK1-ΔN but not the negative control SB202474. In SB202190-treated cells, the levels of transglutaminase-1, loricrin, and involucrin mRNA declined to 0.13, 0.02, and 0.38-fold compared with the controls, respectively. Because the inhibitors did not affect the level of ASK1-ΔN protein expression, the suppressive effect of p38 MAP kinase inhibitors on the induction of transglutaminase-1 and involucrin mRNA was caused by the blockade of p38 MAP kinase. Therefore, p38 MAP kinase is necessary for the downstream signal transduction of ASK1-induced differentiation. We next studied whether the induction of differentiation caused ASK1 expression. Inducing differentiation with C2 ceramide, a potent differentiation inducer (22Wakita H. Tokura Y. Yagi H. Nishimura K. Furukawa F. Takigawa M. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), enhanced ASK1 mRNA expression (Fig. 6 A) and activity (Fig.6 B). This experiment was repeated more than three times with essentially identical results. In vivo, normal human epidermis expressed ASK1 mRNA (Fig.7 A). Moreover, an immunohistochemical study revealed that the expression of ASK1 in the upper epidermis paralleled keratinocyte differentiation (Fig.7 B), implicating ASK1 in in vivodifferentiation.Figure 7Expression of ASK1 in vivo.

We propose that the ASK1-p38 MAP kinase cascade is a newly discovered signaling cascade for keratinocyte differentiation. Protein kinase C (PKC) is an intracellular signal transduction molecule that regulates keratinocyte differentiation (20Osada S. Hashimoto Y. Nomura S. Kohno Y. Chida K. Tajima O. Kubo K. Akimoto K.

Activation of PKC isoforms was determined by analyzing the subcellular distribution of PKC isoforms using Western blotting. The redistribution of PKC from the soluble fraction to a particulate fraction is a useful indicator of PKC activation (32Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). However, the expression of ASK1-ΔN did not affect the subcellular distribution of PKCs (data not shown), indicating that PKCs were not activated by ASK1-ΔN. Therefore, PKCs are not localized in the downstream signaling of the ASK1-p38 MAP kinase cascade. A recent study showed that PKC regulates involucrin promoter activity via p38 MAP kinase (33Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) as well as ASK1. Therefore, the ASK1-p38 MAP kinase cascade may cross-talk with the PKC cascade at the level of p38 MAP kinase. NF-κB is another candidate for a molecular regulator of keratinocyte differentiation (34Seitz S.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 35Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S.

Invest. 2000; 105: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The epidermis of mice lacking the inhibitor of κB kinase α (IKKα) shows abnormal differentiation (35Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In normal epidermis, NF-κB is localized in the cytoplasm of basal cells and then translocates to the nucleus in suprabasal cells, suggesting a possible role for commitment to differentiate (34Seitz S.S. Lin Q. Deng H. Khavari P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In contrast to NF-κB, ASK1 protein is found in the upper epidermis and has a different distribution from that of NF-κB. Furthermore, the expression of ASK1-ΔN does not activate NF-κB as analyzed with a gel shift mobility assay (data not shown), indicating that NF-κB is not involved in the ASK1-induced keratinocyte differentiation. One suggested role for NF-κB is that it prevents premature apoptosis before the final step by regulating the expression of the anti-apoptotic molecules TRAF1, TRAF2, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 (37Seitz C.S. Freiberg R.A. Hinata K. Khavari P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ASK1 is an apoptosis inducer and appears in the late stages of differentiation in vivo. Therefore, NF-κB and ASK1 have distinct roles in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation. Although, ASK1 has been identified as an apoptosis inducer (5Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Tagagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar), we have shown that ASK1 induces keratinocyte differentiation. We also found that introducing ASK1 induced apoptosis. However, it required 10-fold higher (MOI of 50) levels of ASK1-ΔN expression than those required for differentiation (MOI of 5). These results suggest that ASK1 has dual physiological functions in keratinocytes; weak or strong activation of ASK1 may lead to differentiation or apoptosis of keratinocytes, respectively. The biological activity of ASK1 depends on the cell type and conditions. In the pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, moderate expression of ASK1-ΔN induces neuronal differentiation and survival rather than apoptosis (38Takeda K. Hatai T. Hamazaki T.S. Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9805-9813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, ASK1 is not only an apoptosis inducer but also mediates a wide range of cellular functions. In continuously self-renewing tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial cells are shed by terminal differentiation and apoptosis. Epidermal keratinocytes also differentiate and are ultimately shed from the epidermis after cell death. However, the morphology of cells dying in terminal differentiation is different from that of cells undergoing pathological apoptosis induced by ultraviolet light and Fas. This physiological cell death is suggested to be a specialized form of apoptosis (39Haake A.R. Polakowska R.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 107-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In ASK1-induced apoptosis, involucrin and transglutaminase-1 are strongly induced before apoptosis (MOI of 50, data not shown), whereas ultraviolet B irradiation does not enhance the expression of transglutaminase-1 mRNA (data not shown). Therefore, the two apoptosis mechanisms are different. Because ASK1 induces apoptosis with differentiation markers, and its expression is localized in the upper epidermis, ASK1 may be involved in the mechanism of apoptosis in terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2020288905,"Cytochrome P-450-dependent hydroxylases are typical enzymes for the modification of basic flavonoid skeletons. We show in this study that CYP71D9 cDNA, previously isolated from elicitor-induced soybean (Glycine max L.) cells, codes for a protein with a novel hydroxylase activity. When heterologously expressed in yeast, this protein bound various flavonoids with high affinity (1.6 to 52 microm) and showed typical type I absorption spectra. These flavonoids were hydroxylated at position 6 of both resorcinol- and phloroglucinol-based A-rings. Flavonoid 6-hydroxylase (CYP71D9) catalyzed the conversion of flavanones more efficiently than flavones. Isoflavones were hardly hydroxylated. As soybean produces isoflavonoid constituents possessing 6,7-dihydroxy substitution patterns on ring A, the biosynthetic relationship of flavonoid 6-hydroxylase to isoflavonoid biosynthesis was investigated. Recombinant 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase (CYP93C1v2) efficiently used 6,7,4'-trihydroxyflavanone as substrate. For its structural identification, the chemically labile reaction product was converted to 6,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone by acid treatment. The structures of the final reaction products for both enzymes were confirmed by NMR and mass spectrometry. Our results strongly support the conclusion that, in soybean, the 6-hydroxylation of the A-ring occurs before the 1,2-aryl migration of the flavonoid B-ring during isoflavanone formation. This is the first identification of a flavonoid 6-hydroxylase cDNA from any plant species."

To investigate the influence of charged interfaces on the conformation of cytochrome c, the CD and magnetic circular dichroic behavior of ferric and ferrous cytochrome c in homogeneous medium and in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine/cardiolipin and dicetylphosphate liposomes was studied in the 300–600 and 200–320 nm wavelength region. EPR spectra demonstrate that the association of cytochrome c with membranes promotes alterations of the crystal field symmetry and spin state of the heme Fe3+. The studies also include the effect of Pi, NaCl, and CaCl2. Magnetic circular dichroism and CD results show that the interaction of both ferrous and ferric cytochrome cwith charged interfaces promotes conformational changes in the α-helix content, tertiary structure, and heme iron spin state. Moreover, the association of cytochrome c with different liposomes is sensitive to the heme iron valence state. The more effective association with membranes occurs with ferrous cytochrome c. Dicetylphosphate liposomes, as a negatively charged membrane model, promoted a more pronounced conformational modification in the cytochrome c structure.

In this model, high phosphate concentration and Ca2+ cooperate in reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondrial damage. The importance of electronically excited triplet states in biological events has been extensively discussed by Cilento and Adam (14Cilento G. Adam W. Free Radic. Biol.

In this regard, evidence has been provided for a relationship between apoptosis, the Ca2+-induced permeability transition pore (17Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and hydrogen peroxide production (18Stridh H. Kimland M. Jones D.P. Orrenius S.E. Hampton M.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the present work we examine the different types of cytochrome c/membrane association influenced by the heme iron redox state, membrane charge, and ionic strength. For this purpose, CD and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) have been used to detect the conformational alterations in the protein induced by the interfacial microenvironment. These techniques are sensitive to the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein and also reflect the relative configuration of the prosthetic group within the protein. EPR was employed to refine the results, providing accurate information about the iron valence, spin state, and change in local symmetry of the iron crystal field around iron. Cytochrome c (horse heart, type III), HEPES, phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk), phosphatidylethanolamine (ovine brain, type II-S), cardiolipin (bovine heart), and dicetylphosphate were purchased from Sigma. DCP liposomes were prepared in HEPES buffer according to Mortara et al. (19Mortara R.A. Quina F.H. Chaimovich H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DCP was suspended in HEPES buffer and sonicated for 20 min with a microtip-equipped Cole-Parmer 4710 series ultrasonic processor at an output of 60 watts. In the preparation of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine/cardiolipin (PC/PE/CL; 15/12/9 molar ratio) liposomes, the lipids were first dissolved in chloroform and the chloroform evaporated with N2, and the resulting test tube film was stored at −20 °C until use. Prior to the experiments, cold HEPES buffer was added to the tube, mixed with a Vortex mixer, and sonicated at 60 watts on ice in 30-s bursts with 1-min cooling intervals. Liposome preparations were centrifuged at 8000 × g and 4 °C for 1 h to precipitate the Ti released by the sonicator tip. Similar procedures were used in the preparation of CL and PE liposomes. CD and MCD measurements of cytochrome c (10 μm) were conducted in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. For the MCD the magnetic field was 870 mT and the optical path 5 mm. The spectra were obtained at room temperature, pH 7.4. EPR measurements of cytochrome c (300 μm) were obtained by using an X-band Varian E-109 spectrometer and/or an X-band Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer, equipped with a helium cryostat and temperature controller from Oxford Company under the following conditions: gain, 5 × 103; modulation amplitude, 1.0 mT; microwave power, 4 milliwatt; temperature, 11 K; and time constant, 0.064 s. After the addition of cytochrome c in different medium, 120 μl of the mixture was quickly introduced into an EPR quartz tube, cooled in liquid nitrogen, and then transferred to the helium cryostat into the EPR cavity to obtain the spectra. In Fig. 1, the MCD spectra (top) and UV-visible absorbance (bottom) of ferric cytochrome c in HEPES buffer (solid line), PC/PE/CL (dashed line), and DCP liposomes (dotted line) are shown. A Cotton effect in the Soret band, with a positive band at 400 nm and a negative band at 418 nm, is exhibited in the MCD spectra. The DCP-bound cytochrome cspectrum shows a decrease and a hypsochromic effect in the negative band with a minimum at 414 nm. The UV-visible spectra also show a hypsochromic effect in the presence of DCP liposomes. The same experiments were carried out with ferrous cytochrome c. Fig. 2 shows that the spectrum of ferrous cytochrome c in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, is quite different from that obtained with ferric cytochrome c. The ferrous cytochrome c MCD spectrum only exhibits a positive band at 418 nm (Fig. 2, top), which accompanies the bathochromic effect observed in the Soret band (Fig. 2,bottom). Furthermore, a remarkable Cotton effect appears in the 549-nm band that characterizes the ferrous cytochrome cvisible spectrum. In the presence of PC/PE/CL liposomes, the ferrous cytochrome c MCD and UV-visible spectra are very similar to those obtained with the oxidized hemeprotein (Fig. 1). The spectrum of ferrous cytochrome c obtained in the presence of DCP liposomes suggests a partitioning of the protein between the vesicles and the aqueous medium. To improve the comprehension of the association of cytochrome c with the charged interfaces, spectra of cytochrome c were recorded with increasing amounts of membrane. Fig. 4shows the alterations in the MCD band in the Soret region that accompany the progressive association of the hemeprotein with DCP liposomes. In fact, the association of ferric cytochrome cwith DCP liposomes promotes a decrease of the molar ellipticity of the negative band at 415 nm (Fig. 3,inset) associated with a hypsochromic effect (Fig. 3). In contrast, increasing the amount of PC/PE/CL liposomes does not promote any significant alteration in the ferric cytochrome c MCD spectra (not shown).Figure 3MCD spectra of cytochrome cin the presence of different DCP concentrations. Inset, the normalized molar ellipticity (θ) 415 nm in each lipid concentration. The experiments were carried out in HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, at room temperature.

The inset of Fig. 4 shows that the association of ferrous cytochrome c with PC/PE/CL liposomes exhibits a sigmoidal behavior. The same experiment realized with DCP liposomes also leads to remarkable modifications in the ferrous cytochrome c spectra (Fig.5); however, this titration does not show a sigmoidal behavior (Fig. 5, inset). EPR spectra of ferric cytochrome c obtained with increasing amounts of PC/PE/CL liposomes, shown as the lipid/protein ratio (Fig.6 A), corroborate the insignificant alteration in the cytochrome c heme iron as indicated by the MCD results. Above the lipid/protein ratio of 24, it is possible to see the appearance of a small quantity of high spin form (g = 6.0, low field region). Above the lipid/protein ratio of 12, the two narrow signals (g = 4.3, around 160 mT and g = 2.0, around 330 mT) appear, provided by the reaction of cytochrome c heme iron with cardiolipin peroxide derivatives and a radical product, respectively. EPR spectra obtained with increasing amounts of DCP liposomes are in agreement with the MCD spectra obtained under similar conditions (Fig. 6 B). Above the lipid/protein ratio of 12, a high spin form (g⊥ = 6.0, low field region, and g∥ = 2.0, high field region) is observed that becomes predominant at higher lipid/protein ratios. A different signal of low spin state superimposed on the signal of the protein in homogeneous medium can be easily identified in the 220 mT region. At the lipid/protein ratio of 24, the concomitant existence of the three species can be clearly identified. As described above the association of ferrous cytochrome cwith charged interfaces leads to MCD and UV-visible spectral changes very similar to those that occur upon conversion of ferrous cytochrome c to ferric cytochrome c (compare Figs. 1 and 2). EPR measurements with liposome-bound ferrous cytochrome cexclude the possibility of conversion of cytochrome c from ferrous to ferric after association with membranes because no EPR signal was observed. Moreover, the MCD spectral changes are reversible when liposome-bound cytochrome c is dissociated from the PC/PE/CL membrane by increasing the ionic strength as shown in Fig.7 A. As previously mentioned (13Kowaltowski A.J. Castilho R.F. Grijalba M.T. Bechara E.J.H. Vercesi A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2929-2934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), Ca2+ promotes modifications in the organization of lipid bilayers. However, the results obtained from CaCl2 titration indicate that, in this model, the effect of Ca2+ is restricted to an increase of the ionic strength, promoting the dissociation of the hemeprotein from the PC/PE/CL membrane (Fig. 7 B). In this regard, the addition of 1 mm CaCl2 to 13.5 μm ferrous cytochrome c bound to 2 mm PC/PE/CL liposomes (lipid/protein ratio, 150:1), a condition in which all cytochrome c molecules are initially membrane-bound, leads to a partial dissociation of the protein similar to that of a lipid/protein ratio of 60:1. The MCD spectra in Figs. 1 and2 reveal that the association of cytochrome c with lipid bilayers promotes alterations in the structure of the heme group of this protein. To assess whether this effect of cytochrome c/lipid association extends to the protein fraction, the UV CD spectra of cytochrome c were obtained in these three different media. Analysis of the spectra (not shown) indicates that the association of cytochrome c with charged interfaces promotes modifications in the secondary structure. The spectra have been analyzed using the Selcon method (20Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 21Sreerama N. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain fractions of α and β and the remainder secondary structure, and these parameters are compared with those obtained from crystallographic data (Tables I and II). In accordance with the data obtained in the Soret and visible region, the UV CD spectra reveal that DCP promotes the most significant modification in both ferrous (Table I) and ferric (Table II) cytochrome c secondary structure.Table ISecondary structure fraction obtained from far UV () CD spectra of ferrous cytochrome c in different mediaMediumα-Helixβ-SheetRemainderTotal%%%%HEPES buffer39.2312.8247.6299.67PC/PE/CL39.1011.9049.50100.50DCP35.4815.2449.78100.50The CD analysis of cytochrome c proceeded at pH 7.4.

Biol. 1994; 242: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar) of the cytochrome cspectra (not shown) are given below. The MCD spectra of ferric and ferrous cytochrome c reveal that the association of this hemeprotein with vesicles promotes conformational changes in the heme group and protein fraction (Figs. 1 and 2; Tables I and II). However, the comparison of Figs. 1 and 2 reveals that only the association with DCP liposomes promotes significant conformational alterations in both ferric and ferrous cytochrome c. The plot of molar ellipticity at 415 nm for ferric cytochrome c (Fig. 3,inset), or at 400 and 550 nm for ferrous cytochrome c, versus DCP concentration reveals a hyperbolic curve. The same curves obtained for PC/PE/CL-bound ferrous cytochrome c are sigmoidal, suggesting that binding of this hemeprotein to an inner mitochondrial mimetic membrane is a cooperative process. As a result, the association of cytochrome c to PC/PE/CL might alter the membrane structure, favoring the attachment of other cytochrome c molecules. Whereas the MCD and EPR spectra of ferric cytochrome c in PC/PE/CL liposomes (Figs. 1 and 6 A) suggest a lipid/protein interaction with little protein modification, Fig. 2 indicates an interaction with strong modification in the case of PC/PE/CL liposomes, when the heme iron of cytochrome c is in oxidation state II. In the case of DCP liposomes, the MCD and EPR spectra suggest a strong modification in both ferric and ferrous cytochrome c (Figs.3, 5, and 6 B). The titration of ferrous cytochrome c with DCP liposomes exhibits protein partitioning between the aqueous and liposomal media (Fig. 5). Increasing the DCP/protein ratio up to 320:1 does not modify the spectra (not shown) from those obtained with a 120:1 lipid/protein ratio of 120:1 (Fig. 5). This partitioning suggests a weak lipid-protein interaction. The comparison of the MCD and absorbance spectra of ferric cytochrome c in homogeneous medium (Fig. 1, top and bottom, respectively, solid lines) with those of ferrous cytochrome c in PC/PE/CL liposomes (Fig. 2,top and bottom, respectively, dashed lines) might suggest, at first glance, that the association of cytochrome c with biological mimetic membranes leads to the oxidation of the heme iron. Iwase et al. (22Iwase H. Takatori T. Nagao M. Iwadate K. Nakajima M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) propose a reaction of ferrous cytochrome c and cardiolipin with production of the monoepoxide of linoleic acid and oxidation of the heme iron. The authors suggest a change of the heme iron redox state based only on the absorbance spectral changes (loss of the 549-nm band) observed after the addition of cytochrome c to a cardiolipin-containing medium. However, our results show that the detachment of the protein from DCP or PC/PE/CL liposomes induced by increasing the ionic strength with NaCl or Pi (Fig.7 A) recovers the ferrous cytochrome c spectra. This clearly indicates the absence of oxidation of heme iron by phospholipids. This result was corroborated by titration with CaCl2 (Fig. 7 B), which concomitantly reverts the ferrous cytochrome c MCD spectra in the presence of lipid membranes. This spectral modification must therefore be explained by environmental modifications in the heme iron crevice. One possibility is a change in the heme iron spin state modulated by conformational changes controlling the heme iron crystal field. In homogeneous medium the absorbance spectrum of ferric cytochrome c exhibits a 695-nm charge transfer band, indicative of the heme iron sixth coordination position with methionine 80 (7) that disappears in the presence of charged interfaces (10Nantes I.L. Faljoni-Alario A. Vercesi A.E. Santos K.E. Bechara E.J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This charged interface-promoted loss of the cytochrome c sixth coordination position significantly enhances the peroxidase/oxidase activity of this protein (8Almeida A.M. Bechara E.J.H. Vercesi A.E. Nantes I.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Nantes I.L. Cilento G. Bechara E.J.H. Vercesi A.E. Photochem.

Med. 2000; 28: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The comparison of the results obtained with ferric cytochrome c bound to DCP and PC/PE/CL liposomes provides the following information. (i) The secondary structure modifications are more significant in DCP vesicles than PC/PE/CL vesicles. (ii) Contrary to that observed in PC/PE/CL vesicles, the Soret band of the MCD spectrum in DCP vesicles shows a clear difference when compared with homogeneous medium. (iii) Unlike in PC/PE/CL vesicles, the EPR spectra in DCP vesicles clearly show the presence of both spin states (low and high). The existence of this high spin state species has been described in the literature as a denatured cytochrome c (23Vincent J.S. Kon H. Levin I.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2312-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the addition of NaCl promotes the detachment of the hemeprotein from the membrane as observed by the decrease of the signal of the high spin state form and the recuperation of the signal of the native low spin state form (not shown). This is in agreement with the MCD results obtained with ferrous MCD (Fig. 7,A and B). Moreover, the analysis of the UV CD spectra of ferrous and ferric cytochrome c is incompatible with protein denaturation, as shown in Tables I and II. These results could be explained if we assume the interaction between the charged vesicles and protein as a mechanism of modulation of the crystal field of the iron moiety removing the sulfur atom from the heme iron coordination sphere and changing the spin state from low to high form. If this assumption is correct, similar behavior should occur with ferrous cytochrome c. In this case, the UV CD and MCD results show that both vesicle types produce significant changes in the cytochrome c secondary and tertiary structure (Tables I andII; Figs. 2, 4, and 5). In the case of the MCD results for ferrous cytochrome c, drastic modifications in the 550-nm range are observed when the protein is associated with the membrane. To decide whether this modification reflects the change of heme iron spin state, we compared these results with MCD of human met-, oxy-, and deoxyHb (not shown), the heme iron valence and spin states of which are well known (24Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 175-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This comparison shows that ferrous cytochrome c heme iron in homogeneous medium is in the low spin state (S = 0) and exhibits a strong signal at 550 nm in MCD spectra. When associated with the membranes, ferrous cytochrome c heme iron is in the high spin state form (S = 2). In this case, the strong signal at 550 nm in the MCD spectra disappears. The similarity of the ferrous cytochrome c high spin state MCD and absorbance spectra (membrane bound) with the ferric cytochrome c MCD and absorbance spectra (compare Figs. 1 and 2) could induce the erroneous interpretation that cytochrome c oxidation is promoted by the membrane phospholipids (22Iwase H. Takatori T. Nagao M. Iwadate K. Nakajima M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One important aspect of the above results is the fact that only ferrous cytochrome cexhibits an association with biological membranes accompanied by significant structural alterations in the protein. Moreover, only the association of ferrous cytochrome c with mimetic biological membranes exhibits cooperative behavior, suggesting conformational changes in the lipid bilayer. This high specificity for heme iron valence in determining the type of interaction and the affinity of cytochrome c for biological membranes suggests a relationship to the role played by cytochrome c in cell apoptosis. In this regard, this could be the point where the participation of cytochrome c in the respiratory chain and in apoptosis shows overlap of their regulatory mechanisms. Recently, several reports have correlated the cytochrome c redox state with its upstream (cytochrome c release from inner mitochondrial membrane) (25Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O. Schenk U.

Although there is not agreement in the literature as to whether reactive oxygen species are the cause or the consequence of cytochrome c release, cytochrome coxidants such as singlet oxygen (27Varnes M.E.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31185-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) have been consistently pointed out to be upstream apoptosis inducers. In this context, ceramide, an apoptosis inducer, has a high affinity only for ferric cytochrome c, promoting its detachment from the inner mitochondrial membrane (25Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O. Schenk U. Pruschy M. Rocha S. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6080-6084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is evidence pointing to ferric cytochrome c as the caspase activator in the cytosol (25Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O. Schenk U. Pruschy M. Rocha S. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6080-6084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 30Pan Z. Voehringer D.W. Meyn R.E. Cell. Death Differ. 1999; 7: 683-688Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In any event, a sustained steady state of cytochrome c in the ferric form seems to favor its detachment from the inner mitochondrial membrane and the caspase activation in the cytosol. Thus, the ability of cytochrome cto participate in the caspase activation might be dependent on the association of this protein with membranes and/or protein complexes, as suggested by recent literature (29Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). In this context, it is important to verify whether the association of cytochrome c with protein complexes, such as apoptosomes (29Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar), is dependent on the heme iron valence state and association with membranes.

Structural modeling suggested that the substrate binding pocket of the human 5-lipoxygenase is 20% bigger than that of the reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase; thus, reduction of the active-site volume was suggested to convert a 5-lipoxygenase to a 15-lipoxygenating enzyme species. To test this “space-based” hypothesis of the positional specificity, the volume of the 5-lipoxygenase substrate binding pocket was reduced by introducing space-filling amino acids at critical positions, which have previously been identified as sequence determinants for the positional specificity of other lipoxygenase isoforms. We found that single point mutants of the recombinant human 5-lipoxygenase exhibited a similar specificity as the wild-type enzyme but double, triple, and quadruple mutations led to a gradual alteration of the positional specificity from 5 S- via 8 S- toward 15 S-lipoxygenation.

In contrast, plant physiologists prefer a linoleic acid-related enzyme nomenclature since arachidonic acid is only a minor fatty acid in plants. Mammalian 5-LOXs are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, which are important mediators of inflammatory and anaphylactic disorders (3Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A.

Med. 1999; 340: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). During the past 10 years, 5-LOX inhibitors and leukotriene receptor antagonists have been developed as anti-asthmatic drugs, and some of them are now available for prescription (5Wenzel S.E.

Expression of the human 5-LOX is up-regulated by transforming growth factor (12Brungs M. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Translation of the 15-LOX mRNA is prevented during early stages of red cell maturation when special non-histone nuclear proteins (heteronuclear ribonucleaoproteins K and E1) bind to a repetitive sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (18Ostareck D.H.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recently, Tyr-603 and His-604 have been identified as critical amino acids for the positional specificity of the murine epidermis 8 S- and the human epidermis-type 15 S-LOX isoforms (28Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1287-1292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, neither specificity-related mutagenesis data nor x-ray coordinates are currently available for the pharmacologically most relevant human leukocyte 5-LOX.For the time being, there are two hypotheses that rationalize the mechanistic differences between arachidonic acid 5- and 15-lipoxygenation (29Funk C.D. Loll P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 966-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). (i) The “orientation-based” hypothesis suggests that, for 15-lipoxygenation, arachidonic acid may slide into the substrate binding pocket with its methyl terminus first and may adopt a steric configuration at the active site favoring oxygen insertion at C-15 of the arachidonic acid backbone. In contrast, for arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenation, an inverse, head-to-tail substrate orientation was assumed (30Prigge S.T. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 178-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). (ii) According to the “space-based” hypothesis, the substrate alignment at the active site is conserved among all LOX isoforms and the volume of the substrate binding pocket appears to be decisive for the positional specificity (31Browner M. Gillmor S.A. Fletterick R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 179Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling suggested that the substrate binding cavity of 5-LOXs is about 20% bigger than that of 15-LOXs (22Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 31Browner M. Gillmor S.A. Fletterick R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 179Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the additional space may allow an optimal substrate orientation for 5-lipoxygenation.To test the “space-based” hypothesis, we attempted to alter the volume of the substrate binding pocket by site-directed mutagenesis and determined the positional specificity of the LOX mutants. Since previous experiments failed to convert mammalian 12/15-LOXs to 5-lipoxygenating enzyme species (24Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 25Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C. Anton M. Fletterick R. Kühn H. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), an inverse mutagenesis strategy was selected. Crucial amino acids of the human leukocyte 5-LOX were replaced with the more space-filling counterparts present in the reticulocyte-type 15-LOXs. We found that reduction of the active site volume by multiple site-directed mutagenesis gradually altered the positional specificity from 5 S- via 8 S- toward 15 S-lipoxygenation.DISCUSSIONFor mammalian 12- and 15-LOXs the amino acids, which align with the Phe-353 (23Borngräber S. Kuban R.J. Anton M. Kühn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), Ile-418, Met-419 (24Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and Ile-593 (25Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C. Anton M. Fletterick R. Kühn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37345-37350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) of the rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX, have been identified as sequence determinants for the positional specificity. However, the question of whether these amino acids may also be important for the specificity of the pharmacologically most relevant mammalian 5-LOXs has not been investigated so far. Since previous site-directed mutagenesis studies and chimera formation failed to convert mammalian 12- and 15-LOXs to 5-lipoxygenating enzyme species (24Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 25Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C. Anton M. Fletterick R. Kühn H. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we followed an inverse strategy and mutated critical amino acids of the human 5-LOX to the more space-filling counterparts present in mammalian 15-LOXs. Our data suggest that Phe-359, Ala-424, Asn-425, and Ala-603 of the human 5-LOX are involved in positioning substrate fatty acids at the active site and, thus, may be considered as sequence determinants for the positional specificity. When these amino acids alone or in combination with each other were mutated to more space-filling residues, we observed a gradual conversion of the human 5-LOX to 8 S- and further to 15 S-lipoxygenating enzyme species. These results, which indicate the principle possibility of interconverting 5- and 15-lipoxygenating enzyme species, are rather surprising since the stereochemistry of 5 S- and 15 S-lipoxygenation is quite different and both isoenzyme classes do not share a high degree of amino acid identity (64% between human 5-LOX and reticulocyte-type 15-LOX).In order to find out whether the effects observed are peculiar for the human leukocyte 5-LOX, we carried out mutagenesis studies on a potato tuber 5-LOX (36Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The recombinant wild-type enzyme oxygenated arachidonic acid to a mixture of 5- and 8-HpETE, as indicated by RP-HPLC of the corresponding hydroxy compounds obtained after borohydride reduction (5-HpETE/8-HpETE ratio of 65:35). No 15-HpETE formation was observed. Val-580 of this enzyme, which aligns with Asn-425 of the human 5-LOX, was mutated to a more space-filling His, and the resulting V580H mutant converted arachidonic acid to a 60:20:20 mixture of 5-, 8-, and 15-HpETE (data not shown). With this enzyme, a single point mutation altered the positional specificity in favor of 15 S-lipoxygenation. However, the alterations were only partial and we did not carry out multiple mutations on this plant LOX.The x-ray data of the rabbit 15-LOX (22Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and more recent mutagenesis studies on this enzyme (25Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C.

The walls of the cavity are lined by hydrophobic residues, but in the proximity of the iron center there are several polar amino acids. The opening of the substrate-binding cleft may be capped by Arg-403, which was modeled to interact with the substrates' carboxylate (22Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 37Gan Q.F. Browner M. Sloane D.L. Sigal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25412-25418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Arg-403 of the rabbit enzyme aligns with Lys-409 of the human 5-LOX (Fig. 2), and we mutated this lysine to a positively charged arginine (K409R) and to an apolar leucine (K409L). Surprisingly, we did not observe major differences when the positional specificity and the specific activities of the wild type and mutant enzyme species were compared. These data suggest that Lys-409 of the human 5-LOX may not be of major importance for enzyme/substrate interaction.In mammals 5- and 15-LOXs may have different biological functions. Thus, unspecific LOX inhibitors, which have no preference for a particular LOX isoform, may not be developed as potential drugs, because of probable unwanted side effects. However, the observation that the volume of the active site of mammalian 5-LOXs is bigger than that of other isoforms may be useful for the development of specific 5-LOX inhibitors. The mutant enzyme species created in this study may be used in molecular test systems searching for isoform-specific LOX inhibitors. Lipoxygenases (LOXs)1constitute a heterogeneous family of lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that catalyze the dioxygenation of free and/or esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids to their corresponding hydroperoxy derivatives. In mammals LOXs are categorized with respect to their positional specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation into 5-, 8-, 12-, and 15-LOXs (1Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 2Kuhn H. Thiele B.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In contrast, plant physiologists prefer a linoleic acid-related enzyme nomenclature since arachidonic acid is only a minor fatty acid in plants. Mammalian 5-LOXs are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, which are important mediators of inflammatory and anaphylactic disorders (3Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A.

Med. 1999; 340: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). During the past 10 years, 5-LOX inhibitors and leukotriene receptor antagonists have been developed as anti-asthmatic drugs, and some of them are now available for prescription (5Wenzel S.E. Kamada A.K. Ann. Pharmacother. 1996; 30: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6O'Byrne P.M. Israel E. Drazen J.M. Ann. Intern.

Expression of the human 5-LOX is up-regulated by transforming growth factor (12Brungs M. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Steinhilber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Translation of the 15-LOX mRNA is prevented during early stages of red cell maturation when special non-histone nuclear proteins (heteronuclear ribonucleaoproteins K and E1) bind to a repetitive sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (18Ostareck D.H.

Although the positional specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation is decisive for mammalian LOX classification, the structural reasons for the variation of this enzyme property remain unclear.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies identified Phe-353 (23Borngräber S. Kuban R.J. Anton M. Kühn H. J. Mol.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recently, Tyr-603 and His-604 have been identified as critical amino acids for the positional specificity of the murine epidermis 8 S- and the human epidermis-type 15 S-LOX isoforms (28Jisaka M. Kim R.B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1287-1292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, neither specificity-related mutagenesis data nor x-ray coordinates are currently available for the pharmacologically most relevant human leukocyte 5-LOX. For the time being, there are two hypotheses that rationalize the mechanistic differences between arachidonic acid 5- and 15-lipoxygenation (29Funk C.D. Loll P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 966-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). (i) The “orientation-based” hypothesis suggests that, for 15-lipoxygenation, arachidonic acid may slide into the substrate binding pocket with its methyl terminus first and may adopt a steric configuration at the active site favoring oxygen insertion at C-15 of the arachidonic acid backbone. In contrast, for arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenation, an inverse, head-to-tail substrate orientation was assumed (30Prigge S.T. Gaffney B.J. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 178-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). (ii) According to the “space-based” hypothesis, the substrate alignment at the active site is conserved among all LOX isoforms and the volume of the substrate binding pocket appears to be decisive for the positional specificity (31Browner M. Gillmor S.A. Fletterick R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 179Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling suggested that the substrate binding cavity of 5-LOXs is about 20% bigger than that of 15-LOXs (22Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 31Browner M. Gillmor S.A. Fletterick R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 179Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the additional space may allow an optimal substrate orientation for 5-lipoxygenation. To test the “space-based” hypothesis, we attempted to alter the volume of the substrate binding pocket by site-directed mutagenesis and determined the positional specificity of the LOX mutants. Since previous experiments failed to convert mammalian 12/15-LOXs to 5-lipoxygenating enzyme species (24Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 25Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C. Anton M. Fletterick R. Kühn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37345-37350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Chen X.S. Funk C.D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), an inverse mutagenesis strategy was selected. Crucial amino acids of the human leukocyte 5-LOX were replaced with the more space-filling counterparts present in the reticulocyte-type 15-LOXs. We found that reduction of the active site volume by multiple site-directed mutagenesis gradually altered the positional specificity from 5 S- via 8 S- toward 15 S-lipoxygenation. DISCUSSIONFor mammalian 12- and 15-LOXs the amino acids, which align with the Phe-353 (23Borngräber S. Kuban R.J. Anton M. Kühn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), Ile-418, Met-419 (24Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and Ile-593 (25Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C. Anton M. Fletterick R. Kühn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37345-37350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) of the rabbit reticulocyte 15-LOX, have been identified as sequence determinants for the positional specificity. However, the question of whether these amino acids may also be important for the specificity of the pharmacologically most relevant mammalian 5-LOXs has not been investigated so far. Since previous site-directed mutagenesis studies and chimera formation failed to convert mammalian 12- and 15-LOXs to 5-lipoxygenating enzyme species (24Sloane D.L. Leung R. Craik C.S. Sigal E. Nature. 1991; 354: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 25Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C. Anton M. Fletterick R. Kühn H. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we followed an inverse strategy and mutated critical amino acids of the human 5-LOX to the more space-filling counterparts present in mammalian 15-LOXs. Our data suggest that Phe-359, Ala-424, Asn-425, and Ala-603 of the human 5-LOX are involved in positioning substrate fatty acids at the active site and, thus, may be considered as sequence determinants for the positional specificity. When these amino acids alone or in combination with each other were mutated to more space-filling residues, we observed a gradual conversion of the human 5-LOX to 8 S- and further to 15 S-lipoxygenating enzyme species. These results, which indicate the principle possibility of interconverting 5- and 15-lipoxygenating enzyme species, are rather surprising since the stereochemistry of 5 S- and 15 S-lipoxygenation is quite different and both isoenzyme classes do not share a high degree of amino acid identity (64% between human 5-LOX and reticulocyte-type 15-LOX).In order to find out whether the effects observed are peculiar for the human leukocyte 5-LOX, we carried out mutagenesis studies on a potato tuber 5-LOX (36Geerts A. Feltkamp D. Rosahl S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The recombinant wild-type enzyme oxygenated arachidonic acid to a mixture of 5- and 8-HpETE, as indicated by RP-HPLC of the corresponding hydroxy compounds obtained after borohydride reduction (5-HpETE/8-HpETE ratio of 65:35). No 15-HpETE formation was observed. Val-580 of this enzyme, which aligns with Asn-425 of the human 5-LOX, was mutated to a more space-filling His, and the resulting V580H mutant converted arachidonic acid to a 60:20:20 mixture of 5-, 8-, and 15-HpETE (data not shown). With this enzyme, a single point mutation altered the positional specificity in favor of 15 S-lipoxygenation. However, the alterations were only partial and we did not carry out multiple mutations on this plant LOX.The x-ray data of the rabbit 15-LOX (22Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and more recent mutagenesis studies on this enzyme (25Borngräber S. Browner M. Gillmor S. Gerth C.

The walls of the cavity are lined by hydrophobic residues, but in the proximity of the iron center there are several polar amino acids. The opening of the substrate-binding cleft may be capped by Arg-403, which was modeled to interact with the substrates' carboxylate (22Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25412-25418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Arg-403 of the rabbit enzyme aligns with Lys-409 of the human 5-LOX (Fig. 2), and we mutated this lysine to a positively charged arginine (K409R) and to an apolar leucine (K409L). Surprisingly, we did not observe major differences when the positional specificity and the specific activities of the wild type and mutant enzyme species were compared. These data suggest that Lys-409 of the human 5-LOX may not be of major importance for enzyme/substrate interaction.In mammals 5- and 15-LOXs may have different biological functions.

(1978) Atlas of Metal-Ligand Equilibria in Aqueous Solution, pp. 284–285 and 322–323, Halstead Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar) and can catalyze chemical reactions leading to the production of reactive oxygen species via the Haber-Weiss cycle (1Crichton R.R. Inorganic Biochemistry of Iron Metabolism. Ellis Horwood, Ltd., Chichester, UK1991: 29-58Google Scholar). It is therefore essential for biological systems to control the chemical environment of iron.Disease-causing bacteria are in constant battle with their hosts for essential iron. Humans and other mammals sequester extracellular iron in serum using transferrin and in secretions using lactoferrin. Pathogenic bacteria have developed efficient iron-uptake systems to compete with these host iron-binding proteins. For many pathogenic bacteria, iron-uptake efficiency is directly related to virulence (3Mietzner T.A. Tencza S.B. Adhikari P. Vaughan K.G. Nowalk A.J. Vogt P.K. Mahan M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. Springer, Berlin1998: 113-135Google Scholar,4Braun V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 779-786PubMed Google Scholar). Two fundamentally different strategies are used by pathogenic bacteria to scavenge iron (3Mietzner T.A. Tencza S.B. Adhikari P. Vaughan K.G. Nowalk A.J. Vogt P.K. Mahan M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. Springer, Berlin1998: 113-135Google Scholar). The first strategy is to synthesize low molecular weight organic Fe3+ chelators (siderophores) that are secreted into the surrounding environment for iron uptake. Using this mechanism iron is transported into the bacterial cell in the form of an iron-siderophore chelate. This strategy has the advantage of being nonspecific and therefore easily used for diverse sources of iron. Some pathogenic organisms have developed multiple siderophore-based systems to allow for a more efficient iron uptake from a wide range of situations. Siderophores are generally polydentate chelators with high affinity Fe3+-specific binding groups such as hydroxamic acids or catechols (5Albrecht-Gary A.-M. Crumbliss A.L. Sigel A. Sigel H. Iron Transport and Storage in Microorganisms, Plants, and Animals. M. Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 239-327Google Scholar). However, siderophore-mediated iron acquisition processes are energetically demanding because of the constant need for synthesis and metabolism of these low molecular weight ligands.The second strategy employed by some pathogenic organisms, more specific with regard to iron and energetically more favorable, is an uptake mechanism based on ferric-binding proteins that sequester iron. Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria such as Neisseria andHaemophilus, which cause ailments ranging from gonorrhea to respiratory tract infections to meningitis, acquire iron from the host proteins lactoferrin and transferrin using surface receptors. Iron is then released from these proteins and transported across the bacterial outer membrane and into the periplasmic space where it is bound by the ferric-binding protein and subsequently transported across the cytoplasmic membrane. Ferric-binding proteins (Fbps)1 are found inHaemophilus influenzae (hFbp), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis(nFbp) (3Mietzner T.A. Tencza S.B. Adhikari P. Vaughan K.G. Nowalk A.J. Vogt P.K. Mahan M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. Springer, Berlin1998: 113-135Google Scholar). Although these bacteria express several different transferrin and lactoferrin receptors, Fbps appear to be the nodal point for transport of iron across the periplasmic space to the cytoplasmic membrane. hFbp and nFbp have been shown to possess 80% amino acid sequence identity (3Mietzner T.A. Tencza S.B. Adhikari P. Vaughan K.G. Nowalk A.J. Vogt P.K. Mahan M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. Springer, Berlin1998: 113-135Google Scholar).The transferrins are a class of iron-binding proteins that are characterized by a high thermodynamic affinity for Fe3+ (3Mietzner T.A. Tencza S.B.

Saunders Co., Ltd, London1994: 1-30Google Scholar). Human transferrin (hTf) is a bilobal protein with a single Fe3+ binding site per lobe. Each hTf binding site contains two tyrosines, a histidine, and an aspartate. The fifth and sixth Fe3+ coordination sites are occupied by exogenous CO32− (8Baker E.N. Lindley P.F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Baker E.N. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1994; 41: 389-394Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Fbps and transferrin lobes are functionally and structurally homologous. The recently published x-ray crystal structure of hFbp (also referred to as HitA) from H. influenzae (10Bruns C.M. Nowalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct.

A., and Nunn, R. To be Published, PDB no.Google Scholar) provides a convincing argument that these proteins function as bacterial transferrins. From previous work reported on nFbp (3Mietzner T.A. Tencza S.B. Adhikari P. Vaughan K.G. Nowalk A.J. Vogt P.K. Mahan M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. Springer, Berlin1998: 113-135Google Scholar), it is clear that structural and functional similarities exist between the transferrins and the Fbps. The inner coordination shell around iron in both nFbp (11McRee, D. E., Bruns, C. M., Williams, P. A., Mietzner, T. A., and Nunn, R. To be Published, PDB no.Google Scholar) and hFbp (10Bruns C.M.

Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) show a striking resemblance with the inner coordination sphere of iron in mammalian transferrins. These Fbps contain only a single Fe3+ binding site composed of four donor groups from protein side chains: two tyrosyl oxygens, one histidyl nitrogen, and one glutamyl oxygen. The fifth and sixth positions are also occupied by exogenous ligands and have been found to be PO43− (monodentate) and H2O in both Fbps. The Fe3+ binding constant forhFbp and nFbp was estimated to be comparable to that for each hTf binding site (6Aisen P. Leibman A. Zweier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1930-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nowalk A. Tencza S. Mietzner T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12769-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Chen C.Y. Berish S.A. Morse S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A comparison of Fbp sequences with each domain of the transferrins reveals no remarkable primary structure similarities, yet both proteins reversibly bind Fe3+ with substantial affinity and play related roles in the transport of Fe3+ within the spaces between two membranes.The mechanism of Fe3+ acquisition at the outer membrane/periplasm interface and the mechanism of Fe3+deposition at the periplasm/cytoplasmic interface in Gram-negative bacteria is of general scientific interest and of medical significance. Although it is postulated that the release of Fe3+ from Fbps in vivo is facilitated by binding to a permease on the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and that release is accelerated by a pH effect (3Mietzner T.A. Tencza S.B. Adhikari P. Vaughan K.G. Nowalk A.J. Vogt P.K. Mahan M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. Springer, Berlin1998: 113-135Google Scholar), essentially no work has been done in this area at the molecular mechanism level.We have embarked on a series of experiments that directly relate to a further chemical characterization of the Fe3+ binding site in nFbp and the ability, in a thermodynamic sense, of this protein to tightly bind and release Fe3+. These results are presented against a background of similar data from the literature for mammalian transferrins. Here, we report how subtle differences in the Fbp binding site profoundly influence the Fe3+/2+ redox potential (E 12) for Fe-nFbp when compared with hTf. The E 12 is a relevant parameter for iron transport because high-spin Fe2+exchanges ligands more rapidly than Fe3+ and forms less stable complexes with hard donor ligands (14Wilkins R.G. Kinetics and Mechanisms of Reactions of Transition Metal Complexes, 2nd Ed. VCH, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). By determining the redox properties of this nFbp system, we are able to establish if reduction within the periplasm at the cytoplasmic membrane is thermodynamically feasible, and consequently whether redox may play a role in the transport mechanism of Fe3+ across the periplasmic space to the cytosol. These results, along with relevant EPR data and the Fe3+ binding constant for nFbp, allow us to chemically characterize the Fe3+ binding site of nFbp. Comparison of these data with corresponding data for mammalian transferrin studies enable us to develop a molecular paradigm for iron transport by Fbps in terms of a possible Fe3+/2+ couple that could trigger iron release in vivo.DISCUSSIONEPR spectra confirm the Fe3+ bound to nFbp to be high-spin in a strong field ligand site with low symmetry. Comparison of EPR spectra for Fe3+ nFbp with those for mammalian transferrin (6Aisen P. Leibman A. Zweier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1930-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Aasa R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11036-11043Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) shows that the synergistic anions are different for each protein, which is consistent with the presence of PO43− (in monodentate coordination) and H2O exogenous ligands in the former case and CO32− (in bidentate coordination) in the latter, as shown in their respective crystal structures (10Bruns C.M. Nowalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11McRee, D. E., Bruns, C. M., Williams, P.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5804-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). A comparison of the inner coordination shell of Fe3+ for the two proteins is illustrated in Fig.4. This similarity in binding site further manifests itself in the Fe3+ binding constant fornFbp at pH 6.5, 2.4 × 1018m−1, which is within a factor of 13 of the effective binding constant of the isolated N-lobe of transferrin measured in air at pH 6.7 (1.8 × 1017m−1) (27Zak O. Leibman A. Aisen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).A defining structural feature for all transferrins is the dependence of Fe binding on the concomitant binding of an exogenous anion. This requirement is evident in nFbp, in which the anion binding site can accept a phosphate or apparently, a bi(carbonate). However, the change in binding site symmetry brought about by the change in exogenous ligands (H2O and PO43− for nFbp and CO32− for hTf), and the increased exposure of the nFbp binding site to solvent (Fig.5) have resulted in a significant (∼200 mV) positive shift in Fe3+/2+ redox potential for Fe3+ nFbp relative to Fe3+ hTf (19Kraiter D.C.

Using either 1.8 × 1017m−1 (isolated N-lobe hTf, Ref. 27Zak O. Leibman A. Aisen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) or 1.4 × 1018m−1 (upper limit for the N-lobe site in holo-hTf, Ref. 28Zak O. Aisen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 829: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) forK III(hTf) at pH 6.7 and our value of 2.4 × 1018m−1 forK III(nFbp) at pH 6.5 (the 0.2 pH unit difference is not likely to have a substantial effect on the stability constants), we estimate thatK II(nFbp) in the presence of phosphate is 103.5–104.5 greater thanK II(hTf) in the presence of carbonate. A direct determination of Fe2+ binding by either protein has not been made, largely because of the extreme air sensitivity of the systems. However, an indirect estimate of 103m−1 based on a LFER at pH 7.4 has been made for Fe2+ binding to the N-terminal lobe ofhTf (26Harris W.R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1986; 27: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). K II(hTf) at pH 6.5 is expected to be lower than this value because of the proton dependence of the Fe2+ binding constant. Based on these considerations we use Eq. 2 to estimate the Fe2+ binding constant for nFbp in the presence of phosphate to be within an order of magnitude of 106m−1. We acknowledge that the binding constants used in Eqs. 1 and 2 for this estimate are effective and not thermodynamic constants as would be required in the strict application of the thermodynamic cycle shown above. However, our calculations are internally consistent and the expressed uncertainty adequately reflects the uncertainty in the parameters used to make this estimate.Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An implication of the positive shift in redox potential fornFbp relative to hTf is that the redox potential for Fe3+ nFbp is in the range for NADH- or NADPH-driven reduction. Therefore Fe3+/2+ reduction emerges as a viable chemical mechanism for iron release from Fbp, given our estimate that Fe2+ binding to Fbp is about 12 orders of magnitude weaker than Fe3+ binding. This is in contrast to Fe3+ hTf, which as a result of a more negative redox potential requires the presence of a Fe2+ chelator with an affinity constant in the range 103m−1 or greater for NAD+ or NADP+ driven Fe3+/2+ reduction to play a role in iron release from the protein (19Kraiter D.C. Zak O. Aisen P. Crumbliss A.L. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 37: 964-968Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have shown that the effective stability constant for Fe3+ nFbp in the presence of phosphate at the periplasmic pH 6.5 is 2.4 × 1018m−1. This is within an order of magnitude of the Fe3+ binding to N-terminal site for hTf in the presence of carbonate. EPR spectra of Fe3+ nFbp in the presence of phosphate and carbonate are consistent with a displaceable phosphate ligand in the wild-type protein. 31P NMR results show that phosphate is present in the holo form of reconstituted nFbp, consistent with x-ray crystallographic results that show monodentate binding of phosphate to iron (10Bruns C.M. Nowalk A.J. Arvai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11McRee, D. E., Bruns, C. M., Williams, P. A., Mietzner, T. A., and Nunn, R. To be Published, PDB no.Google Scholar) and that phosphate is released when Fe3+ is removed by dialysis against EDTA. As in transferrin, the synergistic anion in nFbp is bound weakly if at all in the absence of bound metal ion. The similarity in metal and anion binding properties of the bacterial and eukaryotic transferrins, despite the absence of sequence homology, is a striking example of convergent evolution. However, a significant finding in our study is that nFbp has a very different redox potential from mammalian transferrin. Our spectroelectrochemical measurements imply that Fe3+ nFbp may be reduced in vivoby pyridine nucleotides making a reductive iron release feasible for iron transport from outer membrane to cytoplasmic membrane across the periplasmic space in these Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Iron is an essential nutrient for almost all living cells (1Crichton R.R. Inorganic Biochemistry of Iron Metabolism. Ellis Horwood, Ltd., Chichester, UK1991: 29-58Google Scholar). Different organisms have developed specialized mechanisms to acquire, transport, and assimilate iron.

By determining the redox properties of this nFbp system, we are able to establish if reduction within the periplasm at the cytoplasmic membrane is thermodynamically feasible, and consequently whether redox may play a role in the transport mechanism of Fe3+ across the periplasmic space to the cytosol. These results, along with relevant EPR data and the Fe3+ binding constant for nFbp, allow us to chemically characterize the Fe3+ binding site of nFbp. Comparison of these data with corresponding data for mammalian transferrin studies enable us to develop a molecular paradigm for iron transport by Fbps in terms of a possible Fe3+/2+ couple that could trigger iron release in vivo. DISCUSSIONEPR spectra confirm the Fe3+ bound to nFbp to be high-spin in a strong field ligand site with low symmetry.

This requirement is evident in nFbp, in which the anion binding site can accept a phosphate or apparently, a bi(carbonate). However, the change in binding site symmetry brought about by the change in exogenous ligands (H2O and PO43− for nFbp and CO32− for hTf), and the increased exposure of the nFbp binding site to solvent (Fig.5) have resulted in a significant (∼200 mV) positive shift in Fe3+/2+ redox potential for Fe3+ nFbp relative to Fe3+ hTf (19Kraiter D.C.

Acta. 1985; 829: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) forK III(hTf) at pH 6.7 and our value of 2.4 × 1018m−1 forK III(nFbp) at pH 6.5 (the 0.2 pH unit difference is not likely to have a substantial effect on the stability constants), we estimate thatK II(nFbp) in the presence of phosphate is 103.5–104.5 greater thanK II(hTf) in the presence of carbonate. A direct determination of Fe2+ binding by either protein has not been made, largely because of the extreme air sensitivity of the systems. However, an indirect estimate of 103m−1 based on a LFER at pH 7.4 has been made for Fe2+ binding to the N-terminal lobe ofhTf (26Harris W.R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1986; 27: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). K II(hTf) at pH 6.5 is expected to be lower than this value because of the proton dependence of the Fe2+ binding constant. Based on these considerations we use Eq. 2 to estimate the Fe2+ binding constant for nFbp in the presence of phosphate to be within an order of magnitude of 106m−1. We acknowledge that the binding constants used in Eqs. 1 and 2 for this estimate are effective and not thermodynamic constants as would be required in the strict application of the thermodynamic cycle shown above. However, our calculations are internally consistent and the expressed uncertainty adequately reflects the uncertainty in the parameters used to make this estimate.Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An implication of the positive shift in redox potential fornFbp relative to hTf is that the redox potential for Fe3+ nFbp is in the range for NADH- or NADPH-driven reduction. Therefore Fe3+/2+ reduction emerges as a viable chemical mechanism for iron release from Fbp, given our estimate that Fe2+ binding to Fbp is about 12 orders of magnitude weaker than Fe3+ binding. This is in contrast to Fe3+ hTf, which as a result of a more negative redox potential requires the presence of a Fe2+ chelator with an affinity constant in the range 103m−1 or greater for NAD+ or NADP+ driven Fe3+/2+ reduction to play a role in iron release from the protein (19Kraiter D.C. Zak O. Aisen P. Crumbliss A.L. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 37: 964-968Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have shown that the effective stability constant for Fe3+ nFbp in the presence of phosphate at the periplasmic pH 6.5 is 2.4 × 1018m−1. This is within an order of magnitude of the Fe3+ binding to N-terminal site for hTf in the presence of carbonate. EPR spectra of Fe3+ nFbp in the presence of phosphate and carbonate are consistent with a displaceable phosphate ligand in the wild-type protein. 31P NMR results show that phosphate is present in the holo form of reconstituted nFbp, consistent with x-ray crystallographic results that show monodentate binding of phosphate to iron (10Bruns C.M.

A., Mietzner, T. A., and Nunn, R. To be Published, PDB no.Google Scholar) and that phosphate is released when Fe3+ is removed by dialysis against EDTA. As in transferrin, the synergistic anion in nFbp is bound weakly if at all in the absence of bound metal ion. The similarity in metal and anion binding properties of the bacterial and eukaryotic transferrins, despite the absence of sequence homology, is a striking example of convergent evolution. However, a significant finding in our study is that nFbp has a very different redox potential from mammalian transferrin. Our spectroelectrochemical measurements imply that Fe3+ nFbp may be reduced in vivoby pyridine nucleotides making a reductive iron release feasible for iron transport from outer membrane to cytoplasmic membrane across the periplasmic space in these Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.

Nakamura M. Rothe G. Spiekermann K. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. Roesler J. Cytometry. 1994; 18: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, 7D5 has proven useful in the determination of Cyt bup-regulation as an indicator of neutrophil activation and granule exocytosis (21DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J.P. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and for the identification of individuals deficient in Cyt b (20Emmendorffer A. Nakamura M. Rothe G. Spiekermann K. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. Roesler J. Cytometry. 1994; 18: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Faizunnessa N.N. Tsuchiya T. Kumatori A. Kurozumi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S.

Commun. 1995; 209: 146-152Google Scholar). However, neither the subunit location nor chemical nature of the 7D5 epitope has been elucidated. In our current studies, we have used phage display and immunological analyses to identify the 7D5 epitope on Cyt b. Although we confirmed the inability of 7D5 to recognize Cyt b on immunoblots, we found that 7D5 immunoprecipitated detergent-solubilized Cyt b heterodimer containing its fully processed 91kDa form of gp91 phox and its 65-kDa precursor. Additionally, it precipitated the deglycosylated gp91 phox core protein, 2A. Yamauchi, L. Yu, A. J. G. Pötgens, F. Kuribayashi, H. Nunoi, S. Kanegasaki, D. Roos, H. L. Malech, M. C. Dinauer, and M. Nakamura, unpublished observation. suggesting that neither the mature nor high mannose-containing carbohydrate contributes significantly to the epitope. Furthermore, our results indicate that the 226RIVRG230 and160IKNP163 segments of gp91 phox form the 7D5 epitope and therefore must be exposed on the cell surface. These sequences of gp91 phox were not bound by 7D5 in the absence of p22 phox nor under conditions that disrupted the heterodimer, suggesting that, although 7D5 binding is confined to nonlinear but contiguous regions of gp91 phox , it depends on associated p22 phox for its conformational integrity. In combination, these data provide direct evidence for the identity of two adjacent transmembrane helices in gp91 phox . Prestained protein molecular weight standards were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Reagents for buffers and bacteriological media and Nunc Maxisorb flat bottom plates for ELISA were purchased from Fisher. Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-4B and GammaBind Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Sequencing data were obtained using a Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Unless specified, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Heparinized, venous blood was obtained from healthy individuals (or from patients with CGD) in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at the University of Iowa, and neutrophils were isolated as described previously using Hypaque-Ficoll gradients after dextran sedimentation (24Boyum A. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of the individuals with either X-linked deficiency of gp91 phox or autosomal deficiency of p22 phox were performed by Paul G. Heyworth (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and John T. Curnutte (Genentech, Inc.). The individual with autosomal deficiency of p22 phox (A220) had a nucleotide replacement at position C354 (C354 → A), which resulted in the replacement of Ser118 with Arg. The individual with deficiency of gp91 phox (X910) had a frameshift in exon 11, resulting in the replacement of nine nucleotides with eight. Surface-expressed Cyt b was detected using 7D5 by flow cytometry as described previously (21DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J.P. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on a FACscan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) at the University of Iowa Core Flow Cytometry facility. For most experiments, unfixed neutrophils were used, and a single live gate eliminated debris and contaminating cells. However, when patient cells were shipped overnight, it was sometimes necessary to use propidium iodide staining in combination with an additional gate to further exclude dead cells from the analysis. 35 μl of relax buffer (10 mmHepes, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 8 pmol of heparin-purified Cyt b (determined by spectral absorbance at 414 nm, extension coefficient = 21.6 mm−1cm−1) (25Cross A.R. Higson F.K. Jones O.T. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), in 2% octyl glucoside was used to coat each well of a 96-well Corning Maxisorb ELISA plate overnight at 4 °C. Rinsing and blocking were performed as described (14Burritt J.B. Busse S.C. Gizachew D. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. Bond C.W. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24847-24852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), except a different blocking buffer (Hanks' balanced salt buffer with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) was used. Cyt b was probed for 1 h at 25 °C with 80 μl of the indicated mAb at a concentration of 3 μg/ml. To measure the ability of the intact phage clones to block the binding of 7D5 to immobilized Cytb, the antibody was diluted to 3 μg/ml and exposed to 2.5 × 1012 plaque-forming units for 30 min 25 °C. Pretreated 7D5 was then exposed to the immobilized Cyt b for 4 h. The reactivities of the mAbs for the Cyt b were determined by probing the wells with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as described above. Following treatment with 4 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate (Sigma) for 15 min on ice, 5 × 106 human PMNs were washed and then resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, and 2.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were sonicated at level 10 for 10 s using a probe sonicator (Heat Systems Inc., Farmingdale, NY) and then incubated on ice for 10 min. Lysates were precleared using Pansorbin Cells (Calbiochem) as described previously (26DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B., Yu, L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and then divided into two 100-μl aliquots. For nondenaturing immunoprecipitations, one of the aliquots was diluted to 1.2 ml with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 190 mmNaCl, containing 2.5% Triton X-100). 10–15 μg of monoclonal antibody, 7D5, or those specific for gp91 phox (54.1 (αgp91)) and p22 phox (44.1 (αp22)) or an IgG1 control mAb (Cappel, Organon Teknika Co., Durham, NC) was added to the diluted lysate and rotated at 4 °C for 4 h. Subsequent steps were performed as described previously (26DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B., Yu, L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For denatured lysates, the 100-μl aliquot was made 1% SDS, heated to 100 °C for 3–4 min, and then iced immediately for 5 min. Lysate was then diluted to 1.2 ml with dilution buffer so that SDS concentration was 0.1%, and precipitation was performed as described for nondenaturing immunoprecipitations (above). Alternatively, Cyt b was precipitated from solubilized gp91-PLB cells, a described previously human promyelocytic leukemia cell line constitutively expressing gp91 phox (27Zhen L. King A.A.J. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), using 7D5, αgp91, and αp22. Cyt bwas precipitated from gp91-PLB or a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line with the CYBB gene deleted (XCGD-PLB) as reported earlier (26DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B., Yu, L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and denaturing conditions were as described above. Following 5–20% SDS-PAGE, immune complexes were immunoblotted using a combination of αgp91 and αp22. Immunoblots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal Substrate; Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The generation of monoclonal antibody 7D5 has been described previously (19Nakamura M. Murakami M. Koga T. Tanaka Y. Minakami S. Blood. 1987; 69: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the production of the J404 nonapeptide phage display library was reported (28Burritt J.B. Bond C.W. Doss K.W. Jesaitis A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 7D5 was purified from spent RPMI 1640 media of a hybridoma cell line using GammaBind Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Mapping of 7D5 with the phage display library and plaque lift analyses were carried out as described (16Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), except the affinity-selected clones were amplified following each round of selection by replicating as plaques on a lawn of K91 cells (instead of as K91 colonies on LB agar containing 75 μg/ml kanamycin). 5 × 1010 plaque-forming units of phage produced as described above were disrupted with SDS loading buffer at 100 °C for 5 min and loaded onto a 5–20% SDS-PAGE gel (29Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) to separate capsid proteins. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, the immunoblot was probed with 5 μg/ml 7D5 and detected by goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary (Bio-Rad) in combination with chromagen reagent (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as described (16Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 7D5 has been previously reported to recognize Cyt b expressed at the plasma membrane of neutrophils but not on cells from X-linked CGD individuals (19Nakamura M. Murakami M. Koga T. Tanaka Y. Minakami S. Blood. 1987; 69: 1404-1408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mizuno Y. Hara T. Nakamura M. Ueda K. Minakami S. Take H. J. Pediatr. 1988; 113: 458-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The absence of either gp91 phox or p22 phox in X-linked or autosomal recessive CGD, respectively, results in the absence ofboth proteins on the neutrophil membrane (5Segal A.W. Nature. 1987; 326: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 31Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Jesaitis A.J. Orkin S.H. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1989; 73: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to rule out the possibility that 7D5 binding is dependent on transcriptional regulation of only gp91 phox and not p22 phox , we compared its binding to cells derived from homozygous and heterozygous individuals with autosomal and X-linked inheritance of the disease. Intact neutrophils derived from individuals deficient in gp91 phox (X910) or p22 phox (A220) were probed for surface expression of Cytb using 7D5 in flow cytometry (Fig.1, A and B). In contrast to neutrophils from normal individuals, 7D5 did not stain the cell surface of neutrophils deficient in either p22 phox or gp91 phox (Fig. 1, A and B). Neutrophils from the mother and female siblings of an individual with X-linked CGD displayed bimodal fluorescence, demonstrating that they have both normal and Cyt b-deficient neutrophils. The identification of heterogeneous Cyt b expression in their neutrophils indicates that they possess one copy of a mutant CYBB allele and therefore are carriers for X-linked CGD (Fig. 1 B). Approximately 87% of the neutrophils from the mother and 80% from the daughter shown in Fig. 1 B reduced nitro blue tetrazolium to formazan, indicating that those cells possessed normal O⨪2-generating capacity. A second daughter also had similar lyonization with 74% nitro blue tetrazolium-positive neutrophils (not shown). That three females within the same family would have similar degrees of lyonization may reflect familial nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation, which has been identified in other X-linked disorders (32Moser H. Emery A.E. Clin. Genet. 1974; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Kaladhar R.B. Anandavalli T.E. Reddi O.S. Hum.

The percentage of their neutrophils with normal O⨪2-producing capability correlated well with the amount of 7D5 binding shown by flow cytometry: e.g. 81.1% of the neutrophils in the daughter with 80% nitro blue tetrazolium-positive cells stained with 7D5 (Fig. 1 B). These findings indicate that 7D5-epitope recognition required surface expression of both gp91 phox and p22 phox . Moreover, these results illustrate how 7D5 can be used to identify Cytb-deficient individuals or those who are carriers for X-linked CGD. To demonstrate further the specificity of immunoreactivity of 7D5 to Cyt b, human neutrophil Cyt b was purified from cell membranes as described (38Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and bound to 96-well plates. Probing the immobilized Cyt b with 7D5, anti-p22 phox mAb 44.1 (αp22) (14Burritt J.B. Busse S.C. Gizachew D. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. Bond C.W. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24847-24852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), anti-gp91 phox mAb 54.1 (αgp91) (14Burritt J.B. Busse S.C. Gizachew D. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. Bond C.W. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24847-24852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and an irrelevant mAb suggested that the epitope bound by 7D5 was intact on the detergent-solubilized protein (Fig.2). Although the reactivity of 7D5 in the ELISA was less than that of αp22 or αgp91, all three mAbs specifically recognized Cyt b. It is possible that the binding of mAb 7D5 to Cyt b requires a more native or membrane-resident conformation of the protein than does either αp22 or αgp91, although we were unable to test this directly using our ELISA. To gain insight into the structural nature of the 7D5 epitope, we compared nondenaturing with denaturing conditions for immunoprecipitation of Cyt b using 7D5. Using nondenaturing conditions, 7D5, αgp91, and αp22 precipitated both gp91 phox and p22 phox from human neutrophil detergent lysates (Fig. 3 A). When the lysates were denatured with heat and 1% SDS, αgp91 and αp22, binding linear regions of the protein, precipitated their respective subunits alone. However, 7D5 precipitated neither subunit after denaturation (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether 7D5 bound complex carbohydrates on gp91 phox , we examined the ability of 7D5 to precipitate Cytb using biosynthetically active gp91-PLB cells as a source of both precursor and mature Cyt b (Fig. 3 B). Using nondenaturing conditions, 7D5 precipitated gp91 phox , p22 phox , and a small amount of gp65, the gp91 phox precursor that has exclusively high mannose oligosaccharides (Fig.3 B). Since 7D5 precipitated gp65, the complex carbohydrates of gp91 phox were not required for 7D5 binding to Cytb. These findings were confirmed by the ability of 7D5 to precipitate the heterodimeric complex consisting of 55–58-kDa core gp91 phox protein-p22 phox synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin2 and also bind heterodimer following digestion with PNGase F (data not shown). Consistent with the neutrophil experiments, when gp91-PLB lysates were denatured with 1% SDS and heat, 7D5 precipitated neither mature subunit nor gp65. In contrast, αgp91 and αp22 precipitated their respective subunits following denaturation (Fig. 3 B). These findings suggest that 7D5 recognized the Cyt b peptide backbone in its native form only but do not elucidate whether the antibody bound to an epitope shared by both subunits or if it associated with individual gp91 phox or p22 phox subunits in their native conformation. Our previous studies on the biosynthesis of Cyt bdemonstrated that pools of uncomplexed gp65 and p22 phox accumulate for a limited time following synthesis in gp91-PLB cells (26DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B., Yu, L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, these cells provide a source of native, monomeric Cytb subunits from which to test whether 7D5 recognizes individual gp65 or p22 phox subunits. Sequential immunoprecipitations were performed to determine whether 7D5 was capable of depleting lysates of Cyt b heterodimer and/or individual subunits (Fig. 4 A). Although 7D5 completely removed gp91-p22 phox heterodimer from lysates after three rounds of immunoprecipitation, monomeric gp65 could be subsequently precipitated from those lysates using αgp91 (Fig.4 A, arrowheads). Since neither gp91 phox nor p22 phox coprecipitated with gp65 using αgp91 following three rounds of precipitation with 7D5, gp65 was precipitated free of associated p22 phox . The finding that gp65 but neither gp91 phox nor p22 phox coprecipitated with αgp91 after the immunodepletions with 7D5 suggests that heterodimeric gp91 phox -p22 phox complexes were completely removed by 7D5 (Fig. 4 A). The inability to precipitate and detect by immunoblotting monomeric p22 phox following the three immunodepletions with 7D5 or those with 7D5 followed by a single depletion with αgp91 may be due to the rapid degradation of uncomplexed p22 phox or its rapid processing to heterodimeric form (26DeLeo F.R. Burritt J.B., Yu, L. Jesaitis A.J. Dinauer M.C. Nauseef W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13986-13993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). It is likely that the amount of newly synthesized, monomeric p22 phox present in the depleted lysates may have been below the limits of detection by immunoblotting. Therefore, we pulse-labeled gp91-PLB cells and subsequently chased for 2 h to allow for partial processing of gp65 to gp91 phox and also to allow the formation of gp91 phox -p22 phox complexes (Fig. 4 B). As with the unlabeled immunodepletion experiment, three rounds of precipitation of radiolabeled Cytb using 7D5 completely removed gp91 phox -p22 phox complexes from lysates (Fig.4 B). In contrast, following depletion with 7D5, subsequent precipitation with either αgp91 or αp22 revealed that both gp65 and p22 phox remained in depleted lysates free of their complementary subunit (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that 7D5 precipitated only gp91 phox -p22 phox or gp65-p22 phox heterodimers. To identify whether the 7D5 epitope was located on gp91 phox , p22 phox , or both subunits, we selected phage display library clones using a 7D5 immunoaffinity Sepharose bead matrix. Limiting dilutions were performed on each of three successive eluate samples, to determine the titer and to provide isolated plaques for plaque lift analysis. A six-log increase in the number of adherent clones was observed between the first and third round of selection, suggesting strong enrichment for peptide sequences by the antibody (data not shown). About 15% of the plaques from the second round and 95% of the plaques from the third round elution gave strong signals when probed by 7D5 in a plaque lift analysis (14Burritt J.B. Busse S.C.

Treatment of cells with carboxypeptidase B (CpB)1 reduces plasminogen binding to proteinaceous receptors on the cell surface (5Felez J. Miles L.A. Fabregas P. Jardi M. Plow E.F. Lijnen R.H. Thromb.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). COOH-terminal lysyl, rather than arginyl, residues are implicated as plasminogen binding sites because plasminogen has a much higher affinity for lysine than arginine. Although CpB treatment reduces plasminogen binding to U937 monocytoid cells by ∼60%, the cell surface-dependent enhancement of plasminogen activation is reduced by >95% (5Felez J. Miles L.A. Fabregas P. Jardi M. Plow E.F. Lijnen R.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 76: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This suggests that the class of plasminogen binding sites with COOH-terminal lysine residues accessible to CpB is predominantly responsible for the cell surface-dependent enhancement of plasminogen activation. α-Enolase is a candidate monocytoid cell plasminogen receptor with a COOH-terminal lysine (10Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 13Redlitz A. Fowler B.J. Plow E.F. Miles L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, the number of molecules of α-enolase present on the surface of U937 cells is only 10% of the number of plasminogen binding sites. In the current study, we have utilized susceptibility to CpB treatment as a means to identify a previously unrecognized plasminogen-binding protein that exposes a COOH-terminal lysine in an accessible orientation on the cell surface. To discriminate between such proteins and proteins with inaccessible COOH-terminal lysines, whole cells were treated with CpB to remove exposed COOH-terminal lysines. Cell membranes were subsequently prepared and analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) followed by ligand blotting with125I-plasminogen. Comparison of ligand blots of membranes of untreated intact cells with membranes of CpB-treated intact cells revealed the plasminogen-binding proteins that exposed COOH-terminal lysines on the cell surface, i.e. the class of plasminogen-binding proteins that is predominantly responsible for the cell surface-dependent enhancement of plasminogen activation. Using this methodology we have purified and identified a previously unrecognized plasminogen-binding protein present on the surface of U937 monocytoid cells. We obtained its cDNA sequence, which was identical to human TIP49a. TIP49a was characterized previously as a nuclear protein that has single-stranded DNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity (14Makino Y. Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y. Koji T. Tamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15329-15335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and is present in the cytosol as well (15Holzmann K. Gerner C. Korosec T. Poltl A. Grimm R. Sauermann G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we identify a new subcellular location for TIP49a and demonstrate that TIP49a binds plasminogen and enhances plasminogen activation. Glu-plasminogen was obtained from plasma prepared from fresh human blood collected into 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm benzamidine, 100 KIU/ml Trasylol (Miles, Kankakee, IL), and 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Glu-plasminogen was purified from the plasma by affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose (16Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar) in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 0.15 m NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) containing 1 mm benzamidine, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3, followed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-5m (Bio-Rad) as described previously (17Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11928-11934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of purified Glu-plasminogen was determined at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.61 E1 cm1% (18Wallen P. Wiman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 221: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Glu-plasminogen was iodinated to specific activities of 0.34–0.45 μCi/μg using the IODOGEN method (19Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3613) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat TIP49a was expressed as a fusion protein containing an NH2-terminal histidine tag in BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (20Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). The TIP49a protein was purified from bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose and Mono-Q chromatography as described (21Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Makino Y. Mimori T. Koike C. Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y. Inoue S. Kishimoto T. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against the recombinant rat TIP49a was generated by injection of protein recovered from sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels as described (21Kanemaki M. Makino Y. Yoshida T. Kishimoto T. Koga A. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto M. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Muramatsu M. Tamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To prepare peripheral blood monocytes, mononuclear cells first were isolated from fresh human blood collected into acid citrate dextrose. The blood was diluted with two volumes of RPMI 1640 medium without fetal calf serum, and 35-ml aliquots were layered onto 15 ml of Histopaque-1077 (Sigma), then centrifuged at 400 × g for 40 min at 20 °C. The upper layer was removed, and the interface containing the mononuclear cells was carefully aspirated. Contaminating erythrocytes were lysed by resuspending the mononuclear fraction in three volumes of H2O for 20 s, and then quenched with one volume of 0.6m KCl. The mononuclear cells were washed with PBS, then washed twice with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA. Monocytes were isolated from mononuclear cells using the MACS monocyte isolation kit (no. 533-01; Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For every 107 cells, the cell pellet was resuspended in 160 μl of PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 mm EDTA, and 10% heat-inactivated human serum (MACS buffer). 20 μl of FcR blocking reagent and 20 μl of hapten-antibody mixture were added, and the cells were incubated for 5 min on ice. The cells were washed twice, and then 20 μl of FcR blocking reagent and 20 μl of MACS anti-Hapten microbeads/107 cells were added, and the cells incubated for 15 min on ice. The cells were washed once in a 10-fold volume of MACS buffer and resuspended at a density of 2 × 108cells/ml in MACS buffer. The suspension was passed over a CS column in a VarioMACS magnetic separator, and the monocytes were collected as the unbound fraction. For CpB treatment of intact cells, the cells were washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 20 mmHEPES (HBSS). The cells were resuspended at a final concentration of 3 × 107 cells/ml, and CpB (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to a final concentration of 100 units/ml. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation every 5 min. Control cells were incubated with an equivalent volume of PBS. The cells retained >95% viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Prior to subcellular fractionation, cells were washed three times in HBSS, and resuspended at 3 × 107 cells/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing the protease inhibitors, 2 μm leupeptin (Calbiochem), 1.5 μm pepstatin A (Calbiochem), 50 KIU/ml Trasylol, 8 μm2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (Calbiochem), and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were chilled on ice for 5 min and then sheared in a 7-ml Dounce homogenizer (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). After homogenization, an equivalent volume of 20 mm HEPES containing 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and the protease inhibitors above was added to the cell homogenate. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was washed by centrifugation three times with 20 mm HEPES containing 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and the protease inhibitors above. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. Denaturing first dimension isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed in a vertical slab format. The IEF gel mixture contained 2% Triton X-100 and 9m urea with either 2.0% Bio-Lytes, pH 6–8 (Bio-Rad), or 2.0% Ampholine, pH 6–8 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), unless indicated otherwise, in a 4% polyacrylamide gel with piperazine diacrylamide (Bio-Rad) as cross-linker. Either 100 μg of membrane proteins or 10 μg of cytoplasmic proteins in 0.25% SDS, 2% Triton X-100, 9m urea, and 2% Ampholines were loaded onto the IEF gels, and focused under constant voltage using a stepped-voltage gradient from 50 to 250 V for a total of 4000 V-h, with the current never exceeding 15 mA. The IEF gels were fixed in 12% trichloroacetic acid and washed six times with 50 ml of H2O. Individual lanes were excised from the gels and soaked in reduced sample buffer to resolubilize the proteins. Each lane was placed on the second dimension gel and overlaid with molten 0.5% agarose in 120 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Second dimension SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Samples were subjected to 2D-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 100 mA for 18 h in either 25 mm Tris-HCl containing 192 mm glycine and 10% methanol or 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, with 10% methanol. Blots were blocked for 2 h in 2% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-BSA), then incubated with 50 nm125I-plasminogen in PBS-BSA for 2 h at 22 °C. The blots were washed seven times with PBS-BSA containing 0.5 m NaCl, then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Control blots were incubated with 50 nm125I-plasminogen in the presence of 0.1 mε-aminocaproic acid. Autoradiography was performed using BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Western blotting was performed on the Immobilon P membranes after probing as ligand blots with125I-plasminogen. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in bovine lactotransfer technique optimizer (5% dry nonfat milk in PBS with 0.03% antifoam A and 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (BLOTTO)) (24Johnson D.A. Gautsch J.W. Sportsman J.R. Elder J.H. Gene Anal. Tech. 1984; 1: 3-8Crossref Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The primary antibody was added for 1 h, and the membranes were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline (0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Pierce) was added for 1 h in TBST. The blots were washed three times with TBST and then subjected to chemiluminescent detection using either ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Supersignal CL-HRP (Pierce). Nunc Maxisorp 96-well plates were coated with either 5 μg/ml TIP49a or 10 mg/ml BSA in 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8.5, for 2 h at 37 °C. All wells were postcoated with 10 mg/ml BSA in PBS containing 0.025% Tween 80 (PBST-80) for 1 h at 22 °C, and then washed three times with 1 mg/ml BSA in PBST-80. The immobilized TIP49a or the control BSA-coated wells were incubated with varying concentrations of125I-plasminogen diluted into PBST-80 containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 4 h at 22 °C. The wells were washed four times with PBST-80, the bound 125I-plasminogen was solubilized with 10% SDS, and the radioactivity was quantitated by counting in a γ-counter (Iso-Data Inc., Palatine, IL). Nonspecific binding was determined as the amount of 125I-plasminogen bound to BSA, and specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. The binding kinetics were analyzed by weighted least squares regression using the program LIGAND (25Munson P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Nunc Maxisorp 96-well plates were coated with either 5 μg/ml TIP49a or 10 mg/ml BSA in 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8.5, for 2 h at 37 °C, or with 10 μg/ml fibrinogen in PBS for 90 min at 37 °C. The fibrinogen-coated wells were washed once with 50 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mg/ml gelatin, and 50 units/ml Trasylol, and treated with 60 ng/ml plasmin (Kabi Pharmacia Inc., Franklin, OH) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. The plasmin was inactivated with 0.1 mm p-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidine benzoate and 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride in PBS for 20 min at 25 °C. All wells were postcoated with 10 mg/ml BSA in PBST-80 for 1 h at 22 °C and washed three times with 1 mg/ml BSA in PBST-80. The immobilized TIP49a and plasmin-treated fibrinogen were incubated with varying concentrations of 125I-plasminogen diluted into PBST-80 containing 1 mg/ml BSA for 4 h at 22 °C. The wells were then washed four times with PBST-80. A duplicate 96-well plate was included to determine the amount of125I-plasminogen bound to TIP49a and plasmin-treated fibrinogen. The 125I-plasminogen bound in these duplicate wells was solubilized with 10% SDS, and the radioactivity was quantified by counting in a γ-counter. An amount of125I-plasminogen equivalent to the amount bound to the TIP49a-coated wells was added to the BSA-coated wells so that the effects of soluble plasminogen could be compared with plasminogen bound to either TIP49a or plasmin-treated fibrinogen. The plasmin substrate, S-2251 (DiaPharma Group Inc., Franklin, OH), was added to all wells to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and t-PA was added to 15 nm, then A405 was monitored as a measure of plasmin generation. Screening of expressed sequence tag (EST) clone 185194 by PCR was performed using 200 μm each dNTP, 300 nm each primer, 200 ng of plasmid template, and 0.75 unit of Expand Taq (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a 25-μl reaction containing 15 mm MgCl2. The reactions were denatured for 2 min at 94 °C, then subjected to 10 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C (30 s), hybridization at 55 °C (30 s), and extension at 68 °C (1 min), followed by 15 cycles where the extension was lengthened by 20 s each cycle. The forward primer was 5′-ATCAACGGATCCGCACTGTCCTAGCTGCTGGT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GGAATGGAATTCTGCAGACCCACGCCTGAATG-3′. The anti-α-enolase antibody was a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal nine amino acid residues of human α-enolase (13Redlitz A. Fowler B.J. Plow E.F. Miles L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The specificity of this antibody was established by comparison with an α-enolase-specific polyclonal antibody that was a kind gift of Dr. Kanefusa Kato (Institute for Developmental Research, Aichi, Japan) (26Kato K. Asai R. Shimizu A. Suzuki F. Ariyoshi Y. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 127: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and was specific for α-enolase when used for Western blotting. The anti-cytokeratin 8 antibody was clone M20 (Sigma). We examined U937 membrane-associated proteins for the presence of COOH-terminal lysines exposed to the extracellular environment. Intact U937 cells were incubated in either the presence or absence of 100 units/ml CpB prior to preparing membrane and cytoplasmic fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fractions were subjected to 2D-PAGE and ligand blotted with125I-plasminogen. Comparison of ligand blots from membrane fractions of intact control cells (Fig.1, panel A) with ligand blots of membrane fractions from intact cells treated with CpB (Fig. 1, panel C), showed that a prominent plasminogen-binding protein (mass ∼ 54 kDa, pI 6.5) was undetectable after CpB treatment of intact cells (arrow), indicating that it lost the ability to bind plasminogen. Cytoplasmic proteins did not show changes in plasminogen binding following CpB treatment of intact cells (Fig. 1, compare panels B and D), suggesting that proteolysis by CpB did not occur in the interior of intact cells. (One plasminogen-binding protein at ∼28 kDa was present in both membrane (panel A) and cytoplasmic (panel B) fractions and did show a decrease in 125I-plasminogen binding in the membrane fraction, and an anomalous decrease in125I-plasminogen binding in the cytoplasmic fraction following CpB treatment. Since only this single protein showed a decrease in 125I-plasminogen binding following CpB treatment in both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions, it most likely represents a contamination of the cytoplasmic preparation by this membrane protein). We examined whether the 54-kDa CpB-sensitive plasminogen-binding protein corresponded to either α-enolase or cytokeratin 8, since these known plasminogen-binding proteins are in the size range of the 54-kDa protein. Western blotting with an anti-α-enolase antibody was performed on the same blots used for ligand blotting of control membranes and cytosol. Two spots reacting with anti-α-enolase were observed on the Western blots at a similar size as the 54-kDa protein, but at different pI values (Fig. 1,panels E and F), consistent with the reported distribution of multiple α-enolase isoforms with distinct pI values (27Heydorn W.E. Creed G.J. Marangos P.J. Jacobowitz D.M. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cytokeratin 8 was not detected in U937 membranes or cytosol by Western blotting (data not shown), consistent with its reported pattern of expression (28Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar, 29Leube R.E. Bosch F.X. Romano V. Zimbelmann R. Hofler H. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1986; 33: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These data suggest that a previously unrecognized 54-kDa membrane-associated plasminogen-binding protein exposed a COOH-terminal lysine in an accessible orientation on the extracellular face of the cell. We examined whether the 54-kDa plasminogen-binding protein was up-regulated during cell death. Cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 18 h, resulting in an increase in the percentage of dead cells from 2% to 23% (as determined by propidium iodide incorporation measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting). The125I-plasminogen ligand blotting intensity of the 54-kDa protein increased ∼4-fold following the cycloheximide treatment (data not shown). To purify and identify the 54-kDa plasminogen-binding protein, we first examined whether the protein could be concentrated by solubilization of the U937 membranes in Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors. The Triton X-100 insoluble material was subsequently solubilized in 0.5% SDS, and both soluble and insoluble fractions were subjected to two-dimensional ligand blotting with125I-plasminogen. The 54-kDa protein was present in the Triton X-100 insoluble fraction in an ∼3-fold higher concentration than in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction (Fig.2). The concentration by Triton X-100 solubilization was sufficient to allow purification of the novel plasminogen-binding protein directly from two-dimensional gels. We sought to purify the 54-kDa plasminogen-binding protein directly from two-dimensional gels. 300 μg of the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction from U937 membranes were subjected to 2D-PAGE and replicate gels were either ligand-blotted with 125I-plasminogen (Fig.3, panel A) or stained with colloidal Coomassie (Fig. 3, panel B). Two replicate colloidal Coomassie-stained gels were aligned with the 125I-plasminogen ligand blot and the 54-kDa plasminogen-binding protein was excised from the gels. The protein was eluted from the gels and digested with trypsin. A capillary reverse-phase chromatograph coupled to the electrospray ionization source of a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer was used to obtain two peptide sequences, 11 and 18 residues, from the tryptic digest of the protein (Table I). The exact peptides were found in a rat protein, TATA-binding protein-interacting protein (TIP49a) by searching the nonredundant protein sequence data base (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). When we obtained these sequences, they were not present in the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant human protein data base.Table IAlignment of internal sequences of the 54-kDa plasminogen-binding protein with human TIP49aFragment 1L*D P S I*F*E S L*Q*K*Human TIP49aL D P S I F E S L Q KFragment 2R V E A G D V I*Y I*E A N S G A V K*Human TIP49aR V E A G D V I Y I E A N S G A V KAmino acid sequences of the peptides obtained by trypsin digestion of the purified 54 kDa plasminogen-binding protein are aligned with the cDNA-derived protein sequence of human TIP49a from Makino et al.

Isobaric residues are marked with an asterisk. BLAST searches of the nonredundant human EST data base yielded three ESTs whose calculated translation products were an exact match to the 11-residue peptide sequence from the 54-kDa protein, and one EST whose calculated translation product was an exact match to the 18-residue peptide sequence. The EST that matched the 18-residue peptide sequence also contained cDNA sequence encoding the 11-residue peptide sequence in frame with the other peptide sequence. These ESTs were used to search the TIGR Human Gene Index data base (available via the World Wide Web) for tentative human consensus (THC) sequences (31Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. Fleischmann R.D. Fuldner R.A. Bult C.J. Lee N.H. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Gocayne J.D. White O. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 3-174PubMed Google Scholar). The ESTs used to assemble the THC sequence were then used to search GenBank for additional ESTs with significant sequence identity. Alignment of the ESTs revealed that there were significant amounts of sequence not contained within the original THC, and that the aligned ESTs extended over two THC sequences, THC 171358 and THC 153501 (Fig.4). All ESTs mapped to this alignment, suggesting that only one molecule could account for the peptide sequences generated. A consensus sequence was generated from the EST alignment, and the predicted translation product of the consensus sequence was identical to the rat TIP49a protein except for five amino acid substitutions (Fig. 5).Figure 5Protein alignments.

https://openalex.org/W2055200476,"Gs is a heterotrimeric (α, β, and γ chains) G protein that couples heptahelical plasma membrane receptors to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Inactivation of one GNAS1 gene allele encoding the α chain of Gs (Gαs) causes pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia. Affected subjects have resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other hormones that activate adenylyl cyclase plus somatic features termed Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. By contrast, subjects with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib have hormone resistance that is limited to PTH and lack Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. The molecular basis for pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib is unknown. We analyzed the GNAS1 gene for mutations using polymerase chain reaction to amplify genomic DNA from three brothers with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib. We identified a novel heterozygous 3-base pair deletion causing loss of isoleucine 382 in the three affected boys and their clinically unaffected mother and maternal grandfather. This mutation was absent in other family members and 15 additional unrelated subjects with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib. To characterize the signaling properties of the mutant Gαs, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the isoleucine 382 deletion into a wild type Gαs cDNA, transfected HEK293 cells with either wild type or mutant Gαs cDNA, plus cDNAs encoding heptahelical receptors for PTH, thyrotropic hormone, or luteinizing hormone, and we measured cAMP production in response to hormone stimulation. The mutant Gαs protein was unable to interact with the receptor for PTH but showed normal coupling to the other coexpressed heptahelical receptors. These results provide evidence of selective uncoupling of the mutant Gαs from PTH receptors and explain PTH-specific hormone resistance in these three brothers with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib. The absence of PTH resistance in the mother and maternal grandfather who carry the same mutation is consistent with current models of paternal imprinting of the GNAS1 gene. Gs is a heterotrimeric (α, β, and γ chains) G protein that couples heptahelical plasma membrane receptors to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Inactivation of one GNAS1 gene allele encoding the α chain of Gs (Gαs) causes pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia. Affected subjects have resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other hormones that activate adenylyl cyclase plus somatic features termed Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. By contrast, subjects with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib have hormone resistance that is limited to PTH and lack Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.

Burnett C.H. Smith P.H. Endocrinology. 1942; 30: 922-932Google Scholar) describes a group of disorders characterized by biochemical hypoparathyroidism (i.e. hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia), increased secretion of PTH, and target tissue unresponsiveness to the biological actions of PTH (1Albright F. Burnett C.H. Smith P.H. Endocrinology. 1942; 30: 922-932Google Scholar). Patients with PHP type I show neither a phosphaturic nor a nephrogenous cyclic AMP response to administration of exogenous PTH. These findings have implicated a defect in the PTH receptor-G-protein-adenylyl cyclase complex in cells of the proximal renal tubule as the basis for impaired PTH responsiveness. In one form of PHP, the type Ia variant (2Levine M.A. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000: 1133-1153Google Scholar), patients are resistant to PTH as well as multiple other hormones (3Levine M.A. Downs Jr., R.W. Moses A.M. Breslau N.A. Marx S.J. Lasker R.D. Rizzoli R.E. Aurbach G.D. Spiegel A.M. Am. J. Med. 1983; 74: 545-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) that bind to receptors that are coupled by the stimulatory G protein (Gs) to activation of adenylyl cyclase. In addition to hormone resistance, patients with PHP type Ia also manifest a peculiar constellation of developmental and somatic defects, including short stature, round faces, brachydactyly, and subcutaneous ossifications, that are collectively termed Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) (1Albright F. Burnett C.H. Smith P.H. Endocrinology. 1942; 30: 922-932Google Scholar). The diverse clinical manifestations of AHO have been attributed to heterozygous mutations in the GNAS1 gene that lead to widespread deficiency of the α subunit of Gs (Gαs) (4Levine M.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Patten J.L. Johns D.R. Valle D. Eil C. Gruppuso P.A. Steele G. Smallwood P.M. Levine M.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1412-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Although most subjects with GNAS1 mutations have hormone resistance, and thus PHP type 1a, in many families some members have AHO and normal hormone responsiveness, a condition termed pseudo-PHP (PPHP) (4Levine M.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Patten J.L. Johns D.R. Valle D. Eil C. Gruppuso P.A. Steele G. Smallwood P.M. Levine M.A. N. Engl. J.

In a second form of PHP, termed type Ib, patients have normal Gαs activity in accessible cells, lack features of AHO (7Winter J.S.D. Hughes I.A. Can. Med. Assoc. J. 1980; 123: 26-31PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nusynowitz M.L. Frame B. Kolb F.O. Medicine (Baltimore). 1976; 55: 105-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and have hormone resistance that is limited to PTH (3Levine M.A. Downs Jr., R.W. Moses A.M. Breslau N.A. Marx S.J.

Specific resistance of target tissues to PTH and normal Gαs activity had implicated decreased expression or function of the classical or type 1 PTH receptor (PTHR1) that is expressed in bone and kidney as the cause for hormone resistance. However, molecular studies have failed to disclose mutations in the coding exons (9Schipani E. Weinstein L.S. Bergwitz C. Iida-Klein A. Kong X.F. Stuhrmann M. Kruse K. Whyte M.P. Murray T.

Indeed, inheritance of two defective-type PTHR1 alleles results in Blomstrand chondrodysplasia, a lethal genetic disorder that is characterized by advanced endochondral bone maturation (13Jobert A.S. Zhang P. Couvineau A. Bonaventure J. Roume J. Le Merrer M. Silve C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Most cases of PHP type Ib appear to be sporadic, but familial cases have been described in which transmission of the defect is most consistent with an autosomal dominant pattern (7Winter J.S.D. Hughes I.A. Can. Med. Assoc. J. 1980; 123: 26-31PubMed Google Scholar, 14Allen D.B. Friedman A.L. Greer F.R. Chesney R.W. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1988; 31: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recent studies using linkage analysis have mapped the genetic locus for PHP type 1b to a small region of chromosome 20q13.3 near the GNAS1 gene, thus raising the possibility that some patients with PHP type Ib have inherited a GNAS1 mutation that leads to a selective defect in PTH-dependent signaling (15Juppner H. Schipani E. Bastepe M. Cole D.E. Lawson M.L. Mannstadt M. Hendy G.N. Plotkin H. Koshiyama H. Koh T. Crawford J.D. Olsen B.R. Vikkula M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11798-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this report we describe a unique mutation in the GNAS1 gene that caused autosomal dominant PTH resistance in three brothers with PHP type Ib, but which was clinically silent in their mother and maternal grandfather. These findings confirm that discrete mutations in this G protein can produce a highly specific phenotype and provide additional evidence that imprinting of the GNAS1 gene may explain variable manifestations of the same mutation. Bovine (Nle8,18,Tyr34)-PTH-(1–34)-amide peptide was purchased from Bachem (Torrence, CA). Human chorionic gonadotropin, bovine thyrotropic hormone (bTSH), and (−)-isoproterenol-(+)-bitartrate were purchased from Sigma. Plasmid containing the cDNA for the human TSH receptor was a generous gift of Dr. L. Kohn (National Institutes of Health), and plasmid containing the rat LH receptor was a generous gift of Dr. Deborah Segaloff (University of Iowa). The human kidney PTHR1 cDNA has been described previously (16Adams A.E. Pines M. Nakamoto C. Behar V. Yang Q.M. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Levine M.A. Suva L.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10553-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All receptor cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pcDNAI/Amp (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Erythrocyte membranes were prepared by hypotonic lysis as described previously (17Cain C.D. Adey W.R. Luben R.A. J. Bone. Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and activity of detergent-solubilized Gαs was determined by assessing reconstitution of hormone-sensitive adenylyl cyclase activity of S49 cyc membranes in the presence of 10 μm l-isoproterenol plus 0.1 mm GTPγS (18Gierschik P. Codina J. Simons C. Birnbaumer L. Spiegel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To prepare a particulate fraction (referred to as “membranes”) from transfected HEK293 cells, cultured cells were incubated with a hypotonic lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently harvested by scraping with a Teflon policeman. Cells were disrupted by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (loose-fitting) on wet ice and then centrifuged at 480 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Membranes were suspended in 25 mm HEPES and 1 mmdithiothreitol and stored at −70 °C until used. Expression of Gαs protein in erythrocyte and HEK293 membranes was determined by immunoblot analysis using 50-μg samples of membrane protein, as described previously (19Patten J.L. Levine M.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1990; 71: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), using a polyclonal antibody (RM/1) directed against a carboxyl terminus decapeptide of Gαs (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Levels of immunoreactive Gαs protein were normalized to the level of Gβ protein using a polyclonal antibody that reacts with the common forms of Gβ. Protein was assayed with the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. Exons 1–13 and the flanking intron sequences of the human GNAS1 gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (20Miric A. Vechio J.D. Levine M.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1993; 76: 1560-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 21Jan de Beur S.M. Deng Z. Ding C.L. Levine M.A. Proceedings of the 80th Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, New Orleans. Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD1998: 62Google Scholar) using genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Amplified DNA fragments were analyzed first by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to assess the size of the fragments and then by DGGE to detect mutations (20Miric A. Vechio J.D. Levine M.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1993; 76: 1560-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA fragments that migrated anomalously were precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol and taken up in TE (10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8) prior to ligation into the plasmid cloning vector pCRII (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). DNA from individual clones was sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52602) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Total cellular RNA was isolated from isolated mononuclear cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate-cesium chloride technique (23Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar), and RT-PCR was used to amplify a portion of Gαs mRNA as described previously (24Namnoum A.B. Merriam G.R. Moses A.M. Levine M.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1998; 83: 824-829PubMed Google Scholar). One-fifth of the first strand cDNA served as a template in a 50-μl reaction with 50 pmol of sense primer 5′ AM21 located in exon 8 and antisense primer 5′ MAL21 located in exon 13 (20). By using PCR, we introduced the ΔIle382 mutation into a wild type human Gαs cDNA (5Patten J.L. Johns D.R. Valle D. Eil C. Gruppuso P.A. Steele G. Smallwood P.M. Levine M.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1412-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) that contained a hemagglutinin epitope tag (codons 76–82, DVPDYAS) in exon 3 (25Gejman P.V. Weinstein L.S. Martinez M. Spiegel A.M. Cao Q. Hsieh W.T. Hoehe M.R. Gershon E.S. Genomics. 1991; 9: 782-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, overlapping DNA fragments were amplified using the full-length human GαscDNA as a template. The 5′ fragment was amplified with upstream primer D1 (5′CAAGCAAGATCTGCTCGCTGAGA3′) spanning the unique BglII restriction site and downstream primer D2 (5′TGCGCTGAATGTCACGGCAGTCGT3′) spanning the 3-base pair deletion. The 3′ fragment was amplified with upstream primer D3 (5′ACGACTGCCGTGACATTCAGCGCA3′) spanning the 3-base pair deletion and downstream primer D4 (5′GTAGGCCGCCTTAAGCTTTCTAAAT3′) spanning the unique HindIII restriction site. These PCR products were then mixed, denatured at 95 °C, and annealed together by cooling to 25 °C at 1 °C/s and then used as a template to amplify a BglII-HindIII cassette. The cassette was sequenced to confirm the introduction of the mutation, and the BglII-HindIII fragment was used to replace the corresponding wild type sequence in the Gαs cDNA. Wild type and mutant Gsα cDNA were subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 expression vector (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for transient transfection of HEK293 cells (2 × 106 in a T75 culture flask) with 8 μg of plasmid DNA. After incubation overnight, cells were replated into 24-well dishes (105 cells per well), and assays of cAMP production were performed 48 h later as described previously (26Levine M.A. Eil C. Downs Jr., R.W. Spiegel A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ratio of wild type Gαs plasmid to receptor plasmid was determined empirically for each receptor to obtain optimized hormone-sensitive accumulation of cAMP. Triplicate measurements were made, and experiments were repeated at least three times. Data points were normalized for cell protein and expressed in terms of maximal cAMP accumulation in the presence of wild type Gαs. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed with Prism software (version 2.0, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The proband (subject III-3 in Fig. 1) and his two brothers were referred for evaluation of PHP when they were discovered to have elevated levels of serum PTH during an investigation of hypocalcemia. The three brothers had normal intellectual function and were at or above the 50th percentile for height; only one (III-3) of the three boys was obese (39 kg, >95th percentile) (TableI). Physical examination of the three boys, their unaffected sister, and their parents failed to disclose evidence of subcutaneous ossifications, brachydactyly, or other features of AHO, and radiographs of hands and feet were normal. All three brothers had elevated levels of intact PTH levels and failed to show a significant increase in the urinary excretion of nephrogenous cAMP after intravenous infusion of 200 units of synthetic human PTH-(1–34) (Table II). By contrast, their mother showed a normal urinary cAMP response to administration of human PTH-(1–34). Serum levels of magnesium, 25-(OH)-vitamin D, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and TSH were within the normal range, and serum levels of testosterone were appropriate for age in all three boys (Table II). Subjects III-1 and III-2 showed pubertal LH and follicle-stimulating hormone responses to intravenous infusion of synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (100 μg), and subject III-3 showed a prepubertal response. All studies were approved by the Joint Committee on Clinical Investigation of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and written informed consent was given by the study subjects or their parents.Table IPhysical characteristics of the three affected brothersAge at evaluationBone age (chronological)HeightWeightyearsIII-111 3/1214 (12)146.9 cm (50th)48.1 kg (90th)III-28 8/129 6/12 (9 2/12)130.4 cm (50th)28.9 kg (50th)III-37 2/129 6/12 (7 8/12)132 cm (>95th)39 kg (>95th) Open table in a new tab Table IILaboratory evaluationII-2III-1III-2III-3III-4Serum calcium (8.8–10.4 mg/dl)9.17.49.18.09.6Serum phosphate (3.8–6.0 mg/dl, child) (2.5–4.5 mg/dl, adult)2.77.45.54.9ND2-aND indicates not determined.Intact PTH-(1–84) (10–65 pg/ml)5541627620040PTH infusion, peak UcAMP (nmol/dl GF)118443NDTestosteroneND154 ng/dl84 ng/dl11 ng/dlNDFree testosteroneND22.7 pg/ml11.3 pg/ml1.3 pg/mlNDGnRH infusion2-bGnRH indicates gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

Open table in a new tab Semi-quantitative immunoblot analysis was performed in triplicate and demonstrated that levels of Gαs protein (Fig. 1) were not reduced in erythrocyte membranes prepared from the three affected brothers (134 ± 8%) as compared with other unaffected family members (99.3 ± 2.1%) or a control group of unrelated normal subjects (92 ± 8%). To examine the functional activity of the erythrocyte Gαs protein, we assessed the ability of detergent-solubilized Gs from erythrocyte membranes to reconstitute a hormonally responsive adenylyl cyclase system in membranes prepared from the cyc− clone of S49 murine lymphoma, which genetically lacks Gαs protein (27Sullivan K.A. Liao Y.C. Alborzi A. Beiderman B. Chang F.H. Masters S.B. Levinson A.D. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6687-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Addition of increasing amounts of erythrocyte membrane extract to constant amounts of cyc− membranes produced linear increases inl-isoproterenol (10 μm)-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, with regression slopes for the three affected members (III-1, III-2 III-3; 60.8 ± 4.3) and two members who were unaffected carriers (I-1 and II-2; 69.3 ± 2.0) that were equivalent (Fig. 2). No abnormalities were found in exons 1–12 of the proband's gene for Gαs. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.3 B) and DGGE (Fig.3 C) of DNA fragments amplified from exon 13 revealed additional bands indicating the presence of an abnormal allele. Although the typical pattern for heterozygous alleles on a denaturing gradient gel is composed of four bands, of which two bands represent homoduplex fragments and two bands represent heteroduplex fragments (28Fischer S.G. Lerman L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 29Myers R.M. Fischer S.G. Maniatis T. Lerman L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3111-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30Myers R.M. Maniatis T. Lerman L.S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 501-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), DGGE of this PCR product consistently resolved only three bands. Thus, it is likely that under the conditions we employed the two slowly migrating heteroduplex fragments migrated as a single band on the denaturing gradient gel. The exon 13 PCR products were ligated into the plasmid vector pCRII, and DNA from individual clones was sequenced. Of 10 clones sequenced, 4 contained the wild type sequence for Gαs exon 13. In addition, 6 clones contained inserts in which there was a 3-base pair deletion (CAT) that eliminated an isoleucine residue at position 382 (ΔIle382) of Gαs protein (Fig. 4). RT-PCR of Gαs mRNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells amplified equivalent amounts of wild type and mutant cDNA, indicating that mRNA derived from the mutant allele was stable (data not shown).Figure 4Sequence analysis of antisense strand of exon 13 of the GNAS1 gene. Exon 13 was amplified by PCR of genomic DNA from the propositus, and after ethanol precipitation the DNA was ligated into the plasmid vector pCRII. DNA from individual clones was sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sequence analysis showed a heterozygous mutation (wild type Normal Allele in left panel; mutant Abnormal Allele in right panel) in which one allele contained a 3-base pair deletion (CAT) that results in the in-frame loss of the isoleucine residue at codon 382.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To genotype the rest of the family, PCR products of exon 13 from all available members were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and DGGE. DNA from the clinically unaffected mother (II-1, Fig. 3) and maternal grandfather showed patterns consistent with heterozygosity for the ΔIle382 mutation, whereas DNA from all other family members migrated as single bands indicating homozygosity for the wild type GNAS1 allele (Fig. 3 and not shown). The ΔIle382 mutation was not present in genomic DNA from 15 additional unrelated subjects with PHP type 1b or from 30 other normal, unrelated subjects (data not shown). The ΔIle382 mutation occurs in the middle of the α5 helix at the carboxyl terminus of the protein, a region that contributes importantly to receptor selectivity. The characteristics of the ΔIle382 mutation were assessed by transiently expressing wild type and mutant forms of Gαsplus cDNAs encoding G protein-coupled receptors in HEK293 cells at 37 °C. Immunoblot analyses revealed that the Gαscontaining the ΔIle382 mutation was expressed at a level that was similar (118 ± 11%) to that of the wild type recombinant Gαs protein under all experimental conditions (Fig. 5). Moreover, cells that expressed mutant or wild type Gαs proteins produced similar agonist-dependent increases in cAMP when incubated with various concentrations of l-isoproterenol, which activates endogenous β-adrenergic receptors (Fig.6 B). However, as the Bmax for isoproterenol stimulation was slightly reduced for the mutant Gαs protein, we cannot exclude a subtle defect in coupling to β-adrenergic receptors. To assess the functional effects of the ΔIle382 mutation on receptor coupling, wild type and mutant forms of Gαs were transiently coexpressed in HEK293 cells with specific receptors that can mediate activation of Gs but that are not found in HEK293 cells (31Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Brandon S. Bourne H.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5730-5734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and after incubation with various concentrations of hormones the production of cAMP was measured. Cells transfected with the human PTHR1 showed a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP accumulation after incubation with 10−11 to 10−7m bPTH-(1–34), and this response was significantly enhanced in cells that had been cotransfected with the wild type Gαs cDNA (Fig. 6 A). By contrast, HEK293 cells that had been cotransfected with the cDNAs for the mutant Gαs and hPTHR1 showed cAMP responses to PTH (Fig.6 A) and PTHrP (data not shown) that were no greater than those in cells that had been transfected with only the hPTHR1.Figure 6Functional studies of the recombinant wild type and mutant Gαs proteins.HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors (pcDNA3.1) encoding the wild type (WT) or mutant (MUT) Gαs proteins, plus expression vectors (pcDNA1/Amp) encoding the PTHR1 (A), the TSH receptor (C), or the LH receptor (D). The cells were incubated for 10 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated agonist, and cyclic AMP was extracted and measured by radioimmunoassay. Each point represents the mean (±S.E.) of at least three experiments in which triplicate determinations were performed. The level of cyclic AMP is expressed in terms of maximal agonist-induced accumulation (100%) by cells expressing wild type Gαs. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid containing PTHR1 or LH receptors plus 4 μg of Gαs plasmid and 6 μg of plasmid containing TSH receptor plus 2 μg of Gαs plasmid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the ability of the mutant Gαs protein to couple to other heptahelical receptors, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with wild type or mutant Gαs cDNAs plus cDNAs encoding the TSH receptor or LH receptor. After incubation with various concentrations of either bTSH or human chorionic gonadotropin, the accumulation of cAMP was measured. At all concentrations of hormone tested, cells expressing the wild type or mutant GαscDNAs showed similar increases in cAMP that were significantly greater than those in cells expressing the receptor alone (Fig. 6,C and D). PHP type Ib is characterized by isolated resistance to PTH and an absence of features of AHO, and thus appears to be biochemically and clinically distinct from PHP-type Ia. The identification of a novel germ line mutation, ΔIle382, in the gene encoding Gαs in three boys with PHP type Ib provides a new example of how an inactivating mutation of a widely expressed G protein can cause a limited disease. When expressed in vitro this mutant Gαs was unable to couple to the PTHR1 but was able to interact normally with a variety of other heptahelical receptors (i.e. LH, TSH, and β-adrenergic receptors) that require Gαs to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. The ability of the mutant Gαs protein to activate these other receptors normally effectively excludes defects in βγ subunit interaction and suggests another mechanism for the selective uncoupling from the PTHR1. Several lines of evidence indicate that these findings are the result of differential efficiency in receptor coupling rather than artifact owing from differences in Gαs or receptor expression. First, semi-quantitative immunoblot analysis demonstrated equivalent expression of the mutant and wild type Gαs recombinant proteins in"

IKACh was recorded in mouse atrial myocytes using the patch clamp technique.IKACh was activated by 10 μm ACh and the current decreased by 44.27 ± 2.38% (n = 12) during 4 min due to ACh-induced desensitization. When PE was applied with ACh, the extent of desensitization was markedly increased to 69.34 ± 2.22% (n = 9), indicating the presence of PE-induced desensitization. IKAChwas fully recovered from desensitization after a 6-min washout. PE-induced desensitization of IKACh was not affected by protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C, but abolished by phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, neomycin. When phophatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) replenishment was blocked by wortmannin (an inhibitor of phophatidylinositol 3-kinase and phophatidylinositol 4-kinase), desensitization of IKACh in the presence of PE was further increased (97.25 ± 7.63%, n = 6). Furthermore, the recovery from PE-induced desensitization was inhibited, and the amplitude of IKACh at the second exposure after washout was reduced to 19.65 ± 2.61% (n = 6) of the preceding level. These data suggest that the KAChchannel is modulated by PE through PLC stimulation and depletion of PIP2.

Recently, it was shown that PIP2 is not just a precursor, but also exerts a direct role in the regulation of various ion transporters, such as Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (1Hilgemann D.W. Ball R.

This result may imply that PIP2 is a final regulator molecule for GIRK channel activity and that Gβγ exerts its effect by strengthening the interaction of the channel with PIP2. The KACh channel in cardiac myocytes is believed to be heterotetrameric complex formed by GIRK1 and GIRK4. Slowing of heart rate by vagal stimulation is known to be mediated by the activation of KACh channels, which leads to hyperpolarization of membrane potentials in pacemaking cells and in atrial myocytes (13Sakmann B.

It is also well known that the effect of vagal stimulation fades gradually (vagal escape), due to desensitization of KACh currents (18Martin P. Levy M.N. Matsuda Y. J. Physiol.

Kodama I. Zang W.J. Boyett M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H1779-H1789PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms of KACh activation and desensitization have been subjects of intense researches for more than a decade. However, it is not yet clear whether the recent view on the mechanism of GIRK channel regulation is valid for native KACh channels. It has been generally believed that direct binding of Gβγ to the channel results in activation (23Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 24Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29059-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), but the role of PIP2 in this process is still controversial. In rat atrial myocytes, exogenously applied PIP2 and other phospholipid were reported to block agonist-mediated KAChchannel activation (25Kim D. Bang H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 59-74Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of PIP2 in normal signaling pathway for the regulation of native KACh channels. Considering that PIP2content in the membrane can be controlled by the PLC-linked receptor (26Jenkinson S. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1138-1148PubMed Google Scholar, 27Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5037-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we used mouse atrial myocytes that possess both PLC-linked receptors, such as α1-adrenergic receptor and KACh channels. The results of the present study show that the α1-adrenergic agonist accelerates desensitization of the KACh channel, possibly through the depletion of the PIP2 pool in plasma membrane, supporting the hypothesis that PIP2 is acting as a signal molecule in the regulation of KACh channels through α1-adrenergic pathway. The isolation of single atrial myocytes from mice was performed as described by Harrison et al. (28Harrison S.M. McCall E. Boyett M.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 449: 517-550Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the heart was quickly removed. The heart was cannulated by a 24-gauge needle and then retrogradely perfused via the aorta on a Langendorff apparatus. During coronary perfusion all perfusates were maintained at 37 °C and equilibrated with 100% O2. Initially the heart was perfused with normal Tyrode solution for 2–3 min to clear the blood. The heart was then perfused with Ca2+-free solution for 2 min. Finally the heart was perfused with enzyme solution for 14–16 min. Enzyme solution contains 0.14 mg ml−1 collagenase (Sigma Type 5) in Ca2+-free solution. After perfusion with enzyme solution, the atria were separated from the ventricles and chopped into small pieces. Single cells were dissociated in high K+, low Cl− storage medium from these small pieces using blunt-tip glass pipette. Cells were stored at 4 °C until use. Normal Tyrode solution contained (mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 5 HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Ca2+-free solution contained (mM): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 5 HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The high K+, low Cl− storage medium contained (mM): 70 KOH, 40 KCl, 50 l-glutamic acid, 20 taurine, 20 KH2PO4, 3 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA. Pipette solution contained (mM): 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, titrated to pH 7.2 with KOH. ACh chloride (Sigma), phenylephrine (Sigma), and neomycin (Biomol) were dissolved in deionized water to make a stock solution and stored at −20 °C. On the day of experiments one aliquot was thawed and used. Calphostin C (Biomol) and wortmannin (WMN; Biomol) were first dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as a stock solution and then used at the final concentration in the solution. All experiments were conducted at 35 ± 1 °C. In the presence of ACh, 10 μm glibenclamide was applied to inhibit the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. Cells were superfused with solution by gravity at ∼5 ml/min. Approximately 30 s were required to change completely the bath contents. Membrane currents were recorded in nystatin-perforated patch configuration using an Axopatch-1C amplifier (Axon Instruments). Nystatin forms voltage-insensitive ion pores in the membrane patch that are somewhat selective for cations over anions but are impermeant to Ca2+ and other multivalent ions or molecules >0.8 nm in diameter (29Korn S.J. Horn R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 789-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This method, therefore, minimizes dialysis of intracellular constituents with the internal pipette solution. Nystatin was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 50 mg/ml and then added to the internal pipette solution to yield a final nystatin concentration of 200 μg/ml. The patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, United Kingdom) using a Narishige puller (PP-83; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). We used patch pipettes with a resistance of 2–3 megaohms when filled with the above pipette solutions. The electrical signals were displayed during the experiments on an oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS 210) and a chart recorder (Gould). Data were digitized with pClamp software 5.7.1 (Axon Instruments) at a sampling rate of 1–2 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. Voltage clamp and data acquisitions were performed by a digital interface (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments) coupled to an IBM-compatible computer using pClamp software 5.7.1 (Axon Instruments) at a sampling rate of 1–2 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. The results in the text and in the figures are presented as means ± S.E.,n = number of cells tested. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. The difference between two groups was considered to be significant when p < 0.01 and not significant when p > 0.05. Acetylcholine-activated K+ current (IKACh) was activated by adding 10 μm acetylcholine (ACh) to the bath solution, while the cell was voltage-clamped at the holding potential of −40 mV (Fig.1 A). Upon the application of ACh, a rapid increase in outward current was observed. Despite the continuous presence of ACh, the activation of IKACh was not sustained at its peak, but the amplitude of IKACh decreased slowly. We regarded this decrease as a result of ACh-induced desensitization of IKACh. The ACh-induced desensitization was recovered after washout of ACh, so that the amplitude of IKACh at the second exposure to ACh in a 6-min interval was similar to that at the first exposure. In subsequent experiments, such a paired application of ACh was used for investigating the effect of various signal molecules on regulation of KACh channel, regarding the IKACh at the first response as the control. Characteristics of IKACh activation and desensitization were further investigated from the current-voltage (I-V) curves. I-V curves were obtained from the current response induced by voltage ramps between +60 and −120 mV (at a speed of ± 0.6 V s−1) from the holding potential of −40 mV. The ramps were applied before ACh application (a), at peak (b), 4 min in ACh (c), and washout of ACh (d), as indicated in Fig. 1 A. Corresponding I-V curves were plotted in Fig. 1 B: the reversal potentials were shifted slightly to negative potentials toward K + equilibrium potential, and the shape of I-V curves was changed by ACh. The degree of inward rectification was less strong in the presence of ACh (b and c) compared with that in control (a). A strong inward rectification in “a” is considered to be typical for inward rectifying K+ currents, IRK (30Simmons M.A. Hartzell H.C. Pfluegers Arch. 1987; 409: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The I-V curves for net IKACh were obtained by subtracting the control curve (a) from the I-V curves in the presence of ACh, as shown in Fig.1 C: “b-a” represents IKACh at peak (IKACh, peak), and “c-a” represents IKAChat 4 min in ACh (IKACh, 4 min). The shape of inward rectification and the reversal potential of two curves were not different, indicating that the decrease in current amplitude during exposure to ACh occurs uniformly over the voltage range tested. In Fig.2 A, 100 μmphenylephrine (PE) was applied together at the second exposure to ACh. From the continuous recording of current trace at −40 mV, it was noticed that the process of desensitization was markedly accelerated by PE, resulting in a greater reduction of IKAChafter the same period (Fig. 2 A). But, the amplitude of IKACh at peak was not significantly affected by PE. We regarded this increased desensitization by PE as PE-induced desensitization. The effect of PE on IKAChdesensitization was well illustrated in I-V curves: the difference between IKACh, peak (b′-a′) and IKACh, 4 min (c′-a′) in the presence of PE was significantly greater compared with the control (Fig. 2, B and C). But PE did not affect the degree of inward rectification and the reversal potential, indicating that PE modulates IKACh itself, rather than modulating other current systems. PE-induced desensitization was also reversible after a 6-min recovery period, and the third exposure to ACh elicited an outward current with a similar peak amplitude and desensitization (Fig.2 A). The data were summarized in Fig. 2 D. The amplitude of IKACh was measured at −40 mV to minimize the possible contamination of IRK and voltage-activated K+currents. The amplitude of IKACh at peak was not significantly different between control (775.90 ± 90.29 pA,n = 12) and PE (644.96 ± 94.21 pA,n = 9). However, the amplitude of IKACh at 4 min in ACh was significantly smaller in PE, indicating that desensitization was increased by PE. When the extent of desensitization was determined as a proportion of the current decrease during 4 min, it was 44.27 ± 2.38% (n = 12) in control and increased significantly to 69.34 ± 2.22% (n = 9) by PE. To elucidate the mechanisms for PE-induced desensitization, we blocked each step of the signal transduction pathway related with PE. When PKC inhibitor, calphostin C (2.5 μm), was pretreated before the application of PE at the second exposure to ACh, acceleration of IKAChdesensitization by PE was still observed (Fig.3 A). To focus on the change in desensitization, I-V curves for desensitized current were plotted in Fig. 3 B. It was noticed that desensitized current in the presence of PE and calphostin C (b′-c′) was almost completely overlapped by that in the presence of PE only (b-c). The extent of desensitization in the presence of PE and calphostin C was 79.20 ± 4.46% (n = 4), indicating no significant difference from that in the presence of PE only (69.34 ± 2.22%). Furthermore phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm), a specific PKC activator, did not mimic the effect of PE on the desensitization of IKACh (n = 5, data not shown). The amplitude of IKACh at peak was affected neither by calphostin C nor by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. We then tested the effect of PLC inhibitor, neomycin. When neomycin (500 μm) was pretreated before the application of PE at the second exposure to ACh, the increase in desensitization by PE was no longer observed (Fig. 3 C). This finding suggests that PE-induced desensitization of IKAChis antagonized by neomycin. The I-V curve for desensitized current in the presence of neomycin and PE (b′-c′) was significantly smaller than that in the presence of PE (b-a). The extent of desensitization in the presence of PE and neomycin was 48.79 ± 3.95% (n = 9), showing a significant difference from the extent of desensitization in the presence of PE (69.34 ± 2.22%), but not different from the control (44.27 ± 2.38%). Neomycin itself did not significantly affect the activation of IKACh and ACh-induced desensitization (IKACh, peak: 759.20 ± 93.43 pA; desensitization: 48.65 ± 3.76%, n = 7). The extent of desensitization obtained in various conditions was summarized in Fig. 3 E. Based on these results, it is suggested that PE-induced desensitization of IKACh is the result of the activation of PLC, but not through the activation of PKC. We postulated that PLC involvement is related with PIP2, and this possibility was tested by using WMN (an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase and PI 4-kinase). It was reported that WMN inhibits the replenishment of PIP2 after the depletion of PIP2 by the receptor-mediated activation of PLC (27Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5037-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the inhibition of PIP2replenishment by WMN affects PE-induced desensitization of KACh current and its recovery. In Fig.4 A, we first applied ACh and PE simultaneously to induce the increased desensitization of IKACh and confirmed the full recovery of IKACh from desensitization after a 6-min washout with normal Tyrode solution. Then the same series of experiment was performed in the presence of 100 μm WMN (Fig.4 B). PE-induced desensitization of IKACh was greatly accelerated by WMN, and IKACh, 4 min became very smaller. The extent of desensitization in the presence of WMN was 97.25 ± 7.63% (n = 6), and this value was significantly greater than 64.22 ± 5.70% (n = 7) in the absence of WMN. In contrast, WMN alone without PE did not significantly affect the activation and desensitization of IKACh(IKACh, peak: 603.14 ± 80.63 pA; desensitization: 45.84 ± 4.07%, n = 6, data not shown). These results suggest that blockade of PIP2synthesis by WMN facilitated PE-induced desensitization, but not ACh-induced desensitization. IKACh, peak was not different, but IKACh, peak was significantly smaller in the presence of WMN, indicating that PE-induced desensitization of IKACh was further accelerated by WMN. The extent of desensitization in the presence of WMN was 97.25 ± 7.63% (n = 6), and it was significantly greater than 64.22 ± 5.70% (n = 7) in the absence of WMN. In contrast, WMN alone without PE did not significantly affect the activation and desensitization of IKACh(IKACh, peak: 603.14 ± 80.63 pA; desensitization: 45.84 ± 4.07%, n = 6, data not shown). These results suggest that blockade of PIP2synthesis by WMN facilitated PE-induced desensitization, but not ACh-induced desensitization. The recovery from PE-induced desensitization was also affected by WMN (Fig. 4 B). In the continuous presence of WMN, the amplitude of IKACh, peak measured at the second exposure to ACh was only 19.65 ± 2.61% (n = 6) of the preceding level (Fig. 4 D), indicating that the recovery from desensitization was significantly inhibited by WMN. WMN also inhibited the recovery from ACh-induced desensitization, but to a lesser extent: IKACh, peak measured at the second exposure to ACh in the absence of PE was 70.92 ± 9.18% of preceding level (n = 6, data not shown). The degree of inhibition is comparable with the magnitude reduction of basal PIP2levels in unstimulated cells by WMN in this period time (27Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5037-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), suggesting that the incomplete recovery of ACh-induced desensitization was the result of basal reduction of PIP2 level by WMN. Facilitation of PE effect by WMN was further confirmed in Fig.4 C, where PIP2 pool in the membrane was depleted before the first exposure to ACh by pretreating WMN and PE for 3 min. The amplitude of IKACh, peak was only 178.33 ± 85.36 pA (n = 3), and this value was significantly smaller than IKACh, peak in control (775.90 ± 90.29 pA,n = 12). Above results imply that depletion of PIP2 pool by PE causes a decrease in IKACh and that the increase in desensitization by PE can be explained by the same mechanism. As well as KACh channel, IRK is known to be regulated by PIP2 (4Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 6Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We examined whether IRK is affected by the various substances used in the present study. IRK was determined from the I-V curve, as described previously in Fig. 1 B. The amplitude was measured at −120 mV, where IRK is large. IRK was not affected either by PE (100 μm) or by WMN (100 μm). However, the addition of PE in the presence of WMN decreased IRK by 31.41 ± 1.93%. These results suggest that the change of PIP2 level induced by normal signal molecule such as PE may not contribute to IRK regulation, although IRK is inhibited when PIP2 level is reduced further down by inhibiting its replenishment. The main question addressed in the present study is whether PIP2 is acting as a signal molecule for the regulation of native KACh channels. The results obtained can be summarized as follows: 1) PE, α1-adrenergic agonist, accelerates desensitization of the IKACh; 2) PE-induced desensitization was inhibited by PLC inhibitor, neomycin, but not by PKC inhibitor, calphostin C; 3) when wortmannin, an inhibitor PI 3-kinase and PI 4-kinase was applied with PE, desensitization of IKACh was further accelerated, and the recovery from desensitization was inhibited. From these results it was suggested that KACh channels are regulated by α1-adrenergic agonist through the depletion of the PIP2 pool in plasma membrane. Classical signal molecules produced by the activation of PLC-linked receptors are IP3 and diacylglycerol. The role of IP3 on ion channels has not been reported in cardiac myocytes, but diacylglycerol may possibly contribute to the regulation of ion channels via PKC. Desensitization of KACh channel was known to be caused by phosphorylation of m2 muscarinic receptor (31Shui Z. Boyett M.R. Zang W.-J. Haga T. Kameyama K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 487: 359-366Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Richardson R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22249-22255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kwatra M.M. Leung E.

Pfluegers Arch. 1998; 436: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), so it is possible that PKC is involved in the increased desensitization of KACh channel by PE. We tested this possibility, but calphostin C, a PKC-specific inhibitor did not inhibit PE action (desensitization of 79.20 ± 4.46%, Fig. 3,A and E). Furthermore, the effect of PE was not mimicked by direct pharmacological activation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These results support the idea that the mechanism for PE-induced desensitization was the depletion of PIP2 rather than the production of PIP2metabolites that may inhibit the KACh channel. Although we did not carry out the biochemical measurements of PIP2concentration in the present experiment, the decrease in PIP2 concentration in the plasma membrane by PLC-linked receptor has been reported previously in Chinese hamster ovary cells and human neuroblastoma cells (26Jenkinson S. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1138-1148PubMed Google Scholar, 27Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5037-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The involvement of PIP2 in the PE effect was further supported by the finding that the PE-induced desensitization became irreversible when the replenishment of PIP2 was blocked by WMN (Fig.4 B). Furthermore when the PIP2 pool was depleted by preincubation of PE and WMN, activation of the KAChcurrent was reduced (Fig. 4 C). IRK channels, on the other hand, showed a different response. In the case of IRK, PE did not affect the channel activity, although PE with WMN affected the channel activity. These data suggest that interaction of IRK with PIP2 is stronger than that of KAChchannel, as suggested previously (4Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 6Zhang H. He C. Yan X. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Nat.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36065-36072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and that the effect of PIP2 depletion on IRK occurs at much lower concentration. Another possibility that should be tested in future studies is a co-localization of a specific PLC-linked receptor and a specific ion channel. In this view, the PIP2 pool, which is regulated by PE, may not be uniformly distributed over the whole membrane, but localized closely with KACh channels. It has previously been reported by other studies that several PLC-linked receptor can inhibit KACh channel. Braun et al. (36Braun A.P. Fedida D. Giles W.R. Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 421: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that the selective α1-adrenergic agonist methoxamine reduced both the IK1 and KACh current in rabbit atrial myocytes. Yamaguchi et al. (37Yamaguchi H. Sakamoto N. Watanabe Y. Saito T. Masuda Y. Nakaya H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1745-H1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 inhibited KACh current in guinea pig atrial myocytes. Their observation is similar to the effect of PE presented in this paper, but they failed to identify the mechanism of the α1-adrenergic agonist or endothelin induced inhibition. They only demonstrated that these effects were not mediated by PKC or IP3. But it now seems to be very likely that PIP2 is involved in those effects. Recently, channel expression studies have demonstrated that PLC-linked receptors inhibit GIRK1/GIRK4 channels (38Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A411Google Scholar) or KATP channels (39Xie L. Horie M. Takano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15292-15297Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and these effects were mediated by depletion of the PIP2 pool in membrane. The functional consequence of accelerated desensitization of IKACh by α1-adrenergic receptor may be an early cessation of parasympathetic effect in the continuous presence of ACh. This discovery may be of particular importance, since it provides a novel pathway for sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction. Interaction between sympathetic and parasympathetic system was recognized early in various experimental conditions, and this interaction is also considered to be of clinical importance. However, the precise signal transduction pathways involved in this interaction are not fully understood, except the inhibition of adenylate cyclase by acetylcholine as a mechanism of parasympathetic antagonizism to sympathetic stimulation. To our knowledge, the pathway presented in the present study seems to be the first report of a reciprocal pathway through which sympathetic stimulation can antagonize parasympathetic activity. In conclusion, α1-adrenergic agonist accelerates the desensitization of KACh channel through the regulation of PIP2 pool, suggesting that the receptor mediated regulation of the PIP2 pool may play an important role in the control of cellular function through the modulation of ion channels."

Here we report the identification of cytosolic-like tRNAs in wheat mitochondria using a method involving quantitative hybridization to distinguish among three tRNA classes: (i) those encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and localized in mitochondria, (ii) those encoded by nuclear DNA and located in the cytosol, and (iii) those encoded by nuclear DNA and found in both the cytosol and mitochondria. The latter class comprises tRNA species that are considered to be imported into mitochondria to compensate for the deficiency of mtDNA-encoded tRNAs. In a comprehensive survey of the wheat mitochondrial tRNA population, we identified 14 such imported tRNAs, the structural characterization of which is presented here. These imported tRNAs complement 16 mtDNA-encoded tRNAs, for a total of at least 30 distinct tRNA species in wheat mitochondria. Considering differences in the set of mtDNA-encoded and imported tRNAs in the mitochondria of various land plants, the import system must be able to adapt relatively rapidly over evolutionary time with regard to the particular cytosolic-like tRNAs that are brought into mitochondria.

This observation, coupled with the identification of cytosolic-like tRNAs in mitochondrial RNA preparations of bean (1Green G.A. Marechal L. Weil J.-H. Guillemaut P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 10: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), wheat (2Joyce P.B.M. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5461-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and potato (3Maréchal-Drouard L. Guillemaut P. Cosset A. Arbogast M. Weber F. Weil J.-H. Dietrich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3689-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggests that tRNAs must be imported into angiosperm mitochondria (4Dietrich A. Weil J.H. Maréchal-Drouard L.

Lemieux C. Sankoff D. Turmel M. Brossard N. Delage E. Littlejohn T.G. Plante I. Rioux P. Saint-Louis D. Zhu Y. Burger G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 865-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A requirement for mitochondrial tRNA import in plants is rather surprising in view of the large size of the angiosperm mitochondrial genome (200–2400 kilobase pairs), which in principle could easily accommodate a full set of tRNA genes, as do the much more compact mtDNAs of most animals and fungi (8Gray M.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 141: 233-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Depending on their genome of origin, plant mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) can be divided into three groups (see Refs. 2Joyce P.B.M. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5461-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 4Dietrich A. Weil J.H. Maréchal-Drouard L. Annu. Rev.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 310-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar): (i)native mt-tRNAs, encoded by plant mtDNA and presumed to originate from the eubacteria-like endosymbiont that was the evolutionary source of the mitochondrion and its genome; (ii)chloroplast-like tRNAs, also encoded by plant mtDNA but originating from promiscuous chloroplast DNA sequences that in the course of evolution have been transferred to and are now an integral part of the mitochondrial genome; and (iii) imported tRNAs, encoded by nDNA and localized in mitochondria as well as the cytosol. Given that tRNAs encoded by a particular genome within a plant cell may function in more than one subcellular compartment, complete characterization of a plant tRNA requires not only determination of its anticodon sequence and aminoacylation specificity, but also its intracellular localization and that of the gene encoding it. Although the set of mtDNA-encoded tRNAs or their genes has been examined in a variety of angiosperms (3Maréchal-Drouard L. Guillemaut P. Cosset A. Arbogast M. Weber F. Weil J.-H. Dietrich A.

Biol. 1993; 21: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), only in potato (a dicotyledonous plant) has the mt-tRNA population been extensively characterized (3Maréchal-Drouard L. Guillemaut P. Cosset A. Arbogast M. Weber F. Weil J.-H. Dietrich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3689-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In that plant, 31 mt-tRNAs were found, including 20 encoded by mtDNA (15 native and 5 chloroplast-like) and 11 specified by nDNA. The research reported here aimed to identify and comprehensively characterize nDNA-encoded tRNAs that are imported into wheat mitochondria from the cytosol. The possibility of mitochondrial tRNA import emerged when studies to catalog wheat mtDNA-encoded tRNA genes revealed only 16 genes specific for 13 amino acids (2Joyce P.B.M. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5461-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although we considered that some mtDNA-encoded tRNA genes might have escaped detection in this survey, it seemed unlikely that all of the remaining ∼17 tRNA genes required by standard wobble rules could have been missed. The apparently limited number of wheat mtDNA-encoded tRNAs prompted a preliminary investigation of the wheat mitochondrial tRNA population, which identified three cytosolic-like tRNA species (2Joyce P.B.M. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5461-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, the latter study did not address the issue of possible cytosolic tRNA contamination of the wheat mitochondrial tRNA preparation. In the present investigation, we systematically examined the question of preparative contamination and established criteria and procedures for the identification of tRNAs that are genuinely imported into wheat mitochondria. The procedures of Spencer et al. (11Spencer D.F. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis : Seed Analysis. 14. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar) were used for preparation of viable wheat embryos (from pedigree seed of Triticum aestivum var. Katepwa; Alberta Wheat Pool, Calgary, Alberta, Canada), germination of embryos and isolation of mitochondria. Wheat mtDNA was prepared from DNase-treated, sucrose gradient-purified mitochondria (11Spencer D.F. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis : Seed Analysis. 14. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar) by sequential sarkosyl lysis, incubation of the lysate with Pronase, and recovery of DNA by centrifugation in CsCl-ethidium bromide gradients (11Spencer D.F. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis : Seed Analysis. 14. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar, 12Bonen L. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Wheat nDNA was isolated in a similar fashion from a crude nuclear fraction that was further purified in a discontinuous sucrose gradient (11Spencer D.F. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis : Seed Analysis. 14. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar), except that nuclei were extracted with a phenol/cresol mixture rather than being treated with Pronase. Mitochondrial RNA (from purified mitochondria) and cytosolic RNA (from a post-mitochondrial supernatant) were prepared as described previously (11Spencer D.F. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis : Seed Analysis. 14. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar). For isolation of total cellular RNA, germinating embryos were ground in a mortar with equal volumes of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.02 m Na-EDTA (pH 8.0) and phenol/cresol mix. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min, an equal volume of phenol/cresol solution was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was shaken for 10 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 18,000 ×g for 10 min. After addition of NaCl to 0.5 m to the aqueous phase, RNA was purified by repeated phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. To obtain a sufficient quantity of individual tRNAs for subsequent analysis, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis procedure (13Burkhard G. Steinmetz A. Keller M. Mubumbila M. Crouse E. Weil J.H. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.-H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 347-357Google Scholar) was adapted. Gel solutions and electrophoretic conditions were as described (3Maréchal-Drouard L. Guillemaut P. Cosset A. Arbogast M. Weber F. Weil J.-H. Dietrich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3689-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), except that gels were 0.75 mm thick and stacking gels were employed. Approximately 125 μg of 1m NaCl-soluble wheat mitochondrial RNA (11Spencer D.F. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis : Seed Analysis. 14. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar) was electrophoresed in the first dimension. The tRNAs were located by ultraviolet shadowing, and a gel slice containing them was excised for electrophoresis in the second dimension. The separated tRNAs were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and recovered from individual spots by elution (14Schnare M.N. Heinonen T.Y.K. Young P.G. Gray M.W. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 μg of linear polyacrylamide carrier (15Gaillard C. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 378Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Isolated tRNAs were 3′-end-labeled using 5′-[32P]pCp and RNA ligase (16Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel (33 × 40 × 0.04 cm) at 1600 V for 3 h. Following autoradiography, the resolved tRNA species were recovered by elution (14Schnare M.N. Heinonen T.Y.K. Young P.G. Gray M.W. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sequences and labeling of tRNA-specific oligonucleotides used as primers for reverse transcriptase (RT) sequencing (17Geliebter J. Focus. 1987; 9: 5-8Google Scholar) are described below. Reaction products from 1–2 μl of chemical (16Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) or RT (avian myeloblastosis virus) sequencing reactions (heated at 80 °C for 5 min) were electrophoresed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, 40% (v/v) formamide, and 1× TBE (90 mm Tris-HCl, 90 mmboric acid, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) at 65 W (3000–3500 V; 50 °C) until a xylene cyanol marker reached 17 cm (∼2 h). Gels were pre-run for 1 h at 2000 V. Thin-layer chromatography was employed to determine the anticodon sequence of a wheat mt-tRNAArg. The tRNA was partially hydrolyzed in alkali, and the resulting 5′-OH-terminated fragments were 5′-end-labeled, separated by gel electrophoresis, and individually recovered, as described (14Schnare M.N. Heinonen T.Y.K. Young P.G. Gray M.W. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The isolated fragments were completely digested to nucleoside 5′-monophosphates (pN) with nuclease P1 (18Beier H. Barciszewska M. Krupp G. Mitnacht R. Gross H.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 351-356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting 32P-labeled, 5′-terminal nucleotide of each eluted fragment was identified by co-chromatography with markers in two solvent systems (14Schnare M.N. Heinonen T.Y.K. Young P.G. Gray M.W. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (Regional DNA Synthesis Laboratory, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; see Table I) were labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [α-32P]ATP under standard conditions (17Geliebter J.

In some cases, RNA that had been treated with DNase I served as a control. To prepare the samples, 12 μg of RNA were dissolved in 50 μl of TE and added to 250 μl of 20× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 mNaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 100 μl of 37% (v/v) formaldehyde and 100 μl of H2O. The RNA-containing solution was heated at 65 °C for 15 min, immediately cooled on ice, then serially diluted seven times with an equal volume of 10× SSC, to generate 1:2- to 1:128-fold dilutions. RNA samples (6–0.047 μg) were applied to a Biotrans nylon membrane (ICN Biomedicals) using a Bio-Dot SF blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the supplier's instructions, with 10× SSC as wash solution. Blots were baked for 2 h at 80 °C, then rinsed in 2× SSC. Prehybridization, hybridization using 0.1 μg of oligonucleotide probe (5′-end-labeled as described above), and washing of blots were conducted as described (20Zeff R.A. Geliebter J. Focus. 1987; 9: 1-2Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed for ∼16 h at 5–7 °C lower than the calculated dissociation temperature (Td ) of the oligonucleotide probe (20Zeff R.A. Geliebter J. Focus. 1987; 9: 1-2Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat K x-ray film without intensifying screens, the resulting autoradiographs were digitized, the intensity of each band was determined using the NIH Image Analysis program, and linear regression coefficients were calculated using MacCurveFit. PCR amplification experiments employed oligonucleotides (generally 20-mers) designed to target the 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of the desired tRNA gene, using sequence information obtained by chemical and RT sequencing of the corresponding tRNA. Nucleus-encoded tRNA sequences (DNA and RNA) of other plants (21Steinberg S. Misch A. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3011-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) assisted in primer construction. Purified nDNA (11Spencer D.F. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar) was used either directly or after extensive shearing by two passes at 20,000 p.s.i. through a French pressure cell. The sheared DNA (mean size about 400 base pairs) produced few, if any, artifactual bands and so was the preferred template. Amplification was in a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400 using Vent(exo−) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with 500 ng of nDNA. An optimized regime employed 40 cycles and included a 30-s annealing at 55 °C and a 30-s extension at 72 °C, with the ramp-up from annealing to extension slowed to 50% of maximum. PCR was also attempted with 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide or 1.3 m betaine in the reaction mix; however, neither reagent supported the amplification of tRNA sequences that were not also recovered using the standard protocol. For cloning, blunt-ended PCR products were ligated into pT7 Blue® (Novagen) and transformed into DH5α cells that had been prepared by the protocol of Inoue et al. (22Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Sequence was determined using the fmol Cycle Sequencing® kit (Promega) with 5′-32P-labeled vector-based primers. The term “mitochondrial tRNA” (mt-tRNA) is used here to refer generally to tRNA species present in the isolated mitochondrial tRNA population, whether these species are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA-encoded mt-tRNA) or nuclear genome (nDNA-encoded mt-tRNA). The term “cytosolic tRNA” (cy-tRNA) is reserved for nDNA-encoded tRNAs that are normally localized to and function in the cytosol. The term “imported tRNA” is applied to those nDNA-encoded tRNAs that are selectively accumulated in mitochondria, presumably for use in mitochondrial protein synthesis. When radioactively end-labeled wheat mt-tRNAs were incubated with mtDNA or nDNA, only a fraction of the total mt-tRNA population hybridized to mtDNA. After two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the latter tRNAs generated a distinctly different pattern than those hybridizing to nDNA (23Glover K. The Genetic Origins of Transfer RNAs in Wheat (Triticum aestivum) Mitochondria. Ph.D. thesis. Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia1995Google Scholar). Among the latter group were three cytosolic-like tRNAs (Gly (CCC); Leu (CAA); Val (GAC); anticodon sequences in parentheses) previously identified in the wheat mt-tRNA population (2Joyce P.B.M. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5461-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Total cy-tRNA had a more complex gel electrophoretic profile than the mt-tRNA fraction hybridizing to nDNA, and it contained unique species (23Glover K. The Genetic Origins of Transfer RNAs in Wheat (Triticum aestivum) Mitochondria. Ph.D. thesis. Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia1995Google Scholar). This makes it unlikely that cy-tRNA contamination of the mt-tRNA fraction is of such magnitude and extent that those mt-tRNAs that hybridize to nDNA represent contaminating cy-tRNAs, rather than bona fide imported tRNAs. Nevertheless, this approach cannot unequivocally distinguish imported nDNA-encoded tRNAs from nDNA-encoded cy-tRNA contaminants of the mitochondrial preparation. To assess the level of cy-tRNA co-isolating with wheat mitochondrial RNA, a wheat cytosolic RNA preparation was incubated with [α-32P]ATP and tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (2Joyce P.B.M. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5461-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and the resulting labeled RNA was added to homogenizing medium containing germinating wheat embryos. Embryos were processed according to the standard protocol for isolation of mitochondria and mitochondrial RNA (11Spencer D.F. Gray M.W. Schnare M.N. Linskens H.F. Jackson J.F. Modern Methods of Plant Analysis : Seed Analysis. 14. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 347-360Google Scholar) and radioactivity in various preparative fractions was assessed by liquid scintillation counting. From measurements of RNA recovered from subcellular fractions together with calculated specific activities, we estimated that co-isolating cy-tRNA could comprise as much as 20–25% of the total mt-tRNA prepared by our standard protocol (23Glover K. The Genetic Origins of Transfer RNAs in Wheat (Triticum aestivum) Mitochondria. Ph.D. thesis. Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia1995Google Scholar). To determine whether the cy-tRNA associated with the mitochondrial fraction in this way represents a specific subset of the cy-tRNA population or is a representative sampling, mitochondrial RNA containing radiolabeled cy-tRNA was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No differences in the electrophoretic banding or intensity patterns of the radiolabeled cy-tRNA associated with the mitochondrial fraction could be discerned in comparison to those of similarly labeled cy-tRNA fractions (23Glover K. The Genetic Origins of Transfer RNAs in Wheat (Triticum aestivum) Mitochondria. Ph.D. thesis. Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia1995Google Scholar). Micrococcal nuclease treatment of isolated mitochondria has been used in other studies to reduce contamination of mitochondrial RNA preparations by cytosolic tRNA (24Hancock K. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19208-19215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Maréchal-Drouard L. Weil J.-H. Guillemaut P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 4777-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To assess the effectiveness of this treatment, we carried out a quantitative investigation (23Glover K. The Genetic Origins of Transfer RNAs in Wheat (Triticum aestivum) Mitochondria. Ph.D. thesis. Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia1995Google Scholar), which showed that such treatment reduced the amount of radiolabeled cy-tRNA co-isolating with mitochondrial RNA by at least 50% compared with untreated mitochondria. However, as in other published work, the yield of mitochondrial RNA was also substantially reduced. This meant that, on average, micrococcal nuclease treatment lowered residual contamination by approximately 35%, not 50%. To ascertain whether the cy-tRNA remaining after micrococcal nuclease treatment was a specific subset of the cy-tRNA population, the mitochondrial RNA was electrophoresed in a 4 m urea, 10% polyacrylamide gel. Although the signal was faint, no selection was evident (23Glover K. The Genetic Origins of Transfer RNAs in Wheat (Triticum aestivum) Mitochondria. Ph.D. thesis. Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia1995Google Scholar). Because micrococcal nuclease treatment of wheat mitochondria was not effective in reducing the amount of added cy-tRNA that co-isolated with mt-tRNA to what we would consider a negligible level (<5% of total mt-tRNA), we therefore developed an alternative approach for distinguishing bona fide, imported tRNAs from ones nonspecifically associated with mitochondria, possibly as a result of preparative contamination by cy-tRNAs. Slot blots containing mitochondrial RNA and cytosolic RNA were hybridized with oligonucleotides (Table I) specific for mtDNA-encoded tRNAUGGPro (26Joyce P.B.M. Spencer D.F. Bonen L. Gray M.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 10: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the cytosolic-like tRNAGCCGly (27Marcu K.B. Mignery R.E. Dudock B.S.

Chem. 1969; 244: 3069-3074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter tRNA is not required in wheat mitochondria (i.e. is functionally redundant) because the mtDNA encodes a tRNAGAAPhe (2Joyce P.B.M. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5461-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As expected, distinctly different hybridization patterns were obtained in these experiments (Fig. 1). With the tRNAUGGPro oligonucleotide, there was a strong signal with mitochondrial RNA and a much weaker signal with cytosolic RNA. The reverse was seen with the tRNAGAAPhe oligonucleotide: a strong signal with cytosolic RNA and a much weaker signal with mitochondrial RNA. With tRNAGCCGly (a nDNA-encoded tRNA previously considered to be imported into wheat mitochondria (Ref.2Joyce P.B.M. Gray M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5461-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)), the corresponding oligonucleotide hybridized equally well with mitochondrial and cytosolic RNA. To quantify the relative intensities of the hybridization signals, autoradiographs were digitized and the relationship between the strength of each signal and RNA concentration was determined in the linear region of the plot. The slopes of the lines (regression coefficients) obtained following hybridization of an oligonucleotide to mitochondrial RNA and cytosolic RNA were then compared, providing an estimate of the relative intensities of the two signals (TableII).Table IILinear regression coefficients calculated from slot blot hybridization analyses of wheat mt-tRNAs using tRNA-specific oligonucleotide probestRNA2-aSequences of wheat cytosolic-like tRNA species are shown in Fig. 4.

Here, we characterized an ACCα T3 response element (ACCα-T3RE) with unique functional and protein binding properties. ACCα-T3RE activated transcription both in the absence and presence of T3, with a greater activation observed in the presence of T3. In nuclear extracts from hepatocytes incubated in the absence of T3, ACCα-T3RE bound protein complexes (complexes 1 and 2) containing the liver X receptor (LXR) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR). In nuclear extracts from hepatocytes incubated in the presence of T3 for 24 h, ACCα-T3RE bound a different set of complexes. One complex contained LXR and RXR (complex 3) and another contained the nuclear T3 receptor (TR) and RXR (complex 4). Mutations of ACCα-T3RE that inhibited the binding of complexes 1 and 2 decreased transcriptional activation in the absence of T3, and mutations of ACCα-T3RE that inhibited the binding of complexes 3 and 4 decreased transcriptional activation in the presence of T3. The stimulation of ACCα transcription caused by T3 was closely associated with changes in the binding of complexes 1–4 to ACCα-T3RE. These data suggest that T3 regulates ACCα transcription by a novel mechanism involving changes in the composition of nuclear receptor complexes bound to ACCα-T3RE.

One of the enzymes that plays a pivotal role in mediating this response is acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).1 ACC catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which is the donor of all but two (ω) of the carbon atoms for the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids. This reaction is the pace-setting step of the fatty acid synthesis pathway (1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 2Kim K.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). There are two ACC isoforms that are encoded by distinct genes. ACCα (260 kDa) is the principal isoform expressed in tissues that exhibit high rates of fatty acid synthesis such as liver, adipose tissue, and mammary gland. ACCβ (280 kDa) is the major isoform observed in heart and skeletal muscle, where it is thought to function primarily in the regulation of β-oxidation of fatty acids (3Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of ACCα in liver is subject to nutritional and hormonal regulation. For example, in starved animals, the concentration of hepatic ACCα is low; feeding a high carbohydrate, low fat diet stimulates an 8–20-fold increase in the amount of the enzyme (4Bianchi A.

Kim K.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The effects of nutritional manipulation on ACCα concentration are mediated primarily by changes in the rate of transcription of the ACCα gene (8Hillgartner F.B. Charron T. Chesnut K.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Diet-induced changes in ACCα transcription are mimicked in primary cultures of chick embryo hepatocytes by manipulating the concentration of hormones and nutrients in the culture medium. The addition of 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) to the culture medium stimulates a 7-fold increase in ACCα transcription (9Hillgartner F.B. Charron T. Chesnut K.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a relatively long time (24 h) is required to achieve maximal rates of ACCα transcription after the addition of T3, suggesting that the accumulation of a rate-limiting intermediate is involved in mediating this response. The molecular mechanism by which T3 regulates ACCα transcription remains to be determined. ACCα transcription is initiated from two promoters, resulting in mRNAs with heterogeneity in the 5′-untranslated region (2Kim K.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The more upstream promoter (promoter 1) flanks exon 1, while the more downstream promoter (promoter 2) flanks exon 2. In livers of rats (10Lopez-Casillas F. Ponce-Castaneda M.V. Kim K.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,11Lopez-Casillas F. Ponce-Castaneda M.V. Kim K.H.

Hillgartner, manuscript in preparation. the increase in total ACCα mRNA abundance caused by the consumption of a high carbohydrate, low fat diet is mediated by alterations in the activities of promoter 1 and promoter 2, with the latter promoter playing a quantitatively greater role in mediating this response. Alterations in promoter 2 activity are also primarily responsible for the T3-induced stimulation in total ACCα mRNA abundance in chick embryo hepatocytes.2 Thyroid hormone action is initiated by the binding of T3 to nuclear receptors. Nuclear T3 receptors (TRs) are members of a superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors that include the receptors for steroid hormones, vitamin A derivatives, vitamin D3, oxysterols, prostanoids, and a large family of receptor-like proteins with unknown ligands (orphan receptors) (12Samuels H.H. Forman B.M. Horowitz Z.D. Ye Z.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). TRs bind to DNA sequences denoted as T3 response elements (T3REs). A wide diversity of T3RE structures have been reported in T3-responsive genes (14Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In general, T3REs consist of multiple copies of a hexameric sequence related to a consensus RGGWMA arranged as inverted repeats, everted repeats, direct repeats, or extended single copies of the hexamer. The nucleotide sequence of the hexameric half-sites and flanking DNA and the spacing of the half-sites influence the binding of TR and its interactions with other proteins (15Harbers M. Wahlstrom G.M. Vennstrom B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2252-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Ikeda M. Wilcox E.C. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3375-3380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consequently, the structure of the T3RE is an important factor influencing the transcriptional activity of TR. TRs can bind T3REs as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR) (13Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 14Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TR/RXR heterodimers are thought to be the principal species of TR bound to T3REs in vivo, since this complex binds DNA with higher affinity and modulates transcription more effectively than TR monomers and TR homodimers (19Hallenbeck P.L. Marks M.S. Lippoldt R.E. Ozato K. Nikodem V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5572-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Cell. 1992; 68: 377-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In addition to TR and RXR, other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family can regulate transcription by binding to T3REs. For example, the α and β isoforms of the liver X receptor (LXR) heterodimerize with RXR on an artificial T3RE composed of directly repeated half-sites separated by a 4-bp spacer (22Apfel R. Benbrook D. Lernhardt E. Ortiz M.A. Salbert G. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7025-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Binding of LXR/RXR to this T3RE causes a stimulation of transcription in the absence and presence of ligands for LXR and RXR. Evidence that LXR/RXR heterodimers modulate transcription through T3REs of native genes is presently lacking. TRs bound to T3REs exhibit two regulatory activities. In the absence of T3, TRs repress transcription (23Damm K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 24Fondell J.D. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G.

Metab. 2000; 11: 6-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The addition of T3 causes a derepression of transcription and, in some instances, a further activation of transcription above that observed in the absence of TR (23Damm K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). This dual regulatory activity of TR arises, in part, from the ability of TR to recruit auxiliary regulatory proteins referred to as corepressors and coactivators. In the absence of T3, TR binds to corepressors such as silencing mediator for retinoic and thyroid hormone receptors (27Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) and nuclear receptor corepressor (28Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). The presence of T3 causes the release of corepressors and the subsequent association of TR with coactivators (29Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Corepressors and coactivators may mediate the transcriptional effects of TR by directly interacting with the basal transcriptional machinery, by modulating interactions between TR and the basal transcriptional machinery, and by modifying chromatin structure (13Zhang J.

In the present report, we have investigated the mechanism by which T3 regulates ACCα transcription in hepatocytes. A strongly active T3RE in the 5′-flanking region of ACCα promoter 2 has been characterized. An interesting feature of this ACCα T3RE that distinguishes it from T3REs of other T3-responsive genes is that it activates transcription both in the absence and presence of T3. In addition, this ACCα T3RE binds multiple protein complexes in hepatic nuclear extracts, and several of these complexes contain LXR/RXR heterodimers. We also show that the T3-induced stimulation of ACCα transcription in hepatocytes is closely associated with dramatic changes in the binding of LXR/RXR complexes and TR/RXR complexes to the ACCα T3RE. From these data, we propose that T3 regulates ACCα transcription by a novel mechanism involving changes in the binding of nuclear receptor complexes to a T3RE. An 18-kilobase pair ACCα genomic clone was obtained by screening a λ chicken genomic library (CLONTECH) with a polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragment extending from −1500 to −855 bp relative to the start site of transcription of chicken ACCα promoter 2. The sequence of the primers used to generate the −1500 to −855 bp fragment was derived from the published ACCα promoter 2 sequence (38El Khadir-Mounier C. Le Fur N. Powell R.S. Diot C. Langlois P. Mallard J. Douaire M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).

The cryptic activator protein-1 site located 5′ of the multiple cloning site in pBLCAT2 (41Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Duncan K.G. Lopez G.N. Schaufele F. Uht R.M. Webb P. West B.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 405-407PubMed Google Scholar) was removed by excising the NdeI/HindIII fragment from this plasmid followed by religation. Fragments of the ACCα promoter/regulatory region were inserted into SphI and SalI site 5′ of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in pTKCAT to form ACC/TKCAT constructs. p[ACC−212/−82]TKCAT, p[ACC−171/−82]TKCAT, and p[ACC−212/−108]TKCAT were constructed by first amplifying the indicated ACCα fragments using polymerase chain reaction and then subcloning them into pTKCAT. p[ACC−136/−82]TKCAT, p[ACC−108/−82]TKCAT and pTKCAT constructs containing mutations in the −108 to −82 fragment were made by inserting annealed complementary synthetic oligonucleotides into pTKCAT. Structures of reporter plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and nucleotide sequence analyses. The cDNAs for human RXRα and chicken TRα were provided by R. Evans (Salk Institute) and H. Samuels (New York University), respectively. D. Mangelsdorf (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) provided the cDNAs for human LXRα and LXRβ. Expression plasmids for RXRα, TRα, LXRα, and LXRβ were developed by subcloning the cDNAs for these receptors into pSV-SPORT1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primary cultures of chick embryo hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (42Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1924-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in serum-free Waymouth's medium MD705/1 containing 50 nm insulin (gift from Lilly) and corticosterone (1 μm). Chick embryo hepatocytes were incubated on 60-mm Petri dishes (Fisher) at 40 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were transfected 6 h after plating, using 20 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies), 2.5 μg of p[ACC−4900/+274]CAT or an equimolar amount of another reporter plasmid, and pBluescript KS(+) to bring the total amount of transfected DNA to 3.0 μg/plate. At 18 h of incubation, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without T3 (1.5 μm). At 66 h of incubation, chick embryo hepatocytes were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared as described by Baillie et al. (43Baillie R.A. Klautky S.A. Goodridge A.G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 431-439Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CAT activity (44Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar) were assayed by the indicated methods. All DNAs used in transfection experiments were purified using the Qiagen endotoxin-free kit. Twenty hours after being placed into culture, chick embryo hepatocytes were incubated in Waymouth's medium containing insulin and corticosterone with or without T3 for the times indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (46Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) except that the protease inhibitors, leupeptin (0.25 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 mm), aprotinin (8 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) were added to the extraction buffer at the indicated concentrations. Chicken TRα, human LXRα, human LXRβ, and human RXRα were translated in vitro using the TNT SP6 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). To assess the relative efficiency of synthesis of the different receptor proteins, incorporation of [35S]methionine into receptor proteins was measured in parallel reactions. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by combining equal amounts of the complementary single-stranded DNA in a solution containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA followed by heating to 90 °C for 2 min and then cooling to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides were labeled by filling in overhanging 5′-ends using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and/or [α-32P]dGTP. Binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl containing 18 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 90 mm KCl, 0.18 mm EDTA, 0.45 mm dithiothreitol, 18% glycerol (v/v), 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC). A typical reaction contained 20,000 cpm (0.1 ng) of labeled DNA and 10 μg of nuclear extract or 2 μl of in vitro translated proteins. The reaction was carried out on ice for 60 min. DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subject to storage phosphor autoradiography. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor DNA was mixed with radiolabeled oligomer prior to the addition of nuclear extract. For antibody supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies for 30 min at 0 °C prior to the addition of the oligonucleotide probe. Monoclonal antibody that recognizes the α, β, and γ forms of RXR was generously provided by P. Chambon (Strasbourg, France). Polyclonal antibodies that recognized chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor I (N19), the α and β forms of chicken TR (FL-408), and the α and β forms of LXR (C19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The synthetic oligonucleotides that were used as probes or competitors in gel mobility shift assays are listed in Figs. 3 A and6 C.Figure 6The ability of native and mutant T3REs to compete for the binding of hepatic nuclear proteins to ACC α-T3RE. Gel mobility shift experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using32P-labeled ACCα-T3RE as a probe and nuclear extracts prepared from hepatocytes incubated with or without T3 for 24 h. Nuclear extracts were incubated with the ACCα-T3RE probe in the presence of different concentrations of unlabeled competitor DNAs. Each reaction contained 10 μg of nuclear protein. DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Specific protein-DNA complexes are indicated by arrows. Bands 1 and 2 and bands 3 and 4 are the predominant protein-DNA complexes observed with nuclear extracts from hepatocytes incubated in the absence of T3 and presence of T3, respectively.

The arrows indicate the position and orientation of the half-sites. −T3 NE, nuclear extracts from hepatocytes treated without T3; +T3 NE, nuclear extracts from hepatocytes treated with T3. These data are representative of four experiments employing independent preparations of nuclear extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Results from RNase protection analyses indicated that the T3-induced stimulation of ACCα expression in chick embryo hepatocytes is mediated primarily by changes in the activity of promoter 2 of the ACCα gene.2 Transient transfection experiments were performed to identify the T3RE(s) mediating this regulation. In our initial experiments, chick embryo hepatocytes were transfected with a series DNA constructs containing 5′-deletions of ACCα promoter 2 linked to the CAT gene. In hepatocytes transfected with the longest construct, p[ACC−4900/+274]CAT, T3 caused a 4.2-fold increase in CAT activity (Fig.1). Deletion of ACC-α sequences to −2054, −854, −391, and −212 bp had no effect on T3 responsiveness. Deletion of ACCα sequences from −136 to −108 bp caused a 2.1-fold increase T3 responsiveness, suggesting that the region between −136 and −108 bp contains a sequence that inhibits T3 responsiveness. Deletion of ACCα sequences from −108 to −94 bp caused a marked decrease in promoter activity in the absence and presence of T3. Because the extent of the decrease in promoter activity was greater in cells incubated in the presence of T3, T3 responsiveness was decreased by 83%. Further deletion of ACCα sequence to a 5′-end points of −84, −59, and −41 bp had no effect on residual T3 responsiveness (about a 2-fold increase in CAT activity). Further deletion of ACCα sequence to a 5′-end point of −30 bp abolished promoter activity in the absence and presence of T3 (data not shown). These data suggest that the region between −108 and −94 bp overlaps with a T3RE or an accessory element that augments T3 responsiveness. In addition, another T3RE of weaker activity is located downstream of −41 bp. Analysis of 3′-deletions of ACCα DNA in the context of p[ACC−94/+274]CAT indicated the presence of a T3RE or T3RE accessory element between +179 and +151 bp. 3Y. Zhang and F. B. Hillgartner, unpublished results. However, this T3 regulatory sequence was not detected in 3′-deletions containing the T3 regulatory sequence between −212 and −94 bp. This observation suggests that sequences upstream of the transcription start site mediate most, if not all, of the T3 regulation of transcription initiated from ACCα promoter 2. To obtain additional data indicating the presence of a T3RE in the 5′-flanking region of ACCα promoter 2, chick embryo hepatocytes were transfected with constructs containing ACCα DNA fragments linked to the minimal promoter of the herpes simplex virus TK gene. The TK promoter alone was unresponsive to T3 in chick hepatocytes (Fig.2). Appending an ACCα DNA fragment from −212 to −82 bp to the TK promoter caused a 3.6-fold increase in T3 responsiveness. To further define the location of the T3RE in the −212 to −82 bp fragment, a series of deletions of p[ACC−212/−82]TKCAT were tested for their ability to confer T3 responsiveness. Deletion of the 5′-end to −171 bp caused a 36% increase in T3 responsiveness. Further deletion to −136 bp had no effect on T3 responsiveness. When the 5′-end was deleted to −108 bp, T3 responsiveness increased from 5.7- to 10.2-fold. This observation is consistent with data from 5′-deletion analysis in the context of p[ACC−4900/+274]CAT (Fig. 1), suggesting the presence of a T3 inhibitory element between −136 and −108 bp. When the 3′-end of the −212 to −82 fragment was deleted to −108 bp, T3 responsiveness was abolished. Thus, the sequence between −108 and −82 bp contains a strongly active T3RE. Interestingly, this T3RE confers T3 regulation by stimulating promoter activity both in the absence and presence of T3, with a greater stimulation observed in the presence of T3. These data support the results from 5′-deletion analysis in the context of p[ACC−4900/+274]CAT (Fig. 1) indicating the presence of a T3-dependent and T3-independent enhancer element between −108 and −94 bp. Analysis of the sequences between −108 and −82 bp revealed the presence of four hexameric half-sites (Fig.3 A). Two of these half-sites (sites 2 and 3) conform perfectly to the consensus T3RE half-site sequence, RGGWMA. The other two half-sites (sites 1 and 4) are degenerate copies of the consensus half-site sequence. Half-sites 1 and 3 form an imperfect direct repeat with a 4-bp spacer (DR4) on the coding strand, and sites 2 and 4 form an imperfect DR4 on the noncoding strand. These putative DR4 elements partially overlap with each other. Other combinations of half-sites could form inverted or everted repeat structures. To investigate which of the putative T3RE half-sites were involved in mediating T3 regulation, hepatocytes were transfected with constructs that contained mutations of individual half-sites in the context of p[ACC−108/−82]TKCAT. Mutating the first 3 bp of half-site 1 (mut 1) had no effect on T3 responsiveness (Fig.3 B). In contrast, mutating the first"

TGF-β carries out its biological effects through three cell surface receptors, which are referred to as type I (RI), type II (RII), and type III (RIII). RI and RII are serine/threonine kinases, and an active receptor complex consists of two molecules each of RI and RII, which are essential for TGF-β signal transduction and inhibition of cell growth (3Lin H.Y.

Because RI and RII are necessary for TGF-β-mediated growth arrest, mutational inactivation of either receptor has been reported to generate TGF-β resistance and hence the loss of the tumor suppressive function of TGF-β in cancer cells (7Markowitz S.

Another mechanism for loss of TGF-β-mediated tumor suppression is transcriptional repression of RII due to decreased binding of stimulatory nuclear proteins to the RII promoter in keratinocytes and breast cancer cells (11Kim D.H.

Both RI and RII promoters lack distinct TATA boxes and are highly GC-rich and depend on Sp1 transcription factor for the initiation of transcription. The RI promoter contains four consensus and several putative Sp1 sites, whereas the RII promoter contains two Sp1 sites. The Sp gene family of transcription factors consists of four members, which are referred to as Sp1–Sp4. Whereas Sp1, Sp2, and Sp4 are known to be activators of gene transcription, Sp3 is generally considered to be a repressor (17Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors recognize the same DNA element and have similar binding affinities. Sp3 has been shown to repress Sp1-mediated trans-activation of several genes (18Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

MCF-7 early passage (MCF-7E) breast cancer cells express RI and RII and are responsive to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β. However, MCF-7 late passage cells (MCF-7L) lack RII, show reduced levels of RI, and are TGF-β-resistant. Loss or reduced expression of TGF-β receptors was due to low Sp1 protein levels in MCF-7L cells in comparison to MCF-7E cells (21Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W. Liang J. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J.

Sp1 deficiency was reversed by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment of these cells, leading to the restoration of TGF-β receptor expression and signal transduction (12Ammanamanchi S. Kim S.-J. Sun L.-Z. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16527-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We now show that in addition to Sp1 deficiency, MCF-7L breast cancer cells express higher levels of Sp3 than do MCF-7E cells, which express adequate amounts of both receptors and are consequently sensitive to TGF-β. Sp3 acts as a transcriptional repressor of TGF-β receptors. Furthermore, the transient expression of CMV-Sp3 cDNA into TGF-β-responsive MCF-7E cells resulted in dose-dependent down-regulation of TGF-β receptor mRNA, thus confirming transcriptional repression by Sp3. Similar results were also found for TGF-β receptor expression in a colon cancer cell line designated GEO. Taken together, the previous and present results in the MCF-7 model system indicate that Sp1/Sp3 ratios dictate expression versus repression of TGF-β receptors RI and RII. MCF-7E cells were obtained from Dr. Soule (23Soule H.D. Vazguez J. Long A. Albert S. Brennan M. J. Natl.

It was previously reported that Sp3 could not affect the activities of Sp1-dependent thymidine kinase promoter (19Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16503-16508Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, primers for TK were used to demonstrate the specificity of Sp3 effects on RI and RII expression. Primers for TK were used as an internal control to normalize the expression levels. A total of 30 cycles of amplification were performed. Primers for RI generate an 865-bp fragment (sense primers, TTG TGG CAC GGT GAG AGT GT; antisense primers, TGC TCC TGG GCT ATT GAA TCA). Primers for RII generate a 1003-bp fragment (sense primers, GCC AAC AAC ATC AAC CAC AAC ACA; antisense primers, TAG TGT TTA GGG AGC CGT CTT CAG). Primers for TK generate a 340-bp fragment (sense primers; TTC ATA AGC TAC AGC AGA GG; antisense primers, TTG ACA TCA GCC TGC TTC TT). To determine Sp3 protein expression levels, Western immunoblot was performed using 5 μg each of nuclear extracts from MCF-7E, MCF-7L, and GEO cells. Western analysis showed three protein species of 115, 70, and 68 kDa (Fig.1). The 68–70-kDa species was the result of differential internal translation initiation (25Kennet S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Only the 115-kDa species has been reported to be biologically active. MCF-7L and GEO cells showed significantly higher levels of all the three Sp3 isoforms in comparison to MCF-7E cells, whereas there were no differences in the c-Jun levels, indicating selectivity of Sp3 modulation. EMSAs were performed using MCF-7E and MCF-7L nuclear extracts and 32P-labeled consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide to determine the DNA binding activities of Sp3 (Fig.2). Enhanced binding of a high mobility complex was observed in MCF-7L nuclear extracts in comparison to MCF-7E extracts (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4). To identify whether the high mobility complex contains Sp3, the nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with 2 μg of Sp3 antibody to delete Sp3 protein from the extracts prior to the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. The high mobility complex was eliminated by the Sp3 antibody in MCF-7L extracts, confirming that the protein-DNA complex contains Sp3 (Fig. 2, lane 5). This Sp3 antibody has previously been reported to cause similar depletion of the protein-DNA complexes following incubation with endothelial cell nuclear extracts prior to the addition of 32P-labeled kinase domain receptor promoter of the vascular endothelial growth factor (26Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19294-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Southwestern analysis using nuclear extracts from MCF-7E and MCF-7L cells and radiolabeled RI and RII promoters was carried out to demonstrate Sp3 binding in MCF-7L cells. Higher Sp3 binding to RI and RII promoters was observed in nuclear extracts from MCF-7L cells, suggesting the plausible role of Sp3 as a transcriptional repressor of TGF-β receptors (Fig. 3, a andb). MCF-7L cells, which lack, or show reduced levels of, TGF-β receptors, express high levels of Sp3 and low levels of Sp1 protein. To determine whether the modulation of Sp1/Sp3 protein levels leads to induction of RI and RII promoter activities, we transfected varying amounts (0–8 μg) of CMV-Sp1 cDNA into MCF-7L cells. Western analysis showed increasing amounts of the Sp1 in MCF-7L cells (Fig. 4 a). c-Jun was used as a loading control. Cotransfection of RI and RII promoter-luciferase reporter constructs with the varying amounts of CMV-Sp1 cDNA resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the RI and RII promoter activities, thus suggesting that Sp1/Sp3 ratios control RI and RII promoter activities (Fig. 4 b). Sp1 expression enhanced Sp1-dependent TK promoter activity but not the non-Sp1-dependent NFκB-Luc control construct, thus confirming the specificity of Sp1 effects on the Sp1-dependent RI, RII, and TK promoters. MCF-7E cells, which express TGF-β receptors, contain high levels of Sp1 and low levels of Sp3. Consequently, we transfected varying amounts (0–8 μg) of CMV-Sp3 cDNA into MCF-7E cells to modulate the Sp1/Sp3 protein levels and evaluated the effects on RI and RII promoter activities. Western analysis showed increasing levels of Sp3 in MCF-7E cells (Fig. 4 c). c-Jun was used as a loading control. Cotransfection of RI and RII promoter-luciferase reporter constructs with varying amounts of CMV-Sp3 cDNA showed a dose-dependent decrease in the RI and RII promoter activities, thus confirming that Sp1/Sp3 ratios control RI and RII promoter activities (Fig. 4 d). The transfection efficiencies at 0, 2, 4, and 8 μg of CMV-Sp3 cDNA were 100, 86.4, 84.6, and 85.2%, respectively, for the RI-Luc construct and 100, 80.3, 81.1, and 82.4%, respectively, for the RII-Luc construct. Sp3 expression did not affect the activity of Sp1-dependent TK-Luc and the non-Sp1-dependent NFκB-Luc control construct, thus confirming the specificity of Sp3 effects on RI and RII promoter activities. Although GEO cells express significant levels of Sp3 (Fig.1), low levels of RI and RII can still be detected in these cells. Consequently, we determined the effect of ectopic Sp3 expression on the RI and RII promoter activities in GEO cells as well. Sp3 expression down-regulated RI and RII promoter activities, indicating that Sp3 acts as a transcriptional repressor of TGF-β receptors in GEO colon cancer cells as well (Fig. 4 e). To determine whether transiently expressed Sp3 was binding to RI and RII promoters, Southwestern analysis was performed using radiolabeled RI and RII promoter fragments exposed to nuclear extracts from CMV-Sp3-transfected MCF-7E cells as well as CMV-control vector-transfected MCF-7E cells. Transiently expressed Sp3 bound to RI promoter as well as RII promoter (Fig. 5,a and b). To evaluate whether transiently expressed Sp3 binding to RI and RII promoters in MCF-7E cells results in down-regulation of RI and RII transcripts, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis using RI and RII primers was performed on total RNA from varying amounts (0–8 μg) of CMV-Sp3 cDNA-transfected as well as CMV-control vector-transfected MCF-7E cells. The transfection efficiencies at 0, 2, 4, and 8 μg of CMV-Sp3 cDNA were 100, 80.1, 78.9, and 79.4%, respectively. Sp3 dose-dependent repression of RI and RII expression levels was observed, thus confirming the role of Sp3 as a transcriptional repressor of TGF-β receptors RI and RII. However, Sp3 transfection did not affect thymidine kinase mRNA expression. Because the thymidine kinase promoter contains an Sp1 site important for transcription of the gene, this result indicated that Sp3 did not affect this site, thus reflecting the selective repression of TGF-β receptors by Sp3 (Fig. 6). Loss or reduced expression of TGF-β receptors has been implicated in TGF-β resistance leading to tumor formation and progression (8Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X.-F. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J.

Whereas MCF-7E breast cancer cells express TGF-β receptor RI as well as RII and are responsive to growth inhibition by TGF-β, MCF-7L cells lack RII and show reduced levels of RI. MCF-7L cells are TGF-β-resistant. In addition, MCF-7L cells were found to be tumorigenic, and RII replacement reduced malignancy in athymic nude mice (13Sun L.-Z. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E.

The RI and RII promoters lack distinct TATA boxes but do contain multiple GC elements and depend on Sp1 for the initiation of transcription (15Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.P. Fine A. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol.

Loss or reduced expression of TGF-β receptors in MCF-7L cells in comparison to MCF-7E cells was related to low expression levels of Sp1 transcription factor (22Liu Y. Li W. Zhong X. Brattain M.G. Banerji S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12231-12236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, in this report we present data suggesting that another member of the Sp gene family, Sp3, which has GC element binding affinities similar to those of Sp1, acts as a transcriptional repressor of TGF-β receptors RI and RII. Sp gene family members Sp1, Sp2, and Sp4 are generally known as activators of gene transcription, whereas Sp3 is considered to be a repressor of gene transcription (17Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). MCF-7L cells express higher levels of Sp3 in comparison to MCF-7E cells (Fig. 1). The 115-kDa Sp3 protein is the biologically active form, and the inactive 68–70-kDa species present in Western blots arise as a result of differential internal translational initiation (25Kennet S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, as opposed to direct promoter repression, the Sp3-derived 68–70-kDa species can bind GC elements and thus act as inhibitors of Sp1-mediated gene activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the DNA-binding activities of Sp3 from MCF-7L nuclear extracts (Fig. 2). Southwestern analysis confirmed the binding of the 115-kDa nuclear Sp3 protein to the RI promoter as well as the RII promoter in MCF-7L cells (Fig. 3,a and b), which lack RII expression and show reduced levels of RI. Significantly, nuclear Sp3 binding to the RII promoter in MCF-7E cells was not observed, and only a trace of Sp3 bound to the RI promoter was found (Fig. 3, a andb). Taken together, the Southwestern data from MCF-7E and MCF-7L nuclear extracts indicate a possible role for Sp3 in transcriptional repression of TGF-β receptors RI and RII in MCF-7L cells. The Sp1 dose-dependent up-regulation of RI and RII promoter-luciferase reporter activities after cotransfection with varying amounts of CMV-Sp1 cDNA into Sp1-deficient MCF-7L cells suggested that Sp1/Sp3 protein levels/activities control RI and RII promoter activities (Fig. 4 b). This was confirmed by the Sp3 dose-dependent down-regulation of RI and RII promoter-luciferase reporter activities after cotransfection with varying amounts of CMV-Sp3 cDNA into Sp3-deficient MCF-7E cells (Fig. 4 d). Southwestern analysis confirmed that the transiently expressed Sp3 bound to the RI and RII promoters in MCF-7E cells (Fig. 5, a and b). Most significantly, Sp3 binding to the RI and RII promoters in CMV-Sp3 cDNA-transfected MCF-7E cells resulted in repression of RI and RII mRNA expression, as indicated by the reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses (Fig. 6). However, thymidine kinase, which was used as a control, was not affected. It was previously reported that Sp3 could repress the activity of multiple Sp1 sites contained in the dihydrofolate reductase promoter but not the single Sp1 site contained in the thymidine kinase promoter (19Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16503-16508Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The RI promoter contains four consensus Sp1 sites, whereas the RII promoter contains two (15Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.P. Fine A. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Bae H.W. Geiser A.G. Kim D.H. Chung M.T. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. Kim S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29460-29468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Ornithine decarboxylase promoter activity was also repressed by Sp3 (20Kumar A.P. Butler A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, Sp3 was able to trans-activate c-fos and c-myc promoters (29Udvadia A.-J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3953-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Hence, the availability of specific coactivators, corepressors, or other transcription factors may dictate whether Sp3 activates or inhibits transcription of a specific gene. Moreover Sp3 effects may also depend on the context as well as the number of Sp1 binding sites. It has been reported previously that MCF-7E cells express high levels of Sp1 in comparison to MCF-7L cells (21Ko Y. Banerji S.S. Liu Y. Li W. Liang J. Soule H.D. Pauley R.J. Willson J.K.V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12231-12236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our present data indicate that MCF-7E cells express low levels of Sp3 in comparison to MCF-7L cells (Fig. 1). Consequently, the high Sp1/Sp3 ratios in MCF-7E cells appear to support RI and RII expression, whereas low Sp1/Sp3 ratios contribute to receptor repression in MCF-7L cells. This hypothesis was confirmed by the ectopically driven increase of Sp1/Sp3 ratios in MCF-7L cells by CMV-Sp1 cDNA expression in MCF-7L cells and the decrease of Sp1/Sp3 ratios in MCF-7E cells by Sp3 cDNA expression, which resulted in repression of RI and RII expression (Fig.6). The correlation between Sp1/Sp3 ratios and expression of RI and RII was also observed in GEO human colon carcinoma cells. Thus, transcriptional control of TGF-β receptor expression is dependent upon the ratio of Sp1/Sp3, and cancer cells can gain a growth advantage by favoring receptor repression through a combination of reduced Sp1 and elevated Sp3 expression. We thank Drs. Guntram Suske, Richard Goldstein, and Seong-Jin Kim for kindly providing CMV-Sp3 cDNA, RI-Luc, and RII-Luc, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1979828005,"A novel sulfotransferase gene (designated GP3ST) was identified on human chromosome 2q37.3 based on its similarity to the cerebroside 3′-sulfotransferase (CST) cDNA (Honke, K., Tsuda, M., Hirahara, Y., Ishii, A., Makita, A., and Wada, Y. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 4864–4868). A full-length cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analyses of human colon mRNA. The isolated cDNA clone predicts that the protein is a type II transmembrane protein composed of 398 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence indicates 33% identity to the human CST sequence. A recombinant protein that is expressed in COS-1 cells showed no CST activity, but did show sulfotransferase activities toward oligosaccharides containing nonreducing β-galactosides such as N-acetyllactosamine, lactose, lacto-N-tetraose (Lc4), lacto-N-neotetraose (nLc4), and Galβ1–3GalNAcα-benzyl (O-glycan core 1 oligosaccharide). To characterize the cloned sulfotransferase, a sulfotransferase assay method was developed that uses pyridylaminated (PA) Lc4 and nLc4 as enzyme substrates. The enzyme product using PA-Lc4 as an acceptor was identified as HSO3-3Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc-PA by two-dimensional 1H NMR. Kinetics studies suggested that GP3ST is able to act on both type 1 (Galβ1–3GlcNAc-R) and type 2 (Galβ1–4GlcNAc-R) chains with a similar efficiency. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the GP3ST gene is expressed in epithelial cells lining the lower to middle layer of the crypts in colonic mucosa, hepatocytes surrounding the central vein of the liver, extravillous cytotrophoblasts in the basal plate and septum of the placenta, renal tubules of the kidney, and neuronal cells of the cerebral cortex.

However, no β-Gal-3′-sulfotransferase genes responsible for the biosynthesis of 3′-sulfo-β-Gal linkages in glycoproteins have been cloned. The fact that CST transfers a sulfate group to C-3 of the nonreducing terminal β-galactoside in glycolipids prompted us to undertake a search for a novel β-Gal-3′-sulfotransferase gene using CST cDNA sequence as a probe.

Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PA-Lc4 and PA-nLc4 were synthesized by pyridylamination of lacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-neotetraose, respectively, using a GlycoTAG reagent kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan) with an automated pyridylamination apparatus (GlycoTAG, Takara). One microgram of total RNA isolated from various human tissues (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers and then subjected to PCR. PCR was carried out using Taq DNA polymerase and two pairs of primers: CF2 (5′-TCACCAACATCATGTTC-3′, corresponding to human GP3ST cDNA nucleotides 284–300 in Fig. 1 A) and CR2 (5′-TGAGGCAGGTTGAACCT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 490–506); and CF1 (5′-CCAACGACACCTTCTAC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 524–540) and CR1 (5′-GGAACGGGATGTTCTTG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1302–1318), which are located in the putative exons of the CST-like candidate gene in the CEB1 cosmid (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAF048727). The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel. DNA fragments with the expected sizes of 223 and 795 base pairs, respectively, were excised and subcloned into pT7 Blue(R) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and sequenced as described below. The determined sequences were identical to those in the CEB1 cosmid, and the cloned DNA fragments were designated LIKE-C1 and LIKE-C2. The 5′-end of human GP3ST cDNA was cloned by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (21Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar) using a 5′-RACE system kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). According to the manufacturer's recommended protocol, 1 μg of total RNA from human colon (OriGene Technologies) was reverse-transcribed with the GP3ST gene-specific antisense primer CR2. The first strand cDNA was tailed at the 3′-end by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase with dATP and then subjected to PCR. PCR was accomplished using Taq DNA polymerase, a 3′-RACE adapter primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′), and the GP3STgene-specific antisense primer CR3 (5′-GACCCCACGCCTTCCACGTA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 436–455). The PCR product was electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel, and the DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Tokyo) and hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe synthesized using LIKE-C1 as a template. Southern hybridization was carried out at 42 °C overnight in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1%N-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.02% SDS. Positive bands were cut out, subcloned into pT7 Blue(R), and sequenced. The 3′-end of human GP3ST cDNA was cloned using a 3′-RACE system kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a similar manner. According to the manufacturer's protocol, 1 μg of human colon total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the 3′-RACE adapter primer and subsequently subjected to PCR. PCR was performed using TaqDNA polymerase, the abridged universal amplification primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′), and the GP3STgene-specific sense primer CF5 (5′-TCAAGAACCACACGCAGATC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1115–1134). The PCR product was electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel and subjected to Southern blotting as described above, except that the hybridization probe was synthesized using LIKE-C2 as a template. The subcloned DNAs were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using a Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 377). To obtain a GP3ST cDNA clone that contained the entire open reading frame, RT-PCR was accomplished using total RNA from human colon as a template. PCR was performed using TaqDNA polymerase and a set of primers (CF3, 5′-CCAGAGGCCAAGATGATG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 121–138 in Fig. 1 A); and CR6, 5′-GGAGAGAGGAGCTGGTGT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1362–1379). The PCR product with the expected size of 1259 base pairs was subcloned into pT7 Blue(R) and sequenced as described above. The obtained clone was digested with EcoRI and SalI, and the GP3ST open reading frame fragment was inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pSVK3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), yielding pSV-GP3ST. COS-1 cells (1 × 106) that had been pre-cultured for 1 day in a 10-cm diameter dish were transfected with 10 μg of pSV-GP3ST and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 72 h, the cells were washed twice with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline using a silicon scraper, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 2 min, sonicated in 0.3 ml of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and assayed for sulfotransferase activity according to the method for CST activity (2Honke K. Yamane M. Ishii A. Kobayashi T. Makita A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When oligosaccharides were used as acceptor substrates, water was employed as the eluant in DEAE A25 column chromatography as a substitute for the organic solvent. The standard incubation mixture contained the following components in a total volume of 25 μl: 100 mm MES (pH 6.2), 10 mmMnCl2, 1% Lubrol PX, 1 mm PAPS, 0.2 mm PA-Lc4 or PA-nLc4, and 7.5 μl of enzyme source. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction was terminated by boiling for 2 min. The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, and 20 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, followed by dilution with 180 μl of water; and 50 μl of the diluted solution was injected onto a TSKgel SuperQ-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm; Tosoh) equipped with a Shimadzu LC-VP HPLC system. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0–0.2 m ammonium acetate (pH 9.0) and monitored with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation, 320 nm; and emission, 400 nm). For preparation of the NMR sample, a large-scale GP3ST reaction was carried out using PA-Lc4 as a substrate, and the reaction product was isolated by anion-exchange chromatography as described above. The eluate of the anion-exchange chromatography was then directly injected onto a TSKgel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 75 mm; Tosoh). Elution was carried out at 55 °C with 20 mm ammonium acetate and 0.01% 1-butanol (pH 4.0) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and monitored as described above. A single peak was detected. The effluent corresponding to the peak was collected and dried. Approximately 17 nmol of the reaction product, as evaluated by fluorescence intensity, was deuterium-exchanged; dissolved in 0.1 ml of D2O; and subjected to 1H NMR analysis as described previously (22Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 324: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Yamamoto H. Iida-Tanaka N. Kasama T. Ishizuka I. Kushi Y. Handa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), except for the use of microtubes (Shigemi, Tokyo). The 1H signals of the pyridylaminated oligosaccharides were assigned based on the1H-1H DQF-COSY, two-dimensional HOHAHA, and two-dimensional ROESY experiments in a Joel GX-400 spectrometer at 30 °C. In the case of the DQF-COSY and two-dimensional HOHAHA experiments, the data matrices of 256 (t1) × 4096 (t2) points, acquired with a spectral width of 2000 Hz, were zero-filled to 1048 × 4096 data points. The mixing time of the two-dimensional HOHAHA was set at 100 ms, and the two-dimensional ROESY spectrum was acquired with a 200-ms spin-lock period with a spectral width of 5 kHz. Samples containing 20 μg of total RNAs from human brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, stomach, small intestine, colon, lung, liver, and testis (OriGene Technologies) were denatured in 50% (v/v) formamide, 6% (v/v) formaldehyde, and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) at 65 °C; electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde; and then transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled (−)-strand RNA probe made from human GP3ST cDNA. To detect GP3ST transcripts in normal human tissues, in situ hybridization was carried out using an RNA probes with nonradioactive labeling as described previously (24Kawakami M. Nakayama J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2321-2324PubMed Google Scholar).GP3ST gene-specific nucleotide sequence (nucleotides 720–861 in Fig. 1 A) was amplified by PCR using a 5′-primer (5′-CCCAAGCTTCGGCTTCGACCCCAA-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGAATTCCAGCGCAGCCGGCGC-3′) (HindIII and EcoRI sites are underlined). This amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pGEM-3Zf (+) (Promega), and the resultant vector was used for construction of the RNA probe. A digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe was obtained using a HindIII-cut template and T7 RNA polymerase with a DIG RNA labeling mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Similarly, a sense probe was prepared for negative control experiments using an EcoRI-cut template and SP6 RNA polymerase with the DIG RNA labeling mixture. Paraffin blocks of normal human tissues, including colon, liver, placenta, kidney, and brain, fixed for 24 h in 20% buffered Formalin (pH 7.4) were selected from the pathology file of the Central Clinical Laboratories of the Shinshu University Hospital (Matsumoto, Japan). The deparaffinized tissue sections were immersed in 0.2m HCl for 20 min and then digested with 100 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 20 min, followed by post-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. These slides were rinsed with 2 mg/ml glycine, acetylated for 10 min in 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 mtriethanolamine (pH 8.0), and then defatted with chloroform and air-dried. After prehybridization with 50% deionized formamide and 2× SSC for 1 h at 45 °C, these slides were hybridized with 0.5 mg/ml antisense or sense probe in 50% deionized formamide, 2.5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 1 mg/ml brewers' yeast tRNA at 45 °C for 48 h. After hybridization, the slides were washed with 50% formamide and 2× SSC for 1 h at 45 °C and digested with 10 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. After sequential washing with 2× SSC and 50% formamide at 45 °C for 1 h and 1× SSC and 50% formamide at 45 °C for 1 h, the sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry for detection of the hybridized probes using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The alkaline phosphatase reaction was visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium in the presence of levamisole and 10% polyvinyl alcohol. A control study using the sense probe showed no specific reactivity. When the GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ DNA Data Bank was searched for a sequence homologous to the coding region of the human CST gene (3Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a cosmid clone containing the minisatellite CEB1 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF048727), located on human chromosome 2q37.3, included a significantly similar sequence (25Murray J. Buard J. Neil D.L. Yeramian E. Tamaki K. Hollies C. Jeffreys A.J. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 130-136PubMed Google Scholar). The CEB1 cosmid includes two exons with open reading frames that together cover 1076 base pairs of the human CST mRNA (25Murray J. Buard J. Neil D.L. Yeramian E. Tamaki K. Hollies C. Jeffreys A.J. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 130-136PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the issue of whether the CEB1 candidate gene actually encodes a functional sulfotransferase, we elected to clone its cDNA from human tissues. First, the cDNA fragments LIKE-C1 (nucleotides 284–506 in Fig.1 A) and LIKE-C2 (nucleotides 524–540), which were found in the putative exons of the CEB1 candidate gene, were obtained by RT-PCR using total RNAs from various human tissues. Since the RT-PCR product was strongly detected in the colon (Fig. 5), we employed human colon as a source of mRNA for subsequent cDNA cloning. The 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA of the sulfotransferase candidate were obtained by RACE analyses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 A shows the DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of the cloned cDNA (termed GP3ST). The deduced protein is a type II membrane protein composed of 398 amino acids with a molecular mass of 46,092 Da and has six potential N-glycosylation sites. Its sequence exhibits 33% identity to the human CST sequence (Fig. 1 B) and contains PAPS-binding motifs (26Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cDNA encodes a sulfotransferase. To investigate the issue of whether the isolated cDNA encodes a functional sulfotransferase and, if so, on what substrates the sulfotransferase acts, the cloned cDNA was inserted into a mammalian expression vector, pSVK3 (pSV-GP3ST) and overexpressed in COS-1 cells. We performed a substrate specificity experiment using [35S]PAPS as the sulfate donor, various carbohydrate compounds as acceptors, and cellular lysates of pSV-GP3ST-introduced COS-1 cells as an enzyme source (TableI). A recombinant protein expressed in COS-1 cells showed no CST activity, but did show significant sulfotransferase activities toward oligosaccharides containing nonreducing β-galactosides such as N-acetyllactosamine, lactose, Lc4, nLc4, and Galβ1–3GalNAcα-benzyl (O-glycoside core 1 oligosaccharide). On the other hand, the COS-1 cells transfected with pSV-CST (3Honke K. Tsuda M. Hirahara Y. Ishii A. Makita A. Wada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4864-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or with pSVK3 alone did not show sulfotransferase activity toward any of the oligosaccharides examined (data not shown).Table ISubstrate specificity of GP3STAcceptor1-aThe concentration of acceptor substrates was 1 mm, except for galactosylceramide (GalCer) and lactosylceramide (LacCer), which were used at 0.2 mm.Relative activity1-bTen micrograms of COS-1 cell lysates that had been transfected with pSV-GP3ST was used for each assay.

The values represent the percentage of the activity compared with that of N-acetyllactosamine. Open table in a new tab To further characterize the cloned sulfotransferase, we developed a novel sulfotransferase assay system using pyridylaminated oligosaccharides as acceptors. This system was originally developed for use in the structural analysis of oligosaccharides (27Hase S. Ikenaka T. Matsushima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and was later applied to glycosyltransferase assays (28Taniguchi N. Nishikawa A. Fujii S. Gu J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To separate the acidic products from the neutral substrates, anion-exchange chromatography was employed. A typical elution pattern of the reaction products when PA-Lc4 or PA-nLc4 was used as an acceptor is shown in Fig. 2. The arrows indicate the elution positions of the products. When COS-1 cell lysates transfected with pSV-GP3ST were used as an enzyme source, a robust peak was detected at the positions indicated by the arrows (Fig.2, b and d), whereas COS-1 cells transfected with the pSVK3 vector alone showed no significant peak at the indicated positions (Fig. 2, a and c). The yield of GP3ST products was increased relative to incubation time (over a period of 2 h) in a linear fashion, as well as at enzyme concentrations up to 1 mg/ml (data not shown). To investigate the position where the sulfate group was transferred, a 1H NMR analysis of the enzyme product was performed. For this, a large-scale reaction was performed using PA-Lc4 as a donor, and the product was isolated by sequential HPLC with anion-exchange chromatography and C18 reverse-phase chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” H1–H4 of the Gal residues in PA-Lc4 and the sulfation product (PA-Lc4-S) were assigned by DQF-COSY and two-dimensional HOHAHA. As shown in Fig. 3, the H2–H4 signals of the terminal Gal (IV) residue in PA-Lc4-S were shifted to the lower field by 0.14, 0.67, and 0.38 ppm, respectively, indicating unequivocally that the hydroxyl group at C-3 was esterified by a sulfate. On the other hand, the signals of the internal Gal (II) residue in PA-Lc4-S remained unchanged relative to those in PA-Lc4. To investigate whether or not C-6 was sulfated, the H5 protons were assigned from the two-dimensional ROESY spectra in which the cross-peak between H1 and H5 was observed. The difference in chemical shift of the H5 proton in Gal (IV) was 0.06 ppm (TableII), which is typical for the sulfation at C-3 of the terminal residue (22Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 324: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 29Tadano-Aritomi K. Kubo H. Ireland P. Hikita T. Ishizuka I. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The additional downfield shift by ∼0.2 ppm, which should result from the sulfation at C-6 (22Iida-Tanaka N. Ishizuka I.

Acta. 1994; 1214: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), was not observed. These results clearly show that GP3ST is a β-Gal-3′-sulfotransferase that transfers a sulfate group to C-3 of the nonreducing β-galactosyl residue.Table IIChemical shift of the galactosyl protons in PA-Lc4 and the enzyme product (PA-Lc4-S)ProtonIV (Galβ)II (-3Galβ-)ppmPA-Lc4 H14.454.51 H23.533.61 H33.653.73 H43.924.14 H53.72PA-Lc4-S H14.564.51 H23.673.62 H34.323.72 H44.304.14 H53.78Difference2-aValues represent the chemical shift differences between PA-Lc4-S and PA-Lc4.

The effect of divalent cations on GP3ST activity is summarized in Table III. GP3ST essentially has no requirement for divalent cations; and in fact, Cu2+ and Zn2+ strongly inhibited the sulfotransferase activity. The Km values for PA-Lc4, PA-nLc4, and PAPS were found to be 220, 480,"

Proteasomal degradation determines the turnover rate for a wide range of proteins including abnormal proteins, short lived regulators, and a significant proportion of cellular proteins (1Rock K.L.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae 20 S crystal structure reveals that the proposed entrance sites of the 20 S proteasome are closed (9Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Isolation of the catalytic sites prevents indiscriminate cleavage of proteins within the cell but requires a mechanism to transfer substrates efficiently into the cavity of the proteasome. Two protein complexes have been identified that allow access through the ends of the proteasome. A 19 S regulatory complex can associate with the 20 S proteasome and forms the ubiquitin-ATP-dependent 26 S proteasome (10Rechsteiner M. Peters J.M. Harris R. Finley D.

A second activating complex, 11 S REG (PA28), has been identified, and activates the proteasome to hydrolyze short peptides but cannot independently stimulate the degradation of intact folded proteins (12Chu-Ping M.

The existence of such complexes has led to the proposal by Hendil e t al. that the REG complex (PA28) may actually participate in the degradation of intact proteins when associated in a hybrid proteasome. The original identification of the 11 S REG proteasome activator was from bovine and human red blood cells using the fluorogenic peptide Suc-LLVY-MCA,17-amino-4-methylcoumarin.

This activator was found to be composed of two subunits termed α and β and was shown to have high similarity to a previously described nuclear protein: Ki autoantigen. This antigen target was originally identified in patients with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (16Tojo T. Kaburaki J. Hayakawa M. Okamoto T. Tomii M. Homma M.

Currently, it is known that the human REGγ forms an additional independent complex within mammalian nuclei and can associate reversibly with the 20 S proteasome (18Tanahashi N. Yokota K. Ahn J.Y.

A variety of evidence indicates that the mammalian REGαβ functions to generate antigens for the major histocompatibility complex class I immune pathway (2Tanaka K. Kasahara M. Immunol.

Expression of PA28 in a fibroblast line increases the presentation of viral epitopes from influenza nucleoprotein and a cytomegalovirus protein (19Groettrup M. Soza A. Eggers M. Kuehn L. Dick T.P.

Finally, transgenic mice that lack the REGαβ subunits have reduced ability to generate class I antigen peptides (25Preckel T. Fung-Leung W.P. Cai Z. Vitiello A. Salter-Cid L. Winqvist O. Wolfe T.G. Von Herrath M. Angulo A. Ghazal P. Lee J.D. Fourie A.M. Wu Y. Pang J. Ngo K. Peterson P.A. Fruh K. Yang Y. Science. 1999; 286: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For mammalian REGγ there is no current evidence that this nuclear protein plays a role in the mammalian immune system. The REGγ has been reported by several groups not to be induced by interferon γ, and its location in the nucleus makes it an unlikely candidate to assist antigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex class I immune system. The human REGγ is able to markedly stimulate the trypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome in vitro, preferentially hydrolyzing peptides with basic residues in the P1 position but only modestly activating the cleavage of other peptides (26Realini C.

Recently, it has been observed that mice deficient in REGγ have modestly reduced growth rates, and derived cell lines were shown to have altered cell division with impeded entry into S phase (27Murata S.

We wished to examine if the Drosophila 11 S REG has a role in the insect's immune system. Drosophila lacks an acquired immune system but depends upon an innate immune system that generates antimicrobial peptides for defense against pathogens. This system is well conserved among mammals and insects and has been proposed to share a common evolutionary origin (28Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). In addition, the vertebrate acquired immune system shares similar signal transduction pathways with the interleukin-1 receptor-NF-κB signaling pathways and is also probably related (29Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 30O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J.

Data base searches of cDNA libraries and the completed Drosophila genome sequence indicate that only a single REG gene is present. The following results demonstrate the presence of a REG activator in Drosophila that is localized to the nucleus by a monopartite NLS and activates the trypsin-like activity of the proteasome while potentially inhibiting chymotrypsin-like activities. Cloning of the dREG gene was carried out by PCR amplification of a Drosophila cDNA adult library. The mRNA was poly T-primed, and the resulting cDNA was directionally cloned using XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites into a pBK-CMV phagemid vector using Lambda Zap Express from Stratagene. The Drosophila library was not reamplified and was diluted 4-fold with water and heated for 15 min at 65 °C. The denatured sample was cleared by centrifugation, and a 5-μl aliquot was used in the individual PCRs. The initial primer used was an upstream primer (5′-GCTAACGAAATGCCTAACGACACTGTGG-3′) that was specific for the Drosophila REG 5′ leader sequence. This primer sequence was obtained from EST sequences available from a data base search, Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project/Howard Hughes Medical Institute EST Project. The downstream sequence of the Drosophila REG was not present in any EST sequence at the time, and a primer (5′-GCGTTAAGATACATTGATGAGTTTGG-3′) that corresponded to the pBK-CMV phagemid vector was used for the initial PCR amplification. PCR products were directly cloned into a Promega EZ-TA cloning vector and finally sequenced. A clone was isolated that matched a full-length cDNA sequence of the Drosophila REG cDNA. Subsequent PCRs used an upstream primer of 5′-AGCTAACCATATGCCTAACGACACTGTGG-3′ that introduced a NdeI restriction site at the initial Met residue of the REG sequence. The downstream primer, 5′-GTTGAGGCTCGGGCTTCGGAAATACC-3′, matched the 3′-end of the REG open reading frame sequence. The resulting PCR products were initially cloned into a TA Promega plasmid and then subsequently cloned into a pET26b expression vector. From the 14 previous cDNAs available on the data base and independent PCR products of the library, a consensus sequence for the dREG was obtained. This sequence was later confirmed by the genomic sequence of dREG. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to identify a nuclear localization signal in the Drosophila REG. The mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit on a Drosophila REG pACT expression vector, and the corresponding mutant was then subcloned into a pET26b bacterial expression vector. The two primers used for mutagenesis were 5′- CGTGACAGTCTGCCCACCAGTAGCCAGAGCGTGGATGTCATCG-3′ and 5′-CGATGACATCCACGCTCTGGCTACTGGTGGGCAGACTGTCACG-3′. The resulting mutant constructs were confirmed by sequencing. BL21(DE3)Escherichia coli transformed with pET26b-dREG was grown at 30 °C in LB medium until an A600 of 0.3 was reached. The bacteria were induced with a final concentration of 300 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and harvested after a 2-h induction. The soluble protein fraction was obtained from induced recombinant cells using a French press and resuspended in two pellet volumes of TS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1.1 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA), followed by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble protein extract was treated with 10% streptomycin sulfate and centrifuged, and the supernatant was dialyzed overnight in TS buffer at 4 °C. The extract was initially passed over a 50-ml DEAE cellulose column followed by elution with a 1-liter 0–1 mKCl gradient in TS buffer, pH 8.8. Fractions containing dREG were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Fractions with the recombinant dREG were further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with TS buffer and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The dREG eluted as a complex, and no monomeric form was apparent during the purification. Staged dechorionated embryos were harvested from Oregon-R wild type Drosophila. The embryos were extensively washed with water and frozen at −80 °C. For a 20 S proteasome purification, 10 g of frozen embryos were resuspended in TBS buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl) with 10% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysate was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The extract was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 10% streptomycin sulfate, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then dialyzed overnight in TBS with 10% glycerol. The extract was passed over a DEAE-cellulose column that had been equilibrated in TBS buffer and 10% glycerol. The 20 S proteasome was eluted with a 1-liter KCl gradient, 0–1 m, and the fractions were assayed for 20 S proteasome LLVY-MCA activity in TS buffer containing 0.035% SDS. Fractions containing proteasome activity were concentrated using Amicon Centricon concentrators. The Drosophila 20 S proteasome extract was passed over a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 20 mm sodium acetate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The fractions were assayed for 20 S proteasome activity and stored frozen at −80 °C. The purity of the 20 S proteasome was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western blot analysis using a proteasome monoclonal antibody, anti-α-subunit HC8, purchased from AFFINITI Research Products. The rabbit 20 S proteasome was purchased from AFFINITI Research Products. Spectrofluorometric assays were performed in the presence of fluorogenic peptides, 1 μg of fly proteasome, or 0.2 μg of rabbit proteasome and various amounts of dREG in a final volume of 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.45. Proteasome and REG were incubated together for 10 min at room temperature to allow association, prior to the addition of the fluorogenic peptide substrates. Reactions were performed at room temperature and terminated by the addition of 200 μl of ice-cold ethanol. Fluorescence was measured with a Bio-Rad fluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. All substrate peptides contained the MCA fluorogenic reporter group. Fluorogenic peptides, Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-MCA, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-MCA, and benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Gly-Leu-MCA, were purchased from AFFINITI Research Products. The peptide Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-MCA was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories Europe. Extracts were made of 107 mbn-2 cells after activation of an immune response by the addition of 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide to the cells. Cells were determined to be immune induced by monitoring increased transcription of the CecA1 gene using semiquantitative RT-PCR. The mbn-2 Drosophila cells were grown at 25 °C in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1.8 g/liter stable l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. To confirm immune inductions, RT-PCR was carried out by RNA isolation of mbn-2 cells after exposure to lipopolysaccharide. The RNA was isolated using a Qiagen QIAshredder homogenizer and RNeasy mini kits. The RT-PCRs were carried out using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp EZ rTth RNA PCR kit. Each RNA sample was run in a series of semiquantitative RT-PCRs, which were withdrawn after an increasing number of cycles. As an internal control, oligonucleotides specific for the RP49 gene 5′-GACCATCCGCCCAGCATACAGGC-3′ and 5′-GAGAACGCAG GCGACCGTTGG-3 were present in the reactions with oligonucleotides for the gene cecropin A1, an antibacterial protein, 5′-GTCGCTCAGACCTCACTGCAATATC-3′ and 5′-CGAGGTCAACCTCGGGCAGTTGC-3′, and finally the Drosophila REG gene, 5′-CGCCAGCGCGTGGATGTCATCG-3′ and 5′-CCACATCTTAAGTAGATTGGAATCC-3′. A dREG antibody was generated against purified recombinant protein in rabbit. The polyclonal antibody was generated by AGRI SERA AB using standard injection protocols. The initial injection used Freund's complete adjuvant followed with booster injections with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. After two secondary injections, Western blots were carried out on the initial prebleeds and compared with the preimmune sera. A total of three injections of recombinant REG yielded a high titer rabbit polyclonal antibody. After immune induction, equivalent amounts of mbn-2 cell protein extracts were separated by electrophoresis on 11% SDS-polyacryamide gels. Drosophilacells were plated on 15-cm Petri dishes and allowed to grow for 24 h until they reached a cell density of 2.0 × 106cells/ml, a total of 1 × 107 cells. Cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide to induce the innate immune system, and the inductions were carried out in triplicate plates. At selected times postinduction, the medium was removed, and the cells were directly lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was incubated in TBS buffer (25 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl) with 10% dried milk for 1 h, followed by primary antibody for 1 h in TBS with 5% dried milk, and finally with 125I-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h in TBS with 5% dried milk. The Western blots were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The immunochemistry was done essentially as described in Ref. 32Engström Y. Rozell B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. In brief, mbn-2 cells were grown as monolayers on glass coverslips at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were fixed in 3.7% (w/v) freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.3, for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed in PBS three times for 20 min each, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min followed by several changes of PBS. The cells were preincubated with either 2% normal swine serum for 30 min at room temperature or 10% dried milk protein in PBS, followed by incubation with polyclonal rabbit anti-REG antibody (1:300) at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed and incubated with either secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled swine anti-rabbit antibody (1:250) (DAKO, Denmark) or anti-rabbit antibody, whole molecule, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate conjugate for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were also costained with Hoechst 33258 dye for 40 s and rinsed with PBS. The slides were observed by fluorescence microscopy or with a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Both the multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree were obtained using the MegAlign program from DNASTAR. Specifically, the alignment of REG protein sequences was carried out using ClustalV (33Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 5: 151-153PubMed Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was derived by using the application of the UPGMA algorithm (34Sneath P.H.A. Sokal R.R. Numerical Taxonomy. Freeman, San Francisco1973Google Scholar), which guides the alignment of ancestral sequences, and applying the neighbor joining method (35Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) to the distance and alignment data. Surface residues were determined using a surface modeling program within the Swiss-PdbViewer package (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9588) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues with ≥25% exposure to solvent were grouped as surface residues. To obtain a complete sequence for the Drosophila REG, PCR amplification was carried out on a previously generated Drosophila cDNA library using a primer specific for the upstream 5′ region of the REG open reading frame and a second primer that corresponded to a downstream vector site. The isolated PCR clones contained a single complete open reading frame that matched the consensus identified from the EST data base. The total length of the isolated gene and flanking sequences consisted of a cDNA sequence with a total of 1359 nucleotides containing an open reading frame of 735 nucleotides and 450 nucleotides within the 3′ downstream region. A search of the Drosophila genomic sequence identified the genomic location of the REG gene on the X chromosome at a genetic map position of 1–41, the gene contains a single intron of 196 base pairs. A sequence alignment of the putative dREG with other REG proteins is shown in Fig. 1 A. The Drosophila REG sequence shares the highest overall similarity with the tick sequence and human REGγ. Comparison of the human REGα crystal structure (37Knowlton J.R. Johnston S.C. Whitby F.G. Realini C. Zhang Z. Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) with the location of conserved residues suggests that the invertebrate REG proteins probably share the same overall structure as seen for human REGα. Important secondary structural features, such as proline residues in predicted turns, are highly conserved among the three classes of REG proteins. However, a nonessential flexible loop region termed the homolog-specific insert region present N-terminal to the activation domain shows little sequence conservation between the REG classes (38Zhang Z. Realini C. Clawson A. Endicott S. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9501-9509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This region does show conservation within the classes and the alignment of the vertebrate and invertebrate REG sequences revealed a conserved domain that resembled a c-Myc nuclear localization domain present in the human oncogene. Comparison of the c-Myc nuclear localization domain and the REG sequences are shown within the homolog-specific insert region (Fig.1 A). An additional difference between the REG homologs that may be functionally significant involves the predicted inner channel surfaces of the REG sequences (Fig. 1 C). The human REGα ring contains a central channel composed of seven long α-helices, with each REG monomer contributing a single helix. The REGαβ proteins have different surface channel properties compared with those predicted for REGγ and the invertebrate REG channel surfaces (Fig. 1,A and C). The REGαβ channels contain a repeating number of basic residues on the channel surface, while the proposed corresponding residue positions found within the REGγ channels are conserved acidic residues. The PA28 or REG was originally found by the use of fluorogenic peptides. The ability of the proteasome to degrade small substrates has been tested in vitro with human REGα, -β, and -γ (26Realini C. Jensen C.C. Zhang Z. Johnston S.C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Human REGαβ strongly activates hydrophobic peptide degradation in vitro, whereas human REGγ preferentially activates the basic trypsin-like peptide hydrolysis. To determine whether the isolated Drosophila gene encodes an active proteasome activator, fluorogenic peptide assays were carried out using purified Drosophila 20 S proteasomes and recombinant REG (Fig.2). As expected, the dREG protein was found as a large complex during size exclusion purification and not as a monomer. Purification of Drosophila 20 S proteasomes was also carried out from wild type Oregon-R Drosophila embryos (Fig. 2 B). The homogenization protocol used for Drosophila embryos has previously been shown not to efficiently rupture the nuclei, and the isolated proteasomes are therefore preferentially from the cytoplasm. The specific activity of Drosophila 20 S proteasome for the cleavage of Suc-LLVY-MCA peptide, 5 pmol/min/μg, agreed with the published activities of isolated Drosophila 20 S proteasome (39Covi J.A. Belote J.M. Mykles D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and for the mammalian form (13Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the Drosophila proteasome showed no detectable REGγ protein present in the purification fractions (data not shown). Fluorogenic peptide assays demonstrated that the recombinant dREG was able to strongly stimulate the trypsin-like activity of the Drosophila 20 S proteasome (Fig.3 A). The activation of the Drosophila proteasome by the REG complex was ATP-independent. To confirm that activation is not due to the presence of contaminating E. coli proteases in the purified recombinant REG sample, assays were carried out in the absence of Drosophila 20 S proteasome. The purified REG sample had no independent protease activity present and required the addition of 20 S proteasome for peptide proteolysis (Fig. 3 A). The dREG, as previously found with the human REGγ, is a strong activator of the trypsin-like activity of the proteasome but a poor activator of other proteolytic activities (Fig. 3 B). Initial kinetic analysis indicates that doubling the Vmax for hydrolysis of Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-MCA peptide led to no observable change in the Km (80 μm). Incubation of dREG with rabbit 20 S proteasome moderately activated the trypsin-like activity 5-fold. Surprisingly, during the initial survey of peptides, the chymotrypsin-like activity for cleavage of Suc-LLVY-MCA was apparently inhibited by dREG. To further examine the apparent decrease of the neutral chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity, assays were carried out to titrate the inhibition of the 20 S proteasome by dREG. As shown in Fig. 3 C, inhibition of Suc-LLVY-MCA cleavage was titratable, requiring an excess ratio of REG versus the Drosophila proteasome. To addr"

Residue −4 in Gαi, Gαo, and Gαt is the cysteine residue that is ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, a covalent modification that prevents the interaction of the G-protein with the receptors. In the Gq family, the residue −4 is a tyrosine residue that has to be phosphorylated for an efficient coupling to the PLC-activating receptors (16Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in the C-terminal structures upon coupling to the GPCR probably cause activation of the Gα−protein. Another region determining coupling selectivity is the extreme N terminus. In the case of Gq/11-proteins, this N terminus has been shown to restrict coupling of these G-proteins to a subset of GPCRs, namely to those known to activate PLC (17Kostenis E. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Finally, the region between α4 and α5 helices that includes the L9 loop and β6 sheet (18Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) is also involved in coupling selectivity probably by directly interacting with the receptors of the rhodopsin-like family (family 1 GPCRs) (10Onrust R.

The overall surface charge of a region that comprises the structures close to the C terminus is probably defining either selectivity or coupling properties in general (23Bae H. Cabrera-Vera T.M.

Among the various G-proteins identified so far, the Gα15subunit has unique properties. This G-protein that is found exclusively in the murine hematopoietic cell lineage shares the closest sequence similarity with the Gαq protein and activates PLCβs (24Wilkie T.M. Scherle P.A.

In cells normally expressing this G-protein as well as in heterologous expression systems it was found that it can couple to many GPCRs, including those that naturally do not stimulate PLC. This was observed with the members of family 1 GPCRs (26Wu D. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gα15 is therefore a G-protein that is not able to discriminate between a variety of receptors (26Wu D. Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16008-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Functional characterization of the human homologue Gα16 revealed that this protein also couples to many GPCRs (27Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) but is not as promiscuous as Gα15. It is of interest to understand what determines the lack of selectivity of Gα15 and which sequences restrict promiscuity of the Gα16 subunit. There are several examples of receptors that cannot activate Gα16 (31Arai H. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21814-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Among the family 3 receptors we reported that the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor mGlu2 activated both Gα15 and Gα16, whereas the group III receptors (mGlu4, -7, and -8 receptors) activated Gα15only (29Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar, 30Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gα15 and Gα16 proteins share 85% sequence identity. Interestingly, they share identical C termini, indicating this sequence element is not responsible for their differential coupling. Such a situation appears ideal to identify other regions in these G-proteins involved in their specific interaction with GPCRs. In the present study, the coupling of both mGlu2 and mGlu8 receptors to a series of Gα15/Gα16 chimeric G-proteins was analyzed. This study revealed that amino acids within α4 helix, β6 strand, L9 loop, and α5 helix constitute one of the determinants that allows G-protein α subunit to discriminate between members of family 3 receptors, a situation corresponding to data reported for family 1 GPCRs. In addition we identified a new region within the G-protein α subunit involved in the selective recognition of group II versus group III mGlu receptors. This new region is located in the loop that connects αN helix with β1 sheet. Chemicals including glutamate were obtained from Sigma (L'Isle d'Abeau, France) unless otherwise indicated. Serum, culture media, and other solutions used for cell culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy Pontoise, France). The plasmids expressing mGlu receptors were as described previously (14Blahos J., II Mary S. Perroy J. de Colle C. Brabet I. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25765-25769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or modified (see below). The hemagglutinin epitope-tagged Gαq was kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Conklin (The Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA). The plasmids pCIS-Gα15 and pCIS-Gα16were kindly provided by Dr. M. Simon (Caltech, Los Angeles, CA). HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, 100 units/ml final). Electroporation was performed in a total volume of 300 μl with 10 μg of carrier DNA, mGlu2, or mGlu8 receptor plasmid DNA (2 and 4 μg, respectively), wild-type or mutated Gα subunit plasmid DNA (1 μg), and 10 million cells in electroporation buffer (K2HPO4, 50 mm; CH3COOK, 20 mm; KOH, 20 mm). After electroporation (260 V, 960 microfarads, Bio-Rad gene pulser electroporator), cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and split in 12-well clusters (Falcon, Paris, France) (10 million cells per cluster) previously coated with poly-l-ornithine (15 μg/ml; M r40,000), (Sigma, Paris, France) to favor adhesion of the cells. The procedure used for the determination of IP accumulation in transfected cells was adapted from previously published methods (33Berridge M. Dawson R. Downes C. Heslop J. Irvine R. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 34Bone E. Fretten P. Palmer S. Kirk C. Michell R. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cells were washed 2–3 h after electroporation and incubated for 14 h in DMEM-glutamax-I (Life Technologies, Inc., Paris, France) containing 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (23.4 Ci/mol), (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Paris, France). Cells were then washed three times and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of Hepes buffer saline (NaCl, 146 mm; KCl, 4.2 mm;MgCl2, 0.5 mm; glucose, 0.1%; Hepes, 20 mm, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 unit/ml glutamate pyruvate transaminase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France) and 2 mm pyruvate (Sigma, Lisle d'Abeau, France). Cells were then washed again twice with the same buffer, and LiCl was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The agonist was applied 5 min later and left for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by replacing the incubation medium with 0.5 ml of perchloric acid (5%), on ice. Supernatants were recovered, and the IPs were purified on Dowex columns. Total radioactivity remaining in the membrane fraction was counted after treatment with 10% Triton X-100, 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min and used as standard. Results are expressed as the amount of IP produced over the radioactivity present in the membranes. The dose-response curves were fitted according to the equationy = ((y max −y min)/1 + (x/EC50)n) + y minusing the kaleidagraph program (Abelbeck software). The anti-Gα15/16 antibodies were raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 10 amino acid residues that are common for both the Gα15 and Gα16. The antiserum was tested in several dilutions (data not shown). The 1:2000 dilution gave optimal results. ECL chemiluminescence system was used to stain the secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Paris, France). The chimeric GαqX5 and GαqX6 were constructed using a unique Xba I site of the cDNA encoding the Gαq-HA-tagged protein. The Xba I sites in the C-terminal part of Gα15 and Gα16 were introduced by silent mutagenesis into the consensus sequence Met-Asp-Leu. This resulted in the expression of chimeric proteins that were detectable by both the HA antibodies and our anti-Gα15/16 C-terminal antibody. Cells were transfected and treated as described above. Cells cultured in one well were harvested for immunodetection, and the rest of the cells were used for IP assay. Protein samples (10 μg per lane) were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Prior to the immunoblotting, total protein on the membranes was visualized with Ponceau S to confirm that the same amounts of protein were loaded on the gel. The G-proteins were detected using primary monoclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin-epitope (generous gift of Dr. B. Mouillac, Montpellier, France) or the newly described polyclonal anti-Gα15/16 C-terminal antibodies. The His6-tagged receptors were detected using specific antibodies recognizing the MRGS-His epitope (Qiagen, Paris, France). We have noticed considerable lower expression levels of the human Gα16 protein than those of Gα15 in transfected HEK 293 cells. To get higher expression levels of Gα16, we removed most of the 5′-untranslated region and introduced a Kozak sequence corresponding to that of Gα15 by polymerase chain reaction using the unique Eco RI-Pst I sites. These modifications were sufficient to raise the Gα16 protein expression obtained with this new Gα16PLUS construct to levels comparable with those reached by Gα15. This construct was used through out the study and is referred as to Gα16 in this text. Silent mutagenesis approach using Pfu-based QuickChangeTMtechnique (Stratagene) was used to introduce a Bam HI, aPst I, and a Bam HI restriction site at the positions indicated in Fig. 2 as sites 1, 2, and 4, respectively. Together with the existing Xba I site (position 3 in Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) and the Hin dIII site in the 3′-untranslated region, these sites were used to construct the chimeric proteins described in Figs. 3 and 4 using conventional subcloning techniques. The same approach was used for making the point mutations.Figure 3a, chimeric proteins between Gα15 and Gα16 at the α4-α5 region were constructed by swapping corresponding portions using silent restriction sites or by introducing point mutations. b, immunoblot analysis of Gα15 and Gα16 proteins and the chimeras and the point mutations expressed in HEK293 cells, stained with the anti-Gα16 antibodies. c, differential coupling of the Gα15, Gα16, and their reciprocal chimeras to mGlu2 and mGlu8 receptors.

Briefly, the pRK5 plasmid containing the sequence encoding the epitope MRGS-His6flanked by a unique Nhe I site at its 5′ end, and an in-frame TAA stop codon at its 3′ end was used. The receptors coding sequences were then introduced by polymerase chain reaction using Nhe I restriction site so that the stop codon was replaced by alanine followed by serine and the MRGS-His6 epitope (where MRGS indicates: methionine, arginine, glycine, serine). The three-dimensional model of the Gα15 subunit was constructed by homology using the coordinates of different G-protein α subunits in their GDP form obtained by x-ray crystallography. These include transducin in its GDP plus Mg2+ form, the αt/αi chimeric protein in its heterotrimeric form with βtγt (35Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Some structural elements were deleted due to their inappropriate folding in the expected heterotrimeric form bound to the receptor. These deletions include the N-terminal α helix (the 24 N-terminal residues of the resolved structure) and the extreme C terminus (4 residues) of the αi1 in its GDP plus Mg2+form. Some constraints were also imposed during the modeling process of Gα15: an α helical secondary structure was imposed to residues 7–39, 305–325, 330–334, and 349–370. The sequence alignment and three-dimensional models were generated using the program Modeler (38Sali A. Blundell T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10447) Google Scholar) in the Insight-II environment (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphic R10000 O2 work station. A statistical evaluation of the three-dimensional model was performed using the Verify 3D algorithm (39Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2539) Google Scholar) and the Verify 3D Structure Evaluation Server. The model giving the best one-dimensional/three-dimensional scores was selected and subjected to energy minimization using the program Discover 2.9.7 (Molecular Simulation Inc.) and the CVFF force field. The extreme C terminus of the Gα15 subunit was modeled manually according to the resolved structure of the 10 C-terminal residues of transducin bound with rhodopsin (40Kisselev O.G. Kao J. Ponder J.W. Fann Y.C. Gautam N. Marshall G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The β1γ2 subunits were added after superposition of the Gα15 model with the Gαi1 subunit in its heterotrimeric complex. The mGlu2 and mGlu8 receptors couple to the Gi type of G-proteins and do not activate PLC pathway when expressed alone in HEK 293 cells. Because Gα15 and Gα16 activate PLCs, their efficient coupling to these mGlu receptors can easily be assayed by measuring the capability of glutamate to activate the PLC pathway in cells expressing both the receptor and one of these G-proteins. As mentioned in the introduction, we reported previously that glutamate activated PLC in HEK 293 cells coexpressing mGlu2 receptors and either Gα15 or Gα16. In contrast, glutamate activated IP formation in cells expressing mGlu8 receptors and Gα15 but not in those coexpressing this receptor with Gα16. To conclude that Gα16can be activated by mGlu2 but not mGlu8 receptors, it was necessary to verify that both G-proteins were expressed at similar levels. We generated a new polyclonal antibody, called anti- Gα15/16AB that recognizes equally well both Gα15 and Gα16 (Fig. 1). The antiserum was raised in rabbits immunized with a peptide corresponding to the extreme C-terminal region (10 amino acid residues) common to both proteins (Figs. 1 and 2). On Western blots, anti-Gα15/16AB recognized a single major band that migrated at a velocity appropriate for these G-proteins (Fig.1). This band was detected only in lanes where membrane proteins from HEK 293 cells expressing proteins possessing C termini of Gα15 or Gα16 were separated. No additional major band was detected, and no bands were detected in lanes where extracts from cells expressing other Gα-protein subunits were loaded (data not shown). To verify that anti-Gα15/16AB was recognizing both G-proteins at the same extent, we expressed chimeric proteins corresponding to the HA-tagged Gαq protein with its last 51 C-terminal residues replaced by their corresponding 63 residues of either Gα15 or Gα16 (chimeras GαqX5 and GαqX6, see Fig. 1). Those were expressed in HEK 293 cells at the same levels, as shown with the HA specific monoclonal antibody. When blots were reprobed with the new antibody anti-Gα15/16AB, the bands corresponding to chimeras bearing Gα15 and Gα16 C termini were stained with similar intensity (Fig. 1). Employing the anti- Gα15/16AB antibody on immunoblots, we noticed that the level of expression of Gα16 was lower than that of Gα15 in cells transfected with the original vectors (data not shown). We therefore replaced the 5′-untranslated region of Gα16 cDNA, including the Kozak sequence with corresponding sequence from of Gα15 coding cDNA (see ”Experimental Procedures“). This modification was found to raise the expression of Gα16 in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells to levels comparable with those of Gα15 (Figs. 1and 3 b). Using the expression plasmids described above, we examined the coupling of mGlu2 and mGlu8 receptors to both Gα15 and the modified Gα16. As shown in Fig. 3 a, glutamate stimulated IP formation in cells coexpressing mGlu2 receptors with either Gα15 or Gα16 , an effect that is dose-dependent (Fig.6). Using the new Gα16 vector, the maximal glutamate effect was found to be slightly lower than that obtained with Gα15 in cells expressing mGlu2 receptors, whereas it was 50% smaller when the original plasmid was used (29Gomeza J. Mary S. Brabet I. Parmentier M.-L. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 923-930PubMed Google Scholar, 30Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the increased protein expression levels of Gα16 that resulted from the modification of the coding plasmid. In cells expressing mGlu8 receptors, a large increase in basal and glutamate-induced IP formation was detected when coexpressed with Gα15, but no change was observed with Gα16. All the glutamate effects were dose-dependent and the calculated EC50 values (for mGlu2 receptor-Gα15 pair the EC50 for glutamate was 8.2 ± 0.8 μm; mGlu2 receptor with Gα16 results in EC50 8.0 ± 0.3 μm glutamate, and mGlu8 receptor coexpressed with Gα15 determined EC50 for glutamate was 9.3 ± 1.6 μm) were close to those determined with these receptors using other assays (41Pin J.-P. de Colle C. Bessis A.-S. Ascher F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 394: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was important to establish that the expression levels of both the receptors and the G-proteins are similar at their different combinations. At the receptor level this was confirmed by using His6-tagged receptors (data not shown). These data further confirm the discriminative coupling of Gα16 to mGlu2 and mGlu8 receptors. To identify the putative regions on the G-protein that cause the differential coupling of Gα15 and Gα16 to mGlu8 receptor, we constructed a series of Gα15/Gα16 chimeras (see panel a in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). When transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells, all chimeras were expressed at levels similar to those of the original proteins as revealed by the antiserum anti- Gα15/16AB (panel b in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Moreover, all constructs did couple well to mGlu2 receptor, as they all allowed an effective coupling of this receptor to IP formation upon glutamate application, showing that they were all functional. Coupling of each single constructs with the receptors are shown in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5(panel c). Chimera Gα15/16C1, which corresponds to Gα15 with the C-terminal 44 residues from Gα16 (Fig. 3 a), showed a smaller response to glutamate as compared with wild-type Gα15 (Fig.3 c). This indicates that the C-terminal portion of Gα16 contains a site that decreases G-protein coupling efficacy to mGlu8 receptors (Fig. 3 c). Progressive exchange of Gα15 C terminus with corresponding sequences of Gα16, as in chimera Gα15/16C2, resulted in a more pronounced decrease in coupling efficiency to mGluR8 (Fig.3 c). The converse chimera Gα15/16C3, which corresponds to Gα16 with the C-terminal 44 residues of Gα15, was activated by mGlu8 receptors, although the glutamate response was smaller than that obtained with Gα15 (Fig. 3 b). The module in Gα16 responsible for discriminating between the two receptors is most likely a region that includes α4 helix, L9 loop, the β6 sheet, and the α5 (residues 331–354). Residues that are different between Gα15 and Gα16 is these regions are: 10 in the α4 helix and N-terminal part of L9 loop,"
https://openalex.org/W1982920006,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) can act as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter depending on the characteristics of the malignant cell. Each of three Ki-ras G12V transfectants of HD6-4 colon cancer cells had been shown to be more aggressive in vivothan controls in earlier studies (Yan, Z., Chen, M., Perucho, M., and Friedman, E. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 30928–30936). We now show that stable expression of oncogenic Ki-ras G12V converts the HD6-4 colon cancer cell line from insensitive to TGF-β1 to growth-promoted by TGF-β1. Each of three Ki-ras G12V transfectants responded to TGF-β1 by an increase in proliferation and by decreasing the abundance of the Cdk inhibitor p21 and the tumor suppressor PTEN, whereas each of three wild-type Ki-ras transfectants remained unresponsive to TGF-β1. The wild-type Ki-rastransfectants lack functional TGF-β receptors, whereas all three Ki-ras G12V transfectants expressed functional TGF-β receptors that bound 125I-TGF-β1. The previous studies showed that in cells with wild-type Ki-ras, TGF-β receptors were not mutated, and receptor proteins were transported to the cell surface, but post-translational modification of TGF-β receptor III (TβRIII) was incomplete. We now show that the betaglycan form of TβRIII is highly modified following translation when transiently expressed in Ki-ras G12V cells, whereas no such post-translational modification of TβRIII occurs in control cells. Antisense oligonucleotides directed to Ki-Ras decreased both TβRIII post-translational modification in Ki-ras G12V cells and TGF-β1 down-regulation of p21, demonstrating the direct effect of mutant Ras. Therefore, one mechanism by which mutant Ki-Ras confers a more aggressive tumor phenotype is by enhancing TβRIII post-translational modification. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) can act as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter depending on the characteristics of the malignant cell. Each of three Ki-ras G12V transfectants of HD6-4 colon cancer cells had been shown to be more aggressive in vivothan controls in earlier studies (Yan, Z., Chen, M., Perucho, M., and Friedman, E. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 30928–30936). We now show that stable expression of oncogenic Ki-ras G12V converts the HD6-4 colon cancer cell line from insensitive to TGF-β1 to growth-promoted by TGF-β1. Each of three Ki-ras G12V transfectants responded to TGF-β1 by an increase in proliferation and by decreasing the abundance of the Cdk inhibitor p21 and the tumor suppressor PTEN, whereas each of three wild-type Ki-ras transfectants remained unresponsive to TGF-β1. The wild-type Ki-rastransfectants lack functional TGF-β receptors, whereas all three Ki-ras G12V transfectants expressed functional TGF-β receptors that bound 125I-TGF-β1. The previous studies showed that in cells with wild-type Ki-ras, TGF-β receptors were not mutated, and receptor proteins were transported to the cell surface, but post-translational modification of TGF-β receptor III (TβRIII) was incomplete. We now show that the betaglycan form of TβRIII is highly modified following translation when transiently expressed in Ki-ras G12V cells, whereas no such post-translational modification of TβRIII occurs in control cells. Antisense oligonucleotides directed to Ki-Ras decreased both TβRIII post-translational modification in Ki-ras G12V cells and TGF-β1 down-regulation of p21, demonstrating the direct effect of mutant Ras. Therefore, one mechanism by which mutant Ki-Ras confers a more aggressive tumor phenotype is by enhancing TβRIII post-translational modification. transforming growth factor-β transforming growth factor-β receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase thymidine base pair(s) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The TGF-β1 family of proteins number >25 and regulate cell growth and differentiation as well as morphogenesis and angiogenesis (1Kingsley D.

There are three mammalian isoforms, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, which are structurally very similar with nine conserved cysteines. The TGF-βs belong to a superfamily of structurally related proteins including the activins, inhibins, and bone morphogenic proteins (3Cui W. Akhurst R. Bondy C. LeRoith D. Growth Factors and Cytokines in Health and Disease. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1996Google Scholar). The TGF-βs induce diverse biological responses by binding to the high affinity receptors TβRI (53 kDa) and TβRII (75 kDa), which function as a heterodimer. Both receptors have a cysteine-rich extracellular domain, one transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail that includes a serine/threonine kinase domain (4Lin H. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R. Lodish H. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 5Franzen P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schultz P. Heldin D. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Constitutively phosphorylated TβRII binds TGF-β1, which then recruits TβRI into the complex. TβRI is transphosphorylated by TβRII and propagates the signal by its kinase activity to downstream substrates (6Wrana J. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Two other cell-surface TGF-β-binding proteins are the type III receptors betaglycan and endoglin, which modulate cellular responses to TGF-β, but have no signaling sequences. Betaglycan and endoglin may function by regulating TGF-β access to TβRII (7Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J. Lane W. Massague J.

TβRIII receptors are not found in every TGF-β-responsive cell and are down-regulated during myoblast differentiation into myotubes (10Ewton D. Spizz G. Olson E. Florini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4029-4032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chief mediators of TGF-β signaling are the SMAD family of structurally related proteins. Receptor-activated SMAD proteins form heterotrimeric complexes and translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with other transcription factors to drive TGF-β1-induced transcription (11Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Transcription factors interacting with SMAD proteins include FAST-1 and FAST-2 (12Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 13Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J.

Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The cooperation of SMAD proteins with other transcription factors suggests that TGF-β1 induces multiple parallel signaling pathways. Additional reported members of the TGF-β signaling pathways include the SMAD-interacting protein SARA and related proteins (15Tsukazaki T. Chiang T. Davison A. Attisano L. Wrana J.

Several investigators have reported that expression of oncogenic Ras confers resistance to the growth inhibitory properties of TGF-β (24Sipes N. Lyons R. Moses H. Mol. Carcinog. 1990; 3: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Houck K. Michalopoulos G. Strom S. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar, 26Filmus J. Zhao J. Buick R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 521-526PubMed Google Scholar, 27Longstreet M. Miller B. Howe P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1549-1556PubMed Google Scholar). In mouse mammary epithelial cells, oncogenic Ras was shown to constitutively activate the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2. Activated ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylate multiple sites within the linker regions of SMAD2 and SMAD3, decreasing, but not totally eliminating, SMAD translocation into the nucleus following TGF-β stimulation (28Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Oncogenic Ras, by this mechanism, eliminates the antimitogenic activity of TGF-β. However, treatment of the same oncogenic Ras-transformed cells with TGF-β1 causes an epithelial-to-fibroblastoid conversion to a more invasive phenotype (29Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Berg H. Reichman E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2462-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), showing that these cells maintained some TGF-β signaling pathways, which mediated tumor aggressiveness. In the mouse skin model of chemical carcinogenesis, one Ha-ras gene is activated by mutation and the normal is allele lost, causing the cells to undergo a morphological transformation to a highly invasive spindle phenotype that can be induced in synergy with TGF-β1 (30Akhurst R. Balmain A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We now report another system in which oncogenic Ras and TGF-β1 work together to enhance tumorigenicity and also report initial studies on the mechanism of this response. Goblet cells compose ∼20% of the colon epithelial cell population and are resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-β1 in vivo, becoming enriched relative to other colon epithelial cells in mice injected with recombinant TGF-β1 (31Deng X. Bellis S. Yan Z. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). Colon goblet cell lines are also resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 (32Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that oncogenic Ras up-regulates post-translational modification of the type III TGF-β receptor in the HD6-4 colon goblet cell line. Unexpectedly, TGF-β1 induces cell proliferation in the presence of oncogenic Ki-ras and, in parallel, down-regulates the Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1 and the tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN. 125I-TGF-β1 and [3H[TdR were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Human recombinant TGF-β1 was from R&D Systems. Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer paper (Immobilon-P) was from Millipore Corp. Antibody TED1 to PTEN was the kind gift of Dr. Hong Sun (Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine). Antibodies to TβRI/Alk5, TGF-β1, and TβRII were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies to phospho-SMAD2 and total SMAD2 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; antibody to betaglycan/TβRIII was from R&D Systems; and mouse monoclonal IgG2a clone 70 to p21Cip1 and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY69 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Phosphorothiolated oligodeoxynucleotides were a gift of Dr. Brett Monia (Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, CA). Isis-13177 is a 20-mer of random sequence, and Isis-6957 is a 20-mer targeted to the 5′-untranslated region of Ki-Ras (CAG-TGC-CTG-CGC-CGC-GCT-CG). This sequence is found within the promoter region of the c-Ki-ras2 gene cloned into pMiKVal12 (see below) ∼60 bp upstream of the translational start site. Endoglycosidase F (N-glycosidase F-free), also known as endo-β-N-acetylglucosidase F, was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents, including chondroitinase ABC and heparitinase III, were from Sigma. Treatment of Ki-ras transfectants was essentially as described (34Chen G. Oh S. Monia B. Stacey D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28259-28265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 2 × 105/well in six-well plates. 48 h later, the cells were washed with prewarmed serum-free insulin transferrin/selenious acid-supplemented DMEM and then incubated in this medium with a fixed ratio of oligonucleotide to Lipofectin (2.4 μl of Lipofectin/100 μmoligonucleotide) for 4 h. The oligonucleotide-containing medium was then replaced with normal growth medium, and growth was continued for 48 h to allow Ras turnover plus reduced Ras mRNA levels to result in reduced Ras protein levels (34Chen G. Oh S. Monia B. Stacey D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28259-28265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from monolayer cultures with TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the supplier's manual. RNA was treated with DNase I (amplification-grade; Life Technologies, Inc.) and RT-PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA Thermal Cycler 480 using a Promega Access RT-PCR kit as follows and using the primers and conditions described previously (31Deng X. Bellis S. Yan Z. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). The amplification products were analyzed by ethidium bromide-agarose gel electrophoresis. The primer set used for RT-PCR of betaglycan mRNA yielded an expected amplification product of 592 bp, whereas primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fromCLONTECH gave a product of 452 bp. Derivation of the oncogenic Ki-ras and wild-type Ki-ras transfectants was as described (35Yan Z. Chen M. Perucho M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30928-30937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in low glucose DMEM buffered with 25 mm Hepes (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.) and containing 7% fetal bovine serum as described (32Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar). Cell density was carefully controlled in these experiments. Within 1 day of growth to confluency, cells were plated at one-third confluent density and then used 2 days later. Serum-free transferrin/selenious acid-supplemented DMEM was used for the TGF-β1 growth experiments (33Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1-treated cells were less adherent, so both adherent and floating cells were analyzed for [3H[TdR incorporation after 3 h of labeling as described (33Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel wells that were not seeded with cells were washed to remove nonspecifically bound label, which was subtracted from all experimental values. The c-Myc-tagged rat betaglycan expression plasmid pCMV-mycBGL was received from J. Massague (7Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J. Lane W. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the retroviral vector pLXSN (CLONTECH). The recombinant retrovirus was used to infect mutant Ki-ras transfectant cells and control cells. Cells were incubated with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in methionine-free DMEM for 6 h before lysates were prepared. 500 μg of cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of anti-TβRIII antibody and 40 μl of protein G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pelleted at 2500 rpm, and washed three times with lysis buffer. After the final wash, the pellet was mixed with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled in a water bath for 5 min. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and TβRIII was detected by Western blotting using anti-TβRIII antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and ECL. Cell lysates were diluted 1:5 with detergent-free lysis buffer and then incubated for 36 h with chondroitinase ABC (2 units/ml), heparitinase (2 units/ml), and N-glycosidase F (5 units/ml) before SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Cells grown in complete medium were lysed in buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride. Depending on the experiment, 30–70 μg of cell lysate proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation by SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 4% nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were used in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% dry milk at the indicated concentrations (anti-p21Cip1/Waf1, 1 μg/ml; anti-TβRI, 1 μg/ml; anti-TβRII, 1 μg/ml; and anti-TβRIII (betaglycan), 1 μg/ml) and dilutions (1:1000 TGF-β1, 1:1000 PTEN, 1:1000 phospho-SMAD2 and total SMAD2, and 1:1000 phosphotyrosine) and then incubated for 2–3 h with primary antibody, and proteins were subsequently detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For p21Cip1 blots, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and blocking was performed in 1% dry milk plus 4% bovine serum albumin. For SMAD2 blots, the first antibody was diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin, and the second in 2.5% dry milk. Affinity labeling of TGF-β receptors with125I-TGF-β1 was performed essentially as described (33Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-surface proteins were biotinylated essentially as described by the vendor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, exponentially growing cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with 40 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.6). Cells were then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 40 mm bicarbonate buffer containing 50 μl of biotin reagent/ml of buffer, 4 ng/ml TGF-β1, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free). Following two washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in 25 mm Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride. 300 μg of each cell lysate were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 200 μl of streptavidin coupled to agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were then washed extensively and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cell-surface TβRI and TβRII were immunoprecipitated with anti-TβRII antibody C-16 with or without TβRII peptide C-16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with anti-TβRI antibody R-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)Biotechnology; antibodies were bound with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin after washing and then detected with ECL. Calculations measuring the difference between two means were performed by the t test. The Ki-ras G12V transfectant cloned sublines V, V1, and V2 were isolated following stable transfection of HD6-4 colon carcinoma cells with a mini-gene construct of the cellular Ki-ras4B gene mutated at codon 12 to valine. Three stable sublines (G, G2, and G3) were isolated following transfection with the wild-type mini-gene construct of cellular Ki-ras4B (35Yan Z. Chen M. Perucho M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30928-30937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Yan Z. Deng X. Chen M. Xu Y. Abram M. Sloane B. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27902-27907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Ki-ras G12V transfectant lines expressed oncogenic Ki-Ras protein, whereas the wild-type Ki-ras transfectant G lines expressed more wild-type Ki-Ras protein as shown by Western blotting with Ki-Ras-specific and pan-RasVal12-specific antibodies (35Yan Z. Chen M. Perucho M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30928-30937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The parental line is not responsive to TGF-β1 (31Deng X. Bellis S. Yan Z. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar), but unexpectedly became TGF-β1-responsive following expression of oncogenic Ki-Ras protein. Ki-ras G12Vtransfectant V cells exhibited a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of an unknown cellular protein of ∼60 kDa after addition of TGF-β1, whereas no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of this or any other protein was found in control cells treated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 1 A). The 60-kDa protein showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation following 5 and 15 min of TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 1 A, arrow), whereas the abundance of phosphotyrosine in a 200-kDa protein remained constant, demonstrating equal loading. The chief mediators of TGF-β signaling are the SMAD family of structurally related proteins. Upon TGF-β receptor activation, TβRI activates phosphorylation of SMAD2 and/or SMAD3, each of which can form an association with the common mediator SMAD4 and then translocate to the nucleus and mediate transcription (reviewed in Refs. 11Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar and 37Heldin C. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). SMAD2 is activated by phosphorylation of serines 465 and 467 (38Abdollah S. Macias-Silva M. Tsukasaki T. Hayashi H. Attisano L. Wrana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). 30 min of TGF-β1 treatment caused a striking increase in the activation of phosphorylation of SMAD2 in the oncogenic Ki-ras V transfectant, but no activation in control cells (Fig. 1 B). A slight increase in the total amount of SMAD2 and SMAD3 in the Ki-ras V transfectant was also detected by Western blotting. Thus, expression of mutant Ki-Ras protein unexpectedly restored an initial step in a TGF-β signaling pathway in these cells. The Ki-ras G12Vtransfectant lines were more tumorigenic in vivo and more invasive in vitro than the control cells (35Yan Z. Chen M. Perucho M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30928-30937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Yan Z. Deng X. Chen M. Xu Y. Abram M. Sloane B. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27902-27907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutant Ki-Ras caused aberrant post-translational glycosylation of β1 integrin, loss of cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix, blocked cell polarization, and decreased cell-cell adhesion properties through up-regulation of carcinoembryonic antigen and down-regulation of N-cadherin (35Yan Z. Chen M. Perucho M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30928-30937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Yan Z. Deng X. Chen M. Xu Y. Abram M. Sloane B. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27902-27907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These decreases in attachment to the extracellular matrix and intercellular adhesion provide one basis for selection for Ki-rasmutations in colon cancers. We had noted in past experiments that certain highly aggressive or metastatic colon cancer cells responded to TGF-β1 by increased cell growth (39Schroy P. Rifkin J. Coffey R. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 261-265PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hsu S. Huang F. Hafez M. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar, 41Huang F. Newman E. Kerbel R.

Cancer. 2000; 87: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and wondered if the increased aggressiveness of the Ki-ras G12V transfectant cells in vivoreflected increased growth in response to autocrine or exogenous TGF-β1. TGF-β1 induced a statistically significant, dose-dependent increase in growth up to 2-fold in Ki-ras G12V transfectant V cells, whereas TGF-β1 induced no change in proliferation of parental cells grown in parallel (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). The p value for mean growth ± 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 was <0.01, whereas the p values for growth ± 2 and 4 ng/ml TGF-β1 were both <0.001, all statistically significant differences. This growth response to TGF-β1 was generalized by assaying two additional Ki-ras G12V transfectant cell lines, V1 and V2, and three other control lines at the optimal TGF-β1 concentration (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). TGF-β1 at 4 ng/ml increased [3H[TdR incorporation 1.5- to >2-fold in V1 and V2 cells, with statistically significant p values of <0.0005. In contrast, TGF-β1 had no effect on cycling of wild-type Ki-ras transfectant G2 and G3 cells or the parental line with endogenous wild-type Ki-ras (Fig.2 B). The mechanism of this unexpected proliferative response to TGF-β1 was explored by assaying two proteins associated with tumorigenicity: the Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1 (43El-Deiry W. Tokino T.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 125-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). p21Cip1/Waf1 inhibits cell cycling by targeting most Cdk-cyclin complexes, binding to them and inhibiting their kinase activity. PTEN is a phospholipid phosphatase, deleted or mutated in a wide variety of tumors (46Maehama T. Dixon J.

Loss of PTEN activity would up-regulate the activity of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which is known to play an important role in generating cell survival signals (47Khwaja A.

Ki-ras G12Vtransfectant V cells and control cells were treated for 2 days with 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 ng/ml TGF-β1, and then cell lysates were blotted for abundance of p21 and PTEN (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). In control cells with wild-type Ki-ras, TGF-β1 caused no alteration in the levels of either protein. However, in duplicate experiments, TGF-β1 induced a dose-dependent decrease in the abundance of the Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1, with the optimal growth-stimulating concentration of 4 ng/ml TGF-β1 reducing p21 levels to 16% of the control. PTEN levels were decreased 6-fold by 2, 4, or 8 ng/ml TGF-β1 only in the mutant Ki-Ras transfectant V cells. Coomassie Blue staining of the blot demonstrated equal loading (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). The generality of these responses was determined by assaying several more cell lines. Levels of p21Cip1/Waf1 and PTEN were examined in two other oncogenic Ki-ras transfectant lines (V1 and V2), two wild-type Ki-ras transfectant lines (G2 and G3), and the parental line with endogenous wild-type ras. Treatment with the optimal concentration of 4 ng/ml TGF-β1 decreased p21 levels in V1 and V2 cells expressing mutant Ki-Ras by 52 and 90%, respectively, whereas no decreases in p21 levels were observed in G1 and G3 lines with wild-type ras (Fig. 2 B,lower panel). Treatment with 4 ng/ml TGF-β1 decreased PTEN levels in V1 and V2 cells expressing mutant Ki-Ras by 50 and 30%, respectively, in duplicate experiments. In contrast, no decreases were observed in PTEN levels in G2 and G3 cells expressing only wild-type Ki-ras. Thus, TGF-β1 acts like a mitogen in mutant Ki-ras-transformed colon carcinoma cells, possibly by decreasing the abundance of the Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1. The loss of PTEN expression with TGF-β1 treatment may contribute to the aggressive growth of each Ki-ras G12V transfectant cell line in vivo, as cells can respond to TGF-β1 from autocrine or paracrine sources (35Yan Z.

Secreted tetramers associate end-to-end to form the distinctive extracellular microfibrils that are found in virtually all connective tissues. Although the precise protein interactions involved in this process are unknown, the N-terminal globular regions, which are composed of multiple copies of von Willebrand factor type A-like domains, are likely to play a critical role in microfibril formation, because they are exposed at both ends of the tetramers. To explore the role of these subdomains in collagen VI intracellular and extracellular assembly, α3(VI) cDNA expression constructs with sequential N-terminal deletions were stably transfected into SaOS-2 cells, producing cell lines that express α3(VI) chains with N-terminal globular domains containing modules N9-N1, N6-N1, N5-N1, N4-N1, N3-N1, or N1, as well as the complete triple helix and C-terminal globular domain (C1-C5). All of these transfected α3(VI) chains were able to associate with endogenous α1(VI) and α2(VI) to form collagen VI monomers, dimers, and tetramers, which were secreted. Importantly, cells that expressed α3(VI) chains containing the N5 subdomain, α3(VI) N9-C5, N6-C5, and N5-C5, formed microfibrils and deposited a collagen VI matrix. In contrast, cells that expressed the shorter α3(VI) chains, N4-C5, N3-C5, and N1-C5, were severely compromised in their ability to form end-to-end tetramer assemblies and failed to deposit a collagen VI matrix. These data demonstrate that the α3(VI) N5 module is critical for microfibril formation, thus identifying a functional role for a specific type A subdomain in collagen VI assembly.

Even though the cell adhesion and extracellular matrix protein binding capabilities of collagen VI have suggested that it may play an important role in the interconnection between the cell and the structural scaffolding of the extracellular matrix, it is only recently that one such critical tissue-specific role in muscle has been demonstrated by the detection of mutations in collagen VI genes in Bethlem myopathy (3Jobsis G.J.

Collagen VI is composed of three genetically distinct α-chain subunits, α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI), each of which contain a relatively short triple helix and N- and C-terminal globular regions. Recent studies have demonstrated that initial association of all three chains into a collagen VI triple helical heterotrimer is a prerequisite for further intracellular assembly, stability and secretion (8Lamandé S.R.

The α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains are similar in size (1009 and 998 amino acids, respectively) and contain one N- and two C-terminal subdomains of approximately 200 amino acids that show homology to the type A domains of von Willebrand factor (vWF)1 (9Chu M.-L. Pan T. Conway D. Kuo H.-J. Glanville R.W. Timpl R. Mann K. Deutzmann R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1939-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, the α3(VI) chain is much larger (up to 3149 amino acids), containing 6 to 10 N-terminal vWF type A-like subdomains (depending on alternative splicing), two C-terminal vWF type A-like subdomains, and subdomains similar to type III fibronectin repeats, and Kunitz protease inhibitors (10Chu M.L.

The precise protein interactions initiating and regulating formation of the unique collagen VI microfibril supramolecular assemblies are not known, but elegant structural studies have identified the organization of assembly intermediates, providing a model for a hierarchical assembly process unlike that of any other members of the collagen family (12Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 13Engel J. Furthmayr H. Odermatt E. von der Mark H. Aumailley M. Fleischmajer R. Timpl R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 460: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Following heterotrimeric assembly of the α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains, these collagen VI monomers form higher order structures intracellularly by aligning in an anti-parallel manner with a 30-nm stagger, first to form dimers and then tetramers by lateral association of dimers. After secretion, the tetramers associate end-to-end to form microfibrils with a distinctive 100-nm periodicity, comprising beaded globular domains separated by short triple helical regions (12Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 13Engel J. Furthmayr H. Odermatt E. von der Mark H. Aumailley M. Fleischmajer R.

However, the critically important questions of what protein structures and interactions drive these complex and specific associations during collagen VI assembly have not been addressed in detail. It is likely that numerous motifs within the collagen VI α-chains contribute to the final microfibril structure and to the development of its heterotypic interactions with other matrix components. The type A subdomains present in all three collagen VI subunits, and found in a number of other extracellular proteins including integrins, matrilins, complement components, and collagens VII, XII, and XIV (14Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1997; 77: 2305-2315Crossref Google Scholar, 15Bohme K. Li Y. Oh P.S. Olsen B.R. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Gerecke D.R. Foley J.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12177-12184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are likely to play an important role, as they have been shown to be commonly involved in specific molecular interactions (14Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1997; 77: 2305-2315Crossref Google Scholar). In particular, it seems probable that the N terminus of the α3(VI) chain may be the crucial domain involved in tetramer-tetramer association because its multiple type A modules would be exposed at both ends of the tetramers during microfibril formation. To examine systematically the role of the α3(VI) N-terminal type A subdomains, N9 to N1, in collagen VI intracellular tetramer assembly and extracellular microfibril formation α3(VI) cDNA constructs with sequential deletions of the N-terminal type A modules were stably transfected into SaOS-2 cells, producing a range of cell lines that express α3(VI) chains with N-terminal domains containing modules N9-N1, N6-N1, N5-N1, N4-N1, N3-N1, or N1, as well as the complete triple helix and C-terminal globular domain. Our data show that α3(VI) subdomains N2 to N9 are not required for intracellular heterotrimer assembly or for the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers and tetramers. Ultrastructural examination of the secreted collagen VI demonstrated that tetramers were able to associate end-to-end to form microfibrils in cells expressing α3(VI) chains containing the N-terminal N9-N1, N6-N1, and N5-N1 modules. Significantly, however, the efficiency of tetramer-tetramer association was reduced in cells expressing α3(VI) chains with N-terminal domains lacking the N5 module. These data provide the first evidence that an α3(VI) N-terminal subdomain (N5) plays a critical role in the interactions between collagen VI tetramers leading to the formation of the microfibrillar network. All constructs were cloned in the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), which contains the neomycin phosphotransferase gene conferring resistance to G418. Production and stable expression of the α3(VI) N6-C5 construct, encoding the BM40 signal sequence and the α3(VI) protein domains N6 to C5 (Fig. 1), have been described previously (8Lamandé S.R.

Constructs encoding α3(VI) domains N5-C5, N4-C5, and N1-C5 were generated by PCR using the α3(VI) N6-C5 cDNA as a template. Forward primers were designed to anneal at the 5′ end of subdomains N5, N4, and N1, beginning at nucleotides 2710 (domains N9-C5, ATG at base 256 (10Chu M.L. Zhang R.Z. Pan T.C. Stokes D. Conway D.

The downstream primer in each reaction corresponded to nucleotides 5748–5771 near the 5′ end of the triple helix and included the SacII site at base 5757. PCR was performed using the proof-reading polymerase Pfu(Stratagene). The resultant fragments were digested with NheI and SacII and used to replace the corresponding fragment of the α3(VI) N6-C5 construct. The α3(VI) N3-C5 construct was generated by digesting α3(VI) N6-C5 with NheI and Bpu1 1021 (recognition site at base 3778). The restriction enzyme-generated overhangs were filled in using Klenow polymerase (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.52Google Scholar), and the resulting blunt ends were religated. The Bpu1 1021 site is in the N4 subdomain, and therefore the α3(VI) N3-C5 construct contains 151 nucleotides of N4 at the 5′ end. To facilitate production of the α3(VI) N9-C5 construct, an NheI site within the N9 subdomain cDNA was deleted using strand overlap extension PCR (18Horton R.M. Pease L. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar) to introduce a silent T to C substitution at position 747. Primers A and B were used to amplify bases 331–755 using the cDNA clone FO19 (10Chu M.L. Zhang R.Z. Pan T.C. Stokes D. Conway D. Kuo H.J. Glanville R. Mayer U. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) as a template, and primers C and D to amplify bases 735–2097. Primers B and C overlapped, and both contained the single nucleotide substitution. To allow cloning, primer A contained a NheI site at the 5′ end. These amplification products were gel-purified, and 100 ng of each used was as the template in a second round of overlapping PCR with primers A and D. The resulting PCR product was digested with NheI and cloned into the NheI site of α3(VI) N6-C5 to generate the α3(VI) N9-C5 construct. To ensure that no errors had been introduced during PCR and cloning, all constructs were transcribed and translated in vitro(TNT®, Promega), and the regions generated by PCR were sequenced (AmpliCycle™, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (data not shown). The SaOS-2 human osteosarcoma cell line (ATCC HTB-85), which expresses α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNA but not α3(VI) mRNA (8Lamandé S.R. Sigalas E. Pan T.-C. Chu M.-L. Dziadek M. Timpl R. Bateman J.F. J.

Cells were transfected with the α3(VI) expression constructs using LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected cells were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and individual clones isolated and expanded into cell lines. RNA was isolated from cultured SaOS-2 cells using RNeasy™ (Qiagen). Total RNA (5 μg) was analyzed under denaturing conditions on 1% agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.52Google Scholar).

SaOS-2 cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes, incubated overnight in the presence of 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate, and then biosynthetically labeled for 18 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label™ 1032 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in 750 μl of methionine-free and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. The medium was removed, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and protease inhibitors were added to the following final concentrations: 1 mm 4-(2 aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 5 mm EDTA. The cell layer was solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm 4-(2 aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Cell lysates and medium samples were clarified by centrifugation and the supernatants precleared with 100 μl of 20% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 2 h. Collagen VI in the supernatants was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using either the α3(VI) monoclonal antibody 3C4 obtained from Dr E. Engvall (21Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J.

Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed twice with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min each. Immunoprecipitated collagen VI was eluted into gel loading buffer at 65 °C for 15 min and analyzed following reduction with 25 mm dithiothreitol by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Collagen VI triple helical monomers, dimers, and tetramers were analyzed on 2.4% (w/v) acrylamide/0.5% (w/v)-agarose composite gels under nonreducing conditions (5Lamandé S.R. Shields K.A.

SaOS-2 cells were grown to confluence and then supplemented daily for 15 days with 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. Cell layers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 0.15 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, containing 1.5% paraformaldehyde (w/v), 1.5% gluteraldehyde (v/v), and 0.1% (w/v) tannic acid for 90 min, rinsed in 0.15 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, post-fixed in 1% (v/v) osmium tetroxide for 1 h, washed with cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol to 100%, and then embedded in Spurr's epoxy and sectioned (50 nm). Confluent SaOS-2 cultures in 80-cm2 flasks were incubated for 18 h in 10 ml of serum-free medium containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. The medium was collected, the protease inhibitors described earlier were added, and sodium azide was included at a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v). To examine collagen VI that had been deposited into the extracellular matrix, confluent SaOS-2 cells were grown in the continuous presence of 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate for 15 days. Cell layers were washed with 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, scraped into 5 ml of this buffer, and then mildly disrupted using a Teflon homogenizer. Culture medium and homogenized matrix samples were clarified by centrifugation, adsorbed onto carbon-coated grids for 1 min, washed with water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge in air, and samples were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. SaOS-2 cells were grown to confluence in 8-well chamber glass slides (Nunc) and then supplemented daily for 15 days with 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. Cell layers were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and then air-dried. Slides were preincubated with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with either the collagen VI antibody 3C4 in PBS or PBS alone for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (Silenus). Slides were mounted in FluorSave™ reagent (Calbiochem) and then viewed and photographed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. To examine the contribution of the α3(VI) N-terminal globular subdomains to collagen VI intracellular assembly, microfibril formation, and matrix deposition, we stably transfected SaOS-2 cells, which express α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNA and protein but no α3(VI) mRNA (8Lamandé S.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7423-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), with six α3(VI) cDNA constructs from which the N-terminal globular domains N9 to N1 were progressively deleted. As a result of alternative splicing, more than 95% of the α3(VI) mRNAs found in cells and tissues lack the N10 subdomain (11Zanussi S. Doliana R. Segat D. Bonaldo P. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24082-24089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the α3(VI) N9-C5 construct was used as the “full-length” control in this study. Individual cell clones transfected with either the control construct (α3(VI) N9-C5) or the shorter constructs (α3(VI) N6-C5, N5-C5, N4-C5, N3-C5, and N1-C5) (Fig. 1) were selected in medium containing G418 and screened for expression of α3(VI) mRNA by Northern blotting (data not shown). Cell lines were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and cell layer and medium fractions immunoprecipitated with collagen VI antibodies. The immunoprecipitated material was electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions to visualize the individual collagen VI chains. All transfected cell lines expressed α3(VI) protein that migrated with an apparent molecular mass in good agreement with the predicted size of each of the shorter chains (Fig.2) when compared with the control α3(VI) N9-C5 (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 12). Because the collagen VI antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were specific for the α3(VI) chain (N9, N6, N5, N4, and N3 constructs), or assemblies of all three chains (N1 construct), co-immunoprecipitation of α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains in all of the cell lines indicated that the shortened α3(VI) chains had formed collagen VI heterotrimers that were able to be secreted. Collagen VI found in the medium had a slower electrophoretic mobility compared with that isolated from the cell layer fraction. This is a consistent finding in both transfected SaOS-2 cells and primary human fibroblasts (5Lamandé S.R. Shields K.A. Kornberg A.J. Shield L.K. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

Secretion of all three collagen VI chains by each of the transfected cell lines provided indirect evidence that heterotrimers containing the shortened α3(VI) chains were able to assemble further into tetramers, the normal secreted form of collagen VI (22Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Ainger K. Bressan G.M. Volpin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14454-14460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetramer formation was demonstrated directly by composite agarose/acrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions (Fig.3). The predominant form of collagen VI secreted by cells expressing control α3(VI) N9-C5 chains migrated with a molecular mass of approximately 2000 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 12) as expected for collagen VI tetramers. Comparable results were seen in cultures expressing each of the shortened α3(VI) chains (Fig.3, lanes 1–10), clearly demonstrating that the α3(VI) N-terminal subdomains N9-N2 are not required for collagen VI monomer, dimer, and tetramer formation and secretion. To determine whether collagen VI tetramers containing shortened α3(VI) chains could self-associate to form end-to-end assemblies of tetramers, secreted collagen VI was examined by negative staining electron microscopy. Medium from cells expressing α3(VI) N9-C5, α3(VI) N6-C5, and α3(VI) N5-C5 (Fig. 4 A) contained microfibrils composed of multiple tetramers as well as single tetramers. In contrast, the majority of the collagen VI in medium from cells expressing the shorter α3(VI) chains, α3(VI) N4-C5, α3(VI) N3-C5, and α3(VI) N1-C5 (Fig. 4 B), was present as single tetramers. Microfibril formation in multiple clonal cell lines expressing the control and shortened α3(VI) chains was quantified by analysis of a large number of micrograph fields (Fig.5). The occurrence of “microfibrils” containing 1–7 tetramers is shown as a percentage of the total number of microfibrils. In cells expressing α3(VI) N9-C5, N6-C5, and N5-C5, 70–80% of the microfibrils contained 2–7 tetramers and only 20–30% were single tetramers (Fig.5, A–C). In striking contrast, in medium from cells expressing α3(VI) N4-C5, N3-C5, and N1-C5, more than 70% of all microfibrils were single tetramers, with only a small number of double tetramers and virtually no higher aggregations of tetramers (Fig. 5,D–F). The efficiency of microfibril formation was comparable in all of the clonal cell lines expressing α3(VI) N9-C5, N6-C5, and N5-C5 (Fig. 5, A–C) and was reduced in all of the cell lines expressing α3(VI) N4-C5, N3-C5, and N1-C5 (Fig.5, D–F). These data demonstrate that all of the cells expressing α3(VI) chains, including the N5 subdomain, are able to form microfibrils with similar efficiency, whereas those lacking the N5 have compromised multimerization, suggesting that the α3(VI) N5 module is crucial for the interactions between tetramers that lead to the formation of microfibrils.Figure 5Quantitative analysis of collagen VI tetramer-tetramer association. Collagen VI secreted into the medium of transfected SaOS-2 cells was visualized by negative staining electron microscopy, and the ability of the tetramers to associate end-to-end was quantitated. The occurrence of microfibrils containing 1–7 tetramers is shown as a percentage of the total number of microfibrils. When available, multiple clonal cell lines expressing each α3(VI) cDNA construct were analyzed. SaOS-2 cells expressing: A, α3(VI) N9-C5; B, α3(VI) N6-C5;C, α3(VI) N5-C5; D, α3(VI) N4-C5;E, α3(VI) N3-C5; F, α3(VI) N1-C5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To formally exclude the possibility that the efficiency of tetramer aggregation was dependent on the concentration of tetramers in the medium, the levels of α3(VI) mRNA and protein in an α3(VI) N5-C5 cell line (able to form microfibrils) and two α3(VI) N3-C5 cell lines (not able to form microfibrils) were examined. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the α3(VI) N5-C5 cell line (clone 28) contained much less α3(VI) mRNA than either of the two α3(VI) N3-C5 cell lines (clones 19 and 17) (Fig.6 A). The amount of collagen VI protein produced by these clones was consistent with the level of expression of α3(VI) mRNA. Small amounts of collagen VI protein were present in the cell and medium fractions of the α3(VI) N5-C5 line (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3 and 4), and substantially larger amounts were produced by the two α3(VI) N3-C5 clones (lanes 5–8). The faint bands in lanes 3and 4 were clearly identified as collagen VI following a longer exposure. Because mRNA and protein expression is higher in the two α3(VI) N3-C5 cell lines than in the α3(VI) N5-C5 line, and end-to-end tetramer assembly is more efficient in the α3(VI) N5-C5 line than in either of the two α3(VI) N3-C5 cell lines (Fig. 5), it is clear that the efficiency of tetramer aggregation is not related to the level of collagen VI synthesis and the concentration of tetramers available for microfibril formation. To determine which cell lines were able to incorporate collagen VI tetramers into an extracellular matrix, transfected SaOS-2 cells were grown for 15 days post-confluence in the presence of sodium ascorbate, stained with collagen VI antibodies, and examined by fluorescence microscopy.

Sp factors, bound to double-stranded (ds) cis-regulatory elements, are critical for proximal promoter activity. Here, we further report that a single-stranded (ss) cis-regulatory element and trans-acting protein factor are also important for proximal promoter activity. A 26-bp morpolypyrimidine/polypurine region (PPy/u) can adopt ss DNA conformation, as demonstrated by S1 nuclease sensitivity. Using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis with nuclear extracts from mor-expressing SH-SY5Y cells, we demonstrate that the sense strand of PPy/u interacts with a major nuclear protein, termedmor polypyrimidine-binding protein (mPy), which is not related to Sp factors. Southwestern blot analysis indicated that mPy protein is ∼25 kDa in size. Functional analysis suggests that mPy protein can trans-activate mor promoter as well as a heterologous promoter. Moreover, combinatorial activation of ss (mPy) and ds (Sps) DNA binding factors, interacting with an overlapping DNA (PPy/u) region, is necessary for proximal promoter activation. Thus our results suggest that transcription of mouse mor gene is regulated by an interplay of ss and ds DNA binding factors.

However, chronic administration results in the development of tolerance and dependence, which limits their usages. Opioids interact with three major types of opioid receptors (μ, δ, and κ), all of which belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily (1Kieffer B.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Based on the use of selective agonists and antagonists, the μ-opioid receptor (mor)1 has traditionally been considered the main site of interaction of the major clinically used analgesics, particularly morphine (2Wood P.L. Iyengar S. Pasternak G.W. The Opiate Receptors. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1988: 307-356Crossref Google Scholar). The critical role of mor in analgesia, as well as in the development of tolerance and dependence, has been confirmed by pharmacological analysis of “knock-out” mice, in which this receptor is eliminated (3Matthes H.W.

Mor is mainly expressed in the central nervous system; different regions of the central nervous system have different densities of receptors, which may play different roles (7Mansour A. Fox C.A.

The mouse mor gene is over 53 kb long with the coding sequence dividing into four exons (14Pan Y.X. Xu J. Bolan E. Abbadie C. Chang A,. Zuckerman A. Rossi G. Pasternak G.W. Mol.

Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Liang Y. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with the proximal promoter predominant in directing mor gene expression in mouse brain (16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have begun focusing on the regulatory process governing the transcription of the mor gene within the proximal promoter. Two cis-acting elements located in the proximal promoter region were found to be critical for its activity: an inverted-GA (iGA) motif and a canonical Sp1 binding site. Both elements formed complexes with Sp factors, which were important for the proximal promoter activity (18Ko J.L. Liu H.C. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to these two cis-acting elements, the mor proximal promoter region also possesses a 26-bp sequence of polypyrimidine/polypurine (PPy/u) nucleotides, which is highly conserved in the mor gene among different species (mouse, rat, and human) (15Min B.H.

The presence of PPy/u sequences in the proximal promoter region of the mouse mor gene implies that regulation of mor gene expression may also involve ss DNA-binding protein. We tested this hypothesis in the present study. We report here that the 26-bp PPy/u region of mor proximal promoter is capable of forming ss DNA conformation (non-B form). A major ss DNA-binding protein, termed mPy protein (mor polypyrimidine-binding protein), that is ∼25 kDa in size can bind to the sense strand of the PPy/u region with high affinity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) further revealed that mPy protein is unrelated to Sp factors, which are known to be important for the mor proximal promoter activity (18Ko J.L. Liu H.C. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transfection and mutation analyses suggest that mPy protein can trans-activate the mor promoter as well as a heterologous promoter. In summary, our results suggest that transcription of mouse mor gene is regulated by a previously unrecognized interplay of ss (mPy) and ds (Sps) DNA binding factors, which interact with an overlapping region of DNA (PPy/u region). Luciferase fusion plasmid, pL450 construct, containing −450 to −249 bp upstream regulatory sequence (related to the translation start site as +1) of the mouse mor gene, was described previously (16Ko J.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), containing −340 to −400 bp fragment, was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sequences of PCR products were confirmed by sequencing, and then subcloned into polylinker sites of a promoterless luciferase vector, pGL3-basic (Promega). The point mutation was introduced by PCR into pL340/300 to generate pLGGT and pLcsp. For pLGGT, a mutagenic oligonucleotide containing three base substitutions (underlined) (5′-CTC CTT CTC TCT CCT GGT TCC CCT CT-3′) was used. For pLcsp, the mutagenic oligonucleotide containing the consensus GC box sequences at 3′-region (underlined) (5′-CTC CTT CTC TCT GATCGGGGCGGGGC-3′ was used. Constructs carrying PCR mutations were sequenced across the entire promoter region to ensure introduction of base changes at only the intended positions. Mutant fragments with correct sequences were then subcloned into pGL3-basic. To prepare a promoter construct containing the 26 bp of morPPy/u element positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter, pairs of oligonucleotides containing the wild type or GGT mutation were prepared and annealed. Wild type oligonucleotides were as follows: upper, 5′-CTC CTT CTC TCT CCT CCC TCC CCT CT-3′; lower, 5′-AGA GGG GAG GGA GGA GAG AGA AGG AG-3′. GGT mutation oligonucleotides were as follows: upper, 5′-CTC CTT CTC TCT CCT GGT TCC CCT CT-3′; lower, 5′-AGA GGG GAA CCA GGA GAG AGA AGG AG-3′. The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotide was inserted into the polylinker site of pGL3-promoter (Promega), containing the SV40 promoter. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected using the Superfect (QIAGEN) lipofection method as described previously (16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells with ∼40% confluence were transfected with an equimolar amount of each test plasmid. The amount of DNA used was within the linear range of the relationship between the luciferase activity and the amount of DNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells grown to confluence were washed and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). To control for differences in transfection efficiency from dish to dish, 0.2 molar ratio of pCH110 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter was included in each transfection and used for normalization. All transfection experiments were repeated three times or more with similar results, utilizing constructs that were independently prepared at least twice. The luciferase and β-galactosidase activities of each lysate were determined as described by the manufacturers (Promega and Tropix, respectively). The morproximal promoter containing plasmid was digested with various amounts of S1 nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) in S1 buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. S1 nuclease digestion was terminated by phenol/chloroform extraction and the plasmid recovered by precipitation. The resulting S1-treated plasmid was then further digested with XbaI restriction enzyme, and the products resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. The regions of S1 nuclease sensitivity were determined by gel purification of the resulting S1 and XbaI restriction digestion fragments, following by PCR reaction using the32P-labeled primer complementary to each strand, and then resolved in sequencing gel. Nuclear extracts were prepared from SH-SY5Y cells using the method described by Johnson et al. (55Johnson D.R. Levant S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence, harvested, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was microcentrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet the nuclei, which were washed with sucrose buffer without Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.02 m KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF), followed by addition of high salt buffer to extract the nuclei, with incubation for 20 min on a rotary platform. Diluent (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mmPMSF) was added, and the sample was microcentrifuged at 13,690 ×g. Aliquots of the supernatant (nuclear extract) were stored at −80 °C. EMSA was performed with 32P-labeled double-stranded or single-stranded oligonucleotides that were incubated with nuclear extract in EMSA buffer, pH 7.5 (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)). For oligonucleotide competition analysis, various amounts (as indicated in each figure legend) or 100-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotides were also added to the mixture. After incubation at 22 °C for 30 min, the mixture was analyzed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. For antibody supershift assays, 1 μl of anti-Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, or Sp4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the mixture. DNA-protein complexes and free DNA were fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris-glycine buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 380 mm glycine, and 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and were visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear extracts (20 μg of total protein) from SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with the treatment buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. The treated extracts were electrophoresed through SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris-HCl, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol). The membrane was incubated in blocking solution (10% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated with32P-labeled probe in the presence or absence of 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides. Following the probing, the membrane was washed with binding buffer. The signals were detected using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager system. To determine whether the single-stranded (ss) DNA conformation is present in the proximal promoter region of the μ-opioid receptor (mor) gene, and whether a ss DNA-binding protein participated in the regulation of mor gene expression, we first examined the capability of the morproximal promoter to form a ss DNA conformation. Formation of a ss region, resulting from the non-B DNA form (such as melting DNA or an intramolecular triplex (H-DNA) structure), is accessible to a ss-sensitive nuclease (S1) at low concentrations (24Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 25Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the pL450 plasmid, containing a fragment of ∼200 bp of the mor proximal promoter inserted within the promoterless pGL3-basic plasmid (16Ko J.L. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Ko J.L. Liu H.C. Minnerath S.R. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), was used to test S1 nuclease sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the pL450 plasmid was treated with or without S1 nuclease, then digested with XbaI enzyme. In the absence of S1 nuclease treatment (lane 6), only an XbaI-linearized DNA band (5 kb, indicated by asterisk) was observed. In contrast, in the presence of S1 nuclease treatment (lanes 7–9), two DNA fragments of 1.8 and 3.2 kb were generated (indicated by arrows). The intensity of both bands increased with increasing the amount of S1 nuclease. These results suggested the presence of a ss region located ∼1.8 kb from the XbaI site (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that the S1 nuclear accessibility of the pL450 plasmid is due to the presence of mor proximal promoter sequences, the promoterless pGL3-basic plasmid (B) was examined using the same digestion procedures (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–4). Only a 5-kb linearized band was observed without S1 (lane 1) or with S1 nuclease treatment (lanes 2–4). Furthermore, formation of such a non-B-DNA conformation was known to require a supercoiled conformation, and does not form in a linearized construct, because the supercoiled structure is thought to provide a ss region of DNA due to negative supercoiling of the circular plasmid (24Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 25Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). When the supercoiled pL450 plasmid was linearized by XbaI digestion before S1 digestion, the 1.8- and 3.2-kb fragments were not observed (Fig.1 A, lanes 10–12). In summary, these results suggested the mouse mor proximal promoter has the ability to form a ss DNA conformation, and formation of the ss region is dependent on its DNA supercoiling status. To determine the exact region with a ss DNA conformation in the mor proximal promoter, the S1 nuclease-accessible region in the pL450 plasmid was identified. Fine mapping was performed using a PCR method with S1-digested fragments (as indicated by arrows in Fig. 1 A) as template and a32P-radiolabeled primer complementary to either sense or antisense strand. The individual labeled PCR fragments was then resolved on a sequencing gel. As shown in Fig. 2, a collection of labeled fragments were generated from the sense (A) or antisense strand (B) of the proximal promoter. The S1 nuclease cleaved mainly in the PPy/u region in both strands (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2, A and B). Additionally, some minor S1 nuclease-sensitive sites were also observed outside of the PPy/u region at −295 and −296 bp in the sense strand as well as at −342, −340, −339, and −335 bp in the antisense strand (indicated by asterisks). The corresponding sequences are shown in Fig. 2 C, with arrows indicating the S1 nuclease-s"
https://openalex.org/W2122273961,"Functional analyses have indicated that the human CD164 sialomucin may play a key role in hematopoiesis by facilitating the adhesion of human CD34+cells to the stroma and by negatively regulating CD34+CD38lo/− cell proliferation. We have identified three novel human CD164 variants derived by alternative splicing of bona fide exons from a single genomic transcription unit. The predominant CD164(E1–6) isoform, encoded by six exons, is a type I transmembrane protein containing two extracellular mucin domains (I and II) interrupted by a cysteine-rich non-mucin domain. The 103B2/9E10 and 105A5 epitopes, which specify ligand binding characteristics, are located on the exon 1-encoded mucin domain I. Three human CD164(E1–6) mRNA species, exhibiting differential polyadenylation site usage, are differentially expressed in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues. This study provides additional evidence that human CD164(E1–6) represents the ortholog of murine MGC-24v and rat endolyn. Comparative analysis of murine MGC-24v/CD164(E1–6) with human CD164(E1–6) revealed two potential splice variants and a similar genomic structure. Whereas the human CD164 gene is located on chromosome 6q21, the mouse gene occurs in a syntenic region on chromosome 10B1–B2. By confocal microscopy, human CD164 in CD34+CD38+hematopoietic progenitor (KG1B) and epithelial cell lines appears to be localized primarily in endosomes and lysosomes, with low concentrations at the cell surface. However, in a minority of KG1B cells, CD164 is more prominently expressed at the plasma membrane and in the recycling endosomes, suggesting that its distribution is regulated in cells of hematopoietic origin."
https://openalex.org/W2018119239,"In the present work, Jurkat cells undergoing anti-Fas antibody (anti-Fas)-triggered apoptosis exhibited in increasing proportion a massive release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria, as revealed by double-labeling confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The cytochrome c release was followed by a progressive reduction in the respiratory activity of the last respiratory enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), and with a little delay, by a decrease in overall endogenous respiration rate, as measured in vivo in the whole cell population. Furthermore, in vivo titration experiments showed that an ∼30% excess of COX capacity over that required to support endogenous respiration, found in naive cells, was maintained in anti-Fas-treated cells having lost ∼40% of their COX respiratory activity. This observation strongly suggested that only a subpopulation of anti-Fas-treated cells, which maintained the excess of COX capacity, respired. Fractionation of cells on annexin V-coated paramagnetic beads did indeed separate a subpopulation of annexin V-binding apoptotic cells with fully released cytochrome c and completely lacking respiration, and a nonbound cell subpopulation exhibiting nearly intact respiration and in their great majority preserving the mitochondrial cytochrome c localization. The above findings showed a cellular mosaicism in cytochrome c release and respiration loss, and revealed the occurrence of a rate-limiting step preceding cytochrome c release in the apoptotic cascade. Furthermore, the striking observation that controlled digitonin treatment caused a massive and very rapid release of cytochrome c and complete loss of respiration in the still respiring anti-Fas-treated cells, but not in naive cells, indicated that the cells responding to digitonin had already been primed for apoptosis, and that this treatment bypassed or accelerated the rate-limiting step most probably at the level of the mitochondrial outer membrane.

The mechanism of cytochrome c release is largely unknown, though several models have been proposed (1Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat.

Since cytochrome c functions as a mobile electron carrier of the respiratory chain, it seems plausible to predict that the complete release of cytochrome c from mitochondria would cause loss of respiration. Very recently, however, it has been reported that HeLa cells induced to undergo apoptosis by UV irradiation released rapidly their cytochrome c into the cytosol, but still maintained an azide-sensitive membrane potential, indicative of a functional cytochrome c oxidase (COX),1 if caspase activation was blocked (17Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In the present work, measurements of respiration and cytochrome c localization in intact Jurkat cells induced to undergo anti-Fas antibody (anti-Fas)-mediated apoptosis and cell sorting experiments have unambiguously shown a massive release of cytochrome c associated with a complete loss of COX respiratory activity and of endogenous respiration in a subpopulation of cells. This subpopulation increased with time after the apoptotic stimulus, with nearly all remaining cells exhibiting normal cytochrome c localization and respiration. These observations have pointed to the existence of a rate-limiting step preceding cytochrome c release in the apoptotic cascade. Most significantly, we obtained strong evidence that this rate-limiting step occurred in cells already primed for apoptosis. Exogenous cytochrome crestored the COX respiratory activity in digitonin-treated cells nearly completely, but, surprisingly, the glutamate/malate- or succinate-dependent respiration only partially. Jurkat cells, a lymphoblastoma-derived T-cell line (TIB 152, ATCC), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Individual cultures were maintained at a cell concentration between 105/ml and 106/ml for no longer than 2 months. For apoptosis induction, cells were transferred to fresh medium, and, after 16 h, 50 ng/ml anti-Fas IgM (clone CH-11, Kamiya Biomedical Co.) was added to a culture containing ∼106 cells/ml. Cells were fixed on coverslips by formaldehyde and methanol treatment (as described below), washed in TD buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 25 °C), and stained with 1 μg/ml dsDNA-binding fluorochrome 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) in TD buffer for 5 min. With DAPI staining, normal cells show homogenous staining of their nuclei, whereas apoptotic cells show irregular staining as a result of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation (18Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Both normal and apoptotic nuclei were counted using fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was also determined by fluorescence microscopy of cells stained with FITC-labeled annexin V (Kamiya Biomedical Co.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Previous work in this laboratory had shown that the osteosarcoma-derived 143B TK− cell line respires in TD buffer at the same rate as in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking glucose (19Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, the respiration rate was continuously measured in an oxygraph (Yellow Springs Instruments, model 5300) in a suspension at 107cells/ml in TD buffer, before and after each of the following sequential additions: 17 μm dinitrophenol (DNP), 20 nm antimycin A (Sigma), 10 mm ascorbate + 400 μm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (TMPD, Fluka), essentially as described (19Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The concentration of DNP specified above was one that, in preliminary tests (data not shown), produced the highest stimulation of the endogenous respiration rate in naive Jurkat cells. Since ascorbate/TMPD autooxidation causes significant oxygen consumption, the oxygen consumption rate of ascorbate and TMPD in the absence of cells was subtracted from the oxygen consumption rate measured in the presence of cells, DNP, antimycin A, ascorbate, and TMPD. Oxygen consumption rate was expressed in nanomoles of oxygen consumed per min and mg of cellular protein, as determined by the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad). Cells were resuspended at 1.5–2.0 × 107/ml in TD buffer containing either 17 μm DNP, for KCN titration of “integrated” COX activity, or 17 μm DNP, 20 nm antimycin A, 10 mm ascorbate, and 200 μm TMPD, for KCN titration of “isolated” COX activity, and transferred into two chambers connected in parallel, as described (19Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). If anti-Fas-treated cells were analyzed, the cell concentration was increased to yield respiration rates similar to those of naive cells. The KCN titration measurements and the determination of maximum COX capacity (COXR(max)), relative to the uncoupled endogenous respiration rate, from the threshold plots (i.e. plots of relative endogenous respiration rate versus the percentage of inhibition of isolated COX activity at the same KCN concentration in DNP-uncoupled intact cells) were performed as described (19Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cell culture samples (in some experiments after digitonin treatment, see below) were centrifuged onto glass coverslips, and then sequentially incubated in 2% formaldehyde in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3.8 mmNaH2PO4, 16.2 mmNa2HPO4), PBS, anhydrous methanol, PBS, 2% horse serum in PBS (HSPBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (20Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The coverslips were then incubated with mouse anti-cytochrome cmonoclonal antibody 6H2.B4 (PharMingen), diluted 1:15 in HSPBS, and rabbit anti-Hsp60 antiserum (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.), diluted 1:50, for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. After three washes in HSPBS, the coverslips were incubated with 1:50-diluted FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) and 1:100-diluted lyssamine-rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, the coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides in FluoroGuard antifade reagent (Bio-Rad), and analyzed on a Zeiss 310 laser-scanning microscope equipped with 488-nm argon and 543-nm helium neon lasers. Cells with diffuse cytosolic cytochrome c staining (green) and punctate mitochondrial Hsp60 staining (red) were counted as cells carrying cytochrome c released from mitochondria into cytosol. Cells with punctate cytochrome c staining that overlapped with Hsp60 staining were counted as cells with mitochondrial cytochrome c staining. Apoptotic cells were separated from nonapoptotic cells by magnetic enrichment using the Apoptotic Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells (4 × 107) were incubated with 80 μl of annexin V-Microbeads in 400 μl of binding buffer for 15 min at 12 °C and, after a 20-fold dilution with binding buffer, centrifuged. The cells, resuspended in the same buffer, were then passed through the magnetic separation column for positive selection (VS+), which was placed in the magnetic field of the Vario MACS magnetic separator. The flow-through fraction was centrifuged and resuspended in TD buffer. After removal of the column from the magnetic field, the magnetically retained cells were eluted, centrifuged, and resuspended in TD buffer. In a separate experiment, the flow-through fraction of the cell population, manipulated as described above, but without addition of annexin V-microbeads, was also collected to obtain the mock-fractionated cell fraction. In a typical experiment, cells were resuspended in a measurement buffer at ∼1.2 × 107/ml, transferred into the 1.9-ml oxygraphic chamber, and the cell number was then determined by counting. After taking four aliquots from the chamber for protein determination, the oxygen consumption in the presence of DNP (endogenous uncoupled respiration) was measured. Then, digitonin was added from 5% stock solution in Me2SO to permeabilize the cells. The concentration of digitonin that, in preliminary tests (data not shown), produced the highest stimulation of the glutamate/malate-dependent respiration rate in naive Jurkat cells (5 μg/106 cells) was used. If not indicated otherwise, two min after the addition of digitonin a substrate was added to support the respiration. The glutamate/malate-dependent respiration was measured, in the presence of 17 μm DNP, 5 mm glutamate, and 5 mm malate, in respiration medium I (21Villani G. Greco M. Papa S. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31829-31836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) (75 mmsucrose, 20 mm d-glucose, 5 mmKPi, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4), as oxygen consumption that was sensitive to 0.2 μm rotenone. The respiration medium I was chosen because the glutamate/malate-dependent respiration rate in digitonin-permeabilized naive cells in this measurement buffer was 1) almost constant during the course of experiment, and 2) similar to the endogenous respiration rate. The succinate-dependent respiration was measured, in the presence of 17 μm DNP or 0.5 mm ADP, 0.2 μm rotenone, and 5 mm succinate, in respiration medium I as oxygen consumption that was sensitive to 20 nm antimycin A. The TMPD-dependent respiration was measured in respiration medium II (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KPi, pH 7.1), since in this measurement buffer only a low rate of ascorbate/TMPD autooxidation occurred. In this medium, the respiration rate was determined in the presence of 17 μm DNP, 20 nm antimycin A, 10 mm ascorbate, and 400 μm TMPD, and then corrected by subtracting the nonspecific oxygen consumption rate due to autooxidation of ascorbate/TMPD in the same buffer. Cytochrome c (Sigma) was added from a 10 mm stock solution. In this form, cytochrome c was fully oxidized, since addition of potassium ferricyanide did not decrease the A550. Reduced cytochrome c was prepared by addition of few crystals of sodium hydrosulfite into a 10 mm stock solution of cytochrome c, and stirring for 1 h. Full reduction of cytochrome c was verified by showing that addition of extra sodium hydrosulfite did not increase the A550. Samples (pellet of intact cells or pellet and supernatant of digitonin-treated cells) derived from the same number of cells, as estimated from the amount of total cellular protein (350 μg), were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) at 150 mA for 12 h in a buffer (0.037% SDS, 20 mmTris, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.2 (25 °C)). After blocking of nonspecific binding in PBST (0.1% Tween 20, 3% nonfat milk in PBS) containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 3 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody 7H8.2C12 (PharMingen), diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% nonfat milk, for 17 h at 4 °C. The membranes, washed three times in PBST, were incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-linked (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), diluted 1:1000 in PBST, for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed five times in PBST, and specific protein complexes were identified using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) by autoradiography. Cells were washed in respiration medium I, counted, resuspended in the same medium at 107/ml, treated with digitonin (5 μg/106cells) for 7 min at 37 °C, and centrifuged at 400 ×g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant (digitonin supernatant) was then transferred to the oxygraphic chamber. Since the determination of cytochrome c release from mitochondria based on immunoblotting of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions prepared from cellular homogenates have led to different conclusions even in the same system (22Krippner A.

The majority of the cells treated for 4 h with anti-Fas antibody exhibited diffused cytosolic cytochrome c staining, while staining of Hsp60, located in the mitochondrial matrix, was punctate (Fig. 1). In contrast, in untreated (naive) cells or in cells treated with anti-Fas antibody and the caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH2F (z-VADfmk, Kamiya), cytochrome c staining was punctate and colocalized with the Hsp60 staining. These results confirmed earlier observations (23Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 24Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Furthermore, the physical integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane was preserved under these conditions, as indicated by the behavior of Hsp60. In addition, an analysis of multiple optical sections of individual cells anti-Fas-treated for 4 h showed that the majority of the cells displayed either only punctate mitochondrial cytochrome c staining, or diffused cytosolic cytochrome c staining without detectable mitochondrial staining (data not shown). These observations indicated the existence of a mechanism for a rapid cytochrome c release from all mitochondria of individual cells, as recently reported for HeLa cells induced to undergo apoptosis by UV irradiation or staurosporine treatment (17Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there was clearly a marked cellular heterogeneity in cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Fig. 1). To investigate the possible effects of cytochrome c release on respiration, the rate of oxygen consumption in naive Jurkat cells and in cells induced to undergo apoptosis by anti-Fas antibody was measured both in the absence and in the presence of the uncoupler DNP. Fig. 2 Apresents the results of a representative experiment showing that Jurkat cells, treated with anti-Fas antibody for increasing time periods, exhibited a progressively lower rate of both uncoupled and coupled endogenous respiration. The uncoupled respiration rate decreased to ∼62% of the rate of naive cells after 4 h of treatment, ∼53% after 6 h, and ∼43% after 8 h. The uncoupled endogenous respiration of both naive and anti-Fas-treated cells was 98% antimycin A-sensitive. The progressive decrease in endogenous respiration rate correlated well with an increase in number of apoptotic cells, which exhibited a characteristic shrunk and fragmented appearance of their nuclei, as determined by staining with the dsDNA-binding fluorochrome DAPI (Fig. 2 A). To dissect further the anti-Fas-induced changes in respiration, the effect of anti-Fas antibody on COX respiratory activity of intact cells was measured. The rate of oxygen consumption, in the presence of the membrane-permeant electron donor TMPD, of ascorbate as primary reducing agent, and of antimycin A to block the electron flux upstream of COX, is known to depend on both cytochrome c and COX, providing a measure of COX-dependent oxygen consumption that is isolated from the upstream segment of the respiratory chain (19Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows that the TMPD-dependent respiration rate decreased progressively with increasing time of cell treatment with anti-Fas antibody. The kinetics of decrease in TMPD-dependent respiration rate during the first 8 h of treatment was very similar to the kinetics of decrease in endogenous uncoupled respiration rate. However, it was apparently faster in the first few hours. In fact, a comparison of the kinetics of decrease in the endogenous and TMPD-dependent respiration rates in the first 3 h after anti-Fas-induction revealed that the reduction in endogenous respiration rate was slightly, but significantly, delayed with respect to the decrease in TMPD-dependent respiration rate. In particular, as shown by a representative experiment in Fig.2 B, after 1 h of anti-Fas-induction, the endogenous respiration rate was almost unchanged, whereas the TMPD-dependent respiration rate was decreased by ∼12% relative to the control. It was also found that z-VADfmk fully prevented the anti-Fas-induced decrease in endogenous coupled, endogenous uncoupled, and TMPD-dependent respiration rates (Fig. 2 C), indicating a requirement for caspase activation in anti-Fas-triggered loss of respiration in intact cells. In Fig.3, the changes in respiration in apoptotic Jurkat cells were correlated with the kinetics of cytochrome c release. Quantification of cytochrome c release from images such as those shown in Fig. 1 revealed that about 25% of the cells released massively cytochrome c into the cytosol after less than 1 h of treatment with anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 3). After 2 h of treatment, 58% of the cells had released cytochrome c, while the endogenous uncoupled and TMPD-dependent respiration rates had decreased only by 20 and 22%, respectively, relative to those measured in naive cells. After 4 h of treatment, 71% of cells had released cytochrome c, while the endogenous uncoupled and TMPD-dependent respiration rates had decreased only by 40% and 39%, respectively. Cytochrome c remained mitochondria-localized in ∼20% of the cells even after 8 h of treatment with anti-Fas antibody, when the uncoupled and TMPD-dependent respiration rates were decreased by ∼60% and ∼57%, respectively (Fig. 3). The faster kinetics of increase in the percentage of cells with released cytochrome c and the faster kinetics of respiration loss during the first 4 h indicated the presence of a subpopulation of cells responding faster to the apoptotic stimulus. These results also suggested a sequence of events in which loss of cytochrome c from a cell would precede a decrease in COX-dependent oxygen consumption and endogenous respiration. The observation mentioned above of a slight, although apparently significant, delay in the kinetics of decrease in the endogenous respiration rate relative to the kinetics of decrease in TMPD-dependent respiration rate could reflect an excess of COX capacity over that required to support the normal endogenous respiration. In fact, recent studies have demonstrated that, in a variety of human cell types analyzed, including fibroblasts and myoblasts, there is in vivo a relatively low excess of COX capacity (19Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Villani G. Greco M. Papa S. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31829-31836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the present work, the TMPD-dependent respiration rate had been measured in naive uncoupled Jurkat cells, and found to be ∼33% higher than the endogenous uncoupled respiration rate (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown). Thus, it seemed plausible to assume that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria would cause initially a decrease in COX-dependent oxygen consumption, without affecting the endogenous respiration rate. To obtain a deeper insight into the role of the respiratory flux control by COX in the apoptosis-related events, the relative COX capacity in intact naive Jurkat cells was determined. For this purpose, the COX activity in DNP-uncoupled intact cells was titrated with the specific COX inhibitor KCN both as isolated step, in the presence of antimycin A, ascorbate, and TMPD, and as respiratory chain-integrated step (endogenous respiration) (19Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the low range of KCN con"

Serpins share a conserved tertiary structure, in which an exposed region of amino acid residues (called the reactive center loop or RCL) acts as bait for a target proteinase. Within E*I*, the two proteins are linked covalently as a result of nucleophilic attack by Ser195 of the serine proteinase on the P1 residue within the RCL of the serpin.

However, its subsequent hydrolysis is extremely slow as a result of structural changes within the enzyme leading to distortion of the active site. There is at present an ongoing debate concerning the structure of the E*I* complex; in particular, as to whether the enzyme, bound to P1, maintains its original position at the top of the serpin molecule or instead translocates across the entire length of the serpin, with concomitant insertion of RCL residues P1-P14 within β-sheet A and a large separation of the enzyme and RCL residue P1′. We report time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer and rapid mixing/quench studies that support the former model. Our results indicate that the distance between residue P1′ in α1-antichymotrypsin and the amino terminus of chymotrypsin actually decreases on conversion of the encounter complex E·I to E*I*. These results led us to formulate a comprehensive mechanism that accounted both for our results and for those of others supporting the two different E*I* structures. In this mechanism, partial insertion of the RCL, with no large perturbation of the P1′ enzyme distance, is followed by covalent acyl enzyme formation.

For ACT, this loop extends from residues 342 to 367, denoted P17-P9′, in which, following the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (1Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4763) Google Scholar), the scissile bond cleaved by the targeted proteinase chymotrypsin (Chtr) is between the P1 and P1′ residues. The native serpin structure is unusual in that it is metastable and is considered to be in a stressed (S) conformation. The cleaved serpin released from the complex is much more stable than the intact serpin (2Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol.

As a result of this insertion, the P1 and P1′ residues are separated by 70 Å. There is now very good evidence that within E*I* the two proteins are linked covalently; an acyl enzyme has formed following attack by the nucleophilic Ser195 of the serine proteinase on the P1 residue of the serpin (5Nair S.A.

Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Within this structure, the antitrypsin is in the R conformation, and the trypsin attached to the P1 residue has translocated from the top of the serpin molecule, defined as the position of the RCL in the intact, active serpin, across its entire length to the bottom of the molecule. The trypsin*antitrypsin* structure provides strong support for one side in what has been an ongoing debate concerning the extent of RCL insertion within the E*I* complex, whether full insertion (R conformation), as first proposed by Wright and Scarsdale (12Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), or partial insertion, as suggested by Whisstock et al.(13Whisstock J. Lesk A.M. Carrell R. Proteins Struct.

These continuing disagreements raise questions as to whether the structure of the E*I* complex may be different for different serpins and to what extent the time scale employed in measurement affects the structure observed, i.e. whether the partially inserted form may be an intermediate on the way to full insertion (19Y B. Hazes B. Chang W.-S.W. Dafforn T.R. Carrell R.W. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here, we report time-resolved stopped-flow FRET and rapid mixing/quench studies of E*I* formation between α−ACT, derivatized with a fluorescence donor at the P1′ position, and δ−Chtr, derivatized with a fluorescence acceptor at the amino terminus. Our results demonstrate multistep formation of the E*I* complex in which the distance separating the two fluorophores is inconsistent with formation of the fully inserted R conformation. In consequence, we propose a mechanism for E*I* formation that rationalizes the apparent disagreements mentioned above. The chief features of this mechanism are that: (a) partial insertion of the RCL occurs with the P1-P1′ peptide linkage intact; (b) acyl enzyme formation occurs following partial insertion and is not concomitant with full insertion; and (c) the R conformation forms reversibly, but not necessarily rapidly, from the partially inserted conformation.

The internal primers coding for the Ser → Cys mutation are as follows: 5′-CCCTCCTTTGTGCATTAGTGGAGACA-3′ and 5′-GCACAAAGGAGGGTGATTTTGAC-3′ (the mutation sites are in boldface). The polymerase chain reaction product, representing the entire coding region, was cut with BstXI, gel-purified, and inserted in the correct reading orientation in pZMS. Full gene sequencing confirmed a single codon change. S359C-rACT and rACT were purified to homogeneity as described earlier (22O'Malley K.M. Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). S359C-rACT (2 μm in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, pH 8.3) was reacted with a 100-fold excess of BMMC for 12 h at 0 °C in an amber-colored reaction vessel. Samples were concentrated and buffer-exchanged using Amicon, Centriprep-30, and Centricon-30 concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). The stoichiometry of (7-methoxycoumarin)-methyl (MCM) labeling was determined by absorbance measurements. Total bound MCM concentration was determined using ε330 = 13,000 m−1cm−1. Total protein concentration was determined using ε280 = 39,000m−1 cm−1, calculated as the sum of the coefficients of the unlabeled protein (36,000 m−1cm−1, calculated from an ACT solution standardized by Bradford analysis) and the MCM group, determined using the A280/A330 ratio for BMMC. Purified protein had a calculated stoichiometry of 1.05 MCM/protein. As shown earlier (22O'Malley K.M. Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Luo Y. Zhou Y. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17733-17741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the unique Cys residue in wild-type rACT, Cys237, is buried in the hydrophobic core of the molecule and has negligible reactivity under the reaction conditions used for derivatization. Zymogen was derivatized prior to activation, permitting specific labeling of the unique amino terminus present in the proenzyme. Chymotrypsinogen (19 μm in 20 mm sodium Pi, pH 7) was reacted with a 6-fold excess of 7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid, DEACA-succinimidyl ester at 27 °C for 30 to 150 min in a foil-covered reaction vessel. The reaction was quenched by adding a 0.1 volume of 1.5 mhydroxylamine, pH 8.5, with stirring at room temperature for 1 h. The sample was then washed and concentrated using Amicon and Centricon-10 concentrators. Total bound DEACA concentration was determined using ε432 = 44,000m−1 cm−1(24Corrie, J. E. T. (1994) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I 2975–2982.Google Scholar). The ε280 of labeled protein, 58,000m−1 cm−1, was calculated as the sum of the extinction coefficients of the unlabeled protein (50,000 m−1cm−1) (25Dixon G.H. Neurath H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 225: 1049-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the DEACA group (8,000m−1 cm−1, as determined by theA280/A432 ratio for DEACA). The proenzyme had a calculated stoichiometry of 0.50–1.2 DEACA/protein depending on the time of incubation employed. All of the kinetics experiments reported in this paper were conducted with 0.75 DEACA/Chtr, prepared using a 30-min incubation time. Labeled proenzyme (8 μm) was activated by incubation with trypsin (0.4 μm) at 27 °C in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, until maximum activity was achieved (∼90 min). The sample was then quenched with TLCK (final concentration, 2 mm), concentrated, and buffer-exchanged using Amicon, Centriprep-10, and Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). Kinetic parametersKm and kcat were evaluated by Eadie-Hofstee plots for δ-CT and DEACA-δ-CT using the chromophoric substrate succinimidyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The stoichiometry of active site Ser195 in DEACA-δ-Chtr was determined by titration with 4-methylumbelliferyl-p-(N,N,N-trimethylammonium)-cinnamate (26Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S.A. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). All assays were performed at room temperature (20 ± 1 °C). Second-order rate constants for inhibition ki and stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) were determined for all serpin-proteinase pairs. Inhibition rate constants were determined by incubating equimolar concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor under second-order conditions and removing aliquots for residual enzyme activity determination as described earlier (20Rubin H. Wang Z.M. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SI values were determined by densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE gels by comparing the intensity of cleaved serpin following complex formation with proteinase with the band intensity of unreacted intact serpin (23Luo Y. Zhou Y. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17733-17741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization was performed on a Micromass Platform LC Electrospray mass spectrometer (Micromass® UK, division of Waters Corp., Milford, MA) at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) was performed on a VG Tofspec (Fisons Instruments, Danvers, MA) at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory in the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania. Oxidation of chymotrypsin with performic acid results in cleavage of the disulfide links in the protein and allows for the separation of the amino-terminal fragment (α-chain) from the rest of the molecule (27Richmond V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar,28Meedom B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1956; 5: 881-882Crossref Google Scholar). δ-Chtr or DEACA-δ-Chtr was suspended in formic acid (88% in H20), and a 2-fold volume of performic acid (prepared by adding 1/20 volume 30% H202 to formic acid followed by room temperature incubation for 1 h (29Hirs C.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 611-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hoang D.V. Rovery M. Desnuelle P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 1, (Suppl.): 232-238Google Scholar)) was added, bringing the final concentration of enzyme to 20 mg/ml. Following incubation on ice for 15 min, the reaction mixture was brought to pH 5 by the addition of 10 volumes of 1 m Tris, pH 10, leading to virtually complete precipitation of residues Ile16-Asn245 (27Richmond V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 28Meedom B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1956; 5: 881-882Crossref Google Scholar), as shown by subsequent HPLC analysis of the supernatant (see below). The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and redissolved in formic acid, and the amount of incorporated probe was determined byA430 measurement. The supernatant was subject to RP-HPLC (Rainin C-18 column, Microsorb-MVTM, 50 × 4.6 mm, 300 Å, 5 μm). Following equilibration with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, peptides were eluted with the following gradient of acetonitrile (also containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid): 0–10 min, 0–20%; 10–30 min, 20–30%; 30–90 min, 30–40%; 90–95 min, 40–100%; 100–105 min, 100%. HPLC data were analyzed using Turbochrom Navigator software from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The amounts of α-chain were estimated from peak areas at 215 nm, corrected for elution yields of both the modified (23.4 ± 1.8%) and unmodified (71.1 ± 5.8%) forms, taking into account the contributions to A215 from peptide bonds, side chains (31Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and fluorescent probe. Stopped-flow fluorescence emission traces were acquired using an Applied PhotophysicsSX.18MV stopped-flow spectrofluorometer with excitation at 330 and 430 nm. Emission was monitored at 400 nm (the emission maximum of MCM-S359C-rACT) or 475 nm (the emission maximum of DEACA-δ-chymotrypsin). Traces were fit to a three-step kinetic model using Pro-Kineticist software (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). Serpin-proteinase complexes were formed at 21 °C in 20 mm sodium Pi, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7, by the addition of 5 μm proteinase (50 μl) to 20 μm serpin (50 μl) and incubation for 15 min. Static fluorescence spectra were acquired using a PerkinElmer LS50 luminescence spectrometer with excitation at 330 nm. Rapid quenched-flow kinetic studies were carried out using a KinTek Chemical-Quench-Flow Model RQF-3 machine followed by densitometric analysis on SDS-PAGE as described previously (22O'Malley K.M. Nair S.A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5354-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis was performed on aliquots of the acid-quenched reaction mixture using gels containing 12% polyacrylamide. Prior to analysis, all samples were precipitated with freshly prepared 20% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice 30 min, centrifuged and redissolved in 10 μl of 20 mm sodium Pi, pH 7, to which 2 μl of 1 m Tris base was added to neutralize the excess trichloroacetic acid present in the quenched samples. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 2 mm was also added to rapidly inactivate any renatured chymotrypsin. Gels were stained overnight in GelCode® Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce), destained overnight in water, then dried prior to densitometric analysis. Data were fit to a three-step kinetic scheme using Hopkinsim, version 1.7 (32Wachsstock D.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1260-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Energy transfer was determined by the acceptor enhancement method as well as by the decrease in donor fluorescence (33Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 303-339Crossref Google Scholar). In calculating efficiencies, observed values of fluorescence were corrected for the inner filter effect (Equation 1) (33Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 303-339Crossref Google Scholar), in whichAEX is the absorption of all species at λD1 and AEM is the absorption of all species at the emission wavelength (λD2). Such corrections varied from 3 to 19% for both acceptor and donor fluorescence (see below). F=Fobsd×10−(AEX+AEM)/2Equation 1 Fluorescence acceptor efficiencies (34Schiller P.W. Chen R.F. Edelhoch H. Biochemical Fluorescence: Concepts. Marcel Dekker, New York1975: 285-303Google Scholar) were calculated by Equation 2, in which FDA is the fluorescence of the donor/acceptor pair (MCM-S359C-rACT/DEACA-chymotrypsin) when irradiated at the excitation wavelength of the donor and detected at the emission maximum of the acceptor (λ D1A2refers to 330 nm excitation, 475 nm emission); FA is the fluorescence of acceptor in the absence of donor: i.e.unlabeled rACT/DEACA-chymotrypsin, using the same excitation/emission wavelength pair; AD(λD1) andAA(λD1) are the absorbances of the donor and acceptor, respectively, at an excitation wavelength (λD1) of 330 nm; and fa (equal to 0.75) is the fraction of labeled acceptor protein. E=(1/fa)[AA(λD1)/AD(λD1)][FDAλD1A2)/FA(λD1A2)−1]Equation 2 The decrease in donor efficiency (35Kella N.K. Roberts D.D. Shafer J.A. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4777-4781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was calculated by Equation3, in which FDA is the fluorescence of the donor/acceptor pair, with irradiation at the excitation wavelength of the donor and detection at the emission maximum of the donor (λ D1D2= 330 nm excitation, 400 nm emission) and FD is the fluorescence of the donor in the absence of acceptor: i.e.MCM-S359C-rACT/unlabeled chymotrypsin, using the same excitation/emission pair. E=(1/fa)[1−FDA(λD1D2)/FD(λD1D2)]Equation 3 The measured efficiency is a function of the distance between donor and acceptor, R, equal to [E −1− 1]1/6ro, where RO, the Förster distance at which the efficiency is 50%, is calculated from Equation 4. Ro6=8.8×10−5(κ2n−4φdJ)Equation 4 In this equation, J, the overlap integral that relates the degree of spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of the MCM group covalently bound to serpin and the absorption spectrum of the DEACA group attached to proteinase, was determined to be 4.52 × 10−14m−1cm−1nm4 using the method of Conrad and Brand (36Conrad R.H. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); φD, the quantum yield of the donor in the absence of acceptor, was determined to be 0.023 for labeled serpin complexed to unlabeled proteinase by comparison with quinine sulfate as standard (37Parker C.A. Rees W.T. Analyst. 1960; 85: 587-600Crossref Google Scholar); n, the index of refraction of the solvent, is assumed to be 1.33 (38Grossman S.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); and κ2 is the orientation factor, describing the relative orientation in space of the transition dipoles of the donor and acceptor. κ2may be set equal to 0.667 for donors and acceptors that randomize by rotational diffusion prior to energy transfer or to 0.476 assuming that a range of static donor-acceptor orientations exists that does not change during the lifetime of the excited state (33Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 303-339Crossref Google Scholar). Using either of these values gives similar values for RO of 23.5 Å (κ2 = 2/3) or 21.0Å (κ2 = 0.476). Modeling of the MCM-S359C-rACT·DEACA-δ-Chtr complex was performed using the program Quanta version 98.1111 (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA). The coordinates for the ACT-Chtr docked model proposed by Katz and Christianson (39Katz D.S. Christianson D.W. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were used as a starting point. The fluorescent probes were constructed in the two-dimensional Sketcher application and then converted to molecular structure files. These were simultaneously imported into Quanta along with the published model, moved into proximity with their attachment sites, and covalently attached with the modeling palette. The Molecular Editor tool was used to add or remove hydrogens as necessary for proper valency. The initial orientation of the probes was varied for both probes by a rotation around the bond directly connected to the fluor in 90o increments, generating a total of 16 structures. The probe aromatic rings were constrained to remain planar during the minimization and subsequent energy calculations. Each structure was then minimized first by the method of Steepest Descents, followed by the method of Adopted-Basis Newton-Raphson. These structures were then used to measure an average center-to-center distance between the probes in the encounter complex. The site or sites of labeling within δ-Chtr depended on the overall stoichiometry of chymotrypsinogen labeling. Preparations having ≥1.0 DEACA groups per Chtr molecule had measurable labeling of the Ile16-Asn245 polypeptide chain, rising to ∼0.22 mol/mol for the sample containing 1.2 DEACA groups per Chtr. This most likely reflects partial labeling of some of the 14 free Lys residues present. On the other hand, preparations containing ≤0.75 DEACA groups per chymotrypsinogen molecule showed no (<0.01 mol/mol) such labeling of Ile16-Asn245. For these samples, all labeling was confined to the α-chain (residues 1–13) and, by inference, to the only amino group within this chain, the α-amino group of Cys1. Accordingly, preparations containing 0.75 DEACA per δ-Chtr were used in all kinetics experiments. Direct determination of the stoichiometry of α-chain labeling was provided by RP-HPLC analysis of the soluble fraction of a performic acid oxidized sample of DEACA-δ-Chtr (Fig.1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An analysis of the 75% labeled DEACA-δ-Chtr gave a labeled α-peptide/unlabeled α-peptide ratio of 3:1, measured by corrected peak area at A215. The assignment of peak 2 as the DEACA-labeled α-chain was indicated by its absorbance at 430 nm and confirmed by mass spectral analysis (1589,M + 2 Na). The assignment of peak 1 as an underivatized α-chain was also confirmed by mass spectral analysis (1301,M + H). As shown by the results in Table I, MCM-S359C-rACT retains full activity toward Chtr inhibition, as measured by both the second-order rate constant for inhibition,ki, and the SI of ∼1. Similarly, DEACA-δ-Chtr retains full activity toward rACT and toward hydrolysis of the standard substrateN-succinimidyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide (data not shown). Finally, the reaction of MCM-S359C-rACT with DEACA-δ-Chtr has an SI value (∼1) and a second-order rate c"
