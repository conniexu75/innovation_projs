https://openalex.org/W2086502719,"A model of stress transfer implies that earthquakes in 1933 and 1952 increased the Coulomb stress toward failure at the site of the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. The 1971 earthquake in turn raised stress and produced aftershocks at the site of the 1987 Whittier Narrows and 1994 Northridge ruptures. The Northridge main shock raised stress in areas where its aftershocks and surface faulting occurred. Together, the earthquakes with moment magnitude M >/= 6 near Los Angeles since 1933 have stressed parts of the Oak Ridge, Sierra Madre, Santa Monica Mountains, Elysian Park, and Newport-lnglewood faults by more than 1 bar. Although too small to cause earthquakes, these stress changes can trigger events if the crust is already near failure or advance future earthquake occurrence if it is not."
https://openalex.org/W2101884223,"It is shown by angle-resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that cavitands derived from resorcin[4]arenes provided with four dialkylsulfide chains form stable monolayers on gold surfaces that are well organized by self-assembly. The cavitand headgroups at the surface of the resorcin[4]arene monolayer act as molecular recognition sites for small organic molecules with remarkable selectivity for perchloroethylene (C(2)Cl(4)). Comparative thermal desorption experiments indicate binding sites with high interaction energies of C(2)Cl(4) at the surface of the resorcin[4]arene monolayers. Fast and reversible ""host-guest"" interactions were found by the monitoring of extremely small mass changes (in the nanogram range) with a quartz microbalance oscillator provided with gold electrodes coated by resorcin[4]arene monolayers."
https://openalex.org/W2094475135,"The first encounter between the sun and the surrounding interstellar cloud appears to have occurred 2000 to 8000 years ago. The sun and cloud space motions are nearly perpendicular, an indication that the sun is skimming the cloud surface. The electron density derived for the surrounding cloud from the carbon component of the anomalous cosmic ray population in the solar system and from the interstellar ratio of Mg(+) to Mg degrees toward Sirius support an equilibrium model for cloud ionization (an electron density of 0.22 to 0.44 per cubic centimeter). The upwind magnetic field direction is nearly parallel to the cloud surface. The relative sun-cloud motion indicates that the solar system has a bow shock."
https://openalex.org/W2017160955,"The platinum-rhodium tip of a scanning tunneling microscope that operates inside of an atmospheric-pressure chemical reactor cell has been used to locally rehydrogenate carbonaceous fragments deposited on the (111) surface of platinum. The carbon fragments were produced by partial dehydrogenation of propylene. The reactant gas environment inside the cell consisted of pure H(2) or a 1:9 mixture of CH(3)CHCH(2) and H(2) at 300 kelvin. The platinum-rhodium tip acted as a catalyst after activation by short voltage pulses. In this active state, the clusters in the area scanned by the tip were reacted away with very high spatial resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2013100935,"Results from the San Francisco Bay area seismic imaging experiment (BASIX) reveal the presence of a prominent lower crustal reflector at a depth of approximately 15 kilometers beneath San Francisco and San Pablo bays. Velocity analyses indicate that this reflector marks the base of Franciscan assemblage rocks and the top of a mafic lower crust. Because this compositional contrast would imply a strong rheological contrast, this interface may correspond to a lower crustal detachment surface. If so, it may represent a subhorizontal segment of the North America and Pacific plate boundary proposed by earlier thermo-mechanical and geological models."

https://openalex.org/W1980200584,"Platinum black efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of methane by iron(III) to generate carbon dioxide and eight equivalents of iron(II) in solutions of sulfuric acid in water. The rate of oxidation increases over 4 hours to reach approximately 4.83 x 10(-2) moles of iron(II) per gram atom of surface platinum per second. A redox fuel cell was assembled that used this reaction in a liquid reformer to generate soluble reducing equivalents of iron(II) from methane, which was electrochemically oxidized to iron(III) in the cell. A vanadium(V)-(IV)-nitric acid-O(2) redox system catalyzed the electrochemical reduction of O(2). The open-circuit voltage of the cell was 0.48 volt, and the maximum power output of the cell was 8.1 milliwatts per cubic centimeter of graphite felt electrode."
https://openalex.org/W2027796947,"One of the open key issues in the astrophysics of stellar coronae is the determination of their spatial structure and density. From almost all previous measurements, one can infer merely the presence of a corona, which for the most energetic stellar coronae may exceed the solar x-ray output by as much as five orders of magnitude, but no information can be obtained on the densities and hence volumes and sizes of the hot x-ray emitting material. A direct spectroscopic measurement of the coronal density was obtained for the star Procyon with the spectrometer on board the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer satellite; the ratio of two Fe XIV lines at 211.32 and 264.79 angstroms was used to determine a density of approximately 4 x 10(9) to 7 x 10(9) electrons per cubic centimeter, which is a factor of 2 to 3 higher than typical solar active region densities. From this value, we estimate that approximately 6 percent of the stellar surface is covered with approximately 7 x 10(4) coronal loops."
