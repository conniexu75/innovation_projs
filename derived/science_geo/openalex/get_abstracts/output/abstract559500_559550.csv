https://openalex.org/W2346425069,"Visualizing a response to light Many biological processes depend on detecting and responding to light. The response is often mediated by a structural change in a protein that begins when absorption of a photon causes isomerization of a chromophore bound to the protein. Pande et al. used x-ray pulses emitted by a free electron laser source to conduct time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography in the time range of 100 fs to 3 ms. This allowed for the real-time tracking of the trans-cis isomerization of the chromophore in photoactive yellow protein and the associated structural changes in the protein.

Qiu et al. used the seeded growth of a crystallizable block copolymer and a homopolymer to produce highly uniform rectangular structures (see the Perspective by Ballauff). Chemical etching, or dissolution, of uncross-linked regions of the rectangular structures produced perforated platelet micelles. The sequential addition of different blends and cross-linking/dissolution strategies allowed the formation of well-defined hollow rectangular micelles, which can be functionalized in a variety of ways.

https://openalex.org/W2345914382,"In nature, structural specificity in DNA and proteins is encoded differently: In DNA, specificity arises from modular hydrogen bonds in the core of the double helix, whereas in proteins, specificity arises largely from buried hydrophobic packing complemented by irregular peripheral polar interactions. Here, we describe a general approach for designing a wide range of protein homo-oligomers with specificity determined by modular arrays of central hydrogen-bond networks. We use the approach to design dimers, trimers, and tetramers consisting of two concentric rings of helices, including previously not seen triangular, square, and supercoiled topologies. X-ray crystallography confirms that the structures overall, and the hydrogen-bond networks in particular, are nearly identical to the design models, and the networks confer interaction specificity in vivo. The ability to design extensive hydrogen-bond networks with atomic accuracy enables the programming of protein interaction specificity for a broad range of synthetic biology applications; more generally, our results demonstrate that, even with the tremendous diversity observed in nature, there are fundamentally new modes of interaction to be discovered in proteins."

Primary cilia are sensory organelles that project from the cell surface in most eukaryotic cells and affect signaling cascades in response to environmental stimuli. Photoreceptors use a highly specialized sensory cilium, the “outer segment” (OS), which contains tightly stacked discs containing the photopigment opsin, to detect light. Degeneration of photoreceptors is a major cause of blindness, and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a recessively inherited form of retinal dystrophy resulting in severe visual loss in early childhood (Koenekoop, 2004Koenekoop R.K. An overview of Leber congenital amaurosis: a model to understand human retinal development.Surv. Ophthalmol. 2004; 49: 379-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). LCA affects between 1:30,000 to 1:81,000 individuals and accounts for 5% of all inherited retinal dystrophies (Koenekoop, 2004Koenekoop R.K.

One of the most common causative LCA genes is CEP290 (centrosomal protein of 290 kDa; OMIM: 611755), accounting for around 15%–25% of cases (Chacon-Camacho and Zenteno, 2015Chacon-Camacho O.F.

CEP290 (also known as LCA10, BBS14, JBTS5, NPHP6, MKS4, and SLSN6) is a 92 kb gene of 55 exons, encoding a 2479 amino acid 290 kDa protein originally described as a component of the centrosome (Andersen et al., 2003Andersen J.S.

Proteomic characterization of the human centrosome by protein correlation profiling.Nature. 2003; 426: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). During mitosis, CEP290 is found at the centrosome (Sayer et al., 2006Sayer J.A. Otto E.A. O’Toole J.F. Nurnberg G. Kennedy M.A. Becker C. Hennies H.C. Helou J. Attanasio M.

Genet. 2006; 38: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), while in an interphase cell, CEP290 is located on both mother and daughter centrioles (Tsang et al., 2008Tsang W.Y. Bossard C. Khanna H. Peränen J. Swaroop A. Malhotra V. Dynlacht B.D. CP110 suppresses primary cilia formation through its interaction with CEP290, a protein deficient in human ciliary disease.Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In photoreceptors, CEP290 is located in the connecting cilium (Sayer et al., 2006Sayer J.A. Otto E.A. O’Toole J.F. Nurnberg G. Kennedy M.A. Becker C. Hennies H.C. Helou J. Attanasio M.

Genet. 2006; 38: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). During ciliogenesis, CEP290 is found at the distal end of the mother centriole that becomes part of the basal body at the base of the cilium, suggesting a role for CEP290 in cilium assembly (Chang et al., 2006Chang B. Khanna H. Hawes N. Jimeno D. He S. Lillo C. Parapuram S.K. Cheng H. Scott A.

Indeed, there is growing and compelling evidence for a critical function of CEP290 in ciliogenesis, as multiple studies have shown that loss of CEP290 reduces ciliogenesis (Kim et al., 2008Kim J. Krishnaswami S.R. Gleeson J.G. CEP290 interacts with the centriolar satellite component PCM-1 and is required for Rab8 localization to the primary cilium.Hum. Mol.

Cell. 2008; 15: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), without affecting cell-cycle progression. CEP290 forms a complex with CP110, another centrosomal protein, which leads to CEP290 inactivation until the cell enters quiescence, whereupon the CP110:CEP290 complex dissociates and CEP290 recruits Rab8a, a small GTPase, and triggers ciliogenesis (Tsang et al., 2008Tsang W.Y. Bossard C. Khanna H. Peränen J. Swaroop A. Malhotra V. Dynlacht B.D. CP110 suppresses primary cilia formation through its interaction with CEP290, a protein deficient in human ciliary disease.Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 187-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Mutations in CEP290 are associated with numerous syndromic ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome (JBTS), nephronophthisis (NPHP), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), and Senior-Loken syndrome (SLSN) (Coppieters et al., 2010Coppieters F. Lefever S. Leroy B.P. De Baere E. CEP290, a gene with many faces: mutation overview and presentation of CEP290base.Hum. Mutat. 2010; 31: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The severity of the disease and number of affected organs have been suggested to be related to the amount of residual CEP290 function (Drivas et al., 2015Drivas T.G. Wojno A.P. Tucker B.A. Stone E.M. Bennett J. Basal exon skipping and genetic pleiotropy: a predictive model of disease pathogenesis.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 291ra97Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A recent meta-analysis of 138 CEP290 mutations in 250 individuals demonstrated that LCA is the most common associated phenotype (57%) and that 86% of the CEP290 LCA patients had at least one copy of the most common CEP290 mutation, a deep intronic c.2991+1665A>G change (Drivas et al., 2015Drivas T.G. Wojno A.P. Tucker B.A. Stone E.M. Bennett J. Basal exon skipping and genetic pleiotropy: a predictive model of disease pathogenesis.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 291ra97Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This mutation in intron 26 results in aberrant splicing and subsequent inclusion of a 128 base pair (bp) cryptic exon containing an immediate premature stop codon (p.C998X) between exons 26 and 27. This mutation is specifically associated with LCA retinal dystrophy, and not syndromic disease (den Hollander et al., 2006den Hollander A.I. Koenekoop R.K. Yzer S. Lopez I. Arends M.L. Voesenek K.E. Zonneveld M.N. Strom T.M. Meitinger T. Brunner H.G. et al.Mutations in the CEP290 (NPHP6) gene are a frequent cause of Leber congenital amaurosis.Am. J. Hum.

Basal exon skipping and genetic pleiotropy: a predictive model of disease pathogenesis.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 291ra97Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Importantly, a residual fraction of full-length CEP290 mRNA is still spliced correctly and translated to full-length CEP290 protein. This residual CEP290 protein expression was reported to be as high as 50% of control levels in CEP290-LCA fibroblasts and has been suggested to account for the retinal-only phenotype seen in these individuals, with the remaining protein being sufficient to enable cilia function in other organs (den Hollander et al., 2006den Hollander A.I. Koenekoop R.K. Yzer S. Lopez I. Arends M.L. Voesenek K.E. Zonneveld M.N. Strom T.M. Meitinger T.

It is not clear, however, why photoreceptors would be more vulnerable to reduced CEP290 levels than other cells. Therapeutic options for retinal dystrophies such as LCA are limited. A promising therapeutic strategy in LCA associated with the deep intronic mutation in CEP290 is to target the aberrant splicing using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs). AONs are short, modified RNA molecules that can interfere with splicing, either to adjust levels of naturally occurring splice isoforms or to induce exon skipping of protein-truncating cryptic exons. AONs have been used in CEP290-LCA fibroblasts to provide proof-of-principle that aberrant CEP290 splicing can be corrected, and the ciliation defect of affected cells can be restored (Collin et al., 2012Collin R.W. den Hollander A.I. van der Velde-Visser S.D.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a potent technology that allows for directed differentiation toward most cell types, including retinal cell types. Using this technology with cells derived from affected patients is a powerful technique to model disease. Importantly, this provides an appropriate cellular model with the genetic mutation(s) in genomic context. We have recently used iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from an individual with RP2 X-linked retinitis pigmentosa to test the potential of translational readthrough-inducing drugs to bypass a stop codon and produce functional protein (Schwarz et al., 2015Schwarz N. Carr A.J. Lane A. Moeller F. Chen L.L. Aguilà M. Nommiste B. Muthiah M.N. Kanuga N. Wolfrum U. et al.Translational read-through of the RP2 Arg120stop mutation in patient iPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelium cells.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 972-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Advances in iPSC-photoreceptor differentiation techniques have provided a platform for investigating the effects of patient mutations on neural retinal development and maintenance (Nakano et al., 2012Nakano T. Ando S. Takata N. Kawada M. Muguruma K. Sekiguchi K. Saito K. Yonemura S. Eiraku M. Sasai Y.

Meyer J.S. et al.Generation of three-dimensional retinal tissue with functional photoreceptors from human iPSCs.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In this study, we used fibroblasts from an individual with LCA caused by a homozygous c.2991+1655A>G mutation to create iPSC-derived RPE and three-dimensional (3D) optic cups. These cell types were used to probe disease mechanisms and test antisense morpholino (MO) efficacy on CEP290 aberrant splicing. The data reveal a potential explanation for the retinal specificity associated with this mutation and proof of concept that AON therapy is effective in photoreceptors. Fibroblasts were derived from a dermal skin biopsy of a 39-year-old male who was diagnosed with LCA as a child. The patient was homozygous for the c.2991+1665A>G change and had no signs of syndromic disease. He had no detectable ERG, and retinal imaging showed attenuated vessels, peripheral RPE atrophy, and mottling, with a centrally preserved outer nuclear layer and inner segment ellipsoid band on spectral-domain OCT scanning that corresponded to the increased hyperautofluorescent ring in the macula on autofluorescence imaging (Figure S1, available online). In control fibroblasts, CEP290 protein was present at the base of the acetylated α-tubulin-positive cilium, as previously described (Chang et al., 2006Chang B. Khanna H. Hawes N. Jimeno D. He S. Lillo C. Parapuram S.K. Cheng H. Scott A. Hurd R.E. et al.In-frame deletion in a novel centrosomal/ciliary protein CEP290/NPHP6 perturbs its interaction with RPGR and results in early-onset retinal degeneration in the rd16 mouse.Hum. Mol.

Genet. 2006; 38: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In contrast, CEP290 localization at the base of cilia was severely reduced in LCA fibroblasts (Figure 1A; arrowheads). RT-PCR analysis of LCA fibroblasts using primers spanning exons 26 and 27 of the CEP290 gene revealed the presence of incorrectly spliced transcript containing the cryptic exon (26-X-27), in addition to the normal transcript (26-27) observed in controls (Figure 1B). Primers specific to the cryptic exon amplified a product in LCA fibroblasts only (Figure 1B). Incorrectly spliced transcript (26-X-27) represented the majority (∼60%) of total CEP290 mRNA in LCA cells. Immunoblotting confirmed that CEP290 missplicing leads to reduced levels of CEP290 protein compared to control fibroblasts (Figure 1C). CEP290 is known to play a critical role in the process of ciliogenesis, and cilia incidence was significantly reduced in LCA fibroblasts (Figures 1D and 1E) and the cilia present were significantly shorter (Figure 1F). Thus, we were able to detect and measure functional defects in ciliogenesis in CEP290-LCA patient cells. CEP290-LCA and control fibroblasts were reprogrammed to iPSCs by electroporation with episomal vectors containing the four Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc), Lin28, and a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to p53 (Okita et al., 2011Okita K.

Genet. 2015; 24: 972-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Emerging iPSC colonies were isolated, expanded, and clonally selected to generate clonal lines 1 and 2 (Figures S2A–S2C). The cells formed round, tightly compacted colonies that were positive for iPSC markers (Figures S2D and S2E). The pluripotent status of the CEP290-LCA lines was confirmed by comparing gene expression at the iPSC stage and following undirected embryoid body (EB) differentiation to that of 12 embryonic and 12 iPSC reference lines using the Taqman hPSC Scorecard panel (Figures S2F and S2G) as previously described (Tsankov et al., 2015Tsankov A.M.

Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1182-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CEP290 was present at the base of cilia in control iPSCs, but not in LCA iPSCs in which aberrant splicing of the cryptic exon 26-X-27 was detected (Figures S3A and S3B). Cilia incidence was significantly reduced in LCA iPSCs compared to control iPSCs, although the length of the remaining cilia was similar (Figures S3C–S3E). Clonally derived iPSC lines were differentiated into RPE cells by growing them to confluence and withdrawing bFGF as described previously (Carr et al., 2009Carr A.J. Vugler A.A. Hikita S.T.

Neurol. 2008; 214: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The CEP290 mutation did not appear to delay or reduce the efficiency of the differentiation process, and pigmented colonies of RPE appeared at around week 4 in both LCA and control cell lines. Clusters of RPE were isolated manually after 8 weeks. Control and CEP290-LCA lines formed pigmented monolayers of RPE with typical polygonal morphology (Figure 2A) and were immunopositive for an array of RPE markers (Figures 2B–2E). Analysis of monolayer sections revealed polarized cells expressing MerTK apically and collagen IV in the basal layer (Figures 2D and 2E). RT-PCR confirmed the expression of the cryptic exon in LCA iPSC-RPE (Figure 2F). Interestingly, the ratio of the correctly spliced (26-27) to misspliced (26-X-27) transcript differed in the LCA RPE compared to LCA fibroblasts with the aberrant misspliced transcript accounting for only 50% of the total (Figure 2G). We examined the effect of CEP290 missplicing on RPE cilia incidence and length and observed a slight reduction in LCA RPE cells compared to control (Figures 2H–2J). Photoreceptors are highly polar neurons with a distinctive inner and outer segment joined by a connecting cilium where CEP290 is thought to play an important role in protein trafficking. In order to study the effects of CEP290 depletion on photoreceptor genesis and maintenance, LCA and control iPSCs were differentiated using the 3D techniques for “optic cup” differentiation pioneered by Nakano et al. (Nakano et al., 2012Nakano T. Ando S. Takata N. Kawada M. Muguruma K. Sekiguchi K. Saito K. Yonemura S. Eiraku M. Sasai Y. Self-formation of optic cups and storable stratified neural retina from human ESCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 771-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The progress of their differentiation was monitored by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR (Figure 3). After 3–5 weeks of EB culture in retinal-cell-inducing medium, pouches of transparent neuroepithelium could be seen emerging from the embryoid bodies in both LCA and control cell lines. These pouches were dissected out and subcultured in retinal cell maturation media. After 2–3 further weeks in suspension culture, the pouches formed spherical aggregates with a thick, transparent mantel and histological features of an embryonic retina, including a Brn3/HuD-positive ganglion cell layer, a Chx10/Pax6-positive neuroblastic layer (Figure S4A), and occasional cone-arrestin- and recoverin-positive cells (Figure S4B). In the next stage of temporal development, the optic cups developed a more defined outer nuclear layer (ONL) containing migrating recoverin-positive progenitors (Figures 3B and S4B), as well as cone-arrestin-positive cells (Figure S4B), but no opsin expression (Figure S4C). As in normal development, the differentiation and organization of iPSCs into a polarized and stratified neuroepithelium was concomitant with polarization of the cilia at the apical layer of both control and LCA optic cups (Figure 3B). Electron microscopy (EM) showed apical tight junctions (arrow heads) and cilia (∗) emerging among mitochondria-rich inner segments (IS; Figures 3B and 3C). At the latest time point investigated (week 21), EM analysis of control optic cups revealed the presence of multiple cilia and inner segments that had become elongated. The majority of the protruding cilia were broken at the distal tip, likely as a result of EM processing; however, occasionally disorganized but intact outer segments were observed elaborating from the connecting cilium (Figure 3C). Recoverin (rod, cone, and bipolar cells)- and cone-arrestin (cone specific)-positive cells were abundant across the apical layer of LCA and control optic cups (Figures 3D, 3E, and S4D). Rhodopsin-positive rod cells were detected across an ONL approximately five cell nuclei deep with the most intense staining seen in structures above the ONL (Figures 3D and 3E). L/M- and S-opsin-positive cone cells were also detected in LCA and control optic cups, but were less abundant than rods (Figures 3E and S4C). RT-PCR analysis of different developmental stages revealed concurrent expression of early differentiation genes such as PAX6 and VSX2/CHX10, with similar parallel expression of cone-rod (CRX) and rod-specific genes (NRL, NR2E3) in both control and LCA optic cups (Figure 3F). In control optic cup photoreceptors, CEP290 colocalized with pericentrin at the base of the connecting cilia, whereas in LCA optic cups, CEP290 was not detectable at the connecting cilia (Figures 4A and S5A). RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the cryptic exon in LCA optic cups (Figures 4B and S5A). Strikingly, very little correctly spliced CEP290 transcript was expressed in LCA optic cups (10%–20% of total CEP290 mRNA), whereas in LCA fibroblasts and RPE, it was 40% and 50%, respectively (Figures 1B, 2F, and 4B). Ciliation in developing optic cups was examined in LCA and control cells. Prior to neuroepithelial differentiation, cilia were randomly dispersed in the center of the embryoid bodies. As the EBs underwent neuroepithelial differentiation, extensive migration and polarization of cilia to the apical surface occurred in both control and LCA optic cups (Figures 4C and S5C). Quantification of ciliated basal bodies in developing optic cups revealed an increase in ciliogenesis with time and a significant reduction in cilia incidence in the LCA cells at all stages of optic cup development (Figures 4D and S5D). Cilia length was significantly reduced at the latest time point only, correlating with the very low levels of full-length CEP290 transcript (Figures 4E, 4F, and S5E). The missplicing of CEP290 was examined via RT-PCR during the differentiation period of the optic cups (Figure 4F). At week 3 the splicing of CEP290 was broadly similar to that seen in LCA fibroblasts, iPSCs, and RPE. During subsequent development, the amount of 26-X-27 increased and 26-27 decreased. This correlated with expression of retina-specific isoforms of BBS8 (Murphy et al., 2015Murphy D. Singh R. Kolandaivelu S. Ramamurthy V. Stoilov P. Alternative splicing shapes the phenotype of a mutation in BBS8 to cause nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa.Mol. Cell.

Genet. 1999; 8: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (Figure 4F), suggesting that increased missplicing of CEP290 is associated with photoreceptor differentiation and the inclusion of photoreceptor-specific exons. AONs designed to target the aberrant splice donor site in CEP290 have been shown to increase the relative proportion of correctly spliced CEP290 and restore ciliation in LCA fibroblasts (Collin et al., 2012Collin R.W. den Hollander A.I. van der Velde-Visser S.D.

Assessing the effect of AONs on CEP290-LCA RPE and photoreceptors provides a unique opportunity to assess their therapeutic efficacy in the tissue that manifests LCA disease pathology. A 25 bp antisense morpholino (CEP290-MO) was developed against the c.2991+1665A>G change in CEP290 and tested on LCA fibroblasts alongside a standard control-MO (Figure S6). RT-PCR revealed that an increase in CEP290 26-27 transcript and concurrent reduction in cryptic exon inclusion occurred after 48 hr at doses of 10 μM and above (Figure S6A). At 10 μM, levels of correctly spliced CEP290 mRNA increased by ∼25%, compared to control-MO (Figures 5A and S6D). MO treatment was still effective 9 days after CEP290-MO treatment and increased the levels of correctly spliced product to over 80% of the total transcript (Figure S6E). Control and LCA RPE were treated with control- or CEP290-MO once every 7 days for 14 days. Similar to the LCA fibroblasts, the treatment led to an increase in correctly spliced transcript in RPE cells, but the relative increase was reduced"
https://openalex.org/W2345889524,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been employed to efficiently edit the genomes of diverse model organisms. CRISPR-mediated mouse genome editing is typically accomplished by microinjection of Cas9 DNA/RNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) into zygotes to generate modified animals in one step. However, microinjection is a technically demanding, labor-intensive, and costly procedure with poor embryo viability. Here, we describe a simple and economic electroporation-based strategy to deliver Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins into mouse zygotes with 100% efficiency for in vivo genome editing. Our methodology, designated as CRISPR RNP Electroporation of Zygotes (CRISPR-EZ), enables highly efficient and high-throughput genome editing in vivo, with a significant improvement in embryo viability compared with microinjection. Using CRISPR-EZ, we generated a variety of editing schemes in mouse embryos, including indel (insertion/deletion) mutations, point mutations, large deletions, and small insertions. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we used CRISPR-EZ to target the tyrosinase (Tyr) gene, achieving 88% bi-allelic editing and 42% homology-directed repair-mediated precise sequence modification in live mice. Taken together, CRISPR-EZ is simple, economic, high throughput, and highly efficient with the potential to replace microinjection for in vivo genome editing in mice and possibly in other mammals."

A longstanding question in cilium structure and function is why the microtubule arrangement in cilia is so complex. Stepanek and Pigino developed a time-resolved correlative fluorescence and three-dimensional electron microscopy method to show that the doublets provide directionality to intraflagellar transport. One microtubule in the pair moves cargoes up to the ciliary tip. Meanwhile, the other microtubule moves cargoes back to the cell body. These results explain why the axoneme is built out of microtubule doublets and suggest a mechanistic picture of how the logistics of bidirectional intraflagellar transport are regulated.

https://openalex.org/W2345995343,"Human confidence judgments are thought to originate from metacognitive processes that provide a subjective assessment about one’s beliefs. Alternatively, confidence is framed in mathematics as an objective statistical quantity: the probability that a chosen hypothesis is correct. Despite similar terminology, it remains unclear whether the subjective feeling of confidence is related to the objective, statistical computation of confidence. To address this, we collected confidence reports from humans performing perceptual and knowledge-based psychometric decision tasks. We observed two counterintuitive patterns relating confidence to choice and evidence: apparent overconfidence in choices based on uninformative evidence, and decreasing confidence with increasing evidence strength for erroneous choices. We show that these patterns lawfully arise from statistical confidence, and therefore occur even for perfectly calibrated confidence measures. Furthermore, statistical confidence quantitatively accounted for human confidence in our tasks without necessitating heuristic operations. Accordingly, we suggest that the human feeling of confidence originates from a mental computation of statistical confidence."

In this study, we examine the accumulation of somatic mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) mutations in skin fibroblasts, blood, and iPSCs derived from young and elderly subjects (24-72 years). We found that pooled skin and blood mtDNA contained low heteroplasmic point mutations, but a panel of ten individual iPSC lines from each tissue or clonally expanded fibroblasts carried an elevated load of heteroplasmic or homoplasmic mutations, suggesting that somatic mutations randomly arise within individual cells but are not detectable in whole tissues. The frequency of mtDNA defects in iPSCs increased with age, and many mutations were non-synonymous or resided in RNA coding genes and thus can lead to respiratory defects. Our results highlight a need to monitor mtDNA mutations in iPSCs, especially those generated from older patients, and to examine the metabolic status of iPSCs destined for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2303815889,"A fundamental challenge in calcium imaging has been to infer spike rates of neurons from the measured noisy fluorescence traces. We systematically evaluate different spike inference algorithms on a large benchmark dataset (>100,000 spikes) recorded from varying neural tissue (V1 and retina) using different calcium indicators (OGB-1 and GCaMP6). In addition, we introduce a new algorithm based on supervised learning in flexible probabilistic models and find that it performs better than other published techniques. Importantly, it outperforms other algorithms even when applied to entirely new datasets for which no simultaneously recorded data is available. Future data acquired in new experimental conditions can be used to further improve the spike prediction accuracy and generalization performance of the model. Finally, we show that comparing algorithms on artificial data is not informative about performance on real data, suggesting that benchmarking different methods with real-world datasets may greatly facilitate future algorithmic developments in neuroscience."

We analyze a large set of manually labeled tweets in different languages, use them as training data, and construct automated classification models. It turns out that the quality of classification models depends much more on the quality and size of training data than on the type of the model trained. Experimental results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between the performance of the top classification models. We quantify the quality of training data by applying various annotator agreement measures, and identify the weakest points of different datasets. We show that the model performance approaches the inter-annotator agreement when the size of the training set is sufficiently large. However, it is crucial to regularly monitor the self- and inter-annotator agreements since this improves the training datasets and consequently the model performance. Finally, we show that there is strong evidence that humans perceive the sentiment classes (negative, neutral, and positive) as ordered."

Phillips and Jerolmack, however, suggest that the self-organization of bedrock river channels blunts the impact of extreme rainfall events. River channel geometries from a wide range of course-grained rivers across the United States show that larger floods have very limited additional impact on channel geometry. River channel sculpting does increase as flood size increases, but the effect is most pronounced for moderate floods. This relationship may explain the long-term stability of rivers across shifts in climate. Science , this issue p. 694"

The variability between days suggests that day of the week cannot be ignored in the design and analysis of physical activity studies. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the optimal number of days needed to obtain reliable estimates of weekly habitual physical activity using the wrist-worn GENEActiv accelerometer.Data are from a subsample of the Mitchelstown cohort; 475 (44.6% males; mean aged 59.6±5.5 years) middle-aged Irish adults. Participants wore the wrist GENEActiv accelerometer for 7-consecutive days. Data were collected at 100Hz and summarised into a signal magnitude vector using 60s epochs. Each time interval was categorised according to intensity based on validated cut-offs. Spearman pairwise correlations determined the association between days of the week. Repeated measures ANOVA examined differences in average minutes across days. Intraclass correlations examined the proportion of variability between days, and Spearman-Brown formula estimated intra-class reliability coefficient associated with combinations of 1-7 days.Three hundred and ninety-seven adults (59.7±5.5yrs) had valid accelerometer data. Overall, men were most sedentary on weekends while women spent more time in sedentary behaviour on Sunday through Tuesday. Post hoc analysis found sedentary behaviour and light activity levels on Sunday to differ to all other days in the week. Analysis revealed greater than 1 day monitoring is necessary to achieve acceptable reliability. Monitoring frame duration for reliable estimates varied across intensity categories, (sedentary (3 days), light (2 days), moderate (2 days) and vigorous activity (6 days) and MVPA (2 days)).These findings provide knowledge into the behavioural variability in weekly activity patterns of middle-aged adults. Since Sunday differed from all other days in the week this suggests that day of the week cannot be overlooked in the design and analysis of physical activity studies and thus should be included in the study monitoring frames. Collectively our data suggest that six days monitoring, inclusive of Saturday and Sunday, are needed to reliably capture weekly habitual activity in all activity intensities using the wrist-worn GENEActiv accelerometer."

This biosynthetic cluster contains four genes (Fig. 1d) as follows: mcjA encodes the precursor peptide; mcjB is an ATP-dependent cysteine protease; mcjC is an ATP-dependent asparagine synthetase homolog; and mcjD is an ABC transporter. Although McjD is only needed to export the mature antimicrobial compound (conferring immunity to the producing strain), McjB and McjC directly participate in the maturation of McjA into MccJ25. To accomplish this, McjB cleaves off the leader peptide, and McjC adenylates and then cyclizes the side chain of Glu-8 with the new N-terminal α-amino group of the core peptide, yielding a macrolactam ring with an isopeptide bond (Fig. 1e).

Mutational analysis yielded insights into the biosynthesis of paeninodin. Interestingly, the studied gene cluster was found to contain not only the conserved genes encoding the precursor peptide, processing enzymes, and ABC transporter, but an additional gene coding for a putative kinase.

Closer examination of this and homologous kinases in vitro and in vivo demonstrated their ability to selectively phosphorylate the hydroxyl side chain of the C-terminal Ser of the precursor peptide prior to processing by the B1, B2, and C homologs, thus yielding a phosphorylated lasso peptide. The most active kinase was further characterized via bioinformatics, mutational analysis, and kinetic studies, and its specificity was tested for a wide range of substrates. Finally, the position of phosphorylation was unambiguously determined by chemical esterification assays and NMR spectroscopy. P. dendritiformis C454 was generously provided to us by Eshel Ben-Jacob and Alin Finkelshtein (Tel Aviv University, Israel). Thermobacillus composti KWC4 (DSM no. 18247) was purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DMSZ). Oligonucleotides of HPLC purity were purchased from Sigma. Precursor peptide derivatives were synthesized by Biomatik. For genome mining studies, the Position-specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (PSI-BLAST) was employed. The split B2 protein from lariatin was used as a query with the following parameters: maximum target sequences of 500, expected threshold of 10, and PSI-BLAST threshold of 0.005. The sequence of each gene cluster was downloaded from GenBankTM. Alignment of precursor peptides was performed with the CLC Main Workbench 6.5 (CLC bio). Conserved domain motif matching was implemented using the MEME Suite. Kinase sequences were retrieved from the gene clusters and aligned in ClustalX2, with standard settings as implemented in Mega 6. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the minimum evolution and neighbor-joining method, and the Poisson-correction amino acid model. Phylogeny was tested by bootstrapping with 1000 replications. C protein sequences were downloaded from GenBankTM, and phylogenetic trees were constructed in the same manner. Whole genomic DNA of P. dendritiformis C454 was prepared using a standard protocol (FastDNA SPIN Kit, MP Biomedicals). The padeCAKB1B2D gene cluster (GenBankTM accession no. AHKH01000064.1, 23026 … 28726) was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA (see supplemental Table S1 for primers) using Phusion High Fidelity DNA polymerase. Purified products and pET-41a(+) were digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated with T4 DNA ligase to yield an expression plasmid containing the padeCAKB1B2D gene cluster. After transforming into Escherichia coli TOP10 cells, plasmids were prepared from individual transformants and confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were retransformed with the expression construct and cultured in lysogeny broth (LB) medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking. For heterologous expression of the lasso peptide biosynthetic gene cluster, M9 minimal medium (17.1 g/liter Na2HPO4·12 H2O, 3 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 1 g/liter NH4Cl, 1 ml/liter MgSO4 solution (2 m), 0.2 ml/liter CaCl2 solution (0.5 m), pH 7.0, 10 ml/liter glucose solution (40% w/v) and 2 ml/liter vitamin mix (see supplemental Table S2) were added after autoclaving) was used to screen for the best fermentation conditions. Different temperatures and durations (1–3 days at 37 °C or 3 days at 20 °C) were tested for lasso peptide production. Initially, 60 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin was inoculated with E. coli BL21 cells carrying pET41a-padeCAKB1B2D and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. From these cultures, 2-liter baffled culture flasks, each containing 600 ml of M9 fermentation media, were inoculated to A600 ≈0.01. For fermentation at 37 °C, IPTG (final concentration of 0.05 mm) was used to induce the expression at A600 ≈0.5–0.6. For fermentation at 20 °C, cells were at first grown at 37 °C to A600 ≈0.4–0.5 in about 4.5 h and then slowly cooled to 20 °C for another 1 h. At A600 ≈0.5–0.6, the cells were induced with the same amount of IPTG and cultivated at 20 °C for 3 days. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C) and resuspended by vortexing. Soluble components were extracted by shaking the resuspended pellet of each 600-ml culture in 60 ml of MeOH overnight. After centrifugation (6000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C), the pellet extract was filtered, and the solvent was evaporated at 40 °C and reduced pressure. Dried extracts were resuspended in a total of 900 μl of 50% MeOH, clarified by centrifugation, and analyzed via LC-MS. Additionally, culture supernatants were extracted by use of XAD16 resin (Sigma, ∼7 g/liter supernatant). The XAD16-containing supernatant was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, and the resin was then removed by filtration. The XAD16 on the filter was washed several times with water and subsequently eluted with a total of 60 ml of MeOH per 600 ml of supernatant. Solvent was removed by evaporation at 40 °C and reduced pressure, and dried extracts were resuspended in a total of 900 μl of 50% MeOH and then clarified by centrifugation and analyzed via LC-MS. MS analysis of each extract (100 μl per measurement) was performed with a high resolution LTQ FT Ultra (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an Agilent 1100 HPLC system equipped with a Nucleosil 300-8 C18 column (125 × 2 mm, Macherey-Nagel). UV absorption was monitored at 215 nm. Analysis was performed by applying the following gradient of water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and MeCN, 0.1% trifl"
https://openalex.org/W2338782656,"Repression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in mammals involves several epigenetic mechanisms. Acute loss of the maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1 induces widespread DNA demethylation and transcriptional activation of ERVs, including CpG-rich IAP (intracisternal A particle) proviruses. Here, we show that this effect is not due simply to a loss of DNA methylation. Conditional deletions reveal that both Dnmt1 and Np95 are essential for maintenance DNA methylation. However, while IAPs are derepressed in Dnmt1-ablated embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs), these ERVs remain silenced when Np95 is deleted alone or in combination with Dnmt1. This paradoxical phenotype results from an ectopic interaction between NP95 and the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1. Normally, SETDB1 maintains silencing of IAPs, but in the absence of DNMT1, prolonged binding of NP95 to hemimethylated DNA transiently disrupts SETDB1-dependent H3K9me3 deposition. Thus, our observations reveal an unexpected antagonistic interplay between two repressive pathways involved in retroviral silencing in mammalian cells."

Here, we describe an additional mechanism by which uPA regulates angiogenesis. Ex vivo VEGF-induced vascular sprouting from Matrigel-embedded aortic rings isolated from uPA knock-out (uPA−/−) mice was impaired compared with vessels emanating from wild-type mice. Endothelial cells isolated from uPA−/− mice show less proliferation and migration in response to VEGF than their wild type counterparts or uPA−/− endothelial cells in which expression of wild type uPA had been restored. We reported previously that uPA is transported from cell surface receptors to nuclei through a mechanism that requires its kringle domain. Intranuclear uPA modulates gene transcription by binding to a subset of transcription factors. Here we report that wild type single-chain uPA, but not uPA variants incapable of nuclear transport, increases the expression of cell surface VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) by translocating to the nuclei of ECs. Intranuclear single-chain uPA binds directly to and interferes with the function of the transcription factor hematopoietically expressed homeodomain protein or proline-rich homeodomain protein (HHEX/PRH), which thereby lose their physiologic capacity to repress the activity of vehgr1 and vegfr2 gene promoters.

https://openalex.org/W2346421879,"The cardinal feature of neuronal polarization is the establishment and maintenance of axons and dendrites. How axonal and dendritic proteins are sorted and targeted to different compartments is poorly understood. Here, we identified distinct dileucine motifs that are necessary and sufficient to target transmembrane proteins to either the axon or the dendrite through direct interactions with the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complexes (APs) in C. elegans. Axonal targeting requires AP-3, while dendritic targeting is mediated by AP-1. The axonal dileucine motif binds to AP-3 with higher efficiency than to AP-1. Both AP-3 and AP-1 are localized to the Golgi but occupy adjacent domains. We propose that AP-3 and AP-1 directly select transmembrane proteins and target them to axon and dendrite, respectively, by sorting them into distinct vesicle pools."

Ancient microbes left very little direct morphological evidence of their existence in the rock record, thereby requiring geochemical clues for evidence of their activity.

Cultures of a modern magnetic bacterium fractionated 57 Fe isotopes independent of their mass, in contrast to fractionation patterns often observed for other isotopes. Because this signature is not produced abiotically or by other iron-metabolizing bacteria, it could serve as a reliable biomarker of this ancient magnetic microbial lifestyle.

https://openalex.org/W2345765375,"Background Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 60 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Body Mass Index (BMI). Additional genetic variants, such as copy number variations (CNV), have also been investigated in relation to BMI. Recently, the highly polymorphic CNV in the salivary amylase (AMY1) gene, encoding an enzyme implicated in the first step of starch digestion, has been associated with obesity in adults and children. We assessed the potential association between AMY1 copy number and a wide range of BMI in a population of Italian school-children. Methods 744 children (354 boys, 390 girls, mean age (±SD): 8.4±1.4years) underwent anthropometric assessments (height, weight) and collection of saliva samples for DNA extraction. AMY1 copies were evaluated by quantitative PCR. Results A significant increase of BMI z-score by decreasing AMY1 copy number was observed in boys (β: -0.117, p = 0.033), but not in girls. Similarly, waist circumference (β: -0.155, p = 0.003, adjusted for age) was negatively influenced by AMY1 copy number in boys. Boys with 8 or more AMY1 copy numbers presented a significant lower BMI z-score (p = 0.04) and waist circumference (p = 0.01) when compared to boys with less than 8 copy numbers. Conclusions In this pediatric-only, population-based study, a lower AMY1 copy number emerged to be associated with increased BMI in boys. These data confirm previous findings from adult studies and support a potential role of a higher copy number of the salivary AMY1 gene in protecting from excess weight gain."
https://openalex.org/W2345698419,"Amphibian populations are vanishing worldwide. Declines and extinctions of many populations have been attributed to chytridiomycosis, a disease induced by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). In Africa, however, changes in amphibian assemblages were typically attributed to habitat change. We conducted a retrospective study utilizing field surveys from 2004-2012 of the anuran faunas on two mountains in western Cameroon, a hotspot of African amphibian diversity. The number of species detected was negatively influenced by year, habitat degradation, and elevation, and we detected a decline of certain species. Because another study in this region revealed an emergence of Bd in 2008, we screened additional recent field-collected samples and also pre-decline preserved museum specimens for the presence of Bd supporting emergence before 2008. When comparing the years before and after Bd detection, we found significantly diminished frog species richness and abundance on both mountains after Bd emergence. Our analyses suggest that this may be the first disease-driven community-level decline in anuran biodiversity in Central Africa. The disappearance of several species known to tolerate habitat degradation, and a trend of stronger declines at higher elevations, are consistent with Bd-induced declines in other regions. Not all species decreased; populations of some species remained constant, and others increased after the emergence of Bd. This variation might be explained by species-specific differences in infection probability. Increased habitat protection and Bd-mitigation strategies are needed for sustaining diverse amphibian communities such as those on Mt. Manengouba, which contains nearly half of Cameroon's frog diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2349190723,"The promise of portable diagnostic devices relies on three basic requirements: comparable sensitivity to established platforms, inexpensive manufacturing and cost of operations, and the ability to survive rugged field conditions. Solid state nanopores can meet all these requirements, but to achieve high manufacturing yields at low costs, assays must be tolerant to fabrication imperfections and to nanopore enlargement during operation. This paper presents a model for molecular engineering techniques that meets these goals with the aim of detecting target sequences within DNA. In contrast to methods that require precise geometries, we demonstrate detection using a range of pore geometries. As a result, our assay model tolerates any pore-forming method and in-situ pore enlargement. Using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes modified for conjugation with synthetic bulk-adding molecules, pores ranging 15-50 nm in diameter are shown to detect individual PNA-bound DNA. Detection of the CFTRΔF508 gene mutation, a codon deletion responsible for ∼66% of all cystic fibrosis chromosomes, is demonstrated with a 26-36 nm pore size range by using a size-enhanced PNA probe. A mathematical framework for assessing the statistical significance of detection is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W2347021123,"A few studies indicate that limited nesting stress (LNS) alters maternal behavior and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis of dams and offspring in male Sprague Dawley rats. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of LNS on maternal behavior in Wistar rats, and on the HPA axis, glycemia and in vivo intestinal permeability of male and female offspring. Intestinal permeability is known to be elevated during the first week postnatally and influenced by glucocorticoids. Dams and neonatal litters were subjected to LNS or normal nesting conditions (control) from days 2 to 10 postnatally. At day 10, blood was collected from pups for determination of glucose and plasma corticosterone by enzyme immunoassay and in vivo intestinal permeability by oral gavage of fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran 4kDa. Dams exposed to LNS compared to control showed an increase in the percentage of time spent building a nest (118%), self-grooming (69%), and putting the pups back to the nest (167%). LNS male and female pups exhibited a reduction of body weight by 5% and 4%, adrenal weights/100g body weight by 17% and 18%, corticosterone plasma levels by 64% and 62% and blood glucose by 11% and 12% respectively compared to same sex control pups. In male LNS pups, intestinal permeability was increased by 2.7-fold while no change was observed in females compared to same sex control. There was no sex difference in any of the parameters in control pups except the body weight. These data indicate that Wistar dams subjected to LNS during the first postnatal week have an altered repertoire of maternal behaviors which affects the development of the HPA axis in both sexes and intestinal barrier function in male offspring."

Recent studies suggest that diabetes also impairs reparative responses after cell therapy. In this study, we examined potential mechanisms by which diabetes affects cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). CPCs isolated from the diabetic heart showed diminished proliferation, a propensity for cell death, and a pro-adipogenic phenotype. The diabetic CPCs were insulin-resistant, and they showed higher energetic reliance on glycolysis, which was associated with up-regulation of the pro-glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). In WT CPCs, expression of a mutant form of PFKFB, which mimics PFKFB3 activity and increases glycolytic rate, was sufficient to phenocopy the mitochondrial and proliferative deficiencies found in diabetic cells. Consistent with activation of phosphofructokinase in diabetic cells, stable isotope carbon tracing in diabetic CPCs showed dysregulation of the pentose phosphate and glycero(phospho)lipid synthesis pathways. We describe diabetes-induced dysregulation of carbon partitioning using stable isotope metabolomics-based coupling quotients, which relate relative flux values between metabolic pathways. These findings suggest that diabetes causes an imbalance in glucose carbon allocation by uncoupling biosynthetic pathway activity, which could diminish the efficacy of CPCs for myocardial repair. Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased mortality and progression to heart failure. Recent studies suggest that diabetes also impairs reparative responses after cell therapy. In this study, we examined potential mechanisms by which diabetes affects cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). CPCs isolated from the diabetic heart showed diminished proliferation, a propensity for cell death, and a pro-adipogenic phenotype.

We used spoligotyping to identify a total of 293 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates (one isolate per patient) collected in the Bunda, Dar es Salaam, Ngorongoro and Serengeti areas in Tanzania. The results were compared with results in the SITVIT2 international database of the Pasteur Institute of Guadeloupe. Genotyping and phylogeographical analyses highlighted the predominance of the CAS, T, EAI, and LAM MTBC lineages in Tanzania. The three most frequent Spoligotype International Types (SITs) were: SIT21/CAS1-Kili (n = 76; 25.94%), SIT59/LAM11-ZWE (n = 22; 7.51%), and SIT126/EAI5 tentatively reclassified as EAI3-TZA (n = 18; 6.14%). Furthermore, three SITs were newly created in this study (SIT4056/EAI5 n = 2, SIT4057/T1 n = 1, and SIT4058/EAI5 n = 1). We noted that the East-African-Indian (EAI) lineage was more predominant in Bunda, the Manu lineage was more common among strains isolated in Ngorongoro, and the Central-Asian (CAS) lineage was more predominant in Dar es Salaam (p-value<0.0001). No statistically significant differences were noted when comparing HIV status of patients vs. major lineages (p-value = 0.103). However, when grouping lineages as Principal Genetic Groups (PGG), we noticed that PGG2/3 group (Haarlem, LAM, S, T, and X) was more associated with HIV-positive patients as compared to PGG1 group (Beijing, CAS, EAI, and Manu) (p-value = 0.03). This study provided mapping of MTBC genetic diversity in Tanzania (containing information on isolates from different cities) and neighbouring East African and other several African countries highlighting differences as regards to MTBC genotypic distribution between Tanzania and other African countries. This work also allowed underlining of spoligotyping patterns tentatively grouped within the newly designated EAI3-TZA lineage (remarkable by absence of spacers 2 and 3, and represented by SIT126) which seems to be specific to Tanzania. However, further genotyping information would be needed to confirm this specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2346768102,"Electrical stimulation (ES) is therapeutic to many bone diseases, from promoting fracture regeneration to orthopedic intervention. The application of ES offers substantial therapeutic potential, while optimal ES parameters and the underlying mechanisms responsible for the positive clinical impact are poorly understood. In this study, we assembled an ES cell culture and monitoring device. Mc-3T3-E1 cells were subjected to different frequency to investigate the effect of osteogenesis. Cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, the mRNA levels of osteosis-related genes, the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and intracellular concentration of Ca2+ were thoroughly evaluated. We found that 100 Hz could up-regulate the mRNA levels of collagen I, collagen II and Runx2. On the contrary, ES could down-regulate the mRNA levels of osteopontin (OPN). ALP activity assay and Fast Blue RR salt stain showed that 100 Hz could accelerate cells differentiation. Compared to the control group, 100 Hz could promote cell proliferation. Furthermore, 1 Hz to 10 Hz could improve calcium deposition in the intracellular matrix. Overall, these results indicate that 100Hz ES exhibits superior potentialities in osteogenesis, which should be beneficial for the clinical applications of ES for the treatment of bone diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4230424712,"Fish biomass is a primary driver of coral reef ecosystem services and has high sensitivity to human disturbances, particularly fishing. Estimates of fish biomass, their spatial distribution, and recovery potential are important for evaluating reef status and crucial for setting management targets. Here we modeled fish biomass estimates across all reefs of the western Indian Ocean using key variables that predicted the empirical data collected from 337 sites. These variables were used to create biomass and recovery time maps to prioritize spatially explicit conservation actions. The resultant fish biomass map showed high variability ranging from ~15 to 2900 kg/ha, primarily driven by human populations, distance to markets, and fisheries management restrictions. Lastly, we assembled data based on the age of fisheries closures and showed that biomass takes ~ 25 years to recover to typical equilibrium values of ~1200 kg/ha. The recovery times to biomass levels for sustainable fishing yields, maximum diversity, and ecosystem stability or conservation targets once fishing is suspended was modeled to estimate temporal costs of restrictions. The mean time to recovery for the whole region to the conservation target was 8.1(± 3SD) years, while recovery to sustainable fishing thresholds was between 0.5 and 4 years, but with high spatial variation. Recovery prioritization scenario models included one where local governance prioritized recovery of degraded reefs and two that prioritized minimizing recovery time, where countries either operated independently or collaborated. The regional collaboration scenario selected remote areas for conservation with uneven national responsibilities and spatial coverage, which could undermine collaboration. There is the potential to achieve sustainable fisheries within a decade by promoting these pathways according to their social-ecological suitability."
https://openalex.org/W2346726934,"The over-expression of human neuroglobin (NGB), a heme-protein preferentially expressed in the brain, displays anti-apoptotic effects against hypoxic/ischemic and oxidative stresses enhancing neuron survival. As hypoxic and oxidative stress injury frequently occurs in fast proliferating neoplastic tissues, here, the effect of these stressors on the level, localization, and anti-apoptotic function of NGB in wild type and NGB-stable-silenced MCF-7 breast cancer cells has been assessed. The well-known endogenous NGB inducer 17β-estradiol (E2) has been used as positive control. The median pO2 present in tumor microenvironment of breast cancer patients (i.e., 2% O2) does not affect the NGB level in breast cancer cells, whereas hydrogen peroxide and lead(IV) acetate, which increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, enhance the NGB levels outside the mitochondria and still activate apoptosis. However, E2-induced NGB up-regulation in mitochondria completely reverse lead(IV) acetate-induced PARP cleavage. These results indicate that the NGB level could represent a marker of oxidative-stress in MCF-7 breast cancer cells; however, the NGB ability to respond to injuring stimuli by preventing apoptosis requires its re-allocation into the mitochondria. As a whole, present data might lead to a new direction in understanding NGB function in cancer opening new avenues for the therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2367666776,"Background HPV infection causes cervical cancer, a major contributor to morbidity and mortality among low-income Mexican women. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is now a primary screening strategy in Mexico’s early cervical cancer detection program (ECDP). Research on Mexican women’s perceptions of HPV and testing is necessary for establishing culturally appropriate protocols and educational materials. Here, we explore perceptions about HPV and HPV-related risk factors among low-income Mexican ECDP participants. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 ECDP participants from two primary care health clinics in Michoacán state, Mexico. Interviews addressed women’s understandings of and experiences with HPV and HPV testing. Analysis was inductive and guided by the Health Belief Model with a focus on gender. Results Women’s confusion about HPV and HPV screening caused emotional distress. They understood HPV to be a serious disease that would always cause severe symptoms, often characterizing it as analogous to HIV or inevitably carcinogenic. Women also attributed it to men’s sexual behaviors, specifically infidelity and poor hygiene. Women described both sexes’ desire for sex as natural but understood men’s negative practices of masculinity, like infidelity, as the causes of women’s HPV infection. Some women believed dirty public bathrooms or heredity could also cause HPV transmission. Conclusions These results are consistent with prior findings that geographically and economically diverse populations lack clear understandings of the nature, causes, or symptoms of HPV, even among those receiving HPV testing. Our findings also reveal that local cultural discourse relating to masculinity, along with failure to provide sufficient education to low-income and indigenous-language speaking patients, exacerbate women’s negative emotions surrounding HPV testing. While negative emotions did not deter women from seeking testing, they could be ameliorated with better health education and communication."

These results indicate that the CaMKKβ isoform, rather than CaMKKα, preferably recognizes AMPK, suggesting that the recognition mechanism of AMPK by CaMKK isoforms as a substrate may differ from that of CaMKI. A previous report showed that CaMKKβ, but not CaMKKα, forms a stable complex with AMPK, which could explain why CaMKKβ is an AMPK kinase and CaMKKα is not (21Green M.F. Anderson K.A. Means A.R.

Purified recombinant CaMKK isoforms, including site-directed mutants and GST-CaMKK chimera mutants (∼1 μg/ml unless otherwise indicated), were incubated individually with GST-CaMKIα 1–293, KE (0.5 mg/ml) or AMPK K45R (0.5 mg/ml) at 30 °C for the indicated time periods in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 1 mm DTT, and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (200–700 cpm/pmol) in the presence of either 4 mm CaCl2/10.0–16.5 μm CaM or 2 mm EGTA. Each reaction was initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. 32P incorporation into each substrate was estimated by Cerenkov counting of the excised gels. Human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. A549 cells in 6-well dishes were infected with FLAG-CaMKKα mutants expressing retroviruses that were generated by transfection of the pVSV-G vector and retroviral transfer vectors (pMSCV-MCS-IRES-EGFP) harboring either the FLAG-CaMKKα double mutant (A292T/L233F) as described previously (20Fujiwara Y. Hiraoka Y. Fujimoto T. Kanayama N. Magari M. Tokumitsu H.

After 18 h of culture, the cells were cultured in the absence of FBS for 6 h and then treated with 1 μm ionomycin for 5 min. The cells were extracted with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 μl), followed by immunoblot analysis using indicated antibodies. Student’s t tests were used to evaluate statistical significance when two groups were compared. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The CaM overlay method was performed using 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated CaM in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, followed by detection of the CaM-binding signal using a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (28Tokumitsu H. Hatano N. Tsuchiya M. Yurimoto S. Fujimoto T. Ohara N. Kobayashi R. Sakagami H. Identification and characterization of PRG-1 as a neuronal calmodulin-binding protein.Biochem.

Protein concentration was estimated by staining the samples with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. It has been reported that the purified CaMKKβ from rat brain activated AMPK 7-fold more rapidly than purified CaMKKα in vitro (14Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Mustard K.J. Ross L. Bain J. Edelman A.M.

To confirm a distinct substrate preference of CaMKK isoforms, we attempted to measure the direct phosphorylation of the activation-loop Thr (Thr172) of the α subunit of the AMPK heterotrimeric complex by purified recombinant CaMKK isoforms and compared this with the phosphorylation of the catalytic domain of rat CaMKIα (GST-CaMKIα 1–293, K49E) at Thr177. Recombinant CaMKK isoforms were expressed in the E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) strain and purified by CaM-coupled Sepharose column chromatography. The amounts of the enzymes for measuring substrate phosphorylation were comparable, as judged by the CaM overlay method (Fig. 1A), because both CaMKK isoforms contain similar CaM-binding sequences (24Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. A novel target recognition revealed by calmodulin in complex with Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Both CaMKK substrates were mutated at a residue in the ATP-binding site (K45R in AMPKα and K49E in CaMKIα) to generate kinase-dead enzymes to avoid the feedback phosphorylation of CaMKKs by activated CaMKK target kinases (29Matsushita M.

Time course experiments of phosphorylation of the catalytic domain of GST-CaMKIα 1–293, K49E (Fig. 1B), and AMPK (Fig. 1C) were performed with the same concentrations (1 μg/ml) of CaMKK isoforms in the presence of Ca2+/CaM. Although the phosphorylation profiles of CaMKI by both CaMKK isoforms were indistinguishable (Fig. 1B), CaMKKβ was shown to phosphorylate the Thr172 of AMPK 14-fold more rapidly than CaMKKα (Fig. 1C) under this experimental condition. When we compared the kinetic constant (Km) of CaMKK isoforms for AMPK based on the double reciprocal plots of phosphorylation data using various concentrations of AMPK (Fig. 2A), it was clear that the main reason for the distinct activities of CaMKK isoforms for AMPK phosphorylation was the significantly higher Km (13.1 μm) of CaMKKα for AMPK compared with that of CaMKKβ (1.5 μm). These results are in good agreement with a previous report using purified CaMKKs from rat brain (14Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Mustard K.J. Ross L. Bain J. Edelman A.M. Frenguelli B.G. Hardie D.G. Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β is an alternative upstream kinase for AMP-activated protein kinase.Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar), suggesting that CaMKKβ is the dominant isoform with respect to the regulation of AMPK.FIGURE 2Double reciprocal plots of CaMKKα and β activities.

The results represent duplicate experiments and are presented as double reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To clarify the distinct substrate preference of CaMKK isoforms, we analyzed the activities of catalytic domain mutants of CaMKKβ (residues 162–470) and CaMKKα (residues 126–434) including the wild-type enzyme, which each lacks both the N-terminal extension domain and C-terminal domain containing an autoinhibitory segment and a CaM-binding segment (23Tokumitsu H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20090-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These catalytic domain mutants were expressed in E. coli JM109 and purified as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 3A). Thus, all of recombinant enzyme phosphorylated the protein substrates in a complete Ca2+/CaM-independent manner. When we compared the AMPK phosphorylation activity of GST-CaMKK catalytic domain mutants, including wild-type and CaMKKβ/α chimera mutants, we used the same concentrations (∼1 μg/ml) of the enzymes as those used for measuring GST-CaMKIα 1–293 K49E phosphorylation activity, which were equalized (Fig. 3B, top panel). Despite the ∼70% amino acid sequence homology of the catalytic domain between rat CaMKKα and β (5Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H.

Although the activity of the CaMKKβ-(162–364)/CaMKKα-(329–434) mutant (CaMKKβ/α-1) was comparable with that of CaMKKβ-(162–470), the CaMKKβ-(162–303)/CaMKKα-(268–434) mutant (CaMKKβ/α-2) showed a significantly reduced activity compared with that of CaMKKβ-(162–470) (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). These data suggest that residues 304–364 in CaMKKβ are involved in the efficient phosphorylation of AMPKα. Indeed, we could confirm that the CaMKKβ mutant, in which residues 304–364 were replaced by an equivalent region (residues 268–328) in CaMKKα (CaMKKβ/α/β-1), exhibited a significantly lower activity toward the substrate AMPK than CaMKKβ-(162–470) (Fig. 3B, bottom panel) did, similar to CaMKKα-(126–434). Among residues 304–364 in CaMKKβ and 268–328 in CaMKKα, 17 amino acid residues are different from their corresponding counterparts in these two kinases (Fig. 4A). To narrow down the primary sequence of CaMKKβ, which is involved in the efficient phosphorylation of AMPK, we produced serial chimera mutants based on CaMKKβ/α/β-1 and measured their activities (Fig. 4A). We performed a phosphorylation assay against AMPKα K45R using the same concentration of CaMKKβ/α/β chimera mutants as that used for GST-CaMKIα 1–293 K49E phosphorylation (Fig. 4B) as described in Fig. 3B. CaMKKβ/α/β-2 and CaMKKβ/α/β-3 were shown to phosphorylate AMPK with a lower efficiency similar to that of CaMKKβ/α/β-1, but CaMKKβ/α/β-4 exhibited significantly increased activity to phosphorylate AMPKα (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). These results indicate that Ser357-Leu358 in CaMKKβ apparently plays an important role for the efficient phosphorylation of AMPKα but not for CaMKIα as a substrate. To identify the crucial amino acid(s) in CaMKKβ required for efficiently phosphorylating AMPKα, we produced a full-length CaMKKα mutant in which Ala321-Ile322 was replaced by the corresponding amino acid residues in CaMKKβ (Ser357-Leu358) (Fig. 5A) and measured the CaMKK activity toward CaMKIα and AMPKα as substrates. The amounts of the enzymes for measuring substrate phosphorylation were comparable, as judged by the CaM overlay method (Fig. 5B). The CaMKKα A321S mutant was shown to phosphorylate AMPKα with a lower efficiency, in a similar manner as the CaMKKα wild type. In contrast, the CaMKKα I322L mutant exhibited significantly enhanced kinase activity toward AMPKα in a similar manner as the CaMKKβ wild type. We observed the AMPK phosphorylating activity of the CaMKKα I322L mutant in a complete Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the enhanced kinase activity toward AMPKα as a substrate (Fig. 5C) was not likely due to disruption of the autoinhibitory mechanism of CaMKKα (23Tokumitsu H. Muramatsu M. Ikura M. Kobayashi R. Regulatory mechanism of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20090-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) by this mutation. Therefore, we measured the kinetic constant (Km) of the CaMKKα I322L mutant for AMPK based on the double reciprocal plots of phosphorylation data using various concentrations of AMPK (Fig. 2B) and obtained a Km value (4.9 μm) that was significantly lower than that of CaMKKα (13.1 μm, Fig. 2A). Finally, to confirm the data obtained with in vitro experiments as described above by using living cells, we attempted to test the ionomycin-induced AMPK phosphorylation in A549 cells (a human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line) in which FLAG-tagged CaMKKα mutants were exogenously expressed with a retrovirus expression system (Fig. 6). When we expressed a FLAG-tagged CaMKKα double mutant (A292T/L233F, AT/LF) in A549 cells, which was a CaMKK inhibitor (STO-609)-resistant mutant (20Fujiwara Y. Hiraoka Y. Fujimoto T. Kanayama N.

In contrast, we could observe significant ionomycin-induced AMPK phosphorylation in cells expressing a CaMKKα triple mutant (A292T/L233F/I322L, AT/LF/IL) even in the presence of STO-609, indicating that the CaMKKα triple mutant (AT/LF/IL) acquired an ability for phosphorylating AMPK in living cells. These results suggest that a single amino acid difference (Leu358 in CaMKKβ/Ile322 in CaMKKα) in the catalytic domain of CaMKK isoforms dictates the efficiency of the kinase to phosphorylate AMPKα in vivo as well as in vitro.FIGURE 6Phosphorylation of AMPK by the CaMKKα I322L mutant in A549 cells. Either the FLAG-CaMKKα A292T, L233F mutant (FLAG-CaMKKα AT/LF) or the FLAG-CaMKKα A292T/L233F/I322L mutant (FLAG-CaMKKα AT/LF/IL) was expressed with a retrovirus expression system as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then stimulated without (−, open circles) or with 1 μm ionomycin for 5 min (+) in the absence (−, closed circles) or presence (+, open triangles) of 10 μg/ml STO-609.

The results are expressed as a percentage of the value in the absence of STO-609 (−) with ionomycin treatment (+) and displayed as scatterplots.

It is noteworthy that the kinase activities of both CaMKK isoforms toward CaMKIα were indistinguishable. Our mutagenesis studies clearly indicated that a single amino acid (Leu358 in CaMKKβ/Ile322 in CaMKKα) in subdomain VIII plays a role, at least in part, in the discrimination of AMPK as a native substrate but not in the discrimination of CaMKIα. This finding is in good agreement with a previous report demonstrating that subdomain VIII in MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) was a contact site for its substrate, MKK4, thereby discriminating the substrate (30Tu Z.

Materials and Methods Eight hundred and ninety-four patients were known to have or have been suspicious of having coronary artery disease, underwent CCTA and conventional coronary angiography (CAG). All the images acquired were assessed. The calcified plaque in CCTA was classified into four types (I-IV) according to the ratio of calcified plaque volume to vessel circumference (RVTC). Overall diagnostic accuracy was made under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. CAG was used as the standard reference. Results A total of 12845 segments were evaluated in 894 patients, among which 4955 calcified plaques were detected on 3645(28.4%) segments by CCTA. The overall AUC, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.939, 97.8%, 90.1%, 71.2% and 99.4%, respectively. In type I-II calcification, CCTA had high diagnostic performance in AUC (type I: 0.983; type II: 0.976), sensitivity (96.7%; 98.1%), specificity (99.8%; 97.0%), PPV (95.7%; 90.1%), NPV (99.8%; 99.5%) and accuracy (99.6%; 97.3%). In type III-IV calcification, CCTA has high performance in sensitivity (type III: 97.6%; type IV: 97.9%) and NPV (98.3%; 98.7%), moderate performance in AUC (0.877; 0.829), while remarkable decrease in specificity (78.7%; 67.9%), PPV (71.0%; 56.2%) and accuracy (84.9%; 76.8%). Conclusion CCTA has highest accuracy in diagnosing the coronary artery stenosis of type I-II calcified plaques, but has a significant decrease in specificity, PPV and accuracy in type III-IV calcified plaque."

A mathematical model of the insulin signaling network (ISN) is proposed and used to investigate the dose-response curves of components of this network. Experimental data of C2C12 myoblasts with phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) suppressed and data of L6 myotubes with induced insulin resistance have been analyzed by the model. We focused particularly on single and double Akt phosphorylation and pointed out insulin signaling changes related to insulin resistance. Moreover, a new characterization of the upstream signaling of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is presented. As it is widely recognized that ISN proteins have a crucial role also in cell proliferation and death, the ISN model was linked to a cell population model and applied to data of a cell line of acute myeloid leukemia treated with a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor with antitumor activity. The analysis revealed simple relationships among the concentrations of ISN proteins and the parameters of the cell population model that characterize cell cycle progression and cell death."

First, the iron-ferric uptake regulator (Fur) complex directly binds to qrr promoter regions, inhibiting LuxO activation by competing with LuxO for cis-acting DNA elements. Second, qrr transcription is repressed by iron independently of Fur. Third, LuxO expression is repressed by iron independently of Fur. We also found that, under iron-limiting conditions, the five Qrrs functioned additively, not redundantly, to repress SmcR, suggesting that cells lacking iron enter a high cell density mode earlier and could thereby modulate expression of virulence factors sooner.

Growth hormone (GH) is a major metabolic homeostatic factor that is secreted with a circadian pattern, but whether it is synthesized rhythmically is unknown. We used transgenic mice containing the human (h) GH gene (hGH1) locus to investigate the rhythmicity of hGH synthesis and secretion and to show that RNA and secreted protein levels oscillate over a 24-h cycle. Analysis of hGH1 promoter sequences revealed an enhancer motif (E-box) element that binds the circadian transcriptional machinery (Bmal1 and Clock). Furthermore, Bmal1/Clock were able to transactivate the hGH1 promoter, and mutation of this E-box element adversely affected basal activity after gene transfer. The ability of Bmal1 to bind the hGH1 promoter region containing the E-box element was confirmed in the hGH1 transgenic mouse pituitary in situ. Occupancy was reduced in mice fed a high fat diet during the light (inactive) stage of the daily cycle in mice and corresponded to a decrease in hGH1 RNA levels. The decreases in occupancy and RNA levels were not seen, however, during the dark (active) stage. A chromatin loop required for efficient postnatal hGH1 expression was negatively affected by the high fat diet in the light but not dark stage similar to the pattern observed with Bmal1 association with the promoter region.

https://openalex.org/W2362231528,"Natural genetic transformation is a transient, rapidly progressing energy-consuming process characterized by expression of the transformasome and competence-associated regulatory genes. This transient state is tightly controlled to avoid potentially adverse effects of genetic recombination on genome integrity during cell division. We investigated the global response of Streptococcus suis to exposure to the SigX competence-inducing peptide (XIP), and thus to the activation of the competence machinery, using time series analysis together with PCA analysis, gene clustering followed by heatmap visualisation, and GO enrichment analysis. We explored the possible regulatory link between metabolism and competence, and predicted the physiological adaptation of S. suis during competence induction, progression and exit using transcriptome analysis. We showed that competence development is associated with a suppression of basal metabolism, which may have consequences for the microbe's resilience to fluctuations in the environment, as competence is costly in terms of use of energy and protein translation. Furthermore our data suggest that several basal metabolic pathways are incompatible with activation of competence in S. suis. This study also showed that targeting specific pathways during the development of competence, might render S. suis more vulnerable toward novel antibiotic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2365469421,"Purpose Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) during partial nephrectomy (PN) contributes to acute kidney injury (AKI), which is inaccurately assessed using existent clinical markers of renal function. We evaluated I/R-related changes in expression in hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), within kidney tissue and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) in a porcine model of PN. Materials and Methods Three adult pigs each underwent unilateral renal hilar cross clamping for 180 min followed by a 15 min reperfusion. The contralateral kidney served as control. Biopsies of clamped kidneys were obtained at baseline (time 0), every 60 min during the hypoxic phase, and post-reperfusion. Control kidneys were biopsied once at 180 min. Peripheral blood was sampled at time 0, every 30 min during the hypoxic phase, and post-reperfusion. HIF-1α and TLR4 expression in kidney tissue and PBL were analyzed by Western blotting. I/R-related histological changes were assessed. Results Expression of HIF-1α in clamped kidneys and PBL was below detection level at baseline, rising to detectable levels after 60 min of hypoxia, and continuing to rise throughout the hypoxic and reperfusion phases. Expression of TLR-4 in clamped kidneys followed a similar trend with initial detection after 30–60 min of hypoxia. Control kidneys exhibited no change in HIF-1α or TLR-4 expression. I/R-related histologic changes were minimal, primarily mild tubular dilatation. Conclusions In a porcine model of PN, HIF-1α and TLR4 exhibited robust, I/R-related increases in expression in kidney tissue and PBL. Further studies investigating these molecules as potential markers of AKI are warranted."

Numerous poxviruses encode structural and functional homologs of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, and vaccinia virus harbors antiapoptotic F1L that potently inhibits the mitochondrial apoptotic checkpoint.

Using a reconstituted caspase inhibition assay in yeast we found that unlike AcP35, a well characterized caspase-9 inhibitor from the insect virus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus, F1L does not prevent caspase-9-mediated yeast cell death. Furthermore, we found that deletion of the F1L N-terminal region does not impede F1L antiapoptotic activity in the context of a viral infection. Solution analysis of the F1L N-terminal regions using small angle x-ray scattering indicates that the region of F1L spanning residues 1–50 located N-terminally from the Bcl-2 fold is an intrinsically unstructured region. We conclude that the N terminus of F1L is not involved in apoptosis inhibition and may act as a regulatory element in other signaling pathways in a manner reminiscent of other unstructured regulatory elements commonly found in mammalian prosurvival Bcl-2 members including Bcl-xL and Mcl-1.

In its entirety, F1L from vaccinia virus (MVA) comprises 222 residues of which only residues 57–190 form the canonical Bcl-2-like domain. Although no experimental structural data are available for the N-terminal region of F1L, recent biochemical studies suggested a role in caspase inhibition for the N-terminal region preceding the Bcl-2 fold (51Zhai D.

Subsequent molecular modeling proposed the formation of two α helical segments (1Yu E. Zhai D. Jin C. Gerlic M. Reed J.C. Liddington R.

The coding sequence corresponding to MVA F1L amino acids 1–202 (UniProt accession number O57173) was cloned into the pETDuet-1 vector. Protein expression was induced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested and lysed using 0.2-mm silica beads in a FastPrep instrument (MP Biomedicals) for 4 × 20-s cycles. Cellular debris was removed via centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min and filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter. MVA F1L was purified with 2 × 1-ml HiTrap column charged with nickel (GE Healthcare). The protein was further purified via size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare) into a final buffer of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT. MVA F1L protein was concentrated to 3.9 mg/ml, flash frozen, and stored at 193 K. Synchrotron x-ray scattering data were collected from 50-μl samples of thawed MVA F1L(1–202) protein (including an N-terminal purification tag with the sequence MGSSHHHHHHSQDP) in capillary tubes at the SAXS/WAXS beamline of the Australian Synchrotron using a Pilatus-1M detector. The scattering was measured with exposure times of 1 s at 12 keV at a temperature of ∼286 K with protein concentrations ranging from 3.6 to 0.12 mg/ml in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, NaCl 150 mm, 5 mm DTT. The sample to detector distance was 1575 mm, and the momentum transfer range was 0.01 < s < 0.5 Å−1 at 12 keV. Constant water scattering was determined by subtracting the scattering of an empty capillary from the scattering of a capillary filled with water. Normalization was achieved via integrating the beam stop. To control for radiation damage, the samples were measured in a 1.5-mm quartz capillary and flowed past the beam while measuring 18 × 1 s on samples and blanks (gel filtration buffer and water). The scattering images were integrated, averaged, and calibrated against water using software specific to the beamline (53Kirby N.M. Cowieson N.P.

Both models were generated using a known crystal structure of MVA F1L (Protein Data Bank code 4d2m) lacking 50 amino acids at the N terminus and 15 amino acids at the C terminus. P2 symmetry was imposed to generate a dimer, and the scattering curve of the 1.80 mg/ml data was used. 14 residues were added to the sequence of F1L corresponding to the pDuet purification tag. The MVA F1L coordinate file was prepared for rigid body modeling using Coot (57Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303α cells were transformed with either pGALL(LEU2), pGALL(LEU2)-HA-Bax, or pGALL(LEU2)-His6-Bak or co-transformed with pGALL(HIS3)-Apaf-1(1–530), pGALL(LEU2)-caspase-9, and pGALL(URA3)-caspase-3 or the corresponding empty vectors. Yeast bearing these plasmids were then transformed with either pGALL(TRP1), pGALL(TRP1)Bcl-xL, pGALL(TRP1)-VACV(COP)F1L, or pGALL(TRP1)-AcP35. The pGALL(TRP1) and pGALL(LEU2) vectors place genes under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. Cells were spotted as 5-fold serial dilutions onto medium containing 2% (w/v) galactose (inducing), which induces protein expression, or 2% (w/v) glucose (repressing), which prevents protein expression, as described previously (59Jabbour A.M.

FLAG-F1L(43–226), FLAG-F1L(50–226), and FLAG-F1L(60–226) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using codon-optimized pcDNA3-FLAG-F1L as a template and Pwo (Pyrococcus woesei) polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The forward primers used, all containing a BamHI restriction site, were 5′-GGATCCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGAGAACATGGTGTACCGGTTC-3′ for FLAG-F1L(43–226), 5′-GGATCCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGACAAGTCTACCAATATCCTG-3′ for FLAG-F1L(50–226), and 5′-GGATCCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGAGCACCGAGCGGGACCACGTG-3′ for FLAG-F1L(60–226).

https://openalex.org/W2346195618,"The epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a reservoir of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), with as yet unknown effects on myocardial and coronary arteries homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the angiogenic function of epicardial ASCs and their regulation by the common cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) affecting heart disease. Epicardial fat was obtained from a rodent model with clustering of CVRFs [Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF)-Leprfa] rats and from their lean control (ZDF-Crl) littermates without CVRFs, ASCs were isolated, and their function was assessed by proliferation and differentiation assays, flow cytometry, gene expression, and in vivo Matrigel angiogenesis analysis. Epicardial ASCs from both groups showed adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity; however, epicardial ASCs from CVRF animals had a lesser ability to form tubular structures in vitro after endothelial differentiation, as well as a reduced angiogenic potential in vivo compared to control animals. Epicardial ASCs from CVRF rats showed up-regulation of the downstream Notch signaling genes Hes7, Hey1, and Heyl compared with control animals. The inhibition of Notch signaling by conditioning epicardial ASCs from CVRF animals with a γ-secretase inhibitor induced a reduction in Hes/Hey gene expression and rescued their angiogenic function in vivo. We report for the first time the impact of CVRF burden on the ASCs of EAT and that the defective function is in part caused by increased Notch signaling. Conditioning ASCs by blocking Notch signaling rescues their angiogenic potential.—Bejar, M. T., Ferrer-Lorente, R., Peña, E., Badimon, L.

https://openalex.org/W2347052560,"DNA sequencing by imaging in an electron microscope is an approach that holds promise to deliver long reads with low error rates and without the need for amplification. Earlier work using transmission electron microscopes, which use high electron energies on the order of 100 keV, has shown that low contrast and radiation damage necessitates the use of heavy atom labeling of individual nucleotides, which increases the read error rates. Other prior work using scattering electrons with much lower energy has shown to suppress beam damage on DNA. Here we explore possibilities to increase contrast by employing two methods, X-ray photoelectron and Auger electron spectroscopy. Using bulk DNA samples with monomers of each base, both methods are shown to provide contrast mechanisms that can distinguish individual nucleotides without labels. Both spectroscopic techniques can be readily implemented in a low energy electron microscope, which may enable label-free DNA sequencing by direct imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2347123879,"L-forms are cell wall-deficient variants of otherwise walled bacteria that maintain the ability to survive and proliferate in absence of the surrounding peptidoglycan sacculus. While transient or unstable L-forms can revert to the walled state and may still rely on residual peptidoglycan synthesis for multiplication, stable L-forms cannot revert to the walled form and are believed to propagate in the complete absence of peptidoglycan. L-forms are increasingly studied as a fundamental biological model system for cell wall synthesis. Here, we show that a stable L-form of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes features a surprisingly intact peptidoglycan synthesis pathway including glycosyl transfer, in spite of the accumulation of multiple mutations during prolonged passage in the cell wall-deficient state. Microscopic and biochemical analysis revealed the presence of peptidoglycan precursors and functional glycosyl transferases, resulting in the formation of peptidoglycan polymers but without the synthesis of a mature cell wall sacculus. In conclusion, we found that stable, non-reverting L-forms, which do not require active PG synthesis for proliferation, may still continue to produce aberrant peptidoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2345715893,"Enrolling cancer patients in phase I clinical trials (P1s) requires that they fulfill specific criteria. Between the time they sign the consent form and the 1st administration of the experimental drug, some patients may be excluded and considered as screen failures (SFs). Our objective was to assess SF patients profiles and the reasons and risk factors for SFs.All patients included in P1s at Gustave Roussy from 2008 to 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. SFs were matched with control P1 patients who were successfully enrolled. Patient and tumor characteristics, P1 types and the reasons for SF were analyzed.Among 1,293 patients, 192 (15%) were SF cases; 182 SF cases were matched with 182 controls: median age was 57 (48-64) and 55 (47-63), median home-cancer center distance was 69 vs 55 km, 45% vs 34% had more than 2 metastatic sites, median screening period was 14 vs 11 days, median progression-free survival during the previous line was 12 vs 14 weeks, 37% vs 29% of LDH values were above the upper limit of normal, 42% vs 36% of albumin values were < 35 g/L, respectively. Reasons for SFs were cancer progression (44%), sponsor decision unrelated to a clinical reason (25%), patient retrieval (13.5%), relevant comorbidity (13.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed that a high Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score was potentially associated with higher risk of SFs (OR = 2.3; 95% CI [1.0-5.7], p = 0.06).Cancer progression led to half of the SFs in P1s. Physicians should pay attention to the RMH score at the time of patient inclusion to avoid further SFs."
https://openalex.org/W2386205161,"We investigated the behavioral, respiratory, and thermoregulatory responses elicited by acute exposure to both hypercapnic and hypoxic environments in Wistar audiogenic rats (WARs). The WAR strain represents a genetic animal model of epilepsy.Behavioral analyses were performed using neuroethological methods, and flowcharts were constructed to illustrate behavioral findings. The body plethysmography method was used to obtain pulmonary ventilation (VE) measurements, and body temperature (Tb) measurements were taken via temperature sensors implanted in the abdominal cavities of the animals.No significant difference was observed between the WAR and Wistar control group with respect to the thermoregulatory response elicited by exposure to both acute hypercapnia and acute hypoxia (p>0.05). However, we found that the VE of WARs was attenuated relative to that of Wistar control animals during exposure to both hypercapnic (WAR: 133 ± 11% vs. Wistar: 243 ± 23%, p<0.01) and hypoxic conditions (WAR: 138 ± 8% vs. Wistar: 177 ± 8%; p<0.01). In addition, we noted that this ventilatory attenuation was followed by alterations in the behavioral responses of these animals.Our results indicate that WARs, a genetic model of epilepsy, have important alterations in their ability to compensate for changes in levels of various arterial blood gasses. WARs present an attenuated ventilatory response to an increased PaCO2 or decreased PaO2, coupled to behavioral changes, which make them a suitable model to further study respiratory risks associated to epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2345571239,"Glycopeptides such as vancomycin and telavancin are essential for treating infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. But the dwindling availability of new antibiotics and the emergence of resistant bacteria are making effective antibiotic treatment increasingly difficult. Ramoplanin, an inhibitor of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, is a highly effective antibiotic against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-intermediate resistant Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. Here, two tailoring enzyme genes in the biosynthesis of ramoplanin were deleted by double in-frame gene knockouts to produce new ramoplanin derivatives. The deschlororamoplanin A2 aglycone was purified and its structure was identified with LC-MS/MS. Deschlororamoplanin A2 aglycone and ramoplanin aglycone showed similar activity to ramoplanin A2. The results showed that α-1,2-dimannosyl disaccharide at Hpg11 and chlorination at Chp17 in the ramoplanin structure are not essential for its antimicrobial activity. This work provides new precursor compounds for the semisynthetic modification of ramoplanin."
https://openalex.org/W2346106765,"The Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (or CASP) is a community-wide blind test experiment to reveal the best accomplishments of structure modeling. Assessors have been using the Global Distance Test (GDT_TS) measure to quantify prediction performance since CASP3 in 1998. However, identifying significant score differences between close models is difficult because of the lack of uncertainty estimations for this measure. Here, we utilized the atomic fluctuations caused by structure flexibility to estimate the uncertainty of GDT_TS scores. Structures determined by nuclear magnetic resonance are deposited as ensembles of alternative conformers that reflect the structural flexibility, whereas standard X-ray refinement produces the static structure averaged over time and space for the dynamic ensembles. To recapitulate the structural heterogeneous ensemble in the crystal lattice, we performed time-averaged refinement for X-ray datasets to generate structural ensembles for our GDT_TS uncertainty analysis. Using those generated ensembles, our study demonstrates that the time-averaged refinements produced structure ensembles with better agreement with the experimental datasets than the averaged X-ray structures with B-factors. The uncertainty of the GDT_TS scores, quantified by their standard deviations (SDs), increases for scores lower than 50 and 70, with maximum SDs of 0.3 and 1.23 for X-ray and NMR structures, respectively. We also applied our procedure to the high accuracy version of GDT-based score and produced similar results with slightly higher SDs. To facilitate score comparisons by the community, we developed a user-friendly web server that produces structure ensembles for NMR and X-ray structures and is accessible at http://prodata.swmed.edu/SEnCS. Our work helps to identify the significance of GDT_TS score differences, as well as to provide structure ensembles for estimating SDs of any scores."
https://openalex.org/W2347939291,"There are several hypotheses about the possible functions of the postpharyngeal gland (PPG) in ants. The proposed functions include roles as cephalic or gastric caeca and diverticulum of the digestive tract, mixing of hydrocarbons, nestmate recognition, feeding larvae, and the accumulation of lipids inside this gland, whose origin is contradictory. The current study aimed to investigate the functions of these glands by examining the protein expression profile of the PPGs of Atta sexdens rubropilosa (Hymenoptera, Formicidae). Mated females received lipid supplementation and their glands were extracted and analyzed using a proteomic approach. The protocol used combined two-dimensional electrophoresis and shotgun strategies, followed by mass spectrometry. We also detected lipid β-oxidation by immunofluorescent marking of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Supplying ants with lipids elicited responses in the glandular cells of the PPG; these included increased expression of proteins related to defense mechanisms and signal transduction and reorganization of the cytoskeleton due to cell expansion. In addition, some proteins in PPG were overexpressed, especially those involved in lipid and energy metabolism. Part of the lipids may be reduced, used for the synthesis of fatty alcohol, transported to the hemolymph, or may be used as substrate for the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, which is oxidized to form molecules that drive oxidative phosphorylation and produce energy for cellular metabolic processes. These findings suggest that this organ is specialized for lipid nutrition of adult leaf-cutting ants and characterized like a of diverticulum foregut, with the ability to absorb, store, metabolize, and mobilize lipids to the hemolymph. However, we do not rule out that the PPG may have other functions in other species of ants."
https://openalex.org/W2346379757,"This study compared the variability of 3D echo derived circumferential and longitudinal strain values computed from vendor-specific and vendor-independent analyses of images acquired using ultrasound systems from different vendors.Ten freshly harvested porcine hearts were studied. Each heart was mounted on a custom designed phantom and driven to simulate normal cardiac motion. Cardiac rotation was digitally controlled and held constant at 5°, while pumped stroke volume (SV) ranged from 30-70ml. Full-volume image data was acquired using three different ultrasound systems from different vendors. The image data was analyzed for longitudinal and circumferential strains (LS, CS) using both vendor-specific and vendor-independent analysis packages.Good linear relationships were observed for each vendor-specific analysis package for both CS and LS at the mid-anterior segment, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.82-0.91 (CS) and 0.86-0.89 (LS). Comparable linear regressions were observed for results determined by a vendor independent program (CS: R = 0.82-0.89; LS: R = 0.86-0.89). Variability between analysis packages was examined via a series of ANOVA tests. A statistical difference was found between vendor-specific analysis packages (p<0.001), while no such difference was observed between ultrasound systems when using the vendor-independent program (p>0.05).Circumferential and longitudinal regional strain values differ when quantified by vendor-specific analysis packages; however, this variability is mitigated by use of a vendor-independent quantification method. These results suggest that echocardiograms acquired using different ultrasound systems could be meaningfully compared using vendor-independent software."
