https://openalex.org/W1512899424,"Abstract An assay for measuring 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity over a wide range of substrate concentrations has been described. The ratio of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) to cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) hydrolysis varied several fold among crude subcellular fractions from bovine and rat heart when measured at micromolar but not millimolar substrate. In rat brain, liver or skeletal muscle, this ratio was virtually the same in crude subcellular fractions as in the homogenate when determined at either micromolar or millimolar substrate. A partially purified phosphodiesterase from the bovine heart supernatant had apparent Km values of 1 to 3 µm for cyclic GMP and 25 to 45 µm for cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP interfered with the hydrolysis of each other in a manner predictable on the basis of their apparent Km values, suggesting that this bovine heart preparation contained only a single phosphodiesterase. However, in a crude liver supernatant cyclic GMP stimulated rather than inhibited cyclic AMP hydrolysis. A crude particulate fraction from bovine heart had two apparent Km values for cyclic AMP of about 0.8 and 25 µm. Most, if not all, of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity in this fraction had an apparent Km of about 20 µm. Data obtained using the partially purified bovine heart enzyme indicate that both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP can serve as substrates for a single enzyme. However, differences in the ratios of hydrolysis of the two nucleotides among subcellular fractions and kinetic data suggest the existence of more than one 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase within a tissue. Whether these phosphodiesterase activities have relative substrate preferences or whether one or more might have specific substrate requirements has not been established."
https://openalex.org/W1577909961,"The relationship between ribonucleotide reductase and tumor growth rate was measured in a series of rat hepatomas of different growth rates. An excellent correlation was found between tumor growth rate and the specific activity of ribonucleotide reductase. Differences of 200-fold in enzyme specific activities exist between the very fast and the slow growing hepatomas. This represents the largest enhancement of any enzyme activity in these tumors. No activity was detected in either normal rat liver or liver from a tumor-bearing animal although 1/500 of the enzyme level in the rapid tumor could have been detected. The thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase complex which serves as the hydrogen donor for this reaction was eliminated as a contributory factor for these differences in activities because this complex is found at comparable levels in both fast growing tumor and normal liver extracts. Two other enzymes involved in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, thymidylate synthetase and thymidine kinase, did not exhibit such a close degree of correlation with tumor growth rate. Thymidylate synthetase activity was found to be less markedly enhanced with only a 15- to 20-fold difference between the slow and fast growing tumors. Thymidine kinase exhibited differences of activity of approximately 40-fold. These data, as well as other evidence, indicate that the ribonucleotide reductase reaction is a rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis and cell division and that enzyme synthesis and degradation may be involved in control of this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1517972603,"Abstract A procedure is described for preparing sacs of plasma membrane from free fat cells. The resultant spherical were essentially devoid of fat and contained 25% of the mitochondria, 2% of the soluble glycolytic enzymes measured (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose 1,6-diphosphate aldolase, lactic dehydrogenase), and 15% of the hexokinase activity originally present in fat cells. A large fraction of the hexokinase activity was associated with particles. Some ghosts were nucleated, but all contained undefined particles and vesicles. The plasma membrane of ghosts was semipermeable to ions and sucrose and thus retained some of the characteristics of permeability shown by the plasma membrane of intact fat cells. Adenyl cyclase activity was found in ghosts and in a particulate fraction containing mitochondria released during lysis of fat cells. Ghosts contained 62% of the adenyl cyclase activity, with specific activities that averaged 2.5 times that found in the mitochondrial fraction. The enzyme was not dissociated from membranes by sonic oscillation. Adrenocorticotropin stimulated adenyl cyclase activity in both ghosts and mitochondria fractions, the effect of the hormone being greater on ghosts."
https://openalex.org/W1495200985,"Abstract GSH peroxidase has been purified approximately 2500-fold from pig's blood. With cumene hydroperoxide as substrate, kinetic analysis on the purified enzyme gave nonlinear Lineweaver-Burk plots for the hydroperoxide substrate. Linear Lineweaver-Burk plots were obtained for GSH and a limiting Km value of approximately 3 mm was obtained for GSH. A limited analysis of the rate data has been carried out and a tentative mechanism for GSH peroxidase is given. A wide range of nucleotides inhibited the enzyme, with pyrimidine nucleotides being the most effective. Also, the inhibitory effectiveness increased with the number of phosphate groups in the nucleotide. Nucleotide inhibition was competitive with respect to GSH whereas increased levels of hydroperoxide enhanced the inhibition. The sensitivity of the enzyme to nucleotide inhibition could be substantially decreased by x-ray, ethanol, or trypsin treatment, or aging with a lesser decrease of catalytic activity. Conversely, heat, p-chloromercuribenzoate, or sodium lauryl sulfate preferentially abolished the catalytic function with a lesser effect on the nucleotide response. It was concluded that nucleotides interact with the enzyme at a site other than the active center and hence that GSH peroxidase is an allosteric enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1503716838,"Abstract Cellular pools of dATP and dTTP were determined during the growth of secondary cultures of mouse embryo cells with a recently developed, highly sensitive enzymatic method. During the most active phase of DNA synthesis, the cells contained approximately 2.5 pmoles of dATP and 3.0 pmoles of dTTP per µg of DNA. Later, during growth, these values decreased to between one-half and one-third. The pools of the two nucleotides were calculated to suffice for about 2 to 4 min of DNA synthesis. After 3 days of incubation in a medium containing limiting (0.5%) serum, the cells attained a low resting level of DNA synthesis, and the pool sizes of both nucleotides dropped to around 0.5 pmole per µg of DNA. A wave of DNA synthesis was triggered after a well defined lag phase, either by raising the serum concentration of the medium to 10% or by infecting the cells with polyoma virus. With both procedures, the pools of dATP and dTTP, which increased in parallel with the rate of DNA synthesis, reached a maximum either simultaneously with or just after the peak of DNA synthesis. In no case was there a demonstrable increase in pool sizes before the onset of DNA synthesis; in fact, in the case of the dTTP pool, a decrease was observed. After serum stimulation, the activities of ribonucleotide reductase and thymidine kinase increased about 7- and 100-fold, respectively. These shifts in enzyme activities, as well as changes in pool size of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, demonstrate a striking parallelism between the stimulatory effects of serum and polyoma virus infection on the initiation of DNA synthesis in mouse embryo cellS."

https://openalex.org/W1536293670,"The conditions necessary for the formation and detection of a ribosome-G factor (the soluble translocation protein)-GDP complex in the presence of fusidic acid have been examined. Complex detection has been accomplished by sucrose density gradient sedimentation and both gel and Millipore filtration. The latter two methods reveal a good correlation, as a function of fusidic acid concentration, between the amount of isolatable complex and the inhibition of the GTPase activity of the G factor-ribosome system by the antibiotic. Complex formation requires Mg2+ (10 to 20 mm) but apparently does not require a monovalent cation. The binding of nucleotide requires and is limited by both ribosomes and G factor. An examination of the stoichiometry of complex formation was carried out by varying ribosomes and G factor. The results of these experiments, on the basis of certain assumptions, are interpreted to indicate the formation, in the presence of fusidic acid, of a relatively stable ternary complex involving ribosomes, G factor, and GDP in a molar ratio of 1:1:1."

https://openalex.org/W1530853196,"Abstract The regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity was studied in rat adipocytes. Incubation of fat cells for 60 min in buffer without glucose and insulin resulted in a 50% decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity. This decrease was prevented by glucose and insulin. Inhibition of fat cell protein synthesis by cycloheximide abolished the effect of glucose and insulin and caused a rapid decay of lipoprotein lipase activity (T½ = 24 min). Lipolytic concentrations of N6, O2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP) in the presence of glucose and insulin decreased fat cell lipoprotein lipase activity and also decreased the rate of l-leucine-1-14C incorporation into fat cell protein. A close correlation (r = .95) was found between changes in the rate of protein synthesis and changes in lipoprotein lipase activity caused by lipolytic agents, cycloheximide, and by the omission of glucose and insulin. Incubation with dibutyryl cAMP decreased fat cell ATP content. In the presence of glucose and insulin this occurred without an intracellular accumulation of fatty acid, and it is suggested that the decrease was due to consumption of ATP by the process of re-esterification of fatty acids. Thus the decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity caused by lipolytic hormones could be the last step in a series of events. Activation of lipolysis with re-esterification of some of the fatty acids results in an increased consumption of ATP, and therefore the ATP available for protein synthesis is limited. This leads to a decrease in the rate of protein synthesis and then, because of the rapid decay of this enzyme, to a decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1497726088,"Abstract The molecular weight of a DPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase preparation, exhibiting a single major band on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, has been examined by molecular sieve chromatography. Comparison of the elution volume (Ve) of the enzyme with reference proteins of known molecular weight on columns of Sephadex G-200 and Sepharose 6B permitted calculation of a molecular weight in the range 290,000 to 365,000. Inclusion of the positive modifier ADP (0.035 mm to 1.0 mm) in the eluting buffer (0.15 m potassium phosphate-0.1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.2) of columns of Sepharose 6B revealed an aggregate of the enzyme of molecular weight 670,000 ± 20,000; a species of apparent molecular weight 1,100,000 was observed with 0.8 m ammonium sulfate-5 mm potassium phosphate-0.1 mm dithiothreitol buffer (pH 7.1) containing 0.05 mm to 1.0 mm ADP. Aggregate formation is dependent on protein concentration. Thus, a monomer-dimer equilibrium could be shown when varying amounts of the enzyme were chromatographed on Sepharose 6B in 0.1 mm ADP-0.15 m potassium phosphate-0.1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.2. The limiting values of molecular weight were 330,000 and 680,000 at low and high protein concentrations, respectively. The dissociation constant of the monomer-dimer equilibrium was found to be K = 0.25 ± 0.12 mg per ml. The electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate at pH 7.1 or 8 m urea at pH 2.9 indicated polypeptide chains of average molecular weight 40,800 ± 500; a value of 40,900 ± 700 was obtained by chromatography on Bio-Gel A-5 M in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. This suggests that the enzymically active monomer of molecular weight 330,000 is composed of eight subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1557353406,"Abstract A study was made of the effects of insulin, lipolytic hormones, and theophylline on transport and metabolism of glucose in prepared from isolated fat cells of rat adipose tissue. The ghosts consist of sacs of plasma membrane containing a small amount of cytoplasmic components and enzymes of fat cells. Insulin stimulated, by 30 to 70%, carrier-mediated glucose transport and metabolism of glucose to CO2, glyceride glycerol, and fatty acids over the same dose response range (10 to 1000 microunits per ml) as reported for free fat cells. Potassium ion was essential for insulin-stimulated glucose transport. A particulate fraction (10,000 x g sediment) which did not contain ghosts oxidized glucose but did not respond to insulin. This is suggestive evidence that the plasma membrane of ghosts is necessary for the response to insulin. Because of the absence of fat, lipolysis was not detectable in ghosts even when they were incubated in the presence of lipolytic hormones (adrenocorticotropin, epinephrine, glucagon) or theophylline. These lipolytic agents caused a 30 to 60% reduction in basal glucose utilization, primarily glyceride synthesis, but did not block insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation. Conversely, maximal concentrations of insulin did not block the inhibitory effects of submaximal concentrations of the lipolytic agents on basal glucose utilization. The common effects of lipolytic hormones and theophylline suggested that their inhibitory effect on glucose metabolism was mediated by cyclic 3',5'-AMP. Since the lipolytic agents did not block insulin-stimulated glucose utilization (or transport), it was concluded that cyclic 3',5'-AMP may inhibit basal glucose metabolism but is not involved in the action of insulin on glucose transport."

https://openalex.org/W2071685954,"Action potentials of cerebellar Purkinje cells were observed in intact monkeys during sleep and waking. Purkinje cells exhibit two sorts of action potentials, called simple and complex spikes, and these two sorts of spikes were differently affected by sleep. Simple-spike activity (generated by the parallel fiber inputs to the Purkinje cell) was highest during sleep with rapid eye movements as compared with both waking and sleep with electroencephalographic slow waves. In contrast, complex-spike activity (generated by the climbing fiber inputs to the Purkinje cell) was lowest during sleep with rapid eye movements. The complex action potential of the Purkinje cell consists of an initial large spike followed by one or more smaller secondary spikes, and the number of these secondary spikes was found to be independent of the background discharge frequency of the simple spike. This independence suggests a possible role of presynaptic factors rather than the excitability level of the Purkinje cell itself in determining the number of secondary discharges occurring in the complex spike."
https://openalex.org/W1573792845,"Abstract The effect of steroid substrate addition on the visible absorption and electron spin resonance (ESR) properties of cytochrome P450 was studied in bovine adrenal cortex submitochondrial particles. The interaction of 11-deoxycortisol or deoxycorticosterone produced peaks at 385, 500, and 645 nm and troughs at 420, 535, and 570 nm. 20α-Hydroxycholesterol produced opposite spectral effects. 11-Deoxycortisol or deoxycorticosterone decreased and 20α-hydroxycholesterol increased the g = 2.42, 2.26, and 1.91 low spin signals of P450. The spectral dissociation constants for the visible absorption changes, ESR changes, and Km values for these substrates were similar. A g = 7.9 ESR signal was found in these submitochondrial particles. The height of this signal was increased by deoxycorticosterone and decreased by 20α-hydroxycholesterol interaction. The g = 7.9 signal was not altered by 9 mm cyanide or 100 mm fluoride but was abolished by deoxycholate conversion of P450 to P420 and by dithionite reduction. The substrate-induced changes in the visible absorption and ESR properties of P450 are consistent with a deoxycorticosterone- or 11-deoxycortisol-induced low to high spin transition and a 20α-hydroxycholesterol high to low spin transition of the Fe3+ in P450. The disappearance of the g = 7.9 signal with deoxycholate treatment and the inverse relationship between the steroid-induced changes in the g = 7.9 and the low spin signals suggest that the g = 7.9 signal is a high spin P450. Since all steroid substrates of P450, with the exception of 20α-hydroxycholesterol, produce low to high spin spectral changes, this electronic effect may be important in the enzyme reaction mechanism. Cholesterol was found to inhibit competitively the 20α-hydroxycholesterol-induced difference spectrum, indicating that 20α- and 22R-hydroxylations occur at the same enzyme site. The exceptional electronic effects of 20α-hydroxycholesterol may be explained by its role as an enzyme-bound intermediate of cholesterol oxidation or by its ability to displace cholesterol from cholesterol oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1531501309,"Infection of Escherichia coli B with T4 amber mutants in gene 56 fails to cause the appearance of either deoxycytidine triphosphatase or deoxycytidine diphosphatase, and little or no DNA synthesis results. Infection of E. coli B with a 7:3 mixture of a gene 56 amber mutant and wild type T4 results in the appearance of only 30% as much dCTPase activity as normal but gives a 100% yield of mixed phage. This indicates that dCTPase is present in at least a 3-fold excess in the wild type infection. Escherichia coli W4597, shown by others to support the synthesis by wild type T4 of DNA in which the hydroxymethylcytosine is virtually unglucosylated, also fails to support the synthesis of DNA upon infection with a gene 56 amber mutant. This and other evidence indicate that in T4 DNA a crucial function of hydroxymethylcytosine, whether glucosylated or not, is the protection of progeny phage DNA against nuclease activity that degrades the cytosine-containing DNA of the host."
https://openalex.org/W1483634131,"Abstract Phosphofructokinase from sheep heart was desensitized to ATP inhibition by photo-oxidation of the enzyme in the presence of methylene blue. Amino acid analyses were performed on native and photo-oxidized enzyme. The results showed that of a total of 18.2 moles of histidine per 105 g of enzyme an average of 3 was lost after photo-oxidation. The total number of cysteine residues was reduced from an average of 14.0 to 6.6 moles/105 g of enzyme following such treatment. No other amino acid was affected by photo-oxidation with the possible exception of methionine. The allosteric kinetics of phosphofructokinase was studied after treatment with ethoxyformic anhydride at pH 6.1. Evidence that the reagent reacted with histidine residues came from spectrophotometric studies and from the fact that the reaction could be reversed with hydroxylamine at neutral pH. Spectrophotometric determination of the product of the reaction, N-ethoxyformyl histidine, agreed well with 14C-ethoxyformyl groups formed in the protein in the range of 0 to 4 moles of product per 105 g of enzyme. At pH 8.2, the kinetics of the enzyme containing 3.5 moles of ethoxyformylated residues per 105 g of protein was indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme except for a 22 to 44% decrease in Vmax. However, at pH 6.9, the kinetics of the same derivative was characterized by (a) a loss of sensitivity to inhibition by ATP, (b) a loss of cooperativity with fructose-6-P, and (c) a decrease in sensitivity to inhibition by citrate and to activation by AMP or 3',5'-cyclic AMP. The degree of loss of these regulatory properties was dependent on the extent of modification of the enzyme. Maximum desensitization occurred when 3 to 4 moles of the anhydride reacted per 105 g of protein. Brief treatment of ethoxyformylated enzyme with neutral hydroxylamine resulted in enzyme indistinguishable from the native protein on the basis of catalytic activity and sensitivity to ATP inhibition. Ethoxyformylation of the enzyme was normally carried out in the presence of ATP and fructose-1,6-di-P. However, the effects of the anhydride on the enzyme were the same when the incubation was carried out in the absence of these compounds. Incubation of ethoxyformylated phosphofructokinase in mild acid resulted in loss of activity similar to that observed with native enzyme. The behavior of ethoxyformylated phosphofructokinase on sucrose gradients was identical with that of native enzyme in the presence of ATP or fructose-6-P. However, in the absence of substrates, the ethoxyformylated protein was somewhat more aggregated than the native enzyme. The properties of ethoxyformylated phosphofructokinase are compared to those of photo-oxidized enzyme. It is probable that alteration of histidine residues in both cases is largely responsible for the loss of the allosteric properties of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1490301002,"Abstract 1. The reaction of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase (coupling factor 1) with iodine resulted in rapid loss of ATPase activity, disappearance of sulfhydryl groups, binding of iodine to the protein, and partial dissociation of the molecule. The extent of the changes observed depended on the molar ratio of iodine to protein in the reaction mixture. At a molar ratio of 50, more than 99% of the ATPase activity was inhibited, about 20 atoms of iodine were bound per mole of enzyme and about 40% of the original protein (s20,w = 11.9 S) was converted to a subunit with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.5 S. 2. The iodinated enzyme, which contained less than 0.5% of the original ATPase activity, stimulated oxidative phosphorylation, the 32Pi-ATP exchange reaction and the ATP-dependent reduction of DPN catalyzed by submitochondrial particles which were partially but not completely devoid of coupling factor 1. 3. Reaction of coupling factor 1 with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide also resulted in virtually complete inhibition of ATPase activity. The inhibition was not accompanied by dissociation of the molecule or change in sulfhydryl content. Similar to the iodine-treated enzyme, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-treated coupling factor 1 stimulated oxidative phosphorylation only in submitochondrial particles which contained endogenous coupling factor 1. 4. The failure of chemically modified ATPase to stimulate coupled phosphorylation in submitochondrial particles completely resolved with respect to coupling factor 1 supports the suggestion of a dual role of the coupling factor in oxidative phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2120569989,"A procedure for the preparation of highly purified phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase from Escherichia coli is described. The purified enzyme is markedly stabilized against inactivation by high concentrations of sucrose and is susceptible to inactivation by sulfhydryl reagents. The binding of the activating manganous ion to the dephosphoenzyme was investigated by electron spin resonance and proton relaxation rate of water. The proton relaxation rate of water was enhanced 12 times relative to the Mn2+ aquo-ion. Addition of pyruvate decreased the enhancement, indicating the formation of a dephosphoenzyme-manganese-pyruvate complex. On the basis of a molecular weight of 250,000 it was calculated that 3 to 4 moles of Mn2+ were bound per mole of enzyme with K d ≅ 30 µ m . The phosphate content of phosphoenzyme whether prepared from ATP or phosphoenolpyruvate was 1 to 2 moles of phosphate per mole of enzyme. Initial velocity studies of the forward reaction indicate that an irreversible step occurs between the binding of MgATP to the enzyme and the binding of pyruvate. MgATP and pyruvate combine with the dephospho- and the phosphoenzyme form, respectively, to form kinetically active complexes; the Michaelis constants are K m g atp = 28 µ m and Kpyruvate = 20 µ m at 5 m m free Mg2+. A requirement for free divalent metal ion (Mg2+ or Mn2+) in addition to that bound to ATP was indicated by the kinetic studies and was implicated in the binding of pyruvate to the enzyme. At high concentrations of free Mg2+ and Mn2+, the reaction is inhibited. Ca2+ is not an activator but inhibits the Mn2+-activated reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1593323824,"Abstract A procedure is described by which the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-lipoyl transsuccinylase portion of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of cauliflower mitochondria has been purified to a specific activity g3. The enzymatic activity is totally dependent on α-ketoglutarate, DPN, reduced CoA, thiamine pyrophosphate, Mg2+ or Ca2+, and lipoyl dehydrogenase. Either cauliflower or pig heart lipoyl dehydrogenase will couple with the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-lipoyl transsuccinylase complex to produce DPNH and succinyl-CoA. Because the cauliflower enzyme as prepared has a requirement for both thiamine-PPi and Mg2+, it was possible to show that the enzyme binds magnesium-thiamine-PPi rather than free Mg2+ and free thiamine-PPi. The enzyme-magnesium-thiamine-PPi complex is relatively stable, with a half-life of about 2 min. The Km for magnesium-thiamine-PPi determined on the basis of initial rates was 8.5 x 10-6 m, while the Km determined by measurement of the length of the lag between the addition of magnesium-thiamine-PPi and the initiation of the reaction was 6.1 x 10-6 m. This close agreement supports the conclusion that the lag phase found when the reaction is initiated with magnesium-thiamine-PPi is due to the slow formation of the enzyme-magnesium-thiamine-PPi complex. As usually isolated, the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-lipoyl transsuccinylase complex activity is apparently limited by an inadequate level of lipoyl dehydrogenase still complexed with the other two enzymes. When the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-lipoyl transsuccinylase was isolated completely free of lipoyl dehydrogenase, it was possible to saturate this complex by the addition of lipoyl dehydrogenase either from cauliflower or from pig heart. When the lipoyl dehydrogenase is present in excess it is possible accurately to determine the kinetic parameters for the substrates and cofactors of the complex."

https://openalex.org/W2147893382,"Abstract Using the valyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli Km, Ki, and Vmax values have been determined for a variety of potential amino acid substrates and structural analogues of these potential substrates using the ATP:32PPi exchange reaction. Using these kinetic constants, comparisons have been made concerning (a) the relative binding affinity of the enzyme for amino acids and their analogues in the initial binding or recognition reaction, and (b) the relative effectiveness of these same amino acids and analogues in supporting the exchange reaction. It was found that the enzyme had a broader specificity in the initial binding reaction than in the carboxyl activation reaction. Notably, the stereospecificity in the activation reaction appeared to be absolute while it was considerably less than absolute in the binding reaction. The degree of stereospecificity in the binding reaction appeared to be related to the size and structure of the aliphatic alkyl group of the bound amino acid. In the case of valine, the binding affinity was about 50 times greater for the l isomer than for the d isomer; however, in the cases of alanine and α-aminobutyric acid, where the aliphatic alkyl group is smaller than that of valine, there appeared to be a preference for the d isomer in the binding reaction. The presence of an α-carboxyl group in the molecule was not obligatory for effective binding; however, in a number of instances, the presence of the α-carboxyl group of potential substrates and competitive inhibitors appeared to influence the specificity of the enzyme by diminishing the affinity between the enzyme and the bound molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1540045940,"Abstract The influence of K+ on oxidative phosphorylation of rat liver mitochondria has been investigated. Fresh mitochondria undergo a loss of respiratory control concomitantly with the loss of K+, and a rough correlation was found between the K+ content of the mitochondria and the State 3 to State 4 respiratory ratio. K+-depleted mitochondria have a low respiratory control with NAD-dependent substrates which is significantly enhanced by adding K+ during State 4; K+, added during State 3, fails to affect respiration. Apparently, the respiratory response of the mitochondria to the cation is regulated by its metabolic state. The favorable effect of K+ on oxidative phosphorylation is independent of its action in promoting the entrance of oxidizable substrates into the mitochondria. In K+-depleted mitochondria, there are certain conditions in which valinomycin, but not 2,4-dinitrophenol, stimulates the respiratory activity. As evidenced by swelling experiments, valinomycin induces the passive entrance of K+ into the K+-depleted mitochondria. The results of an attempt to determine the distribution of K+ in the population of mitochondria which have been depleted of K+ suggest that a significant part of the population has extremely low levels of K+, whereas a small part has an adequate concentration of K+. The favorable effect of K+ on mitochondrial respiration is not specific, and other cations, except Na+, may substitute for K+. The order of effectiveness of the cations in inducing respiratory control in K+-depleted mitochondria follows the order by which cations alter the structure of macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1536959193,"Abstract The hydrolytic action of snake venom phosphodiesterase on poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) was investigated in comparison with that of rat liver phosphodiesterase. The purified polymer, labeled with 32P or 14C, was partially hydrolyzed with snake venom phosphodiesterase and passed through a Sephadex G-50 column. The resulting elution profiles showed the existence of degradation products with various chain lengths, which were eluted successively after the void volume. A paper chromatogram of partially hydrolyzed 14C-labeled polymer indicated the existence of a different oligomer of 2'-(5''-phosphoribosyl)adenosine 5'-phosphate, from that found after hydrolysis with rat liver phosphodiesterase. Phosphate esters in the acid-soluble products of partial digestion of 32P-labeled polymer by snake venom phosphodiesterase were not completely susceptible to alkaline phosphomonoesterase from Escherichia coli. To confirm the endonucleolytic cleavage by snake venom phosphodiesterase, the structure of the oligomer obtained by rechromatography was examined. The oligomer was incubated with alkaline phosphomonoesterase and then this was removed and it was completely hydrolyzed by snake venom phosphodiesterase. 2'-(5''-Phosphoribosyl)adenosine, 2'-(5''-phosphoribosyl)-adenosine 5'-phosphate, and 2'-ribosyladenosine 5'-phosphate were found in the hydrolysate. From these results it is concluded that snake venom phosphodiesterase digests the polymer endonucleolytically. This is in contrast to rat liver phosphodiesterase which digests it exonucleolytically."
https://openalex.org/W1542694235,"The effects of free fatty acids on rat liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (EC 4.1.1.32), pyruvate carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.1), and glucose 6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9) were determined to evaluate the suggestion that free fatty acid inhibition of key glycolytic enzymes constitutes a specific inhibitory effect. Activities of all of these gluconeogenic enzymes were found to be markedly inhibited by long chain free fatty acids as well as by palmitoyl coenzyme A. The manner of the inhibition of gluconeogenic enzymes was indistinguishable from that reported for the glycolytic enzymes. It is therefore concluded that such effects in vitro of free fatty acids or long chain acyl-CoA esters on glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes may not be relevent for the regulation of metabolism in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1583264654,"Abstract Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) increases the rate of synthesis of biodegradative threonine deaminase in Escherichia coli made permeable by treatment with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and ethylenedia-minetetraacetate. Cyclic AMP overcomes the repression of the enzyme by glucose. In both cases, a half-maximal effect of the nucleotide occurs at about 1.4 x 10-4 m. Cyclic AMP does not influence the over-all rate of protein and RNA synthesis. Furthermore, it does not stimulate the conversion of inactive enzyme to an active form since it does not affect the enzyme level in cells in which protein synthesis is inhibited by chloramphenicol. The half-life of biodegradative threonine deaminase-specific messenger RNA is approximately 2 min and is also unaffected by the nucleotide. Cyclic AMP fails to stimulate enzyme production in cells in which messenger RNA synthesis is arrested by rifampicin or change of medium components. Thus, cyclic AMP appears to participate in the regulation of this enzyme synthesis at a transcriptional step. Among the nucleotide analogues tested, AMP and ADP stimulate the apparent rate of the enzyme production, but they do not counteract the repression of the enzyme by glucose. These compounds appear to stimulate the conversion of inactive labile enzyme to an active stable form, since they enhance the enzyme level in cells in which protein synthesis is inhibited by chloramphenicol."
https://openalex.org/W1584387693,"Abstract The enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase from Escherichia coli catalyzes the over-all reaction: ATP + pyruvate ⇌ phosphoenolpyruvate + AMP + Pi. Previous investigations had established the formation of a phosphoenzyme EP as an intermediate and had led to the suggestion that the first step in the reaction was the formation of a pyrophosphoryl enzyme, E + ATP ⇌ EPP + AMP, followed by the hydrolysis of EPP: EPP + H2O ⇌ EP + Pi. Attempts were made to establish this sequence of reactions by (a) the substitution of ATP as substrate with analogues in which the oxygen bridge between the β- and the γ-phosphorus is replaced with carbon or nitrogen and are consequently resistant to hydrolysis at the γ-phosphate and (b) the investigation of the Pi-H218O exchange reaction catalyzed by EP. The 5'-adenylylmethylene diphosphonate analogue was shown to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP in the over-all reaction with a Ki equal to 2.1 µm. It was shown that, unlike ATP, the phosphonate analogue did not lead to the formation of AMP. In addition, preliminary incubation of the enzyme with the phosphonate analogue or with 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate did not block subsequent phosphorylation of the enzyme by phosphoenolpyruvate, nor did preliminary incubation with the phosphonate analogue block the 14C-pyruvate-phosphoenolpyruvate exchange reaction. The presence of AMP is required for the rate of the H218O-Pi exchange to proceed at a rate comparable to the Pi-ATP exchange, even when the enzyme is maintained in the EP form with ATP or phosphoenolpyruvate. It is concluded that a free pyrophosphoryl enzyme is not an intermediate in the P-enolpyruvate synthetase reaction and a reaction sequence consistent with all of the experimental data is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2013169628,"THE occurrence of non-carbohydrate substituents in bacterial exopolysaccharides has been well documented. Acetate and pyruvate have frequently been detected either separately or together in the same polysaccharide1,2. More recently, a polysaccharide secreted by Alcaligenes faecalis var. myxogenes was shown to contain succinate3. Although formate is known as a bacterial metabolite it has not previously been reported as an integral component of bacterial extracellular polysaccharides. This may be partly because of the lack of suitable methods for detection or estimation of formate and also because of the known lability of O-acyl groups on carbohydrates."
https://openalex.org/W2274575715,"Abstract A nuclease specific for double stranded DNA has been isolated and partially purified from Hemophilus influenzae. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 8.2 to 8.4 and requires a divalent cation, either Mg++ or Mn++. It is most active on DNA whose size has been reduced by either sonic disruption or limited digestion with pancreatic deoxyribonuclease or spleen acid DNase. The enzyme releases only 5'-mononucleotides and leaves a single stranded segment of DNA which is resistant to further hydrolysis. Furthermore, the enzyme destroys the transforming activity of H. influenzae DNA very slowly. These results indicate that the enzyme is an exonuclease, hydrolyzing from the ends of DNA molecules. In addition, the enzyme also exhibits a DNA-phosphatase activity and releases inorganic phosphate from DNA fragments which terminate in 3'-phosphates, suggesting that this enzyme begins hydrolysis from the 3' end of the DNA strands."

https://openalex.org/W1554638567,"This paper considers the function of troponin-tropomyosin in the control of actomyosin contraction. The findings indicate that: (a) mild heat treatment, known to desensitize native actomyosin to calcium and to inhibit relaxation through the oxidation of certain —SH groups, acts by the oxidation of —SH groups on actomyosin per se, not on troponin-tropomyosin, and these —SH groups appear to play no essential role in the attachment of troponin-tropomyosin to actomyosin (shown by a new turbidimetric method for measuring the combination of these proteins); (b) removal of troponin-tropomyosin from native actomyosin by washing, which is another procedure known to desensitize the system to calcium, prevents the rapid contraction that normally occurs in the presence of calcium and high levels of substrate, MgATP. The system recovered its ability to contract under these conditions only when troponin-tropomyosin was returned to it. These observations support the hypothesis that relaxation of actomyosin is caused by the binding of MgATP to an inhibitory (relaxing) site, and that muscular contraction is controlled by the modification of this inhibitory interaction. Thus, it is proposed that the troponin-tropomyosin complex without calcium favors relaxation by facilitating MgATP binding to this site, whereas the formation of a calcium-troponin-tropomyosin complex has the opposite effect, i.e. it favors contraction by interfering with the binding of Mg-ATP at the relaxing site."

https://openalex.org/W1548129803,"Abstract Spectrophotometric evidence for the reduction of nonheme iron in the respiratory particles of Mycobacterium phlei was obtained by trapping the metal as ferrous o-phenanthrolinate. The protein-bound iron-o-phenanthroline complex had an absorption maximum at 510 mµ, and the extent of reduction of nonheme iron was followed by observing the increase in absorbance at 510 to 540 mµ on the addition of the chelating agent. When succinate was used as the electron donor, part of the nonheme iron present in the particles was found to undergo reduction. The amount of nonheme iron undergoing enzymatic reduction was found to increase with increasing concentrations of particle protein, and was about 3 to 4 times the enzymatically reducible cytochrome c in the preparation. Irradiation of the particles did not affect the nonheme iron content. However, irradiated particles did not show nonheme iron reduction. The reduction of nonheme iron, as well as succinate oxidase activity, was restored on the addition of the supernatant fraction to the irradiated particles. This indicated that the light-sensitive site was on the substrate side of nonheme iron on the succinate pathway. The nonheme iron of the supernatant fraction was not reducible with succinate, but was partially reducible with NAD+-linked substrates like β-hydroxybutyrate and malate. The particulate nonheme iron did not appear to be reducible with β-hydroxybutyrate. The particles, however, contained iron that was accessible to reduction with malate. But it was not known whether this iron was respiratory chain-linked or was a component of the bypass enzyme, malate-vitamin K reductase, present in both the particulate and the supernatant fractions."
