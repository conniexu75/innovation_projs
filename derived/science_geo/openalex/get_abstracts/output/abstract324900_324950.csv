https://openalex.org/W1993133573,"In vivo studies of cucurbitacins, the bitter principles present in Cucurbitaceae, indicated a quantitative relation between the concentrations of cucurbitacin in the plant and the degree of insect feeding. In vitro studies demonstrated the attractiveness of these compounds when they were separated from influences of other components of the host plants."

These findings indicate the existence of unglaciated areas (refugia) between fiords occupied by outlet glaciers flowing toward Baffin Bay, from the central part of the Wisconsin ice sheet, over the Foxe Basin—Hudson Bay area."
https://openalex.org/W2014782020,"Arenes of 1, 2, 3, 4 and more rings have been synthesized in a flow system by passing methane through silica gel at 1000 degrees C. Yields of 4.8 to 7.2 percent have been obtained per single pass. As determined by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the major compound synthesized that are of less than S rings are benzene, naphthalene, acenaphthylene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene. Under certain conditions ( presence of ammonia and water), small amounts of aliphatic hydrocarbons are also synthesized. Even-carbon-numbered hydrocarbons (aromatic as well as aliphatic) predominate, to the extent that about 97 percent of the total weight of the analyzed arenes have even numbers of carbon atoms."
https://openalex.org/W2038637122,"The lower alkyl esters of the C(8) to C(12) fatty acids and the C(8) to C(10) fatty alcohols selectively kill or inhibit the terminal meristem without damaging the axillary meristems, foliage, or stem tissue of a wide variety of plants. The axillary meristems develop at nearly the same time as those of plants whose terminal meristems have been removed manually. The concentration of the fatty acid esters and alcohols required to kill the terminal meristem range from 0.025 to 0.05M for herbaceous plants, 0.05 to 0.16M for semi-woody plants, and 0.16 to 0.27M for woody plants."

https://openalex.org/W2043754861,"A seismic reflection, gravity, and aeromagnetic reconnaissance was made in the Pensacola Mountains, Antarctica, during the 1965-66 austral summer. Prominent ice streams located between the Neptune and Patuxent Ranges and east of the Forrestal Range overlie channels in the rock surface 2000 meters below sea level which are probably of glacial origin. Seismic reflections show that the Filchner Ice Shelf is 1270 meters thick near its southern margin. Along the boundary between West and East Antarctica, Bouguer anomalies decrease from +60 milligals in West Antarctica to -80 milligals in East Antarctica. An abrupt change in crustal structure across this boundary is required to explainl the 2 milligals per kilometer gradient. This may indicate a fault extending through the crust into the mantle. Aeromagnetic profiles delineate anomalies up to 1800 gamma associated with the basic stratiform intrusion which comprises the Dufek and Forrestal ranges. A probable minimum area of 9500 square kilometers is calculated for the intrusive body on the basis of the magnetic anomalies, making it one of the largest bodies of its type. The extension of this magnetic anominaly across a fault forming the north border of the Pensacola Mountains probably precludes transcurrent movement."

https://openalex.org/W2047734680,"Ungulates belonging to the family Barylambdidae were found in the same geologic unit with, but stratigraphically above, a specimen assigned to the Tillodontia and above several molars of the perissodactyl cf. Hyracotherium sp. This arrangement is unusual, as in the well-documented faunas from the Rocky Mountain Region Barylambdidae are known only from the Paleocene, Tillodontia from the Paleocene and Eocene, while Hyracotherium is known only from the Eocene. The expected stratigraphic order would be, from lowest to highest, Barylambdidae, Tillodontia, and Hyracotherium. It is suggested that the Baja California assemblage is late Paleocene on the basis of the generalized molars of cf. Hyracotherium sp. and the characters of cf. Esthonyx sp."
https://openalex.org/W2069642440,The fungus Gibberella fujikuroi (Saw.) Wr. can be used in genetic studies of the production of gibberellins. A gene has been identified which controls a step in the biosynthetic pathway of gibberellin production. Apparently this step is early in the pathway for it affects the accumulation of all of the gibberellins produced by the fungus.

Then followed the work of the cytologists on fixed material. Much of interest and value resulted from these latter studies, notably the discovery of chromosomes and the phenomenon of mitosis. century ushered in a new and with it not only a return to living material, but a view-point based on modern physical and chemical interpretations. This change came about for a number of reasons. now old cytology found itself, at least temporarily, in a cul de sac; the chemists were just beginning to offer their first substantial contributions to the study of colloidal systems, in particular, jellies; and the cytologist had come to realize that if he went no further than what he could see in his miscroscope, he would not get far, any more than would have the physicist had he stopped at what he could see and make a model of. Such methods, which dominated the mechanical interpretations of natural phenomena during the nineteenth century, had inevitably to give way to interpretations based on behavior, whether the behavior of electrons, colloidal systems, or protoplasm. One can not rest content with visible structure. cytology, from a strictly physiological point of view, may be said to have started with the work of Claude Bernard; from the chemical point of view, it began with the work of H. R. Proctor on The Structure of Organic Jellies (34). Protoplasm was viewed by the older workers either as a fine granular suspension or as a framework of fibers, the latter forming a continuous net or an entanglement of discontinuous fibrils. In 1924 Biitschli advanced his alveolar hypothesis of protoplasmic structure. He introduced the word alveolus (a small alveole or cavity) to indicate symmetrically arranged globules resembling small vacuoles and which, because of pressure, have assumed an angular form. Neither alveolus nor vacuole is, however, a well chosen term as there are no cavities or empty sacs in protoplasm. alveolar structure is, in reality, that of an"

https://openalex.org/W2064479857,"The tendency for Tetrahymena pyriformis cells to lyse when they are centrifuged at speeds above 120g and then exposed to an ethanolic deciliating medium is inhibited by treatment with 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. This treatment facilitates greater yields and purer preparations of isolated cilia. Cilia from treated and untreated cells do not differ in some of their biochemical properties."

However, on the evening of 14 December 1964, the shadow of satellite Io was observed and no enhancement was detected. The effect is thus variable with time."
