The records at 15 stations from 14 hurricanes indicated a definite relationship between microseism periods at appropriate storm position. Plotted average microseism periods at appropriate storm positions indicated a 2.5- to 3.5 sec zone in the Gulf of Mexico, a 4.5- to 5.0-sec zone in an elongated region between Bermuda and the 1000- fathom contour off the east coast, and a 5.5- to 6.0-sec zone in the ocean area southeast of Bermuda. These trends are believed to indicate a correlation with their water or water and sediment depths."
