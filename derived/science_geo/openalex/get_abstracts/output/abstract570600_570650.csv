Brain functions such as perception, cognition, and the control of movement depend on the coordinated action of large-scale neuronal networks, local circuit modules linked together by long-range connections (Miller and Vogt, 1984Miller M.W.

Such long-range connections are formed by projection neurons that often comprise several intermingled classes, each projecting to a distinct constellation of downstream targets. Projection neurons have also been implicated in the spread of several neurodegenerative diseases from spatially localized sites of onset (Guo and Lee, 2014Guo J.L. Lee V.M. Cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, Seeley et al., 2009Seeley W.W. Crawford R.K.

Thus, the ability to selectively target specific classes of projection neurons for transgene delivery (e.g., for activity monitoring or manipulation, or genome editing for targeted gene knockouts or repair of pathological mutations) will be important both for gaining insights into how large-scale networks contribute to brain function and, in the long run, for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. Viral vectors constitute an important class of tools for introducing transgenes into specific neuronal populations and are by far the best option for genetic access to target projection neurons through entry at axonal terminals and retrograde transport of their payload to the cell nuclei. A number of naturally evolved neurotropic viruses exhibit retrograde spread as part of their life cycle, including rabies (Baer et al., 1965Baer G.M. Shanthaveerappa T.R. Bourne G.H.

Retrograde transneuronal transfer of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) from motoneurones.Brain Res. 1987; 422: 242-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), among others. Of these, rabies virus is particularly neuro-invasive (Coulon et al., 1989Coulon P. Derbin C. Kucera P. Lafay F. Prehaud C. Flamand A. Invasion of the peripheral nervous systems of adult mice by the CVS strain of rabies virus and its avirulent derivative AvO1.J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and quickly propagates through the nervous system through transcellular transfer (Kelly and Strick, 2000Kelly R.M. Strick P.L. Rabies as a transneuronal tracer of circuits in the central nervous system.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 103: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, its potential for both biological investigation and gene therapy is hampered by excessive virulence (Schnell et al., 2010Schnell M.J. McGettigan J.P. Wirblich C. Papaneri A. The cell biology of rabies virus: using stealth to reach the brain.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), though progress is being made to reduce its toxicity (Reardon et al., 2016Reardon T.R. Murray A.J. Turi G.F. Wirblich C. Croce K.R. Schnell M.J. Jessell T.M. Losonczy A. Rabies virus CVS-N2c(ΔG) strain enhances retrograde synaptic transfer and neuronal viability.Neuron. 2016; 89: 711-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition to naturally neurotropic strains, many other viruses can infect neurons when administered directly to the nervous system, with “pseudorabies” (SuHV1, actually a herpesvirus), adenoviruses, and lentiviruses used most commonly in animal research. Canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2) displays the best infectivity and retrograde transport of this class of viruses (Soudais et al., 2001Soudais C. Laplace-Builhe C. Kissa K. Kremer E.J. Preferential transduction of neurons by canine adenovirus vectors and their efficient retrograde transport in vivo.FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2283-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and has increasingly become the reagent of choice for accessing projection neurons (Junyent and Kremer, 2015Junyent F. Kremer E.J. CAV-2--why a canine virus is a neurobiologist’s best friend.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2015; 24: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, CAV-2 permits only modest levels of transgene expression, displays some toxicity (Piersanti et al., 2013Piersanti S. Astrologo L. Licursi V. Costa R. Roncaglia E. Gennetier A. Ibanes S. Chillon M. Negri R.

Kremer E.J. et al.Evaluation of helper-dependent canine adenovirus vectors in a 3D human CNS model.Gene Ther. 2016; 23: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and is currently not easily compatible with scalable, robust production for the generation of clinical-grade or even large animal studies (Kremer et al., 2000Kremer E.J. Boutin S. Chillon M. Danos O. Canine adenovirus vectors: an alternative for adenovirus-mediated gene transfer.J. Virol. 2000; 74: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus, the development of a non-toxic, readily manufactured viral vector that affords flexible packaging of different transgenes, is robustly internalized and retrogradely transported by axons, and supports long-term, high-level payload expression remains a pressing need. Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) have emerged as an effective platform for in vivo gene therapy, as they mediate high-level transgene expression, are non-toxic, and evoke minimal immune responses (Kaplitt et al., 2007Kaplitt M.G. Feigin A. Tang C. Fitzsimons H.L. Mattis P. Lawlor P.A. Bland R.J. Young D. Strybing K. Eidelberg D. During M.J.

These properties were at the core of the decision to grant the first full regulatory approval of any gene therapy treatment to rAAV-mediated restoration of lipoprotein lipase deficiency (Gaudet et al., 2010Gaudet D. de Wal J. Tremblay K. Déry S. van Deventer S. Freidig A. Brisson D. Méthot J. Review of the clinical development of alipogene tiparvovec gene therapy for lipoprotein lipase deficiency.Atheroscler. Suppl. 2010; 11: 55-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). rAAVs hold great promise in clinical trials for a range of neurological disorders (Ojala et al., 2015Ojala D.S. Amara D.P. Schaffer D.V. Adeno-associated virus vectors and neurological gene therapy.Neuroscientist. 2015; 21: 84-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and they constitute some of the most widespread vectors in neuroscience research (Murlidharan et al., 2014Murlidharan G. Samulski R.J. Asokan A. Biology of adeno-associated viral vectors in the central nervous system.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2014; 7: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Since the original discovery that AAV can undergo retrograde transport (Kaspar et al., 2002Kaspar B.K. Erickson D. Schaffer D. Hinh L. Gage F.H. Peterson D.A. Targeted retrograde gene delivery for neuronal protection.Mol. Ther. 2002; 5: 50-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), rAAVs have afforded some degree of retrograde access to projection neurons in select circuits (Castle et al., 2014Castle M.J.

Efficient transduction of non-human primate motor neurons after intramuscular delivery of recombinant AAV serotype 6.Gene Ther. 2010; 17: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), but their natural propensity for retrograde transport is low, hampering efforts to address the role of projection neurons in circuit computations or disease progression. Here we describe the in vivo directed evolution (Kotterman and Schaffer, 2014Kotterman M.A. Schaffer D.V. Engineering adeno-associated viruses for clinical gene therapy.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014; 15: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) of a new rAAV variant (rAAV2-retro) that, in addition to its regular ability to infect neuronal cell bodies at the site of exposure, is robustly internalized by axons and mediates retrograde access to projection neurons with efficiency comparable to classical retrograde labeling reagents such as synthetic dyes. The rAAV2-retro gene delivery system can be used on its own or in conjunction with Cre recombinase driver lines to achieve long-term, high-level transgene expression that is sufficient for effective functional interrogation of neural circuit function, as well as for genome editing in targeted neuronal populations. To engineer novel rAAVs with enhanced retrograde transport, we designed an in vivo directed-evolution approach to enrich for rAAV capsid variants that were efficiently transported to cell bodies of neurons sending long-range projections to the site of virus injection in the mouse brain (Figure 1A; Experimental Procedures). To maximize the likelihood of recovering a variant with the desired properties, we started with a diverse mixture of previously described libraries of rAAV cap variants (Koerber et al., 2006Koerber J.T.

Random peptide libraries displayed on adeno-associated virus to select for targeted gene therapy vectors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Viral particles were packaged in a way that linked each capsid variant to the AAV genome containing the corresponding cap gene, and the final pool of capsid variants included point mutants, variants with a random 7-mer (plus three constant flanking residues) peptide insertion into the region AAV2 utilizes to bind its co-receptor heparin (Kern et al., 2003Kern A. Schmidt K. Leder C. Müller O.J. Wobus C.E. Bettinger K. Von der Lieth C.W. King J.A. Kleinschmidt J.A. Identification of a heparin-binding motif on adeno-associated virus type 2 capsids.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11072-11081Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and random chimeras of capsid gene sequences from seven parental serotypes (Figure 1A; Experimental Procedures). To identify variants with broad retrograde tropism, we targeted two independent populations of projection neurons: striatal GABAergic neurons projecting to substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and glutamatergic hindbrain neurons projecting to the cerebellar cortex. Three weeks following injection of the entire pool of rAAV variants into the SNr or cerebellum (one injection per animal), striatal or hindbrain tissue, respectively, was removed, the cap sequences were recovered by PCR, and virus was repackaged (Figure 1B). After two more selection steps, error-prone PCR was performed to further diversify the library, followed by two final in vivo selection steps. We sequenced 30 cap variants after the fourth round of evolution, and the majority originated from the insertion library and contained exogenous 10-mer peptides between N587 and R588 of the wild-type AAV2 VP1 capsid gene (Müller et al., 2003Müller O.J. Kaul F. Weitzman M.D. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Trepel M. Random peptide libraries displayed on adeno-associated virus to select for targeted gene therapy vectors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures). Intriguingly, all of the recovered inserts were of the form LAxxDxTKxA or LAxDxTKxxA; mutations elsewhere in the sequence were also enriched (Table S1, available online). We sequenced a further 22 clones after the fifth round of evolution, and with this additional round of evolution, all sequences were AAV2 mutants with LAxxDxTKxA/LAxDxTKxxA insertions (Table S1), demonstrating a marked degree of further convergence. Such convergence suggested that specific peptide insertions into the heparin-binding loop were largely responsible for the retrograde functionality, with potential secondary contributions from the other sites (see Discussion). We next focused a secondary screen (data not shown) on seventeen isolated variants possessing different combinations of peptide insertions and point mutations in the capsid sequence. To apply a high level of stringency, the chosen variants were packaged with an EGFP transgene driven by the CMV promoter, which is typically weak in neurons. For each capsid variant, we evaluated its ability to deliver sufficient payload to cell bodies in key afferent regions to permit the detection of non-antibody-amplified EGFP signal 3 weeks after injection. The clone (insert LADQDYTKTA + V708I + N382D) that displayed the strongest retrograde transport in two independent circuits in this secondary screen (cortex to globus pallidus and inferior olive/basal pontine nuclei [BPN] to cerebellum) was chosen for further analysis and named rAAV2-retro. When we assessed two additional promoters more commonly used in rodent in vivo studies (CAG; Figure 1B; or human Synapsin-1; data not shown), we observed remarkable retrograde labeling efficiency with this rAAV variant in a range of different circuits in mice and rats (Figures 1B and S1; Movie S1; see below). Swapping the 7-mer insertion to one of the other recovered sequences or adding additional point mutations identified in the screen did not lead to further increases in retrograde transport (data not shown). The corticopontine tract is a remarkably convergent descending motor pathway, contributing more than 95% of the afferents to the BPN (Brodal and Bjaalie, 1992Brodal P. Bjaalie J.G. Organization of the pontine nuclei.Neurosci. Res. 1992; 13: 83-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This pathway is therefore particularly advantageous for quantifying the efficiency of viral uptake and retrograde transport by axonal terminals of projection neurons. Indeed, injection of rAAV2-retro into the BPN resulted in dense labeling of layer V neurons (Figure 2A), consistent with past tracing studies (Legg et al., 1989Legg C.R. Mercier B. Glickstein M. Corticopontine projection in the rat: the distribution of labelled cortical cells after large injections of horseradish peroxidase in the pontine nuclei.J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 286: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We therefore next compared the efficacy of retrograde transport in the corticopontine circuit for rAAV2-retro versus several commonly used AAV serotypes, under identical infection and processing conditions (Figures 2B–2D; Experimental Procedures). To ensure quantification accuracy and to eliminate the possible confound of cell-to-cell variability in transgene expression level, we used the AAV to deliver Cre recombinase to Rosa26-Lox-STOP-Lox-H2B-EGFP (histone-fused EGFP) transgenic mice (He et al., 2012He M. Liu Y. Wang X. Zhang M.Q. Hannon G.J. Huang Z.J. Cell-type-based analysis of microRNA profiles in the mouse brain.Neuron. 2012; 73: 35-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Even a low concentration of the Cre enzyme is sufficient to turn on the expression of such a Cre-dependent cassette (Nagy, 2000Nagy A. Cre recombinase: the universal reagent for genome tailoring.Genesis. 2000; 26: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), and the stringent nuclear localization of the histone-fused reporter affords unambiguous identification of infected cells, without confounding neuropil signal. We used a semi-automated analysis procedure to calculate the linear density of infected cortical projection neurons in imaged sagittal sections from mouse brains harvested 3 weeks after local virus injection in the BPN (Figure 2C; Experimental Procedures). For animals infected with rAAV2, we observed minimal cortical GFP expression (linear density 0.98 ± 0.20 neurons/mm, mean ± SEM, n = 5; Figure 2B, middle panel). In contrast, and in agreement with the earlier observation (Figure 2A), a dense layer of EGFP-positive layer V projection neurons could be observed throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the cortex in rAAV2-retro-injected animals (linear density, 130.11 ± 11.08 neurons/mm, n = 4; Figure 2B, lower panel). None of the other commonly used AAV serotypes, nor CAV-2, matched the retrograde efficiency of the engineered rAAV2-retro variant (linear densities, AAV1, 0.05 ± 0.04; AAV2, 0.98 ± 0.2; AAV5, 2.38 ± 1.24; AAV8, 1.43 ± 1.43; AAV9, 1.98 ± 0.86; DJ, 24.82 ± 14.32; CAV-2, 5.56 ± 4.13; n = 3–5 each; Figures 2D and S2). The poor performance by the common AAV serotypes could not have arisen simply as a result of differences in infectivity since even the serotypes displaying similar labeling efficiency at the injection site to that of rAAV2-retro (rAAV2 and rAAV9) did not permit efficient retrograde access to corticopontine neurons (Figure S3). Strikingly, the density of cortical projection neurons labeled by rAAV2-retro was comparable to that achieved with Fluoro-Gold (Schmued and Fallon, 1986Schmued L.C. Fallon J.H. Fluoro-Gold: a new fluorescent retrograde axonal tracer with numerous unique properties.Brain Res. 1986; 377: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), a robust synthetic retrograde tracer (linear density, 81.03 ± 11.08 neurons/mm, n = 3). Thus, rAAV2-retro exhibits up to two orders of magnitude enhancement over existing serotypes in retrograde access to corticopontine projection neurons and rivals the efficacy of synthetic retrograde tracers. We next examined whether the retrograde functionality of rAAV2-retro extended to other circuits, specifically by characterizing the extent to which it labeled various afferents to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), a part of the basal ganglia that receives long-range inputs from a variety of cortical and subcortical areas (Pan et al., 2010Pan W.X. Mao T. Dudman J.T. Inputs to the dorsal striatum of the mouse reflect the parallel circuit architecture of the forebrain.Front. Neuroanat. 2010; 4: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We found that the efficacy of rAAV2-retro-mediated retrograde access to the strongest afferent inputs into DMS—cortex, thalamus, and amygdala—was comparable to that of fluorescent beads classically used for retrograde tracing (Figure 3A). To provide an unbiased estimate for the number of retrogradely labeled neurons in all brain areas known to provide significant long-range input to the DMS, we next assigned any detected fluorescent label in an imaged section of the mouse brain to specific brain areas by aligning the section to the annotated Allen Brain Atlas (Figures 3B and 3C). Quantitative analysis (Figures 3B and 3C) revealed that strong retrograde labeling was found in the vast majority of regions that have been previously reported to send prominent projections to the striatum (Pan et al., 2010Pan W.X. Mao T. Dudman J.T. Inputs to the dorsal striatum of the mouse reflect the parallel circuit architecture of the forebrain.Front. Neuroanat. 2010; 4: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In one noticeable exception, only modest labeling was observed in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), despite it being the source of strong dopaminergic input to the DMS (Figure 3C, arrow at cell count for SNc). A small subset of projection neuron classes was found to be similarly refractory to retrograde access by rAAV2-retro in some of the other circuits tested (Table S2; note that all other AAV serotypes tested also failed to label these projections). Despite these exceptions, rAAV2-retro is broadly applicable for retrograde access to projection neurons within the CNS. We note that no rAAV2-retro-mediated labeling of unexpected pathways has been reported to date (Table S2); however, additional studies will be necessary to fully rule out its ability to infect axons of passage. We also determined whether the retrograde functionality of rAAV2-retro could be combined with the specificity of Cre transgenic lines to enable the interrogation of specific classes of projection neurons. Specifically, we asked whether we could combine rAAV2-retro and Cre transgenic lines to segregate two functionally distinct long-range connections that run in parallel between two brain areas. Projections from cerebral cortex to the striatum arise primarily from neurons in layer V, but some neurons in layers II and III also provide striatal inputs. It has been suggested that inputs to the striatum from different cortical layers constitute separate pathways, with neurons in layer V projecting to the patch compartment of the striatum and neurons in layers II and III to the matrix (Gerfen, 1989Gerfen C.R. The neostriatal mosaic: striatal patch-matrix organization is related to cortical lamination.Science. 1989; 246: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The interdigitated nature of patch and matrix micro-compartments makes it difficult to selectively target these pathways for functional interrogation with the rAAV2-retro system alone. We therefore explored whether we could segregate the two inputs by combining rAAV2-retro with a transgenic line that expresses Cre recombinase in most layer V neurons (Gerfen et al., 2013Gerfen C.R. Paletzki R. Heintz N. GENSAT BAC cre-recombinase driver lines to study the functional organization of cerebral cortical and basal ganglia circuits.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1368-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), but not in neurons in layers II and III (Figure 4A). To highlight both pathways in the same experiment, we chose a Cre-dependent color-flipping payload, which expresses tdTomato in the absence of Cre, but inverts to drive the expression of EGFP in Cre-positive cells (Saunders et al., 2012Saunders A. Johnson C.A. Sabatini B.L. Novel recombinant adeno-associated viruses for Cre activated and inactivated transgene expression in neurons.Front.

To uncover underlying pathogenic mechanisms, we found that DNA damage was greater, in an age-dependent manner, in motor neurons differentiated from iPSCs of multiple C9ORF72 patients than control neurons. Ectopic expression of the dipeptide repeat (DPR) protein (GR)80 in iPSC-derived control neurons increased DNA damage, suggesting poly(GR) contributes to DNA damage in aged C9ORF72 neurons. Oxidative stress was also increased in C9ORF72 neurons in an age-dependent manner. Pharmacological or genetic reduction of oxidative stress partially rescued DNA damage in C9ORF72 neurons and control neurons expressing (GR)80 or (GR)80-induced cellular toxicity in flies. Moreover, interactome analysis revealed that (GR)80 preferentially bound to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and caused mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, poly(GR) in C9ORF72 neurons compromises mitochondrial function and causes DNA damage in part by increasing oxidative stress, revealing another pathogenic mechanism in C9ORF72-related ALS and FTD.

Rapid progress has been made recently in unraveling the pathogenic mechanisms elicited by expanded G4C2 repeats. For instance, knockdown or knockout of C9orf72 expression in mice does not cause any obvious neurodegeneration, suggesting that partial loss of C9ORF72 is not a major initiating factor in ALS and FTD (Lagier-Tourenne et al., 2013Lagier-Tourenne C.

On the other hand, ectopic expression of expanded G4C2 repeats flanked by human introns results in the formation of nuclear RNA foci and production of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins through a process called repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation without causing gross neurodegeneration in flies or some mouse models (Tran et al., 2015Tran H.

However, it is not known whether other cellular pathways are dysregulated in an age-dependent manner by endogenously expressed, expanded G4C2 repeats or DPR proteins. To address this important issue, here we examined ChAT+ motor neurons differentiated from multiple existing and newly generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from C9ORF72 patients and age-matched control subjects. To better understand ALS/FTD pathogenesis in iPSC models, it is critical to study neurons derived from multiple control and patient subjects. To this end, in addition to iPSC lines that we generated previously (Almeida et al., 2012Almeida S. Zhang Z. Coppola G. Mao W. Futai K. Karydas A. Geschwind M.D. Tartaglia M.C. Gao F.

The use of human skin biopsies was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Control line 35L11 and C9ORF72 lines 42L12, 40L3, and 40L8 were used recently in our collaborative study (Freibaum et al., 2015Freibaum B.D. Lu Y. Lopez-Gonzalez R. Kim N.C. Almeida S. Lee K.H. Badders N. Valentine M. Miller B.L. Wong P.C. et al.GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 compromises nucleocytoplasmic transport.Nature. 2015; 525: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar); the other lines are described in Table S1. Briefly, human dermal fibroblasts were transfected with episomal plasmids expressing OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, c-MYC, LIN28, and NANOG. New lines from independent reprogramming events were characterized by expression of pluripotency markers (Figures S1A and S1B), normal karyotype (Figure S1C), and their ability to spontaneously differentiate into cells of the three germ layers (Figure S1D). In the present study, we also used an iPSC line (30iC9-ALS) generated from a C9ORF72 ALS patient by Sareen et al., 2013Sareen D. O’Rourke J.G. Meera P. Muhammad A.K.M.G. Grant S. Simpkinson M.

Med. 2013; 5: 208ra149Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar. We differentiated multiple iPSC lines into spinal cord motor neurons as described by Amoroso et al., 2013Amoroso M.W. Croft G.F.

Accelerated high-yield generation of limb-innervating motor neurons from human stem cells.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar (Figure 1A). More than 80% of cells in these cultures were TUJ1+ neurons (Figures 1B and 1C), and about 35% of neurons were ChAT+ motor neurons (Figures 1D and 1E). Based on the percentages of TUJ1+ and ChAT+ motor neurons in the culture, the C9ORF72 repeat expansions did not seem to affect neuronal differentiation per se (Figure 1E). Further characterization revealed that nuclear RNA foci were present in 2-week-old iPSC-derived ChAT+ motor neurons of three C9ORF72 patients, but not in control neurons (Figure 1F). The percentage of motor neurons with foci (Figure 1G) and the average number of foci per cell (Figure 1H) did not change from 2-week-old to 4-month-old cultures. We also detected the production of RAN translation products, such as poly(GP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Figure 1I) and poly(GR) by dot blot assay (Figure 1J). Thus, this cellular model recapitulates key pathogenic hallmarks of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD. One challenge of using iPSC models is to reveal molecular and cellular phenotypes relevant to age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases. Previously, we demonstrated age-dependent phenotypes (e.g., decreased miR-124 levels) in aged iPSC-derived patient neurons (Gascon et al., 2014Gascon E. Lynch K. Ruan H. Almeida S. Verheyden J.M. Seeley W.W. Dickson D.W. Petrucelli L. Sun D. Jiao J. et al.Alterations in microRNA-124 and AMPA receptors contribute to social behavioral deficits in frontotemporal dementia.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, human motor neurons differentiated from multiple iPSC lines were first cultured for 4 months. Western blot analysis revealed an increased expression of γH2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks, in iPSC-derived motor neuron cultures of all four C9ORF72 patients (Figure 2A). Because other neuronal types are present in these cultures, we performed double-immunostaining analysis to examine DNA damage specifically in motor neurons. We found that the level of γH2AX+ was greater in the nucleus of 4-month-old ChAT+ C9ORF72 motor neurons than in control neurons (Figure 2B). Increased DNA damage activates the p53 pathway, an important component of the response to DNA damage and other cellular stresses (Lakin and Jackson, 1999Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Regulation of p53 in response to DNA damage.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Indeed, western blot analysis showed higher levels of p53 in 4-month-old C9ORF72 motor neuron cultures than in control cultures (Figure 2C). C9ORF72 motor neuron cultures also had increased expression of other markers of DNA damage, such as ATR, which is activated by DNA strand breaks, and GADD45, which is regulated by p53 (Figures S2A and S2B). The p53 mRNA levels were the same in both cultures (Figure S2C), suggesting that the increase in p53 protein reflects posttranslational regulation, as in other cell types (Lakin and Jackson, 1999Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Regulation of p53 in response to DNA damage.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate that p53 protein is increased in C9ORF72 motor neurons in these cultures, we found elevated p53 levels in 4-month-old, iPSC-derived ChAT+ motor neurons (Figure 2D). DNA damage induces p53 phosphorylation, such as at serine 15, to stabilize the protein (Lakin and Jackson, 1999Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Regulation of p53 in response to DNA damage.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 (p-p53) was more abundant in ChAT+ motor neurons than in control neurons (Figure S2D). To determine whether the observed increase in DNA damage was age dependent, we first examined p53 and found that it was not elevated in 2-week-old, iPSC-derived C9ORF72 motor neurons (Figures S2E and S2F). Then we also analyzed the extent of DNA strand breaks by the comet assay (Figure 2E) and quantified the relative tail length (Figure 2F) and the percentage of DNA in the tail (Figure 2G). This analysis further confirmed a significant increase in DNA damage in 4-month-old C9ORF72 motor neuron cultures compared with control motor neuron cultures. Then we examined earlier time points using a recently published iPSC differentiation protocol (Du et al., 2015Du Z.W. Chen H. Liu H. Lu J. Qian K. Huang C.L. Zhong X. Fan F. Zhang S.C. Generation and expansion of highly pure motor neuron progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which generates cultures in which more than 80% of cells are ChAT+ motor neurons (Figures S3A–S3D). DNA damage became detectable at around 8-week-old cultures, and these changes became gradually more pronounced in 3- and 4-month-old cultures (Figure 2H; Figure S2G). It seems that poly(GR) expression is higher in 4-month-old cultures than in 2-month-old cultures (Figure S2H), although the dot blot analysis is not highly quantitative. DNA damage was not detected in astrocytes (Figure S2I), even though these cells show RNA foci (Figure S2J) and presumably express DPR proteins as well. Thus, C9ORF72 motor neurons show a gradual accumulation of DNA damage during the aging process in vitro. Finally, RNA damage was also increased in 3-month-old C9ORF72 motor neurons (Figure 2I). The iPSC-derived C9ORF72 motor neurons produce both nuclear RNA foci and DPR proteins, such as poly(GR) (Figure 1J), but the cause of the DNA damage in these cells is unclear. In a Drosophila model expressing 160 copies of G4C2 repeats in the molecular context of human intronic and adjacent exonic sequences, modest toxicity at higher temperature correlates with increased DPR protein production, but not with the number of nuclear G4C2 sense RNA foci (Tran et al., 2015Tran H.

Expression of (GR)80 in control motor neurons activated the p53 pathway (Figure 3D), increased the level of γH2AX (Figure 3F), and resulted in more DNA strand breaks (Figures 3G–3I). In contrast, expression of (GA)80 for 48 hr did not induce these molecular changes (Figure 3). Thus, (GR)80, but not (GA)80, was sufficient to induce DNA damage when transiently expressed in human motor neurons. Moreover, (GR)80, but not (GA)80, expression compromised the cell survival in iPSC-derived motor neuron cultures (Figure S3E). Furthermore, using our previously established Drosophila model of (GR)80 toxicity (Yang et al., 2015Yang D. Abdallah A. Li Z. Lu Y. Almeida S. Gao F.-B. FTD/ALS-associated poly(GR) protein impairs the Notch pathway and is recruited by poly(GA) into cytoplasmic inclusions.Acta Neuropathol. 2015; 130: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we found that partial inhibition of the p53 pathway—either through heterozygosity of p53 loss-of-function allele or p53 RNAi knockdown or expression of a dominant-negative form of p53—partially suppressed (GR)80-induced toxicity (Figure S3F). Thus, DNA damage-induced activation of the p53 pathway contributes to poly(GR) toxicity. To understand the mechanism underlying (GR)80 toxicity, we assessed oxidative stress, a common cause of DNA damage (Madabhushi et al., 2014Madabhushi R. Pan L. Tsai L.H. DNA damage and its links to neurodegeneration.Neuron. 2014; 83: 266-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). First, we used MitoSOX Red, a mitochondrial dye that produces red fluorescence upon oxidation by superoxide, to measure the relative production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in high-yield control and C9ORF72 motor neuron cultures. ROS production was not elevated in 2- (Figure 4A) or 4-week-old (data not shown), iPSC-derived C9ORF72 motor neuron cultures. However, it started to increase in 8-week-old C9ORF72 neuron cultures (Figure 4B) and continued to increase in 12-week-old (data not shown) and 4-month-old C9ORF72 neuron cultures (Figure 4C), which correlated well with the observed age-dependent increase in DNA damage in these cells (Figures 2F and 2G). Similar results were obtained with dihydrorhodamine 123, another ROS indicator (Figures S4A and S4B). ROS production, measured by both indicators, was also increased in 3-month-old, iPSC-derived C9ORF72 cortical neurons (Figures S4C and S4D). In control iPSC-derived motor neurons expressing (GA)80, ROS production, as measured by MitoSOX Red (Figure S4E) or dihydrorhodamine 123 (Figure S4F), was not affected. However, ROS levels in control iPSC-derived motor neuron cultures were significantly increased by (GR)80 expression (Figure 4D; Figure S4G). This increase was partially prevented by Trolox, a water-soluble antioxidant and vitamin E analog (Le Gal et al., 2015Le Gal K. Ibrahim M.X. Wiel C. Sayin V.I. Akula M.K. Karlsson C. Dalin M.G. Akyürek L.M. Lindahl P. Nilsson J. Bergo M.O. Antioxidants can increase melanoma metastasis in mice.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 308re8Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) (Figure 4E; Figure S4H). Importantly, the extent of DNA strand breaks was reduced in these cells (Figure 4F), indicating that increased DNA damage was caused in part by poly(GR)-induced oxidative stress. We also found that reduction of oxidative stress by Trolox partially reduced DNA damage in 3-month-old C9ORF72 neuron cultures (Figure 4G; Figure S4I). Furthermore, expression of catalase (Figure S4J), hSOD1 (Figure 4H), or both (Figure 4H), enzymes that function in the same molecular pathway to suppress oxidative stress in flies (Milton et al., 2011Milton V.J. Jarrett H.E. Gowers K. Chalak S. Briggs L. Robinson I.M. Sweeney S.T. Oxidative stress induces overgrowth of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 17521-17526Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), partially suppressed (GR)80-induced cell toxicity in flies. Thus, increased oxidative stress in part contributes to DNA damage and cellular toxicity in C9ORF72-related ALS/FTD. To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying (GR)80 toxicity, we expressed (GR)80-GFP or GFP alone in HEK293 cells and performed interactome analysis. We identified 403 proteins that interact with (GR)80-GFP, but not GFP without RNase A treatment. Remarkably, more than half of these proteins are ribosomal and other RNA binding proteins (Table S2). Then we treated cell lysates with RNase A to destroy RNA-mediated interactions and repeated the same analysis. We identified 237 (GR)80-specific interacting proteins (Table S2), including Lamin B receptor and several subunits of the exosome complex, consistent with our earlier findings that they are genetic modifiers in a Drosophila model of C9ORF72-related ALS/FTD (Freibaum et al., 2015Freibaum B.D. Lu Y. Lopez-Gonzalez R. Kim N.C. Almeida S. Lee K.H. Badders N. Valentine M. Miller B.L. Wong P.C. et al.GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 compromises nucleocytoplasmic transport.Nature. 2015; 525: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Interactome and protein functional classification analyses reveal several major groups of proteins whose significance in disease remains to be further investigated (Figures S4K and S4L). However, among the top 100 (GR)80-interacting proteins, 67 are ribosomal proteins, and among them, two-thirds are mitochondrial ribosomal proteins that are required for translation of 13 subunits of the mitochondrial complexes (Figures 4I and 4J). Indeed, we found that mitochondrial membrane potential was increased in iPSC-derived, high-yield C9ORF72 motor neurons (Figure 4K) and in control neurons that expressed (GR)80 (Figure S4M). Thus, poly(GR) preferentially binds to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and compromises mitochondrial function. This study shows that oxidative stress and DNA damage are increased in iPSC-derived C9ORF72 motor neurons in an age-dependent manner. Poly(GR) preferentially binds to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and compromises mitochondrial function, which likely leads to increased oxidative stress in human neurons. More importantly, pharmacological or genetic reduction of oxidative stress partially suppressed these detrimental effects in human motor neurons and flies. These results suggest another pathogenic mechanism in C9ORF72-related ALS/FTD. To understand how cytoplasmic poly(GR) causes DNA damage, we assessed oxidative stress. We found that oxidative stress is elevated in control human neurons expressing (GR)80, as well as in C9ORF72 motor neurons, in an age-dependent manner, which is in part responsible for increased DNA damage. More prolonged antioxidant treatment would likely have resulted in stronger inhibition of DNA damage. Interestingly, interactome analysis revealed that (GR)80 preferentially binds to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (Figure 4), suggesting that mitochondria is a major target of poly(GR) toxicity and that compromised mitochondrial function may lead to increased oxidative stress. (GR)80 also binds to Lamin B receptor and many non-ribosomal RNA binding proteins such as Matrin 3. The functional significance of these biochemical interactions remains to be further investigated in human neurons. Unlike short poly(GR) proteins, such as synthetic (GR)20, which is highly localized to the nucleolus when applied to cultured cells (Kwon et al., 2014Kwon I. Xiang S. Kato M. Wu L. Theodoropoulos P. Wang T. Kim J. Yun J. Xie Y. McKnight S.L. Poly-dipeptides encoded by the C9orf72 repeats bind nucleoli, impede RNA biogenesis, and kill cells.Science. 2014; 345: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), (GR)80 is mostly localized to the cytosol in both mammalian and Drosophila cells (Yang et al., 2015Yang D. Abdallah A. Li Z. Lu Y. Almeida S. Gao F.-B. FTD/ALS-associated poly(GR) protein impairs the Notch pathway and is recruited by poly(GA) into cytoplasmic inclusions.Acta Neuropathol. 2015; 130: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, poly(GR) in C9ORF72 patient brains are mostly cytoplasmic and largely absent from the nucleolus (Schludi et al., 2015Schludi M.H. May S. Grässer F.A. Rentzsch K. Kremmer E. Küpper C. Klopstock T. Arzberger T. Edbauer D.

Thus, DPR proteins of different length may preferentially interact with different sets of proteins. The increase in oxidative stress and DNA damage in iPSC-derived C9ORF72 motor neurons is age dependent. Deterioration of nuclear pore integrity and nucleocytoplasmic transport with age (D’Angelo et al., 2009D’Angelo M.A. Raices M. Panowski S.H. Hetzer M.W.

In addition, DPR accumulation could be facilitated by compromised proteasome and autophagy activities during aging as well. Pharmacological or genetic suppression of oxidative stress decreases poly(GR)-induced DNA damage, suggesting that oxidative stress is one of the key causes of the DNA damage in iPSC-derived C9ORF72 neurons. Thus, reducing oxidative stress is a potential therapeutic strategy for C9ORF72-related ALS/FTD. Moreover, these age-dependent phenotypes can be used as quantifiable assays for testing effectiveness of potential therapeutic drugs on C9ORF72 human neurons.

Pioneering experiments by Rudolph Schönheimer established that proteins are in a dynamic state of synthesis and degradation (Schoenheimer, 1942Schoenheimer R. The Dynamic State of Body Constituents. Harvard University Press, 1942Google Scholar). The subsequent discovery of lysosomes and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) provided detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms of cellular protein homeostasis. It is now well-established that proteins are extensively turned over, that this process is specific, and that the stability of individual proteins can vary under different physiological conditions (Ciechanover, 2005Ciechanover A. Aaron Ciechanover - Nobel Lecture: Intracellular Protein Degradation, The Nobel Prizes 2004. Science History Publications/Watson Publishing, 2005Google Scholar). Despite these mechanistic insights, the kinetics of cellular protein degradation are still not well understood. Early analyses indicated that intracellular protein degradation follows first order kinetics (Goldberg and Dice, 1974Goldberg A.L. Dice J.F. Intracellular protein degradation in mammalian and bacterial cells.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 835-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, Schimke and Doyle, 1970Schimke R.T. Doyle D. Control of enzyme levels in animal tissues.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1970; 39: 929-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Accordingly, protein degradation is thought to be an exponential decay process in which young and old proteins have the same degradation probability per unit time (i.e., degradation rate) (Figure 1A). However, there is substantial evidence that protein degradation does not always follow first-order kinetics. Pulse-chase experiments by Wheatley et al., 1980Wheatley D.N. Giddings M.R. Inglis M.S. Kinetics of degradation of “short-” and “long-lived” proteins in cultured mammalian cells.Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1980; 4: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar indicated that a substantial fraction of proteins are degraded within the first 2 hr after synthesis. In addition, the newly synthesized immature forms of proteins, like the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and basigin (CD147), were found to be rapidly degraded while the “older” mature forms were stable (Tyler et al., 2012Tyler R.E. Pearce M.M.P. Shaler T.A. Olzmann J.A. Greenblatt E.J. Kopito R.R. Unassembled CD147 is an endogenous endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation substrate.Mol. Biol.

Inefficient processing and rapid degradation of wild-type and mutant proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also observed that proteins can be ubiquitinated co-translationally (Duttler et al., 2013Duttler S. Pechmann S. Frydman J. Principles of cotranslational ubiquitination and quality control at the ribosome.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 379-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), that most ubiquitinated proteins in a cell are relatively young (Kim et al., 2011Kim W. Bennett E.J. Huttlin E.L. Guo A. Li J. Possemato A. Sowa M.E. Rad R. Rush J. Comb M.J. et al.Systematic and quantitative assessment of the ubiquitin-modified proteome.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 325-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), and that MHC class I peptides sometimes show higher turnover than their source proteins (Bourdetsky et al., 2014Bourdetsky D. Schmelzer C.E. Admon A. The nature and extent of contributions by defective ribosome products to the HLA peptidome.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2014; 111: 1591-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been estimated that ∼30% of newly synthesized proteins are quickly degraded (Schubert et al., 2000Schubert U. Antón L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Rapid degradation of a large fraction of newly synthesized proteins by proteasomes.Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), although this number was questioned in later studies (Vabulas and Hartl, 2005Vabulas R.M. Hartl F.U. Protein synthesis upon acute nutrient restriction relies on proteasome function.Science. 2005; 310: 1960-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that decay probabilities of proteins can vary as a function of their molecular age. However, to the best of our knowledge, the degradation kinetics of individual proteins has not yet been investigated globally. To systematically assess cellular protein degradation kinetics, we sought to perform pulse-chase experiments on a proteome-wide scale. The general idea is to metabolically label a population of proteins with a short pulse and then to quantify how much of this population is left after different lengths of chase. We and others have previously used stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to study protein synthesis and turnover (Andersen et al., 2005Andersen J.S. Lam Y.W. Leung A.K.

A disadvantage of these approaches is that they require rather long labeling times. Metabolic labeling with bioorthogonal amino acids has emerged as an attractive alternative (Dieterich et al., 2006Dieterich D.C. Link A.J. Graumann J. Tirrell D.A. Schuman E.M. Selective identification of newly synthesized proteins in mammalian cells using bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 9482-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Cells can incorporate the artificial amino acid azidohomoalanine (AHA) into newly synthesized proteins instead of methionine (Kiick et al., 2002Kiick K.L. Saxon E. Tirrell D.A. Bertozzi C.R. Incorporation of azides into recombinant proteins for chemoselective modification by the Staudinger ligation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). AHA contains an azide group enabling capture of proteins via click chemistry (Dieterich et al., 2006Dieterich D.C. Link A.J. Graumann J. Tirrell D.A. Schuman E.M. Selective identification of newly synthesized proteins in mammalian cells using bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 9482-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Combining AHA with SILAC enables relatively short pulse times (Eichelbaum and Krijgsveld, 2014Eichelbaum K. Krijgsveld J. Rapid temporal dynamics of transcription, protein synthesis, and secretion during macrophage activation.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2014; 13: 792-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Eichelbaum et al., 2012Eichelbaum K. Winter M. Berriel Diaz M. Herzig S. Krijgsveld J. Selective enrichment of newly synthesized proteins for quantitative secretome analysis.Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Here, we combined AHA and SILAC to obtain a global survey of protein degradation kinetics. We find that a sizable fraction of proteins are degraded non-exponentially. Many non-exponentially degraded (NED) proteins are members of heteromeric protein complexes that are over-produced relative to other members of the same complex. Thus, in contrast to recent findings in bacteria (Li et al., 2014Li G.W. Burkhardt D. Gross C. Weissman J.S. Quantifying absolute protein synthesis rates reveals principles underlying allocation of cellular resources.Cell. 2014; 157: 624-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), disproportional protein synthesis appears to be common and evolutionarily conserved in metazoans. Our data allowed us to predict how protein levels change in response to gene copy-number alterations in aneuploid cells. Global quantification of protein degradation kinetics reveals an unexpected layer of posttranslational regulation with important functional implications. To perform proteome-wide pulse-chase experiments we combined AHA and SILAC labeling (Figure 1B). First, cells are fully labeled heavy, medium-heavy, or light using SILAC. Second, all three cell populations are pulse-labeled with AHA for 1 hr. This relatively long pulse labeling time was chosen to allow sufficient label incorporation. Heavy cells are harvested immediately after the pulse while medium-heavy and light cells are chased in AHA-free medium for different lengths of time. All three cell populations are then combined and lysed. AHA-containing proteins are purified from the mixed lysate. After digestion into peptides, SILAC-based quantification reveals how much of the pulse-labeled fraction remains at different time points. We first confirmed that click chemistry-based capturing of heavy AHA-labeled proteins is highly specific and reproducible (Figures S1A–S1C). Next, we checked if AHA might itself affect protein degradation kinetics and found no evidence for this (Figures S1D–S1G). Peptides derived from both the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of AHA-labeled proteins had similar intensities, suggesting that AHA does not induce premature termination (Figure S1H). Collectively, these data indicate that AHA pulse-chase (AHA p-c) enables specific enrichment of newly synthesized proteins with no apparent impact on protein stability, consistent with previous reports (Cohen et al., 2013Cohen L.D. Zuchman R. Sorokina O. Müller A. Dieterich D.C. Armstrong J.D. Ziv T. Ziv N.E.

Bunse S. et al.Direct visualization of newly synthesized target proteins in situ.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For global quantification of protein degradation kinetics, we performed three parallel triple-SILAC experiments with different chase times (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 hr) in mouse fibroblasts (NIH 3T3). Heavy cells were always harvested immediately after the pulse and served as a common reference point. Exemplary mass spectra for a stable protein (filamin A [Flna]) and an unstable protein (cathepsin L [Ctsl1]) show expected slow and fast degradation, respectively (Figure 1C). The levels of basigin (Bsg) quickly decreased after the chase but then stabilized after ∼4 hr. This is consistent with the observation that most of the newly synthesized immature basigin is degraded while the mature form of the protein is stable (Tyler et al., 2012Tyler R.E. Pearce M.M.P. Shaler T.A. Olzmann J.A. Greenblatt E.J. Kopito R.R. Unassembled CD147 is an endogenous endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation substrate.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4668-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We combined the data from the three triple-SILAC experiments to obtain kinetic profiles with seven time points. To compensate for differences in cell numbers, we normalized the data using a selected set of very stable proteins (Figure S2; STAR Methods). We also subtracted background signals which could otherwise give rise to erroneous degradation profiles. The entire large-scale experiment was carried out three times, thus yielding data from three independent biological replicates. In total, we obtained profiles for 5,247 proteins (Figure 1D). After applying several quality filters (Figure S3A) we kept 3,605 profiles for further analysis (Figure S3E). Approximately half of these profiles were derived from at least two biological replicates, allowing us to assess reproducibility. Overall, reproducibility was very good with coefficients of variation (CVs, computed in log space) of <10% at time point 32 hr for ∼90% of the proteins (Figure S3F).Figure S3AHA Pulse-Chase Is Reproducible over Biological Replicates, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A–J) The reproducibility of the mouse NIH 3T3 AHA p-c data was evaluated at each of the three different filtering steps (A): i) 1% FDR filtering on PSM and protein level; SILAC Count > 1 and 10% cutoff (subfigures B, C and D). ii) Proteins were filtered to have more than four data points and an RSS smaller 0.05 (subfigures E, F and G). iii) Proteins were required to have a Δ-score based on the 4 and 8 hr time points (subfigures H, I and J). The overlap of proteins across the three experiments is shown as weighted Venn diagrams (B, E and H).

The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for each time point from the intersecting proteins across the experiments (C, F and I).

The second area contains 75% of decay profiles and so forth. Available data points per protein and time point are shown in D, G and J. To model our experimental protein degradation profiles, we adapted a Markov chain-based approach previously used to study mRNA decay (Figure 2A) (Deneke et al., 2013Deneke C. Lipowsky R. Valleriani A. Complex degradation processes lead to non-exponential decay patterns and age-dependent decay rates of messenger RNA.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e55442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We considered two different models. In the first model proteins only exist in a single state “A” that is characterized by a constant decay probability. This “1-state model” therefore describes exponential degradation (ED). The second model has an additional state: newly synthesized proteins first populate state A from where they can either be degraded or transit to state B, which is characterized by a different decay probability. This “2-state model” thus describes non-exponential degradation (NED). To distinguish between both scenarios, we compared the relative quality of both models for each protein degradation profile using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974Akaike H. A new look at the statistical model identification.IEEE Transactions Autom. Control. 1974; 19: 716-723Crossref Scopus (35882) Google Scholar). This approach considers the trade-off between the goodness of fit and model complexity (that is, the number of parameters). Hence, the 2-state-model is only preferred when the improved fit outweighs the increased complexity. The AIC thus provides a conservative estimate of the fraction of NED proteins. Degradation profiles of Ctsl1 and Flna were better explained by the 1-state model (Figure 2B). In contrast, the degradation profile of basigin was better explained by the 2-state model. Overall, we found that the profiles of 509 proteins are better explained by the 2-state model (Figure 2C, AIC probability >0.8). This corresponds to ∼14% of the 3,605 proteins that passed our quality criteria (Figure S3). We conclude that a sizable number of proteins show a tendency toward NED. In principle, the 2-state model can describe two different scenarios: when the degradation rate in state A is higher than in state B (kA > kB) the model describes proteins that become more stable as they age. Alternatively, when the degradation rate in state B is higher than in state A (kB > kA) the model describes destabilization of older proteins. Intriguingly, we only observed age-dependent stabilization (Figure 2D). This is surprising, as we originally expected proteins to become more unstable over time due to the cumulative effects of age-related damage. However, in our cell line model and within the time period monitored (32 hr) we did not find any evidence for this. While our AIC probability describes the relative quality of both models, it does not provide information about the extent of NED for individual proteins. We therefore also measured the distance of intermediate data points from the linear fit in the semi log plot (Figure 2E). This delta score (Δ-score) is a simple measure for the extent of non-exponentiality of individual degradation profiles. We then defined NED and ED proteins based on their AIC probabilities and Δ-scores (STAR Methods). With these filters, ∼10% of proteins were classified as NED and ∼50% as ED. The remaining proteins were classified as undefined (“UN,” Figure 2F). For all subsequent analyses, we relied on this classification (Table S1). In summary, our global quantification of cellular protein degradation kinetics reveals that many proteins become more stable once they have survived the first few hours of their existence. Although AHA labeling does not appear to globally affect protein degradation (Figure S1), it is still possible that labeling with an artificial amino acid introduces systematic biases. We therefore wanted to validate our data with independent methods. First, we compared protein degradation rates in the present study with previously published dynamic SILAC data from the same cell line (Schwanhäusser et al., 2011Schwanhäusser B. Busse D. Li N. Dittmar G. Schuchhardt J. Wolf J. Chen W. Selbach M. Global quantification of mammalian gene expression control.Nature. 2011; 473: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4059) Google Scholar) and found overall good agreement (Figures S4A–S4D). Second, we used classical radioactive pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation to confirm degradation kinetics of an ED and an NED protein (Figure S4E). Finally, to systematically validate our classification, we designed a novel SILAC-based strategy (Figure 3A): we pulse-labeled light cells with heavy SILAC medium for 4 hr. At this time point, the proteome consists of two populations of protein molecules: light proteins, which are older than 4 hr, and heavy proteins with an age between 0 and 4 hr. We harvested half of the cells to quantify the H/L ratio at this time point. Because NED proteins become more stable with age, the younger heavy protein molecules should degrade faster than the older light ones. We therefore cultivated the other half of cells on medium-heavy growth medium for 8 additional hours. This resulted in the expected decrease in H/L ratios for NED but not for ED proteins (Figures 3B–3D). Label swap experiments and different chase times confirmed this finding (Figures S4F–S4H). We computed a NED validation score based on the average rank of proteins across these SILAC pulse-chase experiments (Figures 3E and 3F). This score indicates how well non-exponential degradation could be validated for individual NED proteins and is included in Table S1. Because these validation experiments have longer pulse times and thus lower sensitivity, a low validation score of a NED protein should not be interpreted as evidence for erroneous classification.Figure 3Validation of AHA p-c DataShow full caption(A) Experimental design for direct validation of non-exponential decay.

(F) Counts of NED proteins for the different validation score bins. See also Figure S4. Having shown that a sizable number of proteins are non-exponentially degraded, we next asked how degradation occurs. The two major cellular protein degradation systems are the proteasome and the lysosome. We therefore used drugs, MG132 or wortmannin in combination with bafilomycin A1, to inhibit proteasomal or lysosomal degradation, respectively. To assess non-exponential degradation, we performed AHA p-c experiments with 4 and 8 hr chase times in the presence of the inhibitor or carrier controls (DMSO). The impact of both pathway inhibitions on NED was quantified by measuring their impact on the Δ-score (Figure 4A). Proteasome inhibition reduced Δ-scores of most NED proteins (Figures 4B and 4D; Table S2). In contrast, inhibition of the lysosome did not have an observable impact (Figures 4C and 4E; Table S2). We conclude that the ubiquitin proteasome system is involved in the initial degradation of most NED proteins. We next characterized features that distinguish ED and NED proteins and found that NED proteins are on average more abundant and have a higher degree of secondary structure (Figure S5A). Moreover, many NED proteins are members of annotated heteromeric complexes (Figures S5A and S5B). Mapping the data to protein structures showed that 70% of NED proteins are members of heteromeric protein complexes, which is a significant enrichment relative to ED and UN proteins (Figures 5A and S5C; Table S3).Figure 5NED and Protein ComplexesShow full caption(A) NED proteins are significantly overrepresented in heteromeric protein complexes (Fisher’s exact test, heteromeric versus monomeric or homomeric subunits).

https://openalex.org/W2527849633,"Synapses are often far from the soma and independently cope with proteopathic stress induced by intense neuronal activity. However, how presynaptic compartments turn over proteins is poorly understood. We show that the synapse-enriched protein EndophilinA, thus far studied for its role in endocytosis, induces macroautophagy at presynaptic terminals. We find that EndophilinA executes this unexpected function at least partly independent of its role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. EndophilinA-induced macroautophagy is activated when the kinase LRRK2 phosphorylates the EndophilinA-BAR domain and is blocked in animals where EndophilinA cannot be phosphorylated. EndophilinA-phosphorylation promotes the formation of highly curved membranes, and reconstitution experiments show these curved membranes serve as docking stations for autophagic factors, including Atg3. Functionally, deregulation of the EndophilinA phosphorylation state accelerates activity-induced neurodegeneration. Given that EndophilinA is connected to at least three Parkinson's disease genes (LRRK2, Parkin and Synaptojanin), dysfunction of EndophilinA-dependent synaptic macroautophagy may be common in this disorder."

Here, whole transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis followed by gain- and loss-of-function experiments identified Cacna2d2, the gene encoding the Alpha2delta2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), as a developmental switch that limits axon growth and regeneration. Cacna2d2 gene deletion or silencing promoted axon growth in vitro. In vivo, Alpha2delta2 pharmacological blockade through Pregabalin (PGB) administration enhanced axon regeneration in adult mice after spinal cord injury (SCI). As PGB is already an established treatment for a wide range of neurological disorders, our findings suggest that targeting Alpha2delta2 may be a novel treatment strategy to promote structural plasticity and regeneration following CNS trauma."

We achieved synergistic effects of these two hormones and mitigation of their adverse effects by engineering chemical conjugates enabling delivery of both activities within one precisely targeted molecule. Coordinated glucagon and T3 actions synergize to correct hyperlipidemia, steatohepatitis, atherosclerosis, glucose intolerance, and obesity in metabolically compromised mice. We demonstrate that each hormonal constituent mutually enriches cellular processes in hepatocytes and adipocytes via enhanced hepatic cholesterol metabolism and white fat browning. Synchronized signaling driven by glucagon and T3 reciprocally minimizes the inherent harmful effects of each hormone. Liver-directed T3 action offsets the diabetogenic liability of glucagon, and glucagon-mediated delivery spares the cardiovascular system from adverse T3 action. Our findings support the therapeutic utility of integrating these hormones into a single molecular entity that offers unique potential for treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2529695649,"Even a simple sensory stimulus can elicit distinct innate behaviors and sequences. During sensorimotor decisions, competitive interactions among neurons that promote distinct behaviors must ensure the selection and maintenance of one behavior, while suppressing others. The circuit implementation of these competitive interactions is still an open question. By combining comprehensive electron microscopy reconstruction of inhibitory interneuron networks, modeling, electrophysiology, and behavioral studies, we determined the circuit mechanisms that contribute to the Drosophila larval sensorimotor decision to startle, explore, or perform a sequence of the two in response to a mechanosensory stimulus. Together, these studies reveal that, early in sensory processing, (1) reciprocally connected feedforward inhibitory interneurons implement behavioral choice, (2) local feedback disinhibition provides positive feedback that consolidates and maintains the chosen behavior, and (3) lateral disinhibition promotes sequence transitions. The combination of these interconnected circuit motifs can implement both behavior selection and the serial organization of behaviors into a sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2528136962,"Chemerin is a small chemotactic protein originally identified as the natural ligand of CMKLR1. More recently, two other receptors, GPR1 and CCRL2, have been reported to bind chemerin but their functional relevance remains poorly understood. In this study, we compared the binding and signaling properties of the three human chemerin receptors and showed differences in mode of chemerin binding and receptor signaling. Chemerin binds to all three receptors with low nanomolar affinities. However, the contribution of the chemerin C-terminus to binding efficiency varies greatly amongst receptors. By using BRET-based biosensors monitoring the activation of various G proteins, we showed that binding of chemerin and the chemerin 9 nonapeptide (149YFPGQFAFS157) to CMKLR1 activates the three Gαi subtypes (Gαi1, Gαi2 and Gαi3) and the two Gαo isoforms (Gαoa and Gαob) with potencies correlated to binding affinities. In contrast, no significant activation of G proteins was detected upon binding of chemerin to GPR1 or CCRL2. Binding of chemerin and the chemerin 9 peptide also induced the recruitment of β-arrestin1 and 2 to CMKLR1 and GPR1, though to various degree, but not to CCRL2. However, the propensity of chemerin 9 to activate β-arrestins relative to chemerin is higher when bound to GPR1. Finally, we showed that binding of chemerin to CMKLR1 and GPR1 promotes also the internalization of the two receptors and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAP kinases, although with a different efficiency, and that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 requires both Gαi/o and β-arrestin2 activation but not β-arrestin1. Collectively, these data support a model in which each chemerin receptor displays selective signaling properties."

This study demonstrates that factors influencing efficacy extend beyond receptor conformation(s) and expands understanding of the molecular basis for how G proteins control/influence efficacy. This has important implications for the mechanisms that underlie ligand-mediated biased agonism. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell-surface receptors, sensing a diverse array of stimuli from the extracellular environment and transmitting these signals to evoke cellular responses. This fundamental function is encapsulated by the concept of efficacy, which relates receptor occupancy by an agonist to the magnitude of the cellular response (Kenakin, 2002Kenakin T. Drug efficacy at G protein-coupled receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 349-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The existence of ligands displaying different efficacies and, in particular, ligands displaying preferential signaling to different effectors has led to a model in which GPCRs can adopt multiple active states (Kenakin, 2002Kenakin T. Drug efficacy at G protein-coupled receptors.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 349-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2013Kim T.H. Chung K.Y. Manglik A. Hansen A.L.

Soc. 2013; 135: 9465-9474Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Such ligand-directed signaling bias (biased agonism) is now an important focus in drug discovery (Kenakin and Christopoulos, 2013Kenakin T. Christopoulos A. Signalling bias in new drug discovery: Detection, quantification and therapeutic impact.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), but there are limited data addressing the mechanisms by which such differential efficacy occurs. GPCRs are highly dynamic proteins that rapidly sample a range of both active and inactive conformations (Deupi and Kobilka, 2010Deupi X. Kobilka B.K. Energy landscapes as a tool to integrate GPCR structure, dynamics, and function.Physiology (Bethesda). 2010; 25: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Activation of GPCRs occurs due to changes in the proportion of time the receptor spends in one or more active states upon agonist binding. This is due to a relative decrease in the energy state of the active receptor in the receptor:agonist complex (Deupi and Kobilka, 2010Deupi X. Kobilka B.K. Energy landscapes as a tool to integrate GPCR structure, dynamics, and function.Physiology (Bethesda). 2010; 25: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The principal driver for differential efficacy is thought to be distinct receptor conformations stabilized by different ligands. For example, ligands with distinct efficacies show divergent sampling of conformational space for the β2-adrenoceptor (ADRB2) (Nygaard et al., 2013Nygaard R. Zou Y. Dror R.O. Mildorf T.J. Arlow D.H.

These divergent active conformations are thought to have different affinities for their cognate G protein hetero-trimer, providing a mechanism by which agonists could achieve differential receptor activation.

Ther. 2001; 297: 1218-1226PubMed Google Scholar, however, provided the first hint that the ligand-receptor complex may also distinctly affect G protein conformations, and this has been supported by G protein fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in the presence of partial versus full agonists (Nikolaev et al., 2006Nikolaev V.O. Hoffmann C. Bünemann M. Lohse M.J. Vilardaga J.-P. Molecular basis of partial agonism at the neurotransmitter alpha2A-adrenergic receptor and Gi-protein heterotrimer.J. Biol.

Conformational dynamics of a G-protein α subunit is tightly regulated by nucleotide binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E3629-E3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar has shown that the Gα subunit itself is highly dynamic, sampling a number of conformations in both GDP-bound and nucleotide-free states. Nonetheless, these data on differences in receptor:G protein complexes have principally been interpreted as differences in G protein recruitment to the receptor due to distinct ligand-receptor conformations. At the most basic level, the role of the GPCR is as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), responsible for stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP at the Gα subunit of hetero-trimeric G proteins resulting in their activation. By extension therefore, the formation of an agonist:receptor complex potentiates the receptor’s GEF activity; thus, the agonist is a positive allosteric modulator of the GPCRs GEF activity. As such, we posit that efficacy differences must translate into differential GEF activity of the GPCR. This could be due to differences in GPCR affinity for G protein but potentially also due to agonist-dependent conformational differences in G proteins, resulting in changes to nucleotide exchange rate.

We sought to understand the mechanistic basis of the differential efficacy displayed by hCT and sCT at the CTR. Here, we demonstrate that variations in cellular efficacy are correlated with agonist-dependent, conformational differences promoted in G proteins. This current work extends the concept of conformational selection at the level of the agonist:receptor complex to one that includes conformation selection at the level of the agonist:receptor:G protein complex. The CTR is most strongly coupled to the stimulatory G alpha subunit, Gαs, upstream of adenylate-cyclase-mediated cAMP production. To define the cellular efficacy of hCT and sCT, we performed cAMP accumulation and ligand binding assays (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A–S1E ). Consistent with previous publications (Andreassen et al., 2014Andreassen K.V. Hjuler S.T. Furness S.G. Sexton P.M. Christopoulos A. Nosjean O. Karsdal M.A. Henriksen K.

We performed competition binding on whole cells and isolated plasma membranes to determine the affinity constants for both ligands (Figures 1B and S1A–S1E). sCT had high affinity for the receptor that could be defined by a single binding constant. In contrast, hCT had lower affinity with two discernible affinity states, both of which are lower than that of sCT. Similar to certain chemokine GPCRs (Di Salvo et al., 2000Di Salvo J. Koch G.E.

The observed affinity represents a composite of all the interchangeable affinity states of the receptor at equilibrium (Liu et al., 2012Liu J.J. Horst R. Katritch V. Stevens R.C. Wüthrich K.

To define the particular affinity state(s) associated with the ternary complex containing native Gαs, we explicitly identified this complex using native PAGE (Wittig et al., 2006Wittig I. Braun H.-P. Schägger H. Blue native PAGE.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, Wittig et al., 2007Wittig I. Karas M. Schägger H. High resolution clear native electrophoresis for in-gel functional assays and fluorescence studies of membrane protein complexes.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) (Figures 1C, 1D, S2, and 2B). This allowed us to directly establish concentration-response curves for agonist promoted recruitment of Gαs protein (Figures 1C and 1D). Similar to measures of ligand affinity (Figure 1B), sCT had an ∼10-fold greater potency over hCT for promotion of Gαs recruitment (Figure 1D). This suggests that the equivalent efficacy of the ligands in cAMP accumulation (Figure 1A) was not purely driven by efficiency of G protein recruitment (Figures 1A versus 1D). To better understand the nature of the agonist:receptor:G protein (ternary) complex, the relative stoichiometry of receptor and G protein was defined by using Fab fragments to induce discrete mobility shifts (Figures 2A–2C). The presence of a single shift in mobility of the ternary complex with increasing concentrations of Fab against the receptor indicated a monomeric receptor in the G protein-bound complex (Figure 2A). In contrast, in the absence of agonist, the two different receptor bands undergo either single or double Fab-induced mobility shifts, suggesting both monomeric and dimeric receptor species (Figure 2C). Taken together with the loss of dimeric receptor with increasing G protein interaction (Figure 2B), this indicated that the ligand-responsive receptor species is dimeric, but, upon G protein binding, the dimeric interface weakens and G protein activation occurs in cis (Figure 2A and compare with Figure S2). This is consistent with a proposed model for β1 adrenergic receptor activation where the dimer interface partially overlaps the G protein-binding interface (Huang et al., 2013Huang J. Chen S. Zhang J.J. Huang X.-Y. Crystal structure of oligomeric β1-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptors in ligand-free basal state.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and is depicted in the cartoon in Figure 2H. The apparent mobility observed for the ternary complex by native PAGE was lower than predicted from the molecular weight of the individual components. As an additional confirmation, the same relative mobility (∼440 kDa) and stoichiometry (1:1:1:1 [molecular weight divided by intensity]) of the ternary complex was observed when expressed and purified from insect cells (Figures 2D and 2E).Figure 2CTR Activates Gαs in cis and the GTP Affinity of the Ternary Complex Is Agonist DependentShow full captionAll n numbers for all experiments were performed with different (plasma) membrane preparations on different days.(A) A representative mobility shift assay (n = 3) using an Fab directed against the N-terminal epitope tag of CTR shows that the ternary complex contains only one CTR protomer, which is shown in cartoon with CTR in blue.(B) A representative two-color blot (n = 4) of ligand-dependent transition of CTR (yellow) and Gαs (magenta) to the ternary complex indicating the mobility of CTR increases as it transitions to the ternary complex, consistent with a transition from the dimeric complex (Figure S2).(C) Plasma-membrane preparations from COS-7 cells expressing CTR were incubated with increasing amounts of anti-CTR C-terminal Fab (1H10, IgG2a) during solubilization in digitonin at 6 g/g for 50 min at 4°C, separation on a 4%–13.5% blue native page and transfer.

Both ligands were analyzed on the same gel, which revealed that, although there was no difference in the amount of G protein recruited (Figure 2G, Emax not significantly different), the hCT-occupied complex was disrupted by GTP at ∼10-fold lower GTP concentration than for sCT-occupied complexes (Figures 2F and 2G).

To determine the causal roles of the amygdala and VS in RL, the present study used computational modeling to quantify the effect of targeted excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala or VS on monkeys’ choice behavior in a two-arm bandit task. We show that VS is necessary for learning stochastic reward associations and that the amygdala contributes substantially to RL in both stochastic and deterministic environments. We tested rhesus macaques on a two-armed bandit reversal learning task using deterministic or stochastic reward schedules (Figure 1A). The subjects included four monkeys with bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala (Figure 1B), three monkeys with bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the VS (Figure 1C), and four unoperated controls. The monkeys were first tested on randomly interleaved blocks following one of three probabilistic reward schedules: 80%/20%, 70%/30%, and 60%/40%. Learning was impaired in both lesion groups compared to controls. To determine whether their deficits were specific to the stochastic task, we next tested the monkeys on the same task using a deterministic reward schedule (100%/0%). The task was carried out in blocks of 80 trials. On each trial, a pair of visual cues were displayed as choice options. One cue was associated with a greater probability of reward delivery than the other. The monkeys were allowed to select one cue per trial by making a saccade to the selected cue. By sampling the stimulus-reward outcomes across trials, they could determine which of the two cues was more often rewarded. The stimulus-reward mappings of the two options were reversed once per block on a randomly chosen trial between trials 30 and 50. At the end of the block, two new cues were introduced (signaling the start of a new block), and the monkeys again had to discover by trial and error which of the two options was more often rewarded. To assess motivation, we quantified the percentage of aborted trials per session due to a failure to acquire/hold central fixation or a failure to make a choice-related saccade. The lesion (VS: 12.83%; amygdala: 12.78%) and control (11.16%) groups did not differ in the percentage of trials aborted due to fixation errors (F(2,204) = 1.77, p = 0.173). In addition, the lesion (VS: 0.31%; amygdala: 0.26%) and control (0.01%) groups did not differ in the percentage of trials aborted due to choice errors (F(2,205) = 1.82, p = 0.165). We also computed how quickly the monkeys acquired central fixation. Fixation reaction times (RTs) were faster in the VS lesion group compared to the amygdala (t(197) = 17.4, p < 0.001) or control (t(157) = 16.23, p < 0.001) groups. Fixation RTs were similar in the amygdala and control groups (t(204) = −1.15, p = 0.251; Table S1). Therefore, lesion effects on RL are not attributable to reduced motivation. To visualize the monkeys’ choice behavior, we aligned the trials in each block around the reversal point estimated by a Bayesian change-point analysis (Figure 2; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In both the deterministic (Figure 2A) and stochastic (Figure 2B) tasks, monkeys learned to select the better option and to switch their choice behavior once they detected the contingency reversal. To quantify lesion effects on choice behavior, we computed the fraction of correct choices in the acquisition and reversal phases (Figure 2C). Group performance differed in the deterministic task when averaged across acquisition and reversal (F(2,41) = 74.59, p < 0.001). The striatal lesion group performed worse than the controls (t(19) = −7.79, p < 0.001), and the monkeys with amygdala lesions performed worse than those with striatal lesions (t(33) = −6.23, p < 0.001). Choice accuracy also differed by group in the stochastic task (Figure 2C; F(2,232) = 289.71, p < 0.001). Again, monkeys with striatal lesions chose the correct option less often than controls (t(145) = −13.77, p < 0.001) but more often than animals with amygdala lesions (t(156) = 7.41, p < 0.001). The control group also showed improved performance in the reversal phase compared to the acquisition phase, whereas in the VS and amygdala lesion groups, performance declined in the reversal phase (group × phase, F(2,232) = 15.57, p < 0.001). Although the reward schedule influenced performance (F(2,461) = 407.57, p < 0.001), controls showed greater linear improvement relative to the VS (t(142) = 7.7, p < 0.001) or amygdala (t(160) = 11.48, p < 0.001; group × schedule, F(4,461) = 29.05, p < 0.001) lesion groups. Schedule-related performance increases were equivalent in the two lesion groups (t(154) = 1.53, p = 0.131). We also used a logistic regression model to quantify how previous trial choices and outcomes influenced the monkeys’ ongoing choice behavior (Figure 2D). A positive regression coefficient indicated that the monkeys chose the same rewarded or unrewarded option that they chose on a past trial. In both tasks, the monkeys’ current choices were influenced more by past choices that were rewarded versus unrewarded. In the deterministic (group × outcome, F(2,42) = 4.85, p = 0.009) and stochastic (group × outcome, F(2,208) = 261.07, p < 0.001) tasks, regression coefficients differed between the lesion and control groups as a function of outcome. Across tasks, the mean regression coefficient weighting rewarded outcomes was larger in controls compared to the VS (deterministic: t(19) = 7.12, p < 0.001; stochastic: t(143) = 13.96, p < 0.001) or amygdala (deterministic: t(30) = 11.37, p < 0.001; stochastic: t(163) = 18.67, p < 0.001) lesion groups. In the deterministic task, the mean regression coefficient for unrewarded outcomes did not differ between the lesion and control groups (F(2,42) = 3.09, p = 0.056). In the stochastic task, however, unrewarded outcomes were weighted less in controls compared to the amygdala (t(164) = −10.6, p < 0.001) or VS (t(144) = −6.52, p < 0.001) lesion groups. We assessed whether an RL model best fit the monkeys’ choice behavior compared to alternative models (Figure 3; Table S2). We compared Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) estimates for the following four models: (1) a feedback-dependent RL model that incorporated different learning rate parameters for positive and negative outcomes, (2) a non-feedback-dependent RL model (e.g., Rescorla-Wagner), (3) a win-stay/lose-shift model, and (4) a Bayesian ideal observer model (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). BIC estimates were lowest overall when we fit the feedback-dependent RL model to each group’s choice behavior in the deterministic (Figure 3A) and stochastic (Figure 3B) tasks. Overlay of averaged model predictions and actual choice behavior showed that this model accurately fit the monkeys’ choices (Figure 3C), which was also seen in scatterplots of predicted and measured choice behavior (Figure 3D). Therefore, we proceeded by comparing feedback-dependent RL model parameter fits for the lesion and control groups. We first analyzed how quickly the monkeys learned to update the expected value of each choice option based on positive and negative feedback. Positive and negative learning rates were fit for choices that resulted in reward or no reward, respectively. In the deterministic task (Figure 4A), positive and negative learning rates did not differ (F(1,42) = 3.44, p = 0.071). In the stochastic task (Figure 4B), learning was driven more by positive, rather than negative, feedback (F(1,231) = 273.84, p < 0.001), and mean learning rates were higher in the reversal phase compared to the acquisition phase (F(1,234) = 45.16, p < 0.001). There were no effects of reward schedule on learning rates in the stochastic task (p > 0.6 for all main effects and interactions). Next, we examined group differences in learning rates. In the deterministic task, the groups differed in their mean learning rate (F(2,42) = 12.93, p < 0.001; Figure 4A). Specifically, the mean learning rate was reduced in monkeys with amygdala lesions compared to those with VS lesions (t(34) = −3.99, p < 0.001) or intact controls (t(30) = −4.23, p < 0.001). The mean learning rate did not differ between the VS lesion and control groups (t(19) = 0.85, p = 0.431). Thus, in a deterministic reward environment, learning rates were only impaired in the monkeys with amygdala lesions. When we analyzed the learning rates in the stochastic task, mean learning rates were lower in both the amygdala and VS lesion groups (F(2,234) = 37.18, p < 0.001; Figure 4B). Learning from positive feedback was reduced in the monkeys with amygdala (t(165) = −8.64, p < 0.001) or VS (t(146) = −8.14, p < 0.001) lesions compared to controls. Learning from negative feedback was also reduced in the amygdala lesion group (t(166) = −3.42, p < 0.001) relative to controls. Negative learning rates did not differ between the VS lesion and control groups (t(146) = 2.4, p = 0.116). To summarize, monkeys with amygdala lesions showed deficits in feedback-dependent learning in both the stochastic and deterministic tasks, whereas monkeys with VS lesions only showed learning deficits in the stochastic task relative to controls. Because the VS lesion group was more affected in the stochastic task, we also examined how learning rates changed across the two tasks. For the stochastic task, we averaged learning rates across schedules and directly compared them to learning rates in the deterministic task. Negative learning rates were lower in the stochastic versus the deterministic task (F(1,41) = 25.93, p < 0.001), and this effect was consistent in the lesion and control groups (group × task, F(2,41) = 1.19, p = 0.314). However, there were clear task-related differences between the lesion and control groups in learning from positive feedback (group × task, F(2,41) = 8.96, p < 0.001). For the VS lesion (t(11) = −4.58, p < 0.001) and control (t(8) = −6.59, p < 0.001) groups, positive learning rates decreased in the stochastic versus the deterministic task. This was not the case for the amygdala lesion group, in which positive learning rates were equivalent in the stochastic and deterministic tasks (t(22) = 0.43, p = 0.666). Thus, task effects were confined to learning from positive feedback, supporting the differences found between the lesion and control groups in each task. We next quantified choice consistency using the inverse temperature parameter β from the RL model. This parameter quantified how consistently the monkeys chose the higher-value option; therefore, smaller inverse temperature values were indicative of noisier choice behavior. For both the deterministic (F(1,42) = 11.32, p = 0.002) and stochastic (F(1,232) = 39.74, p < 0.001) tasks, choice consistency was higher in the acquisition phase compared to the reversal phase (Figures 4C and 4D). In both the deterministic (F(2,42) = 11.16, p < 0.001) and stochastic (F(2,228) = 39.74, p < 0.001) tasks, choice consistency was reduced in the lesion groups relative to controls (Figures 4C and 4D). Compared to controls, monkeys with amygdala lesions (deterministic: t(31) = −4.42, p < 0.001; stochastic: t(155) = 14.28, p < 0.001) or VS lesions (deterministic: t(20) = −2.62, p = 0.016; stochastic: t(143) = −6.7, p < 0.001) less consistently chose the higher-value option. In the deterministic task, the lesion groups showed equivalent decreases in choice consistency (t(33) = −1.82, p = 0.078), whereas in the stochastic task, the amygdala lesion group was less consistent than the VS lesion group (t(158) = −2.44, p = 0.016). Also, in the stochastic task, the reward schedule modulated choice consistency only in the control group (group × schedule, F(4,476) = 2.51, p = 0.041). In controls (schedule, F(2,155) = 5.09, p = 0.007), choice consistency was higher in the 80%/20% schedule compared to the 70%/30% (t(156) = 2.38, p = 0.018) or 60%/40% (t(156) = 3.03, p = 0.002) schedules but did not differ in the latter two schedules. When we examined how inverse temperature values changed across the two tasks, we found that they were slightly higher in the stochastic task compared to the deterministic task (F(1,216) = 4.79, p = 0.031), and this effect was consistent in the lesion and control groups (group × task, F(2,181) < 1, p = 0.723). Therefore, the monkeys with VS and amygdala lesions exhibited noisier choice behavior in general. Choice RTs differed between the lesion and control animals (Figure 5; Table S1). The monkeys with VS lesions were faster compared to the monkeys with amygdala lesions or controls in both the deterministic (F(2,42) = 84.81, p < 0.001) and the stochastic (F(2,228) = 802.6, p < 0.001) tasks. Consistent with this result, the choice RT distribution of the VS lesion group was shifted left compared to the control (Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] test deterministic: p < 0.001; stochastic: p < 0.001) or amygdala lesion (deterministic: p < 0.001; stochastic: p < 0.001) groups. Choice RTs did not differ between the amygdala lesion and control groups in either task (all p values > 0.14). In addition, RTs did not differ by task (F(1,250) < 1, p = 0.797), and there were no effects of reward schedule on choice RTs in any group. The observation of faster choice RTs in the VS lesion group suggests that their less consistent selection of high-value options was related to a speed-accuracy trade-off (i.e., faster responses led to less accurate choices). To visualize how choice RTs were related to choice accuracy, we extracted the softmax probability for each of the monkeys’ choices from the RL model. These estimates indicated the probability that monkeys’ choices would be rewarded on a given trial. We then used Gaussian kernel regression to determine the function relating RTs to choice probabilities for each block, sampled the function in equally spaced 20 ms RT bins, and averaged the function estimates across blocks. This was done for both the deterministic and stochastic tasks (Figures 5A and 5B). In each task, it was clear that choice accuracy increased along with RT from about 100 ms up to approximately 225 ms, after which it plateaued before decreasing as RT further increased. This relationship between RTs and choice probabilities was consistent in all three groups, although there were vertical shifts in the curves. To quantify the relationship between RTs and choice probabilities, we computed the correlation coefficient for each block of trials and averaged them by reward schedule and session (Figure 5C). The correlation magnitude increased along with the reward schedule (F(2,457) = 4.16, p = 0.016). The lesion and control groups differed in the magnitude and sign of the correlation coefficient relating choice RT and accuracy. In the deterministic task (group, F(2,42) = 5.87, p = 0.006), direct comparison of correlation coefficients by group confirmed a larger, positive correlation in the VS lesion group compared to the amygdala lesion (t(37) = 2.46, p = 0.023) or control (t(20) = 3.19, p = 0.005) groups. Similarly, in the stochastic task, collapsed across schedules, there was a larger, positive correlation in the VS lesion group compared to the amygdala (t(153) = 7.46, p < 0.001) or control (t(143) = 3.12, p < 0.001) groups. The VS lesion group’s choice RTs were faster overall and showed a speed-accuracy trade-off. Their less consistent selection of high-value options might therefore be due to the VS lesion group acting impulsively—especially in the deterministic task, where striatal lesions had a minor effect on choice consistency relative to controls. To test this hypothesis, we matched the choice RT distributions of the lesion groups and controls pairwise and computed the fraction of times the monkeys in each group chose the higher-value option in each task. When the choice RT distributions of the VS and control groups were matched in the deterministic task (Figures 6A and 6C ), the fraction of correct choices was equivalent in the VS lesion and control groups (t(19) = 1.294, p = 0.211). This indicates that the effect of VS lesions on choice consistency in the deterministic task was limited to trials in which the animals responded too quickly. In the stochastic task, however, equating group choice RT distributions did not mitigate previously identified differences in choice accuracy between the VS lesion group and controls (F(1,141) = 36.6, p < 0.001; Figures 6B and 6C). For example, in the 80%/20% schedule, choice performance was consistently lower in the VS lesion group compared to controls after matching the choice RT distributions (t(143) = −5.73, p < 0.001; Figure 6B). The amygdala lesion and control groups did not differ in their choice RT distributions. Thus, we did not expect matching these groups’ choice RTs would eliminate differences in choice consistency. Even after choice RTs were matched, monkeys with amygdala lesions showed decreased choice consistency relative to controls in the deterministic (t(30) = −5.88, p < 0.001) and stochastic (F(1,149) = 196.6, p < 0.001) tasks. RPEs can promote learning directly or indirectly by altering attention to reward predictive cues (Roesch et al., 2012Roesch M.R. Esber G.R. Li J. Daw N.D. Schoenbaum G. Surprise!

The amygdala appears to utilize error signals to modulate attention during learning (Roesch et al., 2012Roesch M.R. Esber G.R. Li J. Daw N.D. Schoenbaum G. Surprise!

Therefore, we fit a hybrid Pearce-Hall (PH) model (Li et al., 2011Li J. Schiller D. Schoenbaum G. Phelps E.A. Daw N.D. Differential roles of human striatum and amygdala in associative learning.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1250-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) to the monkeys’ choices to examine how amygdala and VS lesions affected attentional gating of learning. This model contains an associability parameter that modulates the learning rate as a function of the absolute magnitude of past RPEs. When RPEs are large, associability (i.e., attention) is increased. The model has two free parameters, κ and η (Table S3). The κ parameter refers to a fixed scalar that modulates value updating of each cue, akin to the learning rate parameter in the feedback-dependent RL model (to control model complexity, we did not fit separate learning rate parameters for positive and negative feedback). The η parameter is a decay parameter that controls the temporal dynamics of associability over time. The fitted κ parameters were consistent with the learning rate results found using the feedback-dependent RL model. In the deterministic task, κ (Figure 7A) was reduced in the monkeys with amygdala lesions (t(30) = 2.32, p = 0.027) relative to controls. For the VS lesion group, the value of κ did not differ from the amygdala lesion (t(33) < 1, p = 0.517) or control (t(19) = −1.56, p = 0.136; group, F(2,42) = 2.62, p = 0.084) groups. In the stochastic task, by contrast, κ was reduced in both the amygdala (t(163) = −5.13, p < 0.001) and VS (t(145) = −3.78, p < 0.001) lesion groups compared to controls (F(2,233) = 14.16, p < 0.001). In the deterministic task, η values only marginally differed between the lesion and control groups (F(2,41) = 3.08, p = 0.057; Figure 7B)."

As growing evidence indicates that reducing the steady-state levels of disease-causing proteins mitigates neurodegeneration in animal models, we developed a strategy to screen for genes that decrease the levels of tau, whose accumulation contributes to the pathology of both Alzheimer disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Integrating parallel cell-based and Drosophila genetic screens, we discovered that tau levels are regulated by Nuak1, an AMPK-related kinase. Nuak1 stabilizes tau by phosphorylation specifically at Ser356. Inhibition of Nuak1 in fruit flies suppressed neurodegeneration in tau-expressing Drosophila, and Nuak1 haploinsufficiency rescued the phenotypes of a tauopathy mouse model. These results demonstrate that decreasing total tau levels is a valid strategy for mitigating tau-related neurodegeneration and reveal Nuak1 to be a novel therapeutic entry point for tauopathies."

Excessive alcohol use is among the leading causes of preventable death worldwide (WHO, 2014WHO (2014).

While many variables contribute to the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD), exposure to stressful life events represents a significant risk factor (Keyes et al., 2012Keyes K.M.

These discrepancies indicate that the basic neuronal mechanisms linking stress and alcohol use are not well understood. Stress-induced changes in alcohol use likely arise from an interaction between the stress and reward systems of the brain (Spanagel et al., 2014Spanagel R. Noori H.R. Heilig M.

At the cellular level, both stress hormones and ethanol influence the DA system by direct actions on DA neurons or indirectly via changes in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (Niehaus et al., 2010Niehaus J.L.

Stress hormone signaling also may alter midbrain GABAA receptor signaling, but the molecular mechanism underlying this adaptation has not been identified (Doyon et al., 2013Doyon W.M. Dong Y.

Stress-induced plasticity of GABAergic inhibition.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Alternatively, acute stress exposure has been shown to induce a paradoxical shift toward excitatory GABAA receptor signaling within the HPA axis by altering the intracellular anion homeostasis (Hewitt et al., 2009Hewitt S.A. Wamsteeker J.I. Kurz E.U. Bains J.S. Altered chloride homeostasis removes synaptic inhibitory constraint of the stress axis.Nat.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 18198-18210Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Given that the GABAA receptor is a target of ethanol, we postulated that alterations in GABAA receptor transmission could contribute to an interaction between stress and ethanol self-administration. To examine the interaction between stress and ethanol, we exposed drug-naive rats to stress and then measured their subsequent ethanol intake. Concomitant with increases in ethanol self-administration, we show that acute stress attenuates ethanol-induced DA neuron firing in the VTA and DA release at target regions. These stress hormone-dependent effects were mediated by an increase in VTA GABAergic inhibition onto DA neurons in response to ethanol. Stress induced the functional downregulation of KCC2, shifting GABAA receptor signaling toward excitation of some downstream GABA neurons. Pharmacological activation of KCC2 restored the GABAergic circuitry and DA neuron signaling and prevented the escalation in ethanol self-administration induced by stress. These results indicate that a shift toward excitatory GABA signaling within the mesolimbic system is associated with increased drinking after exposure to stress. We first examined how a single episode of restraint stress alters subsequent ethanol intake measured during daily operant self-administration sessions (Figure 1A). Stable lever pressing for saccharin (0.125%, w/v) was first established followed by the introduction of ethanol (2%–4%) into the drinking solution (Doyon et al., 2013Doyon W.M. Dong Y. Ostroumov A.

Animals were subjected to restraint stress (1 hr) approximately 15 hr prior to the first ethanol self-administration session. The 15 hr separation between the stress and ethanol self-administration was chosen to examine the lasting impact on neural circuits, not the immediate proximal influence of the stressor itself (Noori et al., 2014Noori H.R.

Biol. 2014; 19: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Pre-exposure to stress caused a significant and long-lasting increase in ethanol self-administration compared to the non-stressed control group (Figure 1A): group: F(1,21) = 19.32, p < 0.01. Blood-ethanol levels were measured in a subset of animals and were correlated with ethanol intake (Figure 1B). Stressed rats showed significantly higher blood-ethanol levels (120.8 ± 13.6 mg/dL, n = 5) than non-stressed rats (61.3 ± 4.3 mg/dL, n = 10, p < 0.01). Mean intake of ethanol over the first 7 days was 0.74 ± 0.03 g/kg for the control group (n = 19) and 0.95 ± 0.03 g/kg for the stressed group (n = 16, p < 0.01) (Figure 1C, black and red bars). Elevated drinking after stress was also observed at higher ethanol concentrations (7%–10%) over a 3-week period (Figures S1A and S1B). Therefore, acute restraint stress induced robust changes in the acquisition and maintenance of ethanol-drinking behavior. Restraint stress is known to increase circulating glucocorticoid levels (Pitman et al., 1988Pitman D.L. Ottenweller J.E. Natelson B.H. Plasma corticosterone levels during repeated presentation of two intensities of restraint stress: chronic stress and habituation.Physiol. Behav. 1988; 43: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effect of stress on drinking was mediated by stress hormone signaling, we pretreated a separate group of rats with RU486 (a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist) prior to stress. Pretreatment with systemic RU486 prevented the stress from increasing subsequent ethanol self-administration (Figure 1C, dark blue bar; 0.67 ± 0.07 g/kg). To determine whether stress hormone signaling acted locally within the DA system (Spanagel et al., 2014Spanagel R. Noori H.R. Heilig M. Stress and alcohol interactions: animal studies and clinical significance.Trends Neurosci. 2014; 37: 219-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Uhart and Wand, 2009Uhart M. Wand G.S. Stress, alcohol and drug interaction: an update of human research.Addict. Biol. 2009; 14: 43-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we microinfused RU486 bilaterally into the VTA prior to stress exposure. Intra-VTA administration of RU486 (Figure S1C) prevented the stress from increasing subsequent ethanol self-administration (Figure 1C, light blue bar; 0.55 ± 0.05 g/kg), revealing that the effect of stress requires glucocorticoid receptor activation within the VTA. In non-stressed control rats, RU486 did not significantly influence ethanol intake when administered systemically or by local microinfusion (Figure 1C, gray bar on the right; 0.67 ± 0.04 g/kg), demonstrating a selective effect of RU486 on stress-induced drinking. Additional control experiments with saccharin and palatable food suggest that the effect of stress we observe was specific to ethanol self-administration (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Because ethanol self-administration involves DA signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) (Gonzales et al., 2004Gonzales R.A. Job M.O. Doyon W.M. The role of mesolimbic dopamine in the development and maintenance of ethanol reinforcement.Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 103: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that stress might also alter ethanol-induced DA release in the NAc. To test this hypothesis, we subjected rats to 1 hr restraint stress 15 hr prior to ethanol exposure, and we collected microdialysis samples to measure changes in the extracellular DA concentration in response to ethanol administration (Figure 2A). We observed a sustained increase in DA levels in the control group (Figure 2B, black trace), but stressed animals showed a blunted DA response to ethanol (Figure 2B, red trace): group × time: F(10,160) = 2.79, p < 0.01. No significant differences in baseline DA levels were detected between control and stress groups: 2.0 ± 0.2 nM in control versus 2.1 ± 0.2 nM after stress. Next, we tested whether glucocorticoid receptor activation mediated the stress-induced decrease in ethanol-evoked DA release. Systemic pretreatment with RU486 prevented the inhibitory effect of stress on ethanol-induced DA release (Figure 2B, gray data). The distribution of the microdialysis probe placements within the NAc is shown in Figure S2. Ethanol stimulates DA release in the NAc by increasing the firing rate of VTA DA neurons (Foddai et al., 2004Foddai M. Dosia G. Spiga S. Diana M. Acetaldehyde increases dopaminergic neuronal activity in the VTA.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2004; 29: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine whether restrained stress altered DA neuron firing rate in vivo, we conducted single-unit recordings of VTA DA neurons in anesthetized rats 15 hr after stress (Figure 2C). DA neurons were recorded in the lateral VTA (Figure 2D) and were identified based on their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties (Figures S3A and S3B). The spontaneous firing rate of VTA DA neurons was measured before and after intravenous infusion of ethanol (0.6–1.5 g/kg). Ethanol administration induced an increase in the spontaneous firing rate of VTA DA neurons in control animals (128.6% ± 7.6%). In contrast, stressed animals failed to demonstrate a significant firing-rate increase upon ethanol administration (102.3% ± 3.1%) (Figures 2E and 2F; n = 8–13, p < 0.01). Together with the microdialysis experiments, these data indicate that ethanol-induced DA signaling was blunted after exposure to stress. To examine the cellular mechanisms of the blunted DA signaling after stress, we measured the ex vivo responses of VTA DA neurons to ethanol (Figure 3A). Midbrain horizontal slices containing the VTA were cut 15 hr after restraint stress, and patch-clamp cell-attached recordings were performed on DA neurons. Putative DA neurons were recorded from the lateral VTA and were identified based on established electrophysiological criteria (Figures S3C–S3E). In 34 of 36 cells displaying these electrophysiological properties, the DA phenotype was confirmed by tyrosine hydroxylase staining (Figure 3B). Bath application of 50-mM ethanol increased the spontaneous firing rate of DA neurons from unstressed control rats (Figures 3C and 3D, black data), but DA cells from stressed animals failed to show significant increases in firing rate upon ethanol application (Figures 3C and 3D, red data): group × time: F(10,200) = 3.55, p < 0.01. Reduced DA activity after stress could be mediated through decreased excitation or increased inhibition of DA neurons. To probe the relative contribution of excitatory neurotransmission, we recorded ethanol-induced DA activity during inhibition of ionotropic glutamate receptors with DNQX (20 μM) and AP5 (50 μM), which inhibit AMPA and NMDA receptors, respectively. When comparing control and stressed groups, the basal firing rate of DA neurons was not significantly altered by bath application of DNQX and AP5. Upon ethanol application, DA neurons from stressed animals again showed reduced DA activity compared to controls (Figure 3E): group × time: F(10,130) = 6, p < 0.01, indicating that this effect of stress was not mediated via changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Next, we tested the contribution of GABAergic signaling by comparing ethanol-induced VTA DA neuron firing between control and stress groups in the presence of picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist. Picrotoxin (50 μM) did not significantly alter the basal firing rate between the control and stress groups. However, upon application of ethanol, the presence of picrotoxin prevented the blunted DA responses to ethanol observed after stress (Figure 3F, red trace). This finding suggests that stress reduced DA responses to ethanol via changes in GABAergic neurotransmission. Altered inhibitory control of DA neurons after stress could be mediated through changes in presynaptic neurotransmitter release or postsynaptic receptor responses. To determine the site of adaptation for GABAergic neurotransmission, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of VTA DA neurons and we measured spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) in the presence of ethanol (Figure 3G). In control animals, bath-applied ethanol produced a small increase in sIPSC frequency (116.1% ± 5.0%). In contrast, DA neurons from stressed animals showed significantly greater ethanol-induced potentiation of sIPSC frequency compared to the control response (171.5% ± 7.2%) (Figures 3H and 3I, black and red data; n = 8–10, p < 0.01). Systemic injection of RU486 prior to stress prevented the stress-mediated increase in sIPSC frequency observed after ethanol application (Figure 3I, gray bar): 110.6% ± 4.5%, n = 8. To demonstrate the direct action of glucocorticoids in mediating the effects of stress, brain slices from control rats were incubated in corticosterone (1 μM) for 1 hr (Pitman et al., 1988Pitman D.L. Ottenweller J.E. Natelson B.H. Plasma corticosterone levels during repeated presentation of two intensities of restraint stress: chronic stress and habituation.Physiol. Behav. 1988; 43: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). DA neurons from control animals treated with corticosterone showed a potentiation of ethanol-induced sIPSC frequency that was indistinguishable from stressed animals (Figure 3I, dark blue bar): 182.7% ± 10.7%, n = 8. Importantly, incubation with RU486 prevented this corticosterone-mediated increase in sIPSC frequency (Figure 3I, light blue bar): 114.5% ± 5.5%, n = 6. Increased frequency, but not amplitude, of sIPSCs suggests that the change caused by stress and corticosterone resides with the presynaptic neuron (i.e., the GABA neuron) not with the postsynaptic neuron (i.e., the DA neuron) (see Figure 3G). Patch-clamp recordings indicated that stress induced long-term alterations in GABAergic inputs onto VTA DA neurons. Local VTA GABA neurons can modulate VTA DA neuron activity (Creed et al., 2014Creed M.C. Ntamati N.R. Tan K.R. VTA GABA neurons modulate specific learning behaviors through the control of dopamine and cholinergic systems.Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To examine whether stress altered the effects of ethanol on local VTA GABA neurons, we performed electrophysiological recordings of these cells ex vivo (Figure 4A). Putative VTA GABA neurons in slices were recorded in the lateral VTA and identified by a combination of factors including small somata size (<20 μm), high pacemaker-like firing rate (>7 Hz), and the lack of Ih-current (Figure 4B) (Korotkova et al., 2006Korotkova T.M. Brown R.E. Sergeeva O.A. Ponomarenko A.A. Haas H.L. Effects of arousal- and feeding-related neuropeptides on dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area of the rat.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Margolis et al., 2006Margolis E.B. Lock H. Hjelmstad G.O. Fields H.L. The ventral tegmental area revisited: is there an electrophysiological marker for dopaminergic neurons?.J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 907-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Importantly, 47 of 49 VTA neurons with these properties were not immunoreactive for TH (Figure 4C). We measured ethanol’s effect on VTA GABA neuron spontaneous firing rate in a cell-attached configuration. Bath-application of ethanol on VTA slices from control animals produced a marginal increase of GABA neuron firing rate (Figure 4D, black trace). A significantly higher ethanol-induced increase in GABA neuron firing rate was observed following stress, compared to non-stressed controls (Figure 4D, red trace): group × time: F(10,160) = 5.89, p < 0.01. Qualitatively similar effects of stress on ethanol-induced GABA neuron firing were observed during in vivo single-unit electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats. Putative GABA neurons in the lateral VTA (Figure S4A) were identified based on their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties (Figures S4B and S4C). Whereas i.v. administration of ethanol (0.6–1.5 g/kg) slightly decreased the firing rate of VTA GABA neurons in control animals (88.7% ± 5.2%, n = 6), the same doses of ethanol significantly increased spontaneous activity after stress (124.5% ± 8.1%, n = 6, p < 0.01) (Figures S4D–S4F). As was previously examined in VTA DA neurons (Figures 3E and 3F), we probed for changes in excitatory and inhibitory input onto VTA GABA neurons ex vivo. After application of ethanol, inhibition of ionotropic glutamate receptors with DNQX and AP5 did not prevent the enhanced GABA cell firing rate observed after stress, indicating that this effect was not mediated via changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission (Figure 4E): group × time: F(10,110) = 11.19, p < 0.01. However, blocking GABAA receptors with picrotoxin prevented the enhanced firing rate of VTA GABA neurons observed after stress (Figure 4F, red trace). This result suggests that, in stressed animals, ethanol increased VTA GABA neuron firing rate via GABAA receptors. Based on our findings in Figure 4F, we hypothesized that GABA inputs onto VTA GABA neurons produced excitatory responses. To test this, we measured VTA GABA neuron firing rates in response to repetitive stimulation of synaptic GABAA receptor inputs with ionotropic glutamate receptors inhibited (Figure 5A). Upon electrical stimulation (20 Hz for 1 s), GABA neurons from control animals showed decreased firing (Figures 5B and 5C, black data), indicative of GABAergic inhibition of the recorded GABA neuron. In marked contrast, slices from stressed animals showed increased GABA neuron firing after GABAA receptor stimulation (Figures 5B and 5C, red data): group × time: F(29,464) = 10.03, p < 0.01. This finding directly demonstrates excitation mediated by high-frequency stimulation of GABAA receptors. Importantly, this effect was blocked by picrotoxin (Figures 5D, top, and 5E, Stress + picrotoxin), providing further confirmation that the observed excitation of VTA GABA neurons following stress was mediated by GABAA receptors. In control animals, similar GABAA receptor-mediated excitation was also observed following 1 hr incubation of brain slices in corticosterone (Figure 5E, blue bar, Cort), suggesting that prolonged exposure to corticosteroids is sufficient to promote excitatory GABAA transmission onto VTA GABA neurons. Next, we tested whether the stress-induced transition in GABAA receptor signaling was also observed in VTA DA neurons. Upon electrical stimulation of GABAA receptor input (20 Hz, 1 s), DA neurons from control and stressed animals showed decreased firing (Figures S5A and S5B), indicating that the direct GABA input onto DA neurons remains inhibitory. It has been reported (Staley et al., 1995Staley K.J. Soldo B.L. Proctor W.R. Ionic mechanisms of neuronal excitation by inhibitory GABAA receptors.Science. 1995; 269: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) that GABAA receptor-mediated excitation can be prevented by application of acetazolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase. Based on these findings, we postulated that acetazolamide would prevent the transition from GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition to excitation of GABA neurons observed after stress. Bath application of acetazolamide (10 μM) did not change basal GABA neuron firing rate between control and stress groups, nor did it change control responses to repetitive stimulation. However, repetitive stimulation in the presence of acetazolamide blocked the increase in GABA neuron firing after stress (Figures 5D, bottom, and 5E, Stress + ACTZ). Given that stress promoted excitatory GABA input onto VTA GABA neurons, we tested whether this phenomenon mediated the stress-induced alterations in alcohol’s actions. Based on the results of our repetitive stimulation studies (Figures 5D and 5E), we bath applied acetazolamide to prevent the changes in GABA and DA neuron firing to ethanol observed after stress. We found that upon application of ethanol, there was no longer a difference in GABA and DA neuron firing rates between control and stressed groups (Figures 6A and 6B , black and red traces compared to the dotted red lines representing stress without acetazolamide). To prevent stress from changing ethanol-induced DA release in the NAc, we infused acetazolamide into the VTA prior to the microdialysis experiments (Figure 6C). In contrast to the intra-VTA infusion of vehicle, acetazolamide prevented the inhibitory effect of stress on ethanol-induced [DA] (Figure 6D): group × time: F(10,120) = 2.96, p < 0.01. The effect of acetazolamide was indistinguishable from the non-stressed control group (Figure 6D, black dotted trace). Microinfusion of acetazolamide outside the VTA did not reverse the inhibitory effect of stress exposure (Figure S6A). In unstressed control animals, the microinfusion of acetazolamide in the VTA did not alter the DA response to ethanol (data not shown, n = 6, p > 0.05). To prevent stress from escalating ethanol intake, we bilaterally infused acetazolamide into the VTA prior to each ethanol self-administration session (Figure 6E). Intra-VTA infusion of acetazolamide significantly decreased the average daily ethanol intake in the stressed group (0.67 ± 0.06 g/kg) compared to the stressed group that received intra-VTA infusions of vehicle (0.92 ± 0.08 g/kg) (Figure 6F; n = 10–14, p < 0.05). These data were indistinguishable from the non-stressed control group (Figure 6F, dotted horizontal line). VTA infusions of acetazolamide did not alter ethanol consumption in control animals (Figure S6B). All microinfusion sites of acetazolamide in the VTA are shown in Figures S6C and S6D. We next investigated the causes underlying the increased GABA cell excitation by alcohol. The transition in GABAA receptor signaling (Figure 5B) suggests a depolarizing shift in the GABAA reversal potential (EGABA) in VTA GABA neurons (Hewitt et al., 2009Hewitt S.A. Wamsteeker J.I. Kurz E.U. Bains J.S. Altered chloride homeostasis removes synaptic inhibitory constraint of the stress axis.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). EGABA is the membrane potential at which evoked IPSCs change their direction from inward to outward. To determine EGABA in VTA GABA neurons, we performed gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings to preserve the intracellular anion concentrations, and we measured GABAA IPSCs at different membrane potentials (Figure 7A). VTA GABA neurons from stressed animals showed a significantly more depolarized EGABA value compared to controls (Figures 7B and 7C): −63.4 ± 3.1 mV after stress (red data) versus −88.2 ± 3.3 mV in controls (black data), n = 10, p < 0.01. A depolarizing shift in EGABA reflects a higher intracellular chloride concentration, which in adult neurons is often mediated by a decrease in Cl− extrusion capacity. During prolonged GABAA receptor stimulation, decreased Cl− extrusion capacity leads to intracellular Cl− accumulation, culminating in the collapse of the Cl− gradient and decreased synaptic GABAA receptor inhibition. To test whether exposure to stress weakens Cl− extrusion in VTA GABA neurons, we applied repetitive GABAA receptor stimulation and measured activity-dependent depression of the IPSCs (Hewitt et al., 2009Hewitt S.A. Wamsteeker J.I. Kurz E.U. Bains J.S. Altered chloride homeostasis removes synaptic inhibitory constraint of the stress axis.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The rate of decrease in IPSC amplitude at the conditions that favor Cl− influx (0 mV) depends on Cl− accumulation and activity-dependent synaptic depression. In contrast, GABAA receptor stimulation at the conditions of Cl− efflux (−90 mV) only depends on activity-dependent synaptic depression. Upon electrical stimulation at 20 Hz at a hol"

The tumour-supporting activity of the intracellular Hsp90 is attributed to their N-terminal ATPase-driven chaperone function. What molecular entity determines the extracellular function of secreted Hsp90 and the distinction between Hsp90α and Hsp90β was unclear. Here we demonstrate that CRISPR/Case9 knocking out Hsp90α nullifies tumour cells’ ability to migrate, invade and metastasize without affecting the cell survival and growth. Knocking out Hsp90β leads to tumour cell death. Extracellular supplementation with recombinant Hsp90α, but not Hsp90β, protein recovers tumourigenicity of the Hsp90α-knockout cells. Sequential mutagenesis identifies two evolutionarily conserved lysine residues, lys-270 and lys-277, in the Hsp90α subfamily that determine the extracellular Hsp90α function. Hsp90β subfamily lacks the dual lysine motif and the extracellular function. Substitutions of gly-262 and thr-269 in Hsp90β with lysines convert Hsp90β to a Hsp90α-like protein. Newly constructed monoclonal antibody, 1G6-D7, against the dual lysine region of secreted Hsp90α inhibits both de novo tumour formation and expansion of already formed tumours in mice. This study suggests an alternative therapeutic approach to target Hsp90 in cancer, that is, the tumour-secreted Hsp90α, instead of the intracellular Hsp90α and Hsp90β."
https://openalex.org/W2529689372,"Naringin, a flavanone glycoside extracted from various plants, has a wide range of pharmacological effects. In the present study, we investigated naringin's mechanism of action and its inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha and high-mobility group box 1 expression in macrophages, and on death in a cecal ligation and puncture induced mouse model of sepsis. Naringin increased heme oxygenase 1 expression in peritoneal macrophage cells through the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, p38, and NF-E2-related factor 2. Inhibition of heme oxygenase 1 abrogated the naringin's inhibitory effect on high-mobility group box 1 expression and NF-kB activation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Moreover, mice pretreated with naringin (200 mg/kg) exhibited decreased sepsis-induced mortality and lung injury, and alleviated lung pathological changes. However, the naringin's protective effects on sepsis-induced lung injury were eliminated by zinc protoporphyrin, a heme oxygenase 1 competitive inhibitor. These results revealed the mechanism underlying naringin's protective effect in inflammation and may be beneficial for the treatment of sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2527782650,"The risk of rehospitalization is elevated in the immediate post-discharge period and declines over time. It is not known if the extent and timing of risk vary across readmission diagnoses, suggesting that recovery and vulnerability after discharge differ by physiologic system.We compared risk trajectories for major readmission diagnoses in the year after discharge among all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries hospitalized with heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia from 2008-2010.We estimated the daily risk of rehospitalization for 12 major readmission diagnostic categories after accounting for the competing risk of death after discharge. For each diagnostic category, we identified (1) the time required for readmission risk to peak and then decline 50% from maximum values after discharge; (2) the time required for readmission risk to approach plateau periods of minimal day-to-day change; and (3) the extent to which hospitalization risks are higher among patients recently discharged from the hospital compared with the general elderly population.Among >3,000,000 hospitalizations, the yearly rate of rehospitalization was 67.0%, 49.5%, and 55.3% after hospitalization for HF, AMI, and pneumonia, respectively. The extent and timing of risk varied by readmission diagnosis and initial admitting condition. Risk of readmission for gastrointestinal bleeding/anemia peaked particularly late after hospital discharge, occurring 10, 6, and 7 days after hospitalization for HF, AMI, and pneumonia, respectively. Risk of readmission for trauma/injury declined particularly slowly, requiring 38, 20, and 38 days to decline by 50% after hospitalization for HF, AMI, and pneumonia, respectively.Patterns of vulnerability to different conditions that cause rehospitalization vary by time after hospital discharge. This finding suggests that recovery of various physiologic systems occurs at different rates and that post-discharge interventions to minimize vulnerability to specific conditions should be tailored to their underlying risks."
https://openalex.org/W2530292989,"The predisposition of patients with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involves components of viral infection, inflammation and time. The development of multifocal, genetically distinct tumours is suggestive of a field defect affecting the entire liver. The molecular susceptibility mediating such a field defect is not understood. One potential mediator of long-term cellular reprogramming is heritable (epigenetic) regulation of transcription, exemplified by DNA methylation. We studied epigenetic and transcriptional changes in HCV-infected livers in comparison with control, uninfected livers and HCC, allowing us to identify pre-neoplastic epigenetic and transcriptional events. We find the HCV-infected liver to have a pattern of acquisition of DNA methylation targeted to candidate enhancers active in liver cells, enriched for the binding sites of the FOXA1, FOXA2 and HNF4A transcription factors. These enhancers can be subdivided into those proximal to genes implicated in liver cancer or to genes involved in stem cell development, the latter distinguished by increased CG dinucleotide density and polycomb-mediated repression, manifested by the additional acquisition of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Transcriptional studies on our samples showed that the increased DNA methylation at enhancers was associated with decreased local gene expression, results validated in independent samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Pharmacological depletion of H3K27me3 using the EZH2 inhibitor GSK343 in HepG2 cells suppressed cell growth and also revealed that local acquired DNA methylation was not dependent upon the presence of polycomb-mediated repression. The results support a model of HCV infection influencing the binding of transcription factors to cognate sites in the genome, with consequent local acquisition of DNA methylation, and the added repressive influence of polycomb at a subset of CG-dense cis-regulatory sequences. These epigenetic events occur before neoplastic transformation, resulting in what may be a pharmacologically reversible epigenetic field defect in HCV-infected liver."
https://openalex.org/W2528946299,"Reports have suggested that tumor textures presented on T2-weighted images correlate with the genetic status of glioma. Therefore, development of an image analyzing framework that is capable of objective and high throughput image texture analysis for large scale image data collection is needed. The current study aimed to address the development of such a framework by introducing two novel parameters for image textures on T2-weighted images, i.e., Shannon entropy and Prewitt filtering. Twenty-two WHO grade 2 and 28 grade 3 glioma patients were collected whose pre-surgical MRI and IDH1 mutation status were available. Heterogeneous lesions showed statistically higher Shannon entropy than homogenous lesions (p = 0.006) and ROC curve analysis proved that Shannon entropy on T2WI was a reliable indicator for discrimination of homogenous and heterogeneous lesions (p = 0.015, AUC = 0.73). Lesions with well-defined borders exhibited statistically higher Edge mean and Edge median values using Prewitt filtering than those with vague lesion borders (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0005 respectively). ROC curve analysis also proved that both Edge mean and median values were promising indicators for discrimination of lesions with vague and well defined borders and both Edge mean and median values performed in a comparable manner (p = 0.0002, AUC = 0.81 and p < 0.0001, AUC = 0.83, respectively). Finally, IDH1 wild type gliomas showed statistically lower Shannon entropy on T2WI than IDH1 mutated gliomas (p = 0.007) but no difference was observed between IDH1 wild type and mutated gliomas in Edge median values using Prewitt filtering. The current study introduced two image metrics that reflect lesion texture described on T2WI. These two metrics were validated by readings of a neuro-radiologist who was blinded to the results. This observation will facilitate further use of this technique in future large scale image analysis of glioma."
https://openalex.org/W2529422575,"Treatment failure defined as progression of disease after initiation of ART or when the anti-HIV medications can't control the infection. One of the major concerns over the rapid scaling up of ART is the emergence and transmission of HIV drug resistant strains at the population level due to treatment failure. This could lead to the failure of basic ART programs. Thus this study aimed to investigate the predictors of treatment failure among adult ART clients in Bale Zone Hospitals, South east Ethiopia.Retrospective cohort study was employed in four hospitals of Bale zone named Goba, Robe, Ginir and Delomena. A total of 4,809 adult ART clients were included in the analysis from these four hospitals. Adherence was measured by pill count method. The Kaplan Meier (KM) curve was used to describe the survival time of ART patients without treatment failure. Bivariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for identifying associated factors of treatment failure.The incidence rate of treatment failure was found 9.38 (95% CI 7.79-11.30) per 1000 person years. Male ART clients were more likely to experience treatment failure as compared to females [AHR = 4.49; 95% CI: (2.61-7.73)].Similarly, lower CD4 count (<100 m3/dl) at initiation of ART was found significantly associated with higher odds of treatment failure [AHR = 3.79; 95% CI: (2.46-5.84).Bedridden [AHR = 5.02; 95% CI: (1.98-12.73)] and ambulatory [AHR = 2.12; 95% CI: (1.08-4.07)] patients were more likely to experience treatment failure as compared to patients with working functional status. TB co-infected clients had also higher odds to experience treatment failure [AHR = 3.06; 95% CI: (1.72-5.44)]. Those patients who had developed TB after ART initiation had higher odds to experience treatment failure as compared to their counter parts [AHR = 4.35; 95% CI: (1.99-9.54]. Having other opportunistic infection during ART initiation was also associated with higher odds of experiencing treatment failure [AHR = 7.0, 95% CI: (3.19-15.37)]. Similarly having fair [AHR = 4.99 95% CI: (1.90-13.13)] and poor drug adherence [AHR = 2.56; 95% CI: (1.12-5.86)]were significantly associated with higher odds of treatment failure as compared to clients with good adherence.The rate of treatment failure in Bale zone hospitals needs attention. Prevention and control of TB and other opportunistic infections, promotion of ART initiation at higher CD4 level, and better functional status, improving drug adherence are important interventions to reduce treatment failure among ART clients in Southeastern Ethiopia."

Methods In UK Biobank, OCT images were acquired between 2009 and 2010 using a commercially available “spectral domain” OCT device (3D OCT-1000, Topcon). Images were obtained using a raster scan protocol, 6 mm x 6 mm in area, and consisting of 128 B-scans. OCT image sets were stored on UK Biobank servers in a central repository, adjacent to high performance computers. Rapid, automated analysis of retinal thickness was performed using custom image segmentation software developed by the Topcon Advanced Biomedical Imaging Laboratory (TABIL). This software employs dual-scale gradient information to allow for automated segmentation of nine intraretinal boundaries in a rapid fashion. Results 67,321 participants (134,642 eyes) in UK Biobank underwent OCT imaging of both eyes as part of the ocular module. 134,611 images were successfully processed with 31 images failing segmentation analysis due to corrupted OCT files or withdrawal of subject consent for UKBB study participation. Average time taken to call up an image from the database and complete segmentation analysis was approximately 120 seconds per data set per login, and analysis of the entire dataset was completed in approximately 28 days. Conclusions We report an approach to the rapid, automated measurement of retinal thickness from nearly 140,000 OCT image sets from the UK Biobank. In the near future, these measurements will be publically available for utilization by researchers around the world, and thus for correlation with the wealth of other data collected in UK Biobank. The automated analysis approaches we describe may be of utility for future large population-based epidemiological studies, clinical trials, and screening programs that employ OCT imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2529109045,"Oligodendrocytes form myelin around axons of the central nervous system, enabling saltatory conduction. Recent work has established that axons can regulate certain aspects of oligodendrocyte development and myelination, yet remarkably oligodendrocytes in culture retain the ability to differentiate in the absence of axons and elaborate myelin sheaths around synthetic axon-like substrates. It remains unclear the extent to which the life-course of oligodendrocytes requires the presence of, or signals derived from axons in vivo. In particular, it is unclear whether the specific axons fated for myelination regulate the oligodendrocyte population in a living organism, and if so, which precise steps of oligodendrocyte-cell lineage progression are regulated by target axons. Here, we use live-imaging of zebrafish larvae carrying transgenic reporters that label oligodendrocyte-lineage cells to investigate which aspects of oligodendrocyte development, from specification to differentiation, are affected when we manipulate the target axonal environment. To drastically reduce the number of axons targeted for myelination, we use a previously identified kinesin-binding protein (kbp) mutant, in which the first myelinated axons in the spinal cord, reticulospinal axons, do not fully grow in length, creating a region in the posterior spinal cord where most initial targets for myelination are absent. We find that a 73% reduction of reticulospinal axon surface in the posterior spinal cord of kbp mutants results in a 27% reduction in the number of oligodendrocytes. By time-lapse analysis of transgenic OPC reporters, we find that the reduction in oligodendrocyte number is explained by a reduction in OPC proliferation and survival. Interestingly, OPC specification and migration are unaltered in the near absence of normal axonal targets. Finally, we find that timely differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes does not depend at all on the presence of target axons. Together, our data illustrate the power of zebrafish for studying the entire life-course of the oligodendrocyte lineage in vivo in an altered axonal environment."
https://openalex.org/W2531281086,"Whereas accumulating studies have supported the cancer stem cell theory, a specific therapy targeting a cancer stem cell subpopulation has not been established. Here, we show that dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-kinase 2 (DYRK2) is a novel negative regulator for formation of breast cancer stem cells. Downregulation of DYRK2 promotes cancer stem-like traits in vitro, tumourigenesis in vivo and the proportion of the cancer stem cell population in human breast cancer tissues. We found that Krupple-like factor 4 (KLF4) serves as a key mediator of DYRK2's control over the cancer stem phenotype. Reduced DYRK2 expression increases KLF4 expression, which induces cancer stem-like properties. We identified androgen receptor (AR) as a transcription factor binding to the KLF4 promoter region; this process is dependent on DYRK2 kinase activity. Our findings delineate a mechanism of cancer stem cell regulation by the DYRK2-AR-KLF4 axis in breast cancer. Targeting of this pathway may be a promising strategy against breast cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2529104978,"The cerebral cortex computes through the canonical microcircuit that connects six stacked layers; however, how cortical processing streams operate in vivo, particularly in the higher association cortex, remains elusive. By developing a novel MRI-assisted procedure that reliably localizes recorded single neurons at resolution of six individual layers in monkey temporal cortex, we show that transformation of representations from a cued object to a to-be-recalled object occurs at the infragranular layer in a visual cued-recall task. This cue-to-target conversion started in layer 5 and was followed by layer 6. Finally, a subset of layer 6 neurons exclusively encoding the sought target became phase-locked to surrounding field potentials at theta frequency, suggesting that this coordinated cell assembly implements cortical long-distance outputs of the recalled target. Thus, this study proposes a link from local computation spanning laminar modules of the temporal cortex to the brain-wide network for memory retrieval in primates."
https://openalex.org/W2529117460,"Shortages of human resources for treating HIV/AIDS (HRHA) are a fundamental barrier to reaching universal antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in developing countries. Previous studies suggest that recruiting HRHA to attain universal ART coverage poses an insurmountable challenge as ART significantly increases survival among HIV-infected individuals. While new evidence about ART's prevention benefits suggests fewer infections may mitigate the challenge, new policies such as treatment-as-prevention (TasP) will exacerbate it. We develop a mathematical model to analytically study the net effects of these countervailing factors. Using South Africa as a case study, we find that contrary to previous results, universal ART coverage is achievable even with current HRHA numbers. However, larger health gains are possible through a surge-capacity policy that aggressively recruits HRHA to reach universal ART coverage quickly. Without such a policy, TasP roll-out can increase health losses by crowding out sicker patients from treatment, unless a surge capacity exclusively for TasP is also created."
https://openalex.org/W2531696307,"Androgens are known to protect prostate cancer cells from DNA damage. Recent studies showed regulation of DNA repair genes by androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancers. ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2) is an androgen-regulated tumor suppressor and its intracellular localization can be modulated by ultraviolet light, suggesting a potential role for EAF2 in androgen regulation of DNA repair in prostate cancer cells. Here we show that knockdown of EAF2 or its homolog EAF1 sensitized prostate cancer cells to DNA damage and the sensitization did not require p53. EAF2 knockout mouse prostate was also sensitized to γ-irradiation. Furthermore, EAF2 knockdown blocked androgen repression of LNCaP or C4-2 cells from doxorubicin induction of γH2ax, a DNA damage marker. In human prostate cancer specimens, EAF2 expression was inversely correlated with the level of γH2ax. Further analysis showed that EAF2 and EAF1 are required for the recruitment and retention of Ku70/Ku80 to DNA damage sites and play a functional role in nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair. These findings provide evidence for EAF2 as a key factor mediating androgen protection of DNA damage via Ku70/Ku80 in prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2528786097,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a significant cause of morbidity in preterm infants, but no screening guidelines exist. We sought to identify risk factors and clinical outcomes associated with PH in preterm infants to develop a PH risk score.Retrospective analysis of two separate populations of preterm infants (NICU cohort n = 230; Clinic registry n = 580).8.3% of the NICU cohort had PH after 4 weeks of age, while 14.8% of the clinic registry had PH after 2 months of age. Lower birth weights and longer initial hospitalizations were associated with PH in both populations (p<0.001 for all tests). Using adjusted logistic regression, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) requiring ligation was associated with PH in both the NICU cohort (OR: 3.19; p = 0.024) and the clinic registry (OR: 2.67; p<0.001). Risk factors (birth weight ≤780 grams, home supplemental oxygen use, and PDA ligation) identified in the clinic registry (training dataset) were validated in the NICU cohort with 0-1 factors present were associated with ≤1.5% probability of having PH, any 2 factors with a 25% probability, and all 3 factors with a 40% probability.Lower birth weight, PDA ligation, and respiratory support were associated with PH in both populations. A PH risk score based on clinical indicators from the training dataset predicted PH in the validation set. This risk score could help focus resources to preterm infants at higher risk for PH. Further work is needed to determine whether earlier or more aggressive management of ductal lesions could alter PH outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2528652266,"High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) remains a major therapeutic challenge despite the recent advent of disialoganglioside (GD2)-antibody treatment combined with interleukin (IL)-2 and granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Indeed, more than one third of the patients still die from this disease. Here, we developed a novel approach to improve the current anti-GD2 immunotherapy based on NK cell stimulation using toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). We demonstrated that this strategy led to the efficient killing of NB cells. When the expression of GD2 was heterogeneous on NB cells, the combination of pDC-mediated NK-cell activation and anti-GD2 treatment significantly increased the cytotoxicity of NK cells against NB cells. Activation by pDCs led to a unique NK-cell phenotype characterized by increased surface expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), with increased expression of CD69 on CD56dim cytotoxic cells, and strong interferon-γ production. Additionally, NB-cell killing was mediated by the TRAIL death-receptor pathway, as well as by the release of cytolytic granules via the DNAX accessory molecule 1 pathway. NK-cell activation and lytic activity against NB was independent of cell contact, depended upon type I IFN produced by TLR-9-activated pDCs, but was not reproduced by IFN-α stimulation alone. Collectively, these results highlighted the therapeutic potential of activated pDCs for patients with high-risk NB."
https://openalex.org/W2528918974,"The present study was performed to identify and characterize genes involved in osteoblasts function. Firstly, we constructed and sequenced a human osteoblast full-length cDNA library to screen for genes whose functions have not been reported and further identify these candidate genes through detecting the relationship with the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex using a dual luciferase reporter system. Only one gene, namely METRNL (Meteorin, glial cell differentiation regulator-like) has been screened out. We performed immunohistochemistry to analyze expression patterns in bone and established a stable transfection MG63 cell line of METRNL-EGFP fusion protein overexpression to analyze the function of METRNL in mineralized nodule formation. Immunohistochemistry showed METRNL expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteoblasts lining trabecular bone surfaces. Overexpression of METRNL inhibited mineralized nodule formation by the MG63 osteosarcoma cell line. Thus, the identified gene, METRNL, which is associated with AP-1 transcription factor complex activity, has a unique expression pattern in bone. In addition, the anomalous expression of METRNL may inhibit bone cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2527781773,"Pausing during the earliest stage of transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a nearly universal control point in metazoan gene expression. The substoichiometric Pol II subunit Gdown1 facilitates promoter proximal pausing in vitro in extract-based transcription reactions, out-competes the initiation/elongation factor TFIIF for binding to free Pol II and co-localizes with paused Pol II in vivo. However, we have shown that Gdown1 cannot functionally associate with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC), which contains TFIIF. In the present study, we determined at what point after initiation Gdown1 can associate with Pol II and how rapidly this competition with TFIIF occurs. We show that, as with the PIC, Gdown1 cannot functionally load into open complexes or complexes engaged in abortive synthesis of very short RNAs. Gdown1 can load into early elongation complexes (EECs) with 5–9 nt RNAs, but efficient association with EECs does not take place until the point at which the upstream segment of the long initial transcription bubble reanneals. Tests of EECs assembled on a series of promoter variants confirm that this bubble collapse transition, and not transcript length, modulates Gdown1 functional affinity. Gdown1 displaces TFIIF effectively from all complexes downstream of the collapse transition, but this displacement is surprisingly slow: complete loss of TFIIF stimulation of elongation requires 5 min of incubation with Gdown1. The relatively slow functional loading of Gdown1 in the presence of TFIIF suggests that Gdown1 works in promoter-proximal pausing by locking in the paused state after elongation is already antagonized by other factors, including DSIF, NELF and possibly the first downstream nucleosome."

https://openalex.org/W2528182066,"Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are proposed to function as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and contribute to post-ischemic neuroinflammation and brain injury by activating Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 at the acute and subacute phases after ischemic stroke. However, there are few studies concerning the inflammatory profiles of six distinct subtypes of Prxs (Prx1-Prx6). Our previous study demonstrated that the protective effect of ligustilide (LIG) against cerebral ischemia was associated with inhibition of neuroinflammatory response and Prx/TLR4 signaling in rats. Herein, the present study explored the inflammatory members of Prxs and the effect of LIG on their inflammatory responses in macrophages.The murine RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with each of exogenous recombinant Prxs at a range of 1 to 50 nM for 24 h. The WST-1 test showed that Prx3 exhibited a significant cytotoxicity, whereas the rest five Prxs did not affect cellular viability. The quantitative measurements with spectrometry or ELISA indicated that three subtypes, Prx1, Prx2 and Prx4, increased production of proinflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a concentration-dependent manner. Immunostaining demonstrated that 20 nM Prx1, Prx2 or Prx4 significantly increased expression of TLR4 and iNOS and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. However, Prx5 and Prx6 showed no poinflammatory effect in macrophages. Remarkably, LIG treatment effectively inhibited the inflammatory response induced by Prx1, Prx2 and Prx4.Three members of Prxs, Prx1, Prx2 and Prx4, are inflammatory DAMPs that induce TLR4 activation and inflammatory response in macrophages, which is effectively inhibited by LIG. These results suggest that inflammatory Prxs-activated macrophages may provide a novel cellular model for screening the potential inhibitors of DAMPs-associated inflammatory diseases such as stroke. Moreover, selective blocking strategies targeting the inflammatory subtypes of Prxs probably provide promising therapeutic approaches with a prolonged time window for stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2528856553,"In this work we study the coupled dynamics of social balance and opinion formation. We propose a model where agents form opinions under bounded confidence, but only considering the opinions of their friends. The signs of social ties -friendships and enmities- evolve seeking for social balance, taking into account how similar agents’ opinions are. We consider both the case where opinions have one and two dimensions. We find that our dynamics produces the segregation of agents into two cliques, with the opinions of agents in one clique differing from those in the other. Depending on the level of bounded confidence, the dynamics can produce either consensus of opinions within each clique or the coexistence of several opinion clusters in a clique. For the uni-dimensional case, the opinions in one clique are all below the opinions in the other clique, hence defining a “left clique” and a “right clique”. In the two-dimensional case, our numerical results suggest that the two cliques are separated by a hyperplane in the opinion space. We also show that the phenomenon of unidimensional opinions identified by DeMarzo, Vayanos and Zwiebel (Q J Econ 2003) extends partially to our dynamics. Finally, in the context of politics, we comment about the possible relation of our results to the fragmentation of an ideology and the emergence of new political parties."
https://openalex.org/W2529731070,"Collective migration depends on cell-cell interactions between neighbors that contribute to their overall directionality, yet the mechanisms that control the coordinated migration of neurons remains to be elucidated. During hindbrain development, facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) undergo a stereotypic tangential caudal migration from their place of birth in rhombomere (r)4 to their final location in r6/7. FBMNs engage in collective cell migration that depends on neuron-to-neuron interactions to facilitate caudal directionality. Here, we demonstrate that Cadherin-2-mediated neuron-to-neuron adhesion is necessary for directional and collective migration of FBMNs. We generated stable transgenic zebrafish expressing dominant-negative Cadherin-2 (Cdh2ΔEC) driven by the islet1 promoter. Cell-autonomous inactivation of Cadherin-2 function led to non-directional migration of FBMNs and a defect in caudal tangential migration. Additionally, mosaic analysis revealed that Cdh2ΔEC-expressing FBMNs are not influenced to migrate caudally by neighboring wild-type FBMNs due to a defect in collective cell migration. Taken together, our data suggest that Cadherin-2 plays an essential cell-autonomous role in mediating the collective migration of FBMNs."

This study investigated the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and CVD risk among older people in Japan where research on this association is scarce. Data came from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study project; questionnaire data collected from 3,810 people aged 65 years or older living in 20 primary school districts in Aichi prefecture, Japan, was linked to a computed composite CVD risk score based on biomarker data (i.e., hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and estimated glomerular filtration rate). A sex-stratified multilevel linear regression analysis revealed that for male participants, living in neighborhoods with a higher perceived occurrence of traffic accidents and reduced personal safety was associated with an elevated CVD risk (coefficient = 1.08 per interquartile range increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 1.86) whereas males living in neighborhoods with a higher perceived proximity of exercise facilities had a lower risk (coefficient = −1.00, 95% CI = −1.78 to −0.21). For females, there was no statistically significant association between neighborhood characteristics and CVD risk. This study suggests that aspects of the neighborhood environment might be important for CVD morbidity and mortality in Japan, particularly among men."
https://openalex.org/W2528910054,"Myosin-1C (MYO1C) is a tumor suppressor candidate located in a region of recurrent losses distal to TP53. Myo1c can tightly and specifically bind to PIP2, the substrate of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and to Rictor, suggesting a role for MYO1C in the PI3K pathway. This study was designed to examine MYO1C expression status in a panel of well-stratified endometrial carcinomas as well as to assess the biological significance of MYO1C as a tumor suppressor in vitro. We found a significant correlation between the tumor stage and lowered expression of MYO1C in endometrial carcinoma samples. In cell transfection experiments, we found a negative correlation between MYO1C expression and cell proliferation, and MYO1C silencing resulted in diminished cell migration and adhesion. Cells expressing excess of MYO1C had low basal level of phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB, a.k.a. AKT) and cells with knocked down MYO1C expression showed a quicker phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) response in reaction to serum stimulation. Taken together the present study gives further evidence for tumor suppressor activity of MYO1C and suggests MYO1C mediates its tumor suppressor function through inhibition of PI3K pathway and its involvement in loss of contact inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2529340563,"The specialised conducting tissues present in the ventricles are responsible for the fast distribution of the electrical impulse from the atrio-ventricular node to regions in the subendocardial myocardium. Characterisation of anatomical features of the specialised conducting tissues in the ventricles is highly challenging, in particular its most distal section, which is connected to the working myocardium via Purkinje-myocardial junctions. The goal of this work is to characterise the architecture of the distal section of the Purkinje network by differentiating Purkinje cells from surrounding tissue, performing a segmentation of Purkinje fibres at cellular scale, and mathematically describing its morphology and interconnections. Purkinje cells from rabbit hearts were visualised by confocal microscopy using wheat germ agglutinin labelling. A total of 16 3D stacks including labeled Purkinje cells were collected, and semi-automatically segmented. State-of-the-art graph metrics were applied to estimate regional and global features of the Purkinje network complexity. Two types of cell types, tubular and star-like, were characterised from 3D segmentations. The analysis of 3D imaging data confirms the previously suggested presence of two types of Purkinje-myocardium connections, a 2D interconnection sheet and a funnel one, in which the narrow side of a Purkinje fibre connect progressively to muscle fibres. The complex network analysis of interconnected Purkinje cells showed no small-world connectivity or assortativity properties. These results might help building more realistic computational PK systems at high resolution levels including different cell configurations and shapes. Better knowledge on the organisation of the network might help in understanding the effects that several treatments such as radio-frequency ablation might have when the PK system is disrupted locally."

This phase I study evaluated nintedanib in combination with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) in elderly patients with untreated or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy in a 3+3 design. Nintedanib (dose levels 100, 150, and 200 mg orally twice daily) and LDAC (20 mg subcutaneous injection twice daily for 10 days) were administered in 28-day cycles. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as non-hematological severe adverse reaction CTC grade ≥ 4 with possible or definite relationship to nintedanib. Between April 2012 and October 2013, 13 patients (median age 73 [range: 62–86] years) were enrolled. One patient did not receive study medication and was replaced. Nine (69%) patients had relapsed or refractory disease and 6 (46%) patients had unfavorable cytogenetics. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events (AE) were gastrointestinal events. Twelve SAEs irrespective of relatedness were reported. Two SUSARs were observed, one fatal hypercalcemia and one fatal gastrointestinal infection. Two patients (17%) with relapsed AML achieved a complete remission (one CR, one CRi) and bone marrow blast reductions without fulfilling PR criteria were observed in 3 patients (25%). One-year overall survival was 33%. Nintedanib combined with LDAC shows an adequate safety profile and survival data are promising in a difficult-to-treat patient population. Continuation of this trial with a phase II recommended dose of 2 x 200 mg nintedanib in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study is planned.

Isaria fumosorosea is a fungal pathogen of B. tabaci. However, the effects of fungal infection on TYLCV expression and transmission by MEAM1 are unclear. In this study, potted tomatoes containing second instar nymphs of MEAM1 were treated with I. fumosorosea IfB01 strain and the relationship between fungal infection in MEAM1 and its TYLCV transmission capacity was investigated. The results indicated that a significantly (p < 0.05) decreased incidence of transmission of TYLCV-infected plants (ITYPs) transmitted by second instar nymphs of MEAM1 infected with fungus. Further, we found a negative correlation between fungal conidial concentrations and eclosion rates of MEAM1, and a positive correlation between ITYPs and eclosion. In addition, when each plant was exposed to three adults treated with fungus, a significantly decreased transmission of TYLCV (TYTE) was observed in the infected group. However, the incidence of TYLCV-carrying MEAM1 adults (ITYAs) was not significantly different in the infected and control groups (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, a significant decrease in viral accumulation using TYLCV AC2 gene as a marker was observed in the fungus-infected MEAM1. In conclusion, the results suggested that I. fumosorosea infection decreases TYLCV accumulation in MEAM1 and subsequently reduces its transmission.

https://openalex.org/W2529380220,"The intersection field of view (IFOV) indicates an extent that the visual information can be observed by drivers. It has been found that further enhancing IFOV can significantly improve emergent collision avoidance performance at intersections, such as faster brake reaction time, smaller deceleration rate, and lower traffic crash involvement risk. However, it is not known how IFOV affects drivers’ eye movements, visual attention and the relationship between visual searching and traffic safety. In this study, a driving simulation experiment was conducted to uncover the changes in drivers’ visual performance during the collision avoidance process as a function of different field of views at an intersection by using an eye tracking system. The experimental results showed that drivers’ ability in identifying the potential hazard in terms of visual searching was significantly affected by different IFOV conditions. As the IFOVs increased, drivers had longer gaze duration (GD) and more number of gazes (NG) in the intersection surrounding areas and paid more visual attention to capture critical visual information on the emerging conflict vehicle, thus leading to a better collision avoidance performance and a lower crash risk. It was also found that female drivers had a better visual performance and a lower crash rate than male drivers. From the perspective of drivers’ visual performance, the results strengthened the evidence that further increasing intersection sight distance standards should be encouraged for enhancing traffic safety."

We investigated the relationship between the Charcot-Marie-Tooth protein NDRG1 and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy.Archived mammary tissue specimen blocks of breast cancer patients who received weekly paclitaxel in a single centre were retrieved and NDRG1 immunohistochemistry was performed on normal nerve tissue found within the sample. The mean nerve NDRG1 score was defined by an algorithm based on intensity of staining and percentage of stained nerve bundles. NDRG1 scores were correlated with paclitaxel induced neuropathy.111 patients were studied. 17 of 111 (15%) developed severe paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. The mean nerve NDRG1 expression score was 5.4 in patients with severe neuropathy versus 7.7 in those without severe neuropathy (p = 0.0019). A Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the mean nerve NDRG1 score revealed an area under the curve of 0.74 (p = 0.0013) for the identification of severe neuropathy, with a score of 7 being most discriminative. 13/54 (24%) subjects with an NDRG1 score < = 7 developed severe neuropathy, compared to only 4/57 (7%) in those with a score >7 (p = 0.017).Low NDRG1 expression in nerve tissue present within samples of surgical resection may identify subjects at risk for severe paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Since nerve biopsies are not routinely feasible for patients undergoing chemotherapy for early breast cancer, this promising biomarker strategy is compatible with current clinical workflow."
https://openalex.org/W2527698746,"Reports of American shad fecundity identify two important themes regarding egg production in fishes. First, geographic variation occurs and is biologically meaningful. Shad annual fecundity decreases with increasing latitude, but predicted lifetime fecundity does not, because of a counter-gradient of survival probability, all of which can explain the adaptive significance of natal homing. Second, the appropriate method of measuring fecundity depends on the pattern of oocyte development. Historically, the relatively simple determinate-fecundity method was used; however, a recent study in a Virginia river indicates that this method may be biased, requiring the more complicated indeterminate method. We address both themes with collections from the 2015 shad spawning run in the Connecticut River, USA. Criteria for using a determinate method were satisfied for this northern population: 1) a size gap evident in the oocyte size frequency distribution, indicating group-synchronous development of yolked oocytes; 2) a decline, early in spawning, in the standing stock of yolked oocytes; and 3) low levels of atresia at the end of spawning. The determinate-method estimate of American shad annual (2015) fecundity (303,000 ± 73,400; mean ± sd) overlapped historic estimates for this and a neighboring river. The indeterminate-method estimate of annual (2015) fecundity (311,500 ± 4,500 sd) was not significantly different from the determinate-method estimate (Student's t-test, P > 0.05). In contrast, indeterminate-method estimates of annual fecundity for a Virginia population were twice as high as that measured by the determinate method in the past. This can all be explained by fundamentally different patterns of oogenesis (i.e., group synchrony versus asynchrony with respect to yolk development) at different latitudes. American shad, which is distributed within its native range from the Canadian maritimes to Florida, USA (50-30°N), may be particularly well suited to evaluate intra-specific variation in oocyte development, a relatively unexplored life history trait."
https://openalex.org/W2527774589,"Polypeptide chain has an invariant main-chain and a variant side-chain sequence. How the side-chain sequence determines fold in terms of its chemical constitution has been scrutinized extensively and verified periodically. However, a focussed investigation on the directive effect of side-chain geometry may provide important insights supplementing existing algorithms in mapping the geometrical evolution of protein chains and its structural preferences. Geometrically, folding of protein structure may be envisaged as the evolution of its geometric variables: ϕ, and ψ dihedral angles of polypeptide main-chain directed by χ1, and χ2 of side chain. In this work, protein molecule is metaphorically modelled as a machine with 4 rotors ϕ, ψ, χ1 and χ2, with its evolution to the functional fold is directed by combinations of its rotor directions. We observe that differential rotor motions lead to different secondary structure formations and the combinatorial pattern is unique and consistent for particular secondary structure type. Further, we found that combination of rotor geometries of each amino acid is unique which partly explains how different amino acid sequence combinations have unique structural evolution and functional adaptation. Quantification of these amino acid rotor preferences, resulted in the generation of 3 substitution matrices, which later on plugged in the BLAST tool, for evaluating their efficiency in aligning sequences. We have employed BLOSUM62 and PAM30 as standard for primary evaluation. Generation of substitution matrices is a logical extension of the conceptual framework we attempted to build during the development of this work. Optimization of matrices following the conventional routines and possible application with biologically relevant data sets are beyond the scope of this manuscript, though it is a part of the larger project design."

HKCs with ectopic CYP 1A1 expression were more tolerant to AA than the control cells. Therefore, OM may alleviate AMK-mediated acute nephrotoxicity through induction of CYP 1A1. We suggest that the coadministration of OM might be beneficial for reducing of AA-induced nephrotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2529240153,"In mammals, episodic memory and spatial cognition involve context-specific recruitment of unique ensembles in the hippocampal formation (HF). Despite their capacity for sophisticated spatial (e.g., for migration) and episodic-like (e.g., for food-caching) memory, the mechanisms underlying contextual representation in birds is not well understood. Here we demonstrate environment-specific Egr1 expression as male brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) navigate environments for food reward, showing that the avian HF, like its mammalian counterpart, recruits distinct neuronal ensembles to represent different contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2529463887,"Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend postoperative radiation therapy based only on adverse pathologic findings (APFs), irrespective of preoperative risk group. We assessed whether a model incorporating both the preoperative risk group and APFs could predict long-term oncologic outcomes better than a model based on APFs alone.We retrospectively reviewed 4,404 men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution between 1992 and 2014. After excluding patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy or with incomplete pathological or follow-up data, 3,092 men were included in the final analysis. APFs were defined as extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), or a positive surgical margin (PSM). The adequacy of model fit to the data was compared using the likelihood-ratio test between the models with and without risk groups, and model discrimination was compared with the concordance index (c-index) for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). We performed multivariate Cox proportional hazard model and competing risk regression analyses to identify predictors of BCR and PCSM in the total patient group and each of the risk groups.Adding risk groups to the model containing only APFs significantly improved the fit to the data (likelihood-ratio test, p <0.001) and the c-index increased from 0.693 to 0.732 for BCR and from 0.707 to 0.747 for PCSM. A RP Gleason score (GS) ≥8 and a PSM were independently associated with BCR in the total patient group and also each risk group. However, only a GS ≥8 and SVI were associated with PCSM in the total patient group (GS ≥8: hazard ratio [HR] 5.39 and SVI: HR 3.36) and the high-risk group (GS ≥8: HR 6.31 and SVI: HR 4.05).The postoperative estimation of oncologic outcomes in men with APFs at RP was improved by considering preoperative risk group stratification. Although a PSM was an independent predictor for BCR, only a RP GS ≥8 and SVI were associated with PCSM in the total patient and high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2527875515,"Background In clinical trials, toxicity leading to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) discontinuation is rare (3% by 2 years); however in clinical practice it seems to be higher, particularly when TDF is co-administered with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r). Aims of this study were to assess the rate of TDF discontinuations in clinical practice and to identify factors associated with the risk of stopping TDF. Methods All antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naive patients initiating a TDF-based regimen were selected from the ICONA Foundation Study cohort. The primary outcome was TDF discontinuation regardless of the reason; secondary outcome measures were TDF discontinuation due to toxicity and selective TDF discontinuation (that is, TDF discontinuation or substitution, maintaining unchanged the remaining antiretroviral treatment). Results 3,618 ART-naïve patients were included: 54% started a PI/r-based and 46% a NNRTI-based based regimen. Two-hundred-seventy-seven patients discontinued TDF and reintroduced ART within 30 days without TDF. The probability of TDF discontinuation regardless of the reason was of 7.4% (95%CI:6.4–8.5) by 2 years and 14.1% (95%CI:12.2–16.1) by 5 years. The 5-year KM estimates in the PI/r vs. NNRTI group were 20.4% vs. 7.6%, respectively (log-rank p = 0.0001), for the outcome of stopping regardless of the reason, and 10.7% vs. 4.7% (p = 0.0001) for discontinuation due to toxicity. PI/r use and lower eGFR were associated with an increased risk of discontinuing TDF. Conclusion In our cohort, the frequency of TDF discontinuations was higher than that observed in clinical trials. Co-administration of TDF with PI/r was associated with an increased rate of TDF discontinuations. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms that might have led to this outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2528556841,"This paper examines the bank lending channel, which considers how monetary authority actions affect the variation of loans. We focus on the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) totalizing 1254 banks from five countries in the period 2000-2012 (totalizing 13 years). The empirical results show that the effect of money supply growth on the growth of loans is non-linear and inverted U-shaped. In this context, our results show empirical evidence expansionary monetary policies do not increase the propensity of economic agents to systematically take greater risks on the market. After a certain level of money stock, increases in the money supply do not lead to increased negotiated credit."
https://openalex.org/W2530954625,"The aim of this study was to describe the use of dengue warning signs by pediatric healthcare staff in the Brazilian public health care system.Cross-sectional study (2012) with physicians, nurses, and nurse technicians assisting children in five health care facilities. Participants reported the use and importance of dengue warning signs in pediatrics clinical practice through a structured questionnaire. Differences in the use of signs (chi-square test) and in the ranking assigned to each of them (Kruskal-Wallis) were assessed according to health care occupation and level of care (p<0.05).The final sample comprised 474 participants (97%), mean age of 37 years (standard deviation = 10.3), mainly females (83.8%), physicians (40.1%) and from tertiary care (75.1%). The majority (91%) reported using warning signs for dengue in pediatrics clinical practice. The most widely used and highly valued signs were major hemorrhages (gastrointestinal, urinary), abdominal pain, and increase in hematocrit concurrent or not with rapid decrease in platelet count. Persistent vomiting as well as other signs of plasma leakage such as respiratory distress and lethargy/restlessness were not identified as having the same degree of importance, especially by nurse technicians and in primary or secondary care.Although most health care staff reported using dengue warning signs, it would be useful to extend the training for identifying easily recognizable signs of plasma leakage that occur regardless of bleeding."
