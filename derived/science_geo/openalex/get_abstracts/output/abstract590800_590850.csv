https://openalex.org/W2735472327,"The ruminal microbiome, comprising large numbers of bacteria, ciliate protozoa, archaea and fungi, responds to diet and dietary additives in a complex way. The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits of increasing the depth of the community analysis in describing and explaining responses to dietary changes. Quantitative PCR, ssu rRNA amplicon based taxa composition, diversity and co-occurrence network analyses were applied to ruminal digesta samples obtained from four multiparous Nordic Red dairy cows fitted with rumen cannulae. The cows received diets with forage:concentrate ratio either 35:65 (diet H) or 65:35 (L), supplemented or not with sunflower oil (SO) (0 or 50 g/kg diet dry matter), supplied in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments and four 35-day periods. Digesta samples were collected on days 22 and 24 and combined. QPCR provided a broad picture in which a large fall in the abundance of fungi was seen with SO in the H but not the L diet. Amplicon sequencing showed higher community diversity indices in L as compared to H diets and revealed diet specific taxa abundance changes, highlighting large differences in protozoal and fungal composition. Methanobrevibacter ruminantium and Mbb. gottschalkii dominated archaeal communities, and their abundance correlated negatively with each other. Co-occurrence network analysis provided evidence that no microbial domain played a more central role in network formation, that some minor-abundance taxa were at nodes of highest centrality, and that microbial interactions were diet specific. Networks added new dimensions to our understanding of the diet effect on rumen microbial community interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2735082680,"p53 over expression in yeast results in cell death with typical markers of apoptosis such as DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization. We aimed to substitute/supplement classical fluorescent techniques (TUNEL, Annexin V, ROS detection) usually used to detect biochemical changes occurring during yeast apoptosis mediated by p53 over expression and the effect of anti-apoptotic purified molecules from Nigel (Nigella sativa) extracts on these same yeasts by the label free technique of FTIR spectroscopy. The comparison of the entire IR spectra highlighted clear modifications between apoptotic p53-expressing yeasts and normal ones. More precisely, DNA damage was detected by the decrease of band intensities at 1079 and 1048 cm-1. While phosphatidylserine exposure was followed by the increase of νsCH2 and νasCH2 bands of unsaturated fatty acids that were exhibited at 2855 and 2926 cm-1, and the appearance of the C = O ester functional group band at 1740 cm-1. In a second step, this FTIR approach was used to estimate the effect of a purified fraction of the Nigel extract. The modulation of band intensities specific to DNA and membrane status was in agreement with apoptosis supression in presence of the Nigel extracts. FTIR spectroscopy is thus proven to be a very reliable technique to monitor the apoptotic cell death in yeast and to be used as a means of evaluating the biomolecules effect on yeast survival."

The aim of this study was to observe the effect of PtNPs in in vitro amplification of DNA fragment of phage λ, on the bacterial cultures (Staphylococcus aureus), human foreskin fibroblasts and erythrocytes. In vitro synthesized PtNPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (PtNPs size range 4.8-11.7 nm), zeta potential measurements (-15 mV at pH 7.4), X-ray fluorescence, UV/vis spectrophotometry and atomic absorption spectrometry. The PtNPs inhibited the DNA replication and affected the secondary structure of DNA at higher concentrations, which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing and DNA denaturation experiments. Further, cisplatin (CisPt), as traditional chemotherapy agent, was used in all parallel experiments. Moreover, the encapsulation of PtNPs in liposomes (LipoPtNPs) caused an approximately 2.4x higher of DNA damage in comparison with CisPt, LipoCisPt and PtNPs. The encapsulation of PtNPs in liposomes also increased their antibacterial, cytostatic and cytotoxic effect, which was determined by the method of growth curves on S. aureus and HFF cells. In addition, both the bare and encapsulated PtNPs caused lower oxidative stress (determined by GSH/GSSG ratio) in the human erythrocytes compared to the bare and encapsulated CisPt. CisPt was used in all parallel experiments as traditional chemotherapy agent."
https://openalex.org/W2735738785,"Near-infrared (874-1734 nm) hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) technique combined with chemometric methods was used to trace origins of 1200 Chinese wolfberry samples, which from Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Sinkiang and Qinghai in China. Two approaches, named pixel-wise and object-wise, were investigated to discriminative the origin of these Chinese wolfberries. The pixel-wise classification assigned a class to each pixel from individual Chinese wolfberries, and with this approach, the differences in the Chinese wolfberries from four origins were reflected intuitively. Object-wise classification was performed using mean spectra. The average spectral information of all pixels of each sample in the hyperspectral image was extracted as the representative spectrum of a sample, and then discriminant analysis models of the origins of Chinese wolfberries were established based on these average spectra. Specifically, the spectral curves of all samples were collected, and after removal of obvious noise, the spectra of 972-1609 nm were viewed as the spectra of wolfberry. Then, the spectral curves were pretreated with moving average smoothing (MA), and discriminant analysis models including support vector machine (SVM), neural network with radial basis function (NN-RBF) and extreme learning machine (ELM) were established based on the full-band spectra, the extracted characteristic wavelengths from loadings of principal component analysis (PCA) and 2nd derivative spectra, respectively. Among these models, the recognition accuracies of the calibration set and prediction set of the ELM model based on extracted characteristic wavelengths from loadings of PCA were higher than 90%. The model not only ensured a high recognition rate but also simplified the model and was conducive to future rapid on-line testing. The results revealed that NIR-HSI combined with PCA loadings-ELM could rapidly trace the origins of Chinese wolfberries."

This study evaluated the pilot year of the Curtin Specialist Mentoring Program (CSMP), a specialised peer mentoring program for university students with ASD aimed at improving self-reported well-being, academic success and retention in university studies.A single group pre-test, post-test design was employed. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations were undertaken with 10 young adults with ASD to explore the effectiveness and acceptability of the CSMP program. Students completed a battery of questionnaires focused on general anxiety, state communication apprehension, perceived communication competence, and communication apprehension both prior to, and five months after commencing enrolment in the CSMP. Information regarding academic success and retention was also obtained. Interviews with participants provided further insight into their experience of the program.Students enrolled in the CSMP showed significant improvement in social support and general communication apprehension assessment scores. Interviews revealed key features of the CSMP that may have contributed to these positive outcomes.The current study provides preliminary evidence that a specialised peer mentoring program can improve the well-being of students with ASD, and highlights the importance of interventions which are individualised, flexible, based on a social model, and target environmental factors such as social support."
https://openalex.org/W2735256934,"Introduction Little is known about the role of viral respiratory pathogens in the etiology, seasonality or severity of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Methods Sentinel surveillance for SARI was conducted from December 2007 through February 2014 at 20 hospitals in Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Qatar and Yemen. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from hospitalized patients meeting SARI case definitions and were analyzed for infection with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human parainfluenza virus types 1–3 (hPIV1-3). We analyzed surveillance data to calculate positivity rates for viral respiratory pathogens, describe the seasonality of those pathogens and determine which pathogens were responsible for more severe outcomes requiring ventilation and/or intensive care and/or resulting in death. Results At least one viral respiratory pathogen was detected in 8,753/28,508 (30.7%) samples tested for at least one pathogen and 3,497/9,315 (37.5%) of samples tested for all pathogens–influenza in 3,345/28,438 (11.8%), RSV in 3,942/24,503 (16.1%), AdV in 923/9,402 (9.8%), hMPV in 617/9,384 (6.6%), hPIV1 in 159/9,402 (1.7%), hPIV2 in 85/9,402 (0.9%) and hPIV3 in 365/9,402 (3.9%). Multiple pathogens were identified in 501/9,316 (5.4%) participants tested for all pathogens. Monthly variation, indicating seasonal differences in levels of infection, was observed for all pathogens. Participants with hMPV infections and participants less than five years of age were significantly less likely than participants not infected with hMPV and those older than five years of age, respectively, to experience a severe outcome, while participants with a pre-existing chronic disease were at increased risk of a severe outcome, compared to those with no reported pre-existing chronic disease. Conclusions Viral respiratory pathogens are common among SARI patients in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Ongoing surveillance is important to monitor changes in the etiology, seasonality and severity of pathogens of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2736004716,"Pathogens that spill over between species cause a significant human and animal health burden. Here, we describe characteristics of animal reservoirs that are required for pathogen spillover. We assembled and analyzed a database of 330 disease systems in which a pathogen spills over from a reservoir of one or more species. Three-quarters of reservoirs included wildlife, and 84% included mammals. Further, 65% of pathogens depended on a community of reservoir hosts, rather than a single species, for persistence. Among mammals, the most frequently identified reservoir hosts were rodents, artiodactyls, and carnivores. The distribution among orders of mammalian species identified as reservoirs did not differ from that expected by chance. Among disease systems with high priority pathogens and epidemic potential, we found birds, primates, and bats to be overrepresented. We also analyzed the life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts and compared them to mammals as a whole. Reservoir species had faster life history characteristics than mammals overall, exhibiting traits associated with greater reproductive output rather than long-term survival. Thus, we find that in many respects, reservoirs of spillover pathogens are indeed special. The described patterns provide a useful resource for studying and managing emerging infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2735616688,"Objective Our study focuses on exploring (1) the intention of health professionals to use and recommend e-mental health applications, (2) how this intention of health professionals might be influenced, (3) which group of health professionals might be most accessible to promote e-mental health applications for maternal depression, and (4) for which tasks they rate them to be most useful. Materials and methods Based on a questionnaire informed by the theory of planned behavior, we collected 131 responses of U.S., Spanish, and Swiss health professionals in the field of pregnancy and maternal care (including psychologists, psychiatrists, midwives, and doctors) by means of an online survey. We analyzed the gathered data applying a structured equation model. Results Our study reveals that health professionals would in general intend to recommend and use e-mental health applications. However, their attitude towards e-mental health applications varies regarding the respective use cases and also differs among health professions. Conclusion We offer three alternative propositions for private or public organizations, associations, or any other entity whose purpose is service to the community for introducing e-mental health applications into practice."
https://openalex.org/W2735908350,"Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis and is considered a major public health problem worldwide. Currently, there is no widely available vaccine against leptospirosis for use in humans. A purified, recombinant subunit vaccine that includes the last six immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains of the leptospiral protein LigA (LigA7'-13) protects against lethal infection but not renal colonization after challenge by Leptospira interrogans. In this study, we examined whether the addition of the first seven Ig-like domains of LigB (LigB0-7) to LigA7'-13, can enhance immune protection and confer sterilizing immunity in the Golden Syrian hamster model of acute leptospirosis. Hamsters were subcutaneously immunized with soluble, recombinant LigA7'-13, LigB0-7, or a combination of LigA7'-13 and LigB0-7 in Freund's adjuvant. Immunization with Lig proteins generated a strong humoral immune response with high titers of IgG that recognized homologous protein, and cross-reacted with the heterologous protein as assessed by ELISA. LigA7'-13 alone, or in combination with LigB0-7, protected all hamsters from intraperitoneal challenge with a lethal dose of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130. However, bacteria were recovered from the kidneys of all animals. Of eight animals immunized with LigB0-7, only three survived Leptospira challenge, one of which lacked renal colonization and had antibodies to native LigB by immunoblot. In addition, sera from two of the three LigB0-7 immunized survivors cross-reacted with LigA11-13, a region of LigA that is sufficient for protection. In summary, we confirmed that LigA7'-13 protects hamsters from death but not infection, and immunization with LigB0-7, either alone or in combination with LigA7'-13, did not confer sterilizing immunity."

In a 9-week longitudinal study, undergraduate students, all taking a psychology statistics course, were randomly assigned to a control condition or a values-affirmation manipulation intended to improve numeracy. By the final week in the course, the numeracy intervention (statistics-course enrollment combined with values affirmation) enhanced objective numeracy, subjective numeracy, and two decision-related outcomes (financial literacy and health-related behaviors). It also showed positive indirect-only effects on financial outcomes and a series of STEM-related outcomes (course grades, intentions to take more math-intensive courses, later math-intensive courses taken based on academic transcripts). All decision and STEM-related outcome effects were mediated by the changes in objective and/or subjective numeracy and demonstrated similar and robust enhancements. Improvements to abstract numeric reasoning can improve everyday outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2734786188,"Eicosanoids may play a role in ischemic stroke. However, the associations of variants in cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway genes and interaction among these variants with carotid plaque vulnerability are not fully understood. In present study, twelve variants in COX pathway genes were examined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry method in 396 patients with ischemic stroke and 291 controls. Platelet aggregation, platelet-leukocyte aggregates, and urine 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (11-dTxB2) were also measured. According to the results of carotid high-resolution B-mode ultrasound, the patients were stratified into the following groups [i.e., non-carotid plaque and carotid plaque. The carotid plaque was further classified into subgroups of echolucent plaque (ELP) and echogenic plaque (EGP)]. Additionally, gene-gene interactions were analyzed to assess whether there was any interactive role for assessed variants in affecting carotid plaque vulnerability, platelet activation and 11-dTxB2 levels. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of genotypes of the twelve variants between patients and controls. Among 396 patients, 294 cases (74.2%) had carotid plaques (106 had ELP, 188 had EGP). Frequency of PTGS2 rs20417CC, TXAS1 rs2267679TT, TXAS1 rs41708TT, PTGIS rs5602CC, and TXA2R rs1131882TT genotype was significantly higher in patients with plaque compared with patients without plaque, or in patients with ELP compared with patients with EGP. 11-dTxB2 levels, platelet aggregation and platelet-leukocyte aggregates were significantly higher in patients with ELP compared with patients without plaque or with EGP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that PTGS2 rs20417CC, TXA2R rs1131882TT, and high-risk interaction among variants in PTGS2 rs20417, TXA2R rs1131882 and TXAS1 rs41708 were independently associated with the risk of ELP after adjusting for confounding variables. The variants in COX pathway genes and the high-risk interactions among variants in PTGS2 rs20417, TXA2R rs1131882 and TXAS1 rs41708 were associated with high 11-dTxB2 and platelet activation, and independently associated with the risk of carotid plaque vulnerability. These variants might be potential markers for plaque instability."
https://openalex.org/W2735729690,"Starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa) is an alga that has emerged as an aquatic invasive species of concern in the United States. Where established, starry stonewort can interfere with recreational uses of water bodies and potentially have ecological impacts. Incipient invasion of starry stonewort in Minnesota provides an opportunity to predict future expansion in order to target early detection and strategic management. We used ecological niche models to identify suitable areas for starry stonewort in Minnesota based on global occurrence records and present-day and future climate conditions. We assessed sensitivity of forecasts to different parameters, using four emission scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6, and RCP 8.5) from five future climate models (i.e., CCSM, GISS, IPSL, MIROC, and MRI). From our niche model analyses, we found that (i) occurrences from the entire range, instead of occurrences restricted to the invaded range, provide more informed models; (ii) default settings in Maxent did not provide the best model; (iii) the model calibration area and its background samples impact model performance; (iv) model projections to future climate conditions should be restricted to analogous environments; and (v) forecasts in future climate conditions should include different future climate models and model calibration areas to better capture uncertainty in forecasts. Under present climate, the most suitable areas for starry stonewort are predicted to be found in central and southeastern Minnesota. In the future, suitable areas for starry stonewort are predicted to shift in geographic range under some future climate models and to shrink under others, with most permutations indicating a net decrease of the species’ suitable range. Our suitability maps can serve to design short-term plans for surveillance and education, while future climate models suggest a plausible reduction of starry stonewort spread in the long-term if the trends in climate warming remain."
https://openalex.org/W2735671455,"Parasitic infections by the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer), cause huge economic damage in salmon farming in the northern hemisphere, with combined treatment costs and production losses in 2014 having been estimated at US$ 350 million for Norway (annual production 1.25 million tonnes). The control of L. salmonis relies significantly on medicinal treatments, supplemented by non-pharmacological approaches. However, efficacy losses have been reported for several delousing agents, including the pyrethroid deltamethrin. The aim of the present study was to analyse the genetic basis of deltamethrin resistance in L. salmonis. Deltamethrin median effective concentrations (EC50) were 0.28 μg L-1 in the drug susceptible L. salmonis strain IoA-00 and 40.1 μg L-1 in the pyrethroid resistant strain IoA-02. IoA-00 and IoA-02 were crossed to produce families spanning one parental and three filial generations (P0, F1-F3). In three families derived from P0 crosses between an IoA-00 sire and an IoA-02 dam, 98.8% of F2 parasites (n = 173) were resistant, i.e. remained unaffected after exposure to 2.0 μg L-1 deltamethrin. F3 parasites from these crosses showed a deltamethrin EC50 of 9.66 μg L-1. In two families of the inverse orientation at P0 (IoA-02 sire x IoA-00 dam), 16.7% of F2 parasites were resistant (n = 84), while the deltamethrin EC50 in F3 animals was 0.26 μg L-1. The results revealed a predominantly maternal inheritance of deltamethrin resistance. The 15,947-nt mitochondrial genome was sequenced and compared among six unrelated L. salmonis strains and parasites sampled from wild salmon in 2010. IoA-02 and three further deltamethrin resistant strains, established from isolates originating from different regions of Scotland, showed almost identical mitochondrial haplotypes. In contrast, the mitochondrial genome was variable among susceptible strains and L. salmonis from wild hosts. Deltamethrin caused toxicity and depletion of whole body ATP levels in IoA-00 but not IoA-02 parasites. The maternal inheritance of deltamethrin resistance and its association with mitochondrial haplotypes suggests that pyrethroid toxicity in L. salmonis may involve molecular targets encoded by mitochondrial genes."
https://openalex.org/W2735175245,"The CCCH zinc finger is a group of proteins characterised by a typical motif consisting of three cysteine residues and one histidine residue. These proteins have been reported to play important roles in regulation of plant growth, developmental processes and environmental responses. In the present study, genome wide analysis of the CCCH zinc finger gene family was carried out in the available chickpea genome. Various bioinformatics tools were employed to predict 58 CCCH zinc finger genes in chickpea (designated CarC3H1-58), which were analysed for their physio-chemical properties. Phylogenetic analysis classified the proteins into 12 groups in which members of a particular group had similar structural organization. Further, the numbers as well as the types of CCCH motifs present in the CarC3H proteins were compared with those from Arabidopsis and Medicago truncatula. Synteny analysis revealed valuable information regarding the evolution of this gene family. Tandem and segmental duplication events were identified and their Ka/Ks values revealed that the CarC3H gene family in chickpea had undergone purifying selection. Digital, as well as real time qRT-PCR expression analysis was performed which helped in identification of several CarC3H members that expressed preferentially in specific chickpea tissues as well as during abiotic stresses (desiccation, cold, salinity). Moreover, molecular characterization of an important member CarC3H45 was carried out. This study provides comprehensive genomic information about the important CCCH zinc finger gene family in chickpea. The identified tissue specific and abiotic stress specific CCCH genes could be potential candidates for further characterization to delineate their functional roles in development and stress."
https://openalex.org/W2736108886,"Sexual dimorphisms are well recognized in various cardiac diseases such as ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Thorough understanding of the underlying genetic programs is crucial to optimize treatment strategies specified for each gender. By performing meta-analysis and microarray analysis, we sought to comprehensively characterize the sexual dimorphisms in the healthy and diseased heart at the level of both mRNA and miRNA transcriptome.Existing mRNA microarray data of both mouse and human heart were integrated, identifying dozens/ hundreds of sexually dimorphic genes in healthy heart, ICM, HCM, and DCM. These sexually dimorphic genes overrepresented gene ontologies (GOs) important for cardiac homeostasis. Further, microarray of miRNA, isolated from mouse sham left ventricle (LV) (n = 6 & n = 5 for male & female) and chronic MI LV (n = 19 & n = 19) and from human normal LV (n = 6 & n = 6) and ICM LV (n = 4 & n = 5), was conducted. This revealed that 13 mouse miRNAs are sexually dimorphic in MI and 6 in normal heart. In human, 3 miRNAs were sexually dimorphic in ICM and 15 in normal heart. These data revealed miRNA-mRNA networks that operate in a sexually-biased fashion.mRNA and miRNA transcriptome of normal and disease heart show significant sex differences, which might impact the cardiac homeostasis. Together this study provides the first comprehensive picture of the genome-wide program underlying the heart sexual dimorphisms, laying the foundation for gender specific treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2734776539,"Collagen III is critical to the integrity of blood vessels and distensible organs, and in hemostasis. Examination of the human collagen III interactome reveals a nearly identical structural arrangement and charge distribution pattern as for collagen I, with cell interaction domains, fibrillogenesis and enzyme cleavage domains, several major ligand-binding regions, and intermolecular crosslink sites at the same sites. These similarities allow heterotypic fibril formation with, and substitution by, collagen I in embryonic development and wound healing. The collagen III fibril assumes a ""flexi-rod"" structure with flexible zones interspersed with rod-like domains, which is consistent with the molecule's prominence in young, pliable tissues and distensible organs. Collagen III has two major hemostasis domains, with binding motifs for von Willebrand factor, α2β1 integrin, platelet binding octapeptide and glycoprotein VI, consistent with the bleeding tendency observed with COL3A1 disease-causing sequence variants."
https://openalex.org/W2736147832,"Maternal control of inflammation is essential during pregnancy and an exaggerated response is one of the underlying causes of fetal loss. Inflammatory response is mediated by multiple factors and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are central. Activation of TLRs results in NALP-3 mediated assembly of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and caspase-1 into the inflammasome and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Given that preventing measures are lacking, we investigated PreImplantation Factor (PIF) as therapeutic option as PIF modulates Inflammation in pregnancy. Additionally, synthetic PIF (PIF analog) protects against multiple immune disorders. We used a LPS induced murine model of fetal loss and synthetic PIF reduced this fetal loss and increased the embryo weight significantly. We detected increased PIF expression in the placentae after LPS insult. The LPS induced serum and placenta cytokines were abolished by synthetic PIF treatment and importantly synthetic PIF modulated key members of inflammasome complex NALP-3, ASC, and caspase-1 as well. In conclusion our results indicate that synthetic PIF protects against LPS induced fetal loss, likely through modulation of inflammatory response especially the inflammasome complex. Given that synthetic PIF is currently tested in autoimmune diseases of non-pregnant subjects (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02239562), therapeutic approach during pregnancy can be envisioned."
https://openalex.org/W2735421894,"Objective We performed single-variant and gene-based association analyses of plasma amyloid-β (aβ) concentrations using whole exome sequence from 1,414 African and European Americans. Our goal was to identify genes that influence plasma aβ42 concentrations and aβ42:aβ40 ratios in late middle age (mean = 59 years), old age (mean = 77 years), or change over time (mean = 18 years). Methods Plasma aβ measures were linearly regressed onto age, gender, APOE ε4 carrier status, and time elapsed between visits (fold-changes only) separately by race. Following inverse normal transformation of the residuals, seqMeta was used to conduct race-specific single-variant and gene-based association tests while adjusting for population structure. Linear regression models were fit on autosomal variants with minor allele frequencies (MAF)≥1%. T5 burden and Sequence Kernel Association (SKAT) gene-based tests assessed functional variants with MAF≤5%. Cross-race fixed effects meta-analyses were Bonferroni-corrected for the number of variants or genes tested. Results Seven genes were associated with aβ in late middle age or change over time; no associations were identified in old age. Single variants in KLKB1 (rs3733402; p = 4.33x10-10) and F12 (rs1801020; p = 3.89x10-8) were significantly associated with midlife aβ42 levels through cross-race meta-analysis; the KLKB1 variant replicated internally using 1,014 additional participants with exome chip. ITPRIP, PLIN2, and TSPAN18 were associated with the midlife aβ42:aβ40 ratio via the T5 test; TSPAN18 was significant via the cross-race meta-analysis, whereas ITPRIP and PLIN2 were European American-specific. NCOA1 and NT5C3B were associated with the midlife aβ42:aβ40 ratio and the fold-change in aβ42, respectively, via SKAT in African Americans. No associations replicated externally (N = 725). Conclusion We discovered age-dependent genetic effects, established associations between vascular-related genes (KLKB1, F12, PLIN2) and midlife plasma aβ levels, and identified a plausible Alzheimer’s Disease candidate gene (ITPRIP) influencing cell death. Plasma aβ concentrations may have dynamic biological determinants across the lifespan; plasma aβ study designs or analyses must consider age."
https://openalex.org/W2735505419,"The complex architecture of adult brain derives from tightly regulated migration and differentiation of precursor cells generated during embryonic neurogenesis. Changes at transcriptional level of genes that regulate migration and differentiation may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is already expressed during early embryonic days. However, AR role in the regulation of gene expression at early embryonic stage is yet to be determinate. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Sox2 overlapping transcript (Sox2OT) plays a crucial role in gene expression control during development but its transcriptional regulation is still to be clearly defined. Here, using Bicalutamide in order to pharmacologically inactivated AR, we investigated whether AR participates in the regulation of the transcription of the lncRNASox2OTat early embryonic stage. We identified a new DNA binding region upstream of Sox2 locus containing three androgen response elements (ARE), and found that AR binds such a sequence in embryonic neural stem cells and in mouse embryonic brain. Our data suggest that through this binding, AR can promote the RNA polymerase II dependent transcription of Sox2OT. Our findings also suggest that AR participates in embryonic neurogenesis through transcriptional control of the long non-coding RNA Sox2OT."
https://openalex.org/W2736052828,"The United States Virgin Islands are comprised of two separate insular platforms separated by the deep water Anegada Passage. Although managed by the same regulations, as one fishery, several physical and spatial differences exist between the two northern shelf islands, St. Thomas and St. John, and isolated St. Croix. Based on two long-term fisheries independent datasets, collected by the U.S. Virgin Islands Territorial Coral Reef Monitoring Program and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, there were significant differences between the northern USVI and St. Croix in both the occurrence and size of several species of large and commercially important reef fishes. These fishes are primarily apex piscivores and generally the first species over-exploited in small-scale fisheries. The disparities between the fish communities on the two island shelves cannot be explained solely by differences in habitat (coral cover, rugosity) or fisheries management, such as relative amount of marine protected area in local waters. They are instead probably caused by a combination of several other interrelated factors including water depth, fishing methodology, fishable area, and the presence or absence of viable fish spawning areas. This study considers those aspects, and illustrates the need for management of island artisanal fisheries that is tailored to the physical and spatial constraints imposed by insular platforms."
https://openalex.org/W2735584782,"Verbal working memory (WM) comprises different processes (encoding, maintenance, retrieval) that are often compromised in brain diseases, but their neural correlates have not yet been examined in childhood and adolescence. To probe WM processes and associated neural correlates in developmental samples, and obtain comparable effects across different ages and populations, we designed an adapted Brown-Peterson task (verbal encoding and retrieval combined with verbal and visual concurrent tasks during maintenance) to implement during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a sample of typically developing children and adolescents (n = 16), aged 8 to 16 years, our paradigm successfully identified distinct patterns of activation for encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. While encoding activated perceptual systems in posterior and ventral visual regions, retrieval activated fronto-parietal regions associated with executive control and attention. We found a different impact of verbal versus visual concurrent processing during WM maintenance: at retrieval, the former condition evoked greater activations in visual cortex, as opposed to selective involvement of language-related areas in left temporal cortex in the latter condition. These results are in accord with WM models, suggesting greater competition for processing resources when retrieval follows within-domain compared with cross-domain interference. This pattern was found regardless of age. Our study provides a novel paradigm to investigate distinct WM brain systems with reliable results across a wide age range in developmental populations, and suitable for participants with different WM capacities."
https://openalex.org/W2735248039,"The bacterial diversity in the Su Bentu Cave in Sardinia was investigated by means of 16S rRNA gene-based analysis. This 15 km long cave, carved in Jurassic limestone, hosts a variety of calcite speleothems, and a long succession of subterranean lakes with mixed granite and carbonate sands. The lower level is occasionally flooded by a rising groundwater level, but with only scarce input of organic remains (leaves and charcoal fragments). On the quiet cave pools there are visible calcite rafts, whereas walls are locally coated with manganese deposits. In the drier upper levels, where organic input is much more subdued, moonmilk-a hydrated calcium-magnesium carbonate speleothem-can be found. Relative humidity approaches 100% and the measured mean annual cave air temperature is 14.8°C. Samples were obtained in 2014 from calcite rafts, moonmilk, manganese oxide deposits and soil (limestone and granite grains). Microclimatic conditions in the cave near the sampling sites, sample properties, physico-chemical parameters of water, and sediment composition were determined. The microbial community of this system is predominately composed of the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Firmicutes. Sampling sites near the entrance of the cave and in close proximity of the underground campsite-located 500 meters deep into the cave-revealed the highest diversity as well as the highest number of human associated microorganisms. Two samples obtained in very close proximity of each other near the campsite, indicate that the human impact is localized and is not distributed freely within the system. Analysis of the abundance of bacterial and archaeal amoA genes revealed a far greater abundance of archaeal amoA genes compared to bacterial representatives. The results of this study highlight that human impact is confined to locations that are utilized as campsites and that exploration leaves little microbial trails. Furthermore, we uncovered a highly specialized microbiome, which is perfectly adapted to survive and thrive in an environment with low nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W2734396934,"Soil food web structure and function is primarily determined by the major basal resources, which are living plant tissue, root exudates and dead organic matter. A field experiment was performed to disentangle the interlinkage of the root-and detritus-based soil food chains. An arable site was cropped either with maize, amended with maize shoot litter or remained bare soil, representing food webs depending on roots, aboveground litter and soil organic matter as predominant resource, respectively. The soil micro-food web, i.e. microorganisms and nematodes, was investigated in two successive years along a depth transect. The community composition of nematodes was used as model to determine the changes in the rhizosphere, detritusphere and bulk soil food web. In the first growing season the impact of treatments on the soil micro-food web was minor. In the second year plant-feeding nematodes increased under maize, whereas after harvest the Channel Index assigned promotion of the detritivore food chain, reflecting decomposition of root residues. The amendment with litter did not foster microorganisms, instead biomass of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as that of fungi declined in the rooted zone. Likely higher grazing pressure by nematodes reduced microbial standing crop as bacterial and fungal feeders increased. However, populations at higher trophic levels were not promoted, indicating limited flux of litter resources along the food chain. After two years of bare soil microbial biomass and nematode density remained stable, pointing to soil organic matter-based resources that allow bridging periods with deprivation. Nematode communities were dominated by opportunistic taxa that are competitive at moderate resource supply. In sum, removal of plants from the system had less severe effects than expected, suggesting considerable food web resilience to the disruption of both the root and detrital carbon channel, pointing to a legacy of organic matter resources in arable soils."
https://openalex.org/W2735011482,"Platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) are closely associated with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and contribute to the inflammatory process. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) play important roles in the progression of joint destruction. The aim of this study is to demonstrate whether PMPs affect the adhesion and motility of RA-FLSs. Our data indicated that PMPs promoted migration, invasion and adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) of RA-FLSs. Further study showed that PMPs up-regulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) and increased the level of phosphorylation of NF-κB (p-NF-κB) and Erk (p-Erk) in RA-FLSs. These results suggest that PMPs promote RA-FLSs adhesion and motility presumably by increasing MMP1 via activating Erk-mediated NF-κB pathway."

In the present study, mice were infected with P. multocida (1.6 × 103 cfu, intraperitoneal) to evaluate host gene expression profile at early and late stages of infection using high throughput microarray transcriptome analyses. Several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at both the time points were identified in P.multocida infected spleen, liver and lungs. Functional annotation of these DEGs showed enrichment of key pathways such as TLR, NF-κB, MAPK, TNF, JAK-STAT and NOD like receptor signaling pathways. Several DEGs overlapped across different KEGG pathways indicating a crosstalk between them. The predicted protein—protein interaction among these DEGs suggested, that the recognition of P. multocida LPS or outer membrane components by TLR4 and CD14, results in intracellular signaling via MyD88, IRAKs and/or TRAF6 leading to activation of NFκB and MAPK pathways and associated cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2735816613,"Forty percent of American women are obese and at risk for type II diabetes, impaired immune function, and altered microbiome diversity, thus impacting overall health. We investigated whether obesity induced by an excess calorie, high fat diet containing hydrogenated fats, fructose, and coconut oil (HFD) altered glucose homeostasis, peripheral immunity, and urogenital microbial dynamics. We hypothesized that HFD would cause hyperglycemia, increase peripheral inflammation, and alter urogenital microbiota to favor bacterial taxonomy associated with inflammation. We utilized female Ossabaw mini-pigs to model a ‘thrifty’ metabolic phenotype associated with increased white adipose tissue mass. Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18. Vaginal swabs or cervical flushes assessed urogenital microbiota. Systemic fatty acids, insulin, glucose, and cytokines were analyzed. Pig weights and morphometric measurements were taken weekly. Obese pigs had increased body weight, length, heart and belly girth but similar glucose concentrations. Obese pigs had decreased cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10), arachidonic acid and plasma insulin, but increased levels of vaccenic acid. Obese pigs had greater urogenital bacterial diversity, including several taxa known for anti-inflammatory properties. Overall, induction of obesity did not induce inflammation but shifted the microbial communities within the urogenital tract to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We postulate that the coconut oil in the HFD oil may have supported normal glucose homeostasis and modulated the immune response, possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics and fatty acid metabolism. This animal model holds promise for the study of how different types of obesity and high fat diets may affect metabolism, immune phenotype, and microbial dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2735039669,"Scoring reflex responsiveness and injury of aquatic organisms has gained popularity as predictors of discard survival. Given this method relies upon the individual interpretation of scoring criteria, an evaluation of its robustness is done here to test whether protocol-instructed, multiple raters with diverse backgrounds (research scientist, technician, and student) are able to produce similar or the same reflex and injury score for one of the same flatfish (European plaice, Pleuronectes platessa) after experiencing commercial fishing stressors. Inter-rater reliability for three raters was assessed by using a 3-point categorical scale (‘absent’, ‘weak’, ‘strong’) and a tagged visual analogue continuous scale (tVAS, a 10 cm bar split in three labelled sections: 0 for ‘absent’, ‘weak’, ‘moderate’, and ‘strong’) for six reflex responses, and a 4-point scale for four injury types. Plaice (n = 304) were sampled from 17 research beam-trawl deployments during four trips. Fleiss kappa (categorical scores) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC, continuous scores) indicated variable inter-rater agreement by reflex type (ranging between 0.55 and 0.88, and 67% and 91% for Fleiss kappa and ICC, respectively), with least agreement among raters on extent of injury (Fleiss kappa between 0.08 and 0.27). Despite differences among raters, which did not significantly influence the relationship between impairment and predicted survival, combining categorical reflex and injury scores always produced a close relationship of such vitality indices and observed delayed mortality. The use of the continuous scale did not improve fit of these models compared with using the reflex impairment index based on categorical scores. Given these findings, we recommend using a 3-point categorical over a continuous scale. We also determined that training rather than experience of raters minimised inter-rater differences. Our results suggest that cost-efficient reflex impairment and injury scoring may be considered a robust technique to evaluate lethal stress and damage of this flatfish species on-board commercial beam-trawl vessels."

Participants consisted of 7716 subjects with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease and a population of 75129 matched control subjects between 2000 and 2010. We measured the risk of Parkinson's disease in association with Sjogren's syndrome by using adjusted odds ratios.A total of 143 Parkinson's disease subjects (1.9%) and 893 control subjects (1.2%) suffered from Sjogren's syndrome (p < 0.001). The crude odds ratio for Parkinson's disease among subjects with Sjogren's syndrome was 1.56 (95% CI 1.30-1.86; p < 0.01). After adjustment for potential confounders which have been proposed that would increase the risk of development of Parkinson's disease, Sjogren's syndrome was found to be significantly associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease with an odds ratio of 1.37 (95% CI 1.15-1.65; p < 0.01).This study preliminarily proposed that Sjogren's syndrome was significant associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2734953075,"Fractures still present a significant burden to patients due to pain and periods of unproductivity. Numerous growth factors have been identified to regulate bone remodeling. However, to date, only the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are used to enhance fracture healing in clinical settings. Activins are pleiotropic growth factors belonging to the TGF-β superfamily. We and others have recently shown that treatment with recombinant fusion proteins of activin receptors greatly increases bone mass in different animal models by trapping activins and other ligands thus inhibiting their signaling pathways. However, their effects on fracture healing are less known. Twelve-week old male C57Bl mice were subjected to a standardized, closed tibial fracture model. Animals were divided into control and treatment groups and were administered either PBS control or a soluble activin type IIB receptor (ActRIIB-Fc) intraperitoneally once a week for a duration of two or four weeks. There were no significant differences between the groups at two weeks but we observed a significant increase in callus mineralization in ActRIIB-Fc-treated animals by microcomputed tomography imaging at four weeks. Bone volume per tissue volume was 60%, trabecular number 55% and bone mineral density 60% higher in the 4-week calluses of the ActRIIB-Fc-treated mice (p<0.05 in all). Biomechanical strength of 4-week calluses was also significantly improved by ActRIIB-Fc treatment as stiffness increased by 64% and maximum force by 45% (p<0.05) compared to the PBS-injected controls. These results demonstrate that ActRIIB-Fc treatment significantly improves healing of closed long bone fractures. Our findings support the previous reports of activin receptors increasing bone mass but also demonstrate a novel approach for using ActRIIB-Fc to enhance fracture healing."

It uses a simple 2-step ligation process to generate length coded products that can be quantified using a variety of DNA sizing methods. We demonstrate Ligo-miR's ability to quantify miRNA expression down to 20 copies per cell sensitivity, accurately discriminate between closely related miRNA, and reliably measure differential changes as small as 1.2-fold. Then, benchmarking studies were performed to show the high correlation between Ligo-miR, microarray, and TaqMan qRT-PCR. Finally, Ligo-miR was used to determine copy number profiles in a number of breast, esophageal, and pancreatic cell lines and to demonstrate the utility of copy number analysis for providing layered insight into expression profile changes."
https://openalex.org/W2609233398,"Background While the importance of the Th2 cytokine IL-13 as a central mediator of airway hyperreactivity (AHR) has been described in allergic protein-induced asthma, this has never been investigated in chemical-induced asthma. Objective We examined the importance of IL-13 in a mouse model of chemical-induced AHR, using toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI). Methods In a first set-up, wild type (WT) and IL-13 knockout (KO) C57Bl/6 mice were dermally treated on days 1 and 8 with 1% TDI or vehicle (acetone/olive oil) on both ears. On day 15, mice received an intranasal instillation with 0.1% TDI or vehicle. In a second set-up, WT mice sensitized with 1% TDI or vehicle, received i.v. either anti-IL-13 or control antibody prior to the intranasal challenge. Results TDI-sensitized and TDI-challenged WT mice showed AHR to methacholine, in contrast to TDI-sensitized and TDI-challenged IL-13 KO mice, which also showed lower levels of total serum IgE. TDI-sensitized and TDI-challenged IL-13 KO mice had lower numbers of T-cells in the auricular lymph nodes. TDI-treated WT mice, receiving anti-IL-13, showed no AHR, in contrast to those receiving control antibody, despite increased levels of IgE. Anti-IL-13 treatment in TDI-treated WT mice resulted in lower levels of serum IL-13, but did not induce changes in T- and B-cell numbers, and in the cytokine production profile. Conclusion and clinical relevance We conclude that IL-13 plays a critical role in the effector phase of chemical-induced, immune-mediated AHR. This implicates that anti-IL-13 treatment could have a beneficial effect in patients with this asthma phenotype."

Insulin resistance was assessed using a homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and serum fasting insulin.In a multivariate linear regression analysis, the HOMA-IR was significantly inversely associated with the BMD of the total hip (TH, β = -0.052, P = 0.002), femoral neck (FN, β = -0.072, P<0.001), femoral trochanter (FTr, β = -0.055, P = 0.003), femoral intertrochanter (FITr, β = -0.041, P = 0.015), and lumbar spine (LS, β = -0.063, P = 0.001) among all study subjects after adjustment for gender, age, height, weight, whole body fat mass percentage, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, vitamin D, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, education level, and household income in both genders as well as labor, the use of oral contraceptives, and age at menarche in females. The serum fasting insulin was significantly inversely associated with the BMD of the TH (β = -0.055, P = 0.001), FN (β = -0.072, P<0.001), FTr (β = -0.055, P = 0.003), FITr (β = -0.045, P = 0.009), and LS (β = -0.064, P = 0.001) among all subjects in a multivariate linear regression analysis.Our results suggest that insulin resistance may be independently and inversely associated with the near peak bone mass of the femur and lumbar spine."
https://openalex.org/W2736056185,"Signal transduction of the conserved transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) family signaling pathway functions through two distinct serine/threonine transmembrane receptors, the type I and type II receptors. Endocytosis orchestrates the assembly of signaling complexes by coordinating the entry of receptors with their downstream signaling mediators. Recently, we showed that the C. elegans type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor SMA-6, part of the TGFβ family, is recycled through the retromer complex while the type II receptor, DAF-4 is recycled in a retromer-independent, ARF-6 dependent manner. From genetic screens in C. elegans aimed at identifying new modifiers of BMP signaling, we reported on SMA-10, a conserved LRIG (leucine-rich and immunoglobulin-like domains) transmembrane protein. It is a positive regulator of BMP signaling that binds to the SMA-6 receptor. Here we show that the loss of sma-10 leads to aberrant endocytic trafficking of SMA-6, resulting in its accumulation in distinct intracellular endosomes including the early endosome, multivesicular bodies (MVB), and the late endosome with a reduction in signaling strength. Our studies show that trafficking defects caused by the loss of sma-10 are not universal, but affect only a limited set of receptors. Likewise, in Drosophila, we find that the fly homolog of sma-10, lambik (lbk), reduces signaling strength of the BMP pathway, consistent with its function in C. elegans and suggesting evolutionary conservation of function. Loss of sma-10 results in reduced ubiquitination of the type I receptor SMA-6, suggesting a possible mechanism for its regulation of BMP signaling."

Methods Of the 1,746 municipalities in 2010, 1,443 (82.6%) and 1,469 (84.1%) were included in the analyses for breast and cervical cancer screening, respectively. In order to estimate the effects of the number of mammography units and of gynecologists on the participation rates in breast and cervical cancer screening in clinical settings, multiple regression analyses were performed using the interaction term for urban municipalities. Results The average participation rate in screening in clinical settings was 6.01% for breast cancer, and was 8.93% for cervical cancer. The marginal effect of the number of mammography units per 1,000 women was significantly positive in urban municipalities (8.20 percent point). The marginal effect of the number of gynecologists per 1,000 women was significantly positive in all municipalities (2.54 percent point) and rural municipalities (3.68 percent point). Conclusions Lack of mammography units in urban areas and of gynecologists particularly in rural areas impaired access to breast and cervical cancer screening. Strategies are required that quickly improve access for the residents and increase their participation rates in cancer screening."
https://openalex.org/W2735450155,"Rationale 
Evidence from observational studies and to a lesser extent clinical trials suggest that a healthy diet may improve symptoms and lung function in patients with asthma. We conducted a pilot study to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger scale dietary trial and to provide preliminary evidence on the impact of a healthy diet on asthma outcomes.


Methods 
In a randomized, two period cross-over trial, participants with asthma received a 4-week dietary intervention followed by a usual diet (or vice versa), separated by a 4-week washout. The dietary intervention was a healthy diet rich in unsaturated fat. During the dietary intervention, participants ate three meals per week on site at the Johns Hopkins ProHealth Research Center. All remaining meals and snacks were provided for participants to consume off-site. During the control diet, participants were instructed to continue their usual dietary intake. Relevant biomarkers and asthma clinical outcomes were assessed at 0, 2, and 4 weeks after starting each arm of the study.


Results 
Eleven participants were randomized, and seven completed the full study protocol. Among these seven participants, average age was 42 years, six were female, and six were African American. Participant self-report of dietary intake revealed significant increases in fruit, vegetable, and omega-3 fatty acid intake with the dietary intervention compared to usual diet. Serum carotenoids (eg. lutein and beta-cryptoxanthin) increased in the intervention versus control. Total cholesterol decreased in the intervention versus control diet. There was no consistent effect on asthma outcomes.


Conclusions 
The findings suggest that a feeding trial in participants with asthma is feasible. Larger trials are needed to definitively assess the potential benefits of dietary interventions on pulmonary symptoms and function in patients with asthma."

Method 40 consecutive patients classified according to the median level of MPO in the culprit artery. A CMR study was performed during the week following AMI and at 6 months, with late gadolinium enhancement sequences. Results Persistent MO was observed in the same proportion (50 vs. 65%, p = 0.728) between the low vs. high MPO group levels. However, the extent of the microvascular obstruction was significantly greater in the high-MPO group (6 (0–9) vs.16.5 (0–31), p = 0.027), together with a greater infarct size, and a trend towards a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p = 0.054) at one week. CMR data at 6 months showed that reverse systolic remodeling was two fold more present in the low-MPO group (p = 0.058). Interestingly, the extent of MO (8.5 (6.5–31) vs. 4.1 (3–11.55), p = 0.042) and IS remained significantly greater (24.5 (9.75–35) vs. 7.5 (2.5–18.75), p = 0.022) in the high-MPO group. Moreover, MPO in the culprit artery appeared to correlate positively with MPO in non-culprit arteries and serum, and with troponin levels and peak CK. Conclusion This patient-based study revealed in patients after AMI that high MPO levels in the culprit artery were associated with more severe microvascular obstruction and greater IS. These findings may provide new insights pathophysiology explanation for the adverse prognostic impact of MO."

Health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) routinely capture data on mortality, interventions and other household related indicators, offering a unique platform for estimating and monitoring the incidence-mortality relationship in space and time.Mortality data from the HDSS located in Western Kenya collected from 2007 to 2012 and linked to health facility incidence data were analysed using Bayesian spatio-temporal survival models to investigate the relation between mortality (all-cause/malaria-specific) and malaria incidence across all age groups. The analysis adjusted for insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership, socio-economic status (SES), distance to health facilities and altitude. The estimates obtained were used to quantify excess mortality due to malaria exposure.Our models identified a strong positive relationship between slide positivity rate (SPR) and all-cause mortality in young children 1-4 years (HR = 4.29; 95% CI: 2.78-13.29) and all ages combined (HR = 1.55; 1.04-2.80). SPR had a strong positive association with malaria-specific mortality in young children (HR = 9.48; 5.11-37.94), however, in older children (5-14 years), it was associated with a reduction in malaria specific mortality (HR = 0.02; 0.003-0.33).SPR as a measure of transmission captures well the association between malaria transmission intensity and all-cause/malaria mortality. This offers a quick and efficient way to monitor malaria burden. Excess mortality estimates indicate that small changes in malaria incidence substantially reduce overall and malaria specific mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2735585734,"Globally, lung cancer results in more deaths worldwide than any other cancer, indicating a need for better treatments. Members of the eicosanoid metabolism pathway represent promising therapeutic targets, as several enzymes involved in the generation of these lipids are dysregulated in many cancers and their inhibition reduces lung cancer growth in mouse models. However, genetic variation of enzymes involved in eicosanoid metabolism has not been adequately examined for association with lung cancer. The goal of this study was to determine whether germline genetic variation altering eicosanoid producing enzyme function and/or expression are associated with differences in lung cancer survival. We examined the association of genetic variation with mortality within eicosanoid metabolism genes in 395 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases from the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). A total of 108 SNPs, both common and rare, in 19 genes, were examined for association. No common or rare variants were associated with lung cancer survival across the entire study population. However, rare variants in ALOX15B (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, type B) and the common variant rs12529 in AKR1C3 (prostaglandin F synthase) were associated with NSCLC mortality in women and African Americans, respectively. Rare variants in ALOX15B were associated with greater mortality in women (HR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.25–3.54, p-value = 0.005). The major allele of rs12529 in AKCR1C3 associated with improved survival in African Americans (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.59–0.92, p-value = 0.008). The lack of genetic associations among all NSCLC cases and the association among women only for rare variants in ALOX15B may, in part, explain the better NSCLC survival observed among women. These results raise the possibility that some subgroups within the NSCLC population may benefit from drugs targeting eicosanoid metabolism."

The aim of this study was to investigate if MIA also inhibits the osteogenic potential of BMP-2 in human articular chondrocytes during redifferentiation, which may lead to a higher grade of differentiation without calcification. HAC of four female patients (mean age: 73.75 ±6.98) were seeded into 3D culture for 28 days; after adding the recombinant proteins, four groups were formed (Control, BMP-2, MIA, BMP-2+MIA). Samples were analysed for gene expression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and histology on day 0, 14 and 28. Collagen type 2 (COL2A1) was significantly increased in the BMP-2 containing groups on day 28; BMP-2 (100-fold, p = 0.001), BMP-2+MIA (65-fold, p = 0.009) and similar to the level of native cartilage. Higher aggrecan (Agg) levels were present in the BMP-2 (3-fold, p = 0.007) and BMP-2+MIA (4-fold, p = 0.002) group after 14 days and in the BMP-2 (9-fold, p = 0.001) group after 28 days. Collagen type 10 (COL10A1) was increased in the BMP-2 containing groups (6-fold, p = 0.006) but these levels were significantly below native cartilage. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type 1 (COL1A1) and the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content did not reveal any relevant differences between groups. BMP-2 is a potent inducer for differentiation of HAC. A significant enhancement of this effect in combination with MIA could not be observed. Furthermore no significant reduction of osteogenic markers during re-differentiation of chondrocytes was present combining BMP-2 and MIA."

The immunotoxin was reconfigured to replace ETA' with either the granzyme B mutant R201K or MAPTau as human effector domains. The novel cytolytic fusion proteins were characterized with a recombinant human lymphocytic cell line developed using Transpo-mAb™ technology. Genes encoding a chimeric TTC-reactive immunoglobulin G were successfully integrated into the genome of the precursor B cell line REH so that the cells could present TTC-reactive BCRs on their surface. These cells were used to investigate the specific cytotoxicity of GrB(R201K)-TTC and TTC-MAPTau, revealing that the serpin proteinase inhibitor 9-resistant granzyme B R201K mutant induced apoptosis specifically in the lymphocytic cell line. Our data confirm that antigen-based fusion proteins containing granzyme B (R201K) are suitable candidates for the depletion of autoreactive B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2735125024,"The Lazarillo of Tormes’ picaresque novel introduces a story where two subjects sequentially extract (one, two or three) tokens from a common pool in an asymmetric information framework (the first player cannot observe her partners’ actions). By introducing a reward for both subjects in case that in every period at least one subject had taken one single token, we define an interesting coordination game. We conduct an experiment with 120 undergraduate students to study their behavior in this framework. We find that if the second player is allowed to take more tokens than her partner, then the frequency of cooperators does not seem to be affected by the informational asymmetry. Nevertheless, this asymmetry (i) incentives the second player to use her ‘power of extraction’ while the social externality is still available, (ii) yields to more asymmetric profit distributions when subjects win the social externality and (iii) delays the breach period in case of coordination failure.

The biotechnological process by which P(3HB) is synthesized occurs in two phases. The first phase involves cell growth in a complex culture medium, while the second phase involves polymer accumulation in the presence of excess carbon sources. As such, the efficiency of the second phase depends on the first phase. The aim of this study was to evaluate culture media with different concentrations of sucrose and glucose and different pH values in the inoculum phase of Ralstonia solanacearum RS with the intention of identifying methods by which the biomass yield could be increased, subsequently enhancing the yield of P(3HB). The culture medium was formulated according to the experimental planning type of central composite rotational design 22. The independent variables were pH and sugar concentration (sucrose and glucose), and the dependent variables were OD600nm, dry cell weight (DCW), and P(3HB) yield. The highest cell growth, estimated by the OD600nm (20.6) and DCW (5.35) values, was obtained when sucrose was used in the culture medium at a concentration above 35 g.L-1 in combination with an acidic pH. High polymer (45%) accumulation was also achieved under these conditions. Using glucose, the best results for OD600nm (12.5) and DCW (2.74) were also obtained at acidic pH but with a sugar concentration at the minimum values evaluated. Due to the significant accumulation of polymer in the cells that were still in the growth phase, the accumulating microorganism P(3HB) Ralstonia solanacearum RS can be classified as having type II metabolism in relation to the polymer accumulation phase, which is different from other Ralstonia spp. studied until this time."
https://openalex.org/W2736060939,"Mutations in the proximal tubular sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporters NPT2a and NPT2c have been reported in patients with renal stone disease and nephrocalcinosis, however the relative contribution of genotype, dietary calcium and phosphate, and modifiers of mineralization such as pyrophosphate (PPi) to the formation of renal mineral deposits is unclear. In the present study, we used Npt2a-/- mice to model the renal calcifications observed in these disorders. We observed elevated urinary excretion of PPi in Npt2a-/- mice when compared to WT mice. Presence of two hypomorphic Extracellular nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (Enpp1asj/asj) alleles decreased urine PPi and worsened renal calcifications in Npt2a-/- mice. These studies suggest that PPi is a thus far unrecognized factor protecting Npt2a-/- mice from the development of renal mineral deposits. Consistent with this conclusion, we next showed that renal calcifications in these mice can be reduced by intraperitoneal administration of sodium pyrophosphate. If confirmed in humans, urine PPi could therefore be of interest for developing new strategies to prevent the nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis seen in phosphaturic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2734918997,"Recent experimental data showed that the PI3K pathway contributes to resistance to temozolomide (TMZ) in paediatric glioblastoma and that this effect is reversed by combination treatment of TMZ with a PI3K inhibitor. Our aim is to assess whether this combination results in metabolic changes that are detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, potentially providing metabolic biomarkers for PI3K inhibition and TMZ combination treatment. Using two genetically distinct paediatric glioblastoma cell lines, SF188 and KNS42, in vitro 1H-NMR analysis following treatment with the dual pan-Class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 resulted in a decrease in lactate and phosphocholine (PC) levels (P<0.02) relative to control. In contrast, treatment with TMZ caused an increase in glycerolphosphocholine (GPC) levels (P≤0.05). Combination of PI-103 with TMZ showed metabolic effects of both agents including a decrease in the levels of lactate and PC (P<0.02) while an increase in GPC (P<0.05). We also report a decrease in the protein expression levels of HK2, LDHA and CHKA providing likely mechanisms for the depletion of lactate and PC, respectively. Our results show that our in vitro NMR-detected changes in lactate and choline metabolites may have potential as non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring response to combination of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors with TMZ during clinical trials in children with glioblastoma, subject to further in vivo validation."
https://openalex.org/W2735593391,"Previous studies have indicated that the relationship between magnocellular-dorsal (M-D) function and reading-related skills may vary with reading development in readers of alphabetic languages. Since this relationship could be affected by the orthographic depth of writing systems, the present study explored the relationship between M-D function and reading-related skills in Chinese, a writing system with a deeper orthography than alphabetic languages. Thirty-seven primary school students and fifty-one undergraduate students participated. Orthographic and phonological awareness tests were adopted as reading-related skill measurements. A steady-pedestal paradigm was used to assess the low-spatial-frequency contrast thresholds of M-D function. Results showed that M-D function was only correlated with orthographic awareness for adults, revealing an enhancement with reading development; while being related to phonological awareness only for children revealing a developmental decrement. It suggested that the mechanism responsible for the relationship between M-D activity and reading-related skills was affected by the characteristics of literacy development in Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2735730069,"We have reported previously that Short Interspersed Degenerate Retroposons of the SIDER2 subfamily, largely located within 3'UTRs of Leishmania transcripts, promote rapid turnover of mRNAs through endonucleolytic cleavage within the highly conserved second tandem 79-nt hallmark sequence (79-nt SII). Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis and in silico RNA structural studies to delineate the cis-acting requirements within 79-nt SII for cleavage and mRNA degradation. The putative cleavage site(s) and other nucleotides predicted to alter the RNA secondary structure of 79-nt SII were either deleted or mutated and their effect on mRNA turnover was monitored using a gene reporter system. We found that short deletions of 8-nt spanning the two predicted cleavage sites block degradation of SIDER2-containing transcripts, leading to mRNA accumulation. Furthermore, single or double substitutions of the dinucleotides targeted for cleavage as well as mutations altering the predicted RNA secondary structure encompassing both cleavage sites also prevent mRNA degradation, confirming that these dinucleotides are the bona fide cleavage sites. In line with these results, we show that stage-regulated SIDER2 inactivation correlates with the absence of endonucleolytic cleavage. Overall, these data demonstrate that both cleavage sites within the conserved 79-nt SII as well as RNA folding in this region are essential for SIDER2-mediated mRNA decay, and further support that SIDER2-harboring transcripts are targeted for degradation by endonucleolytic cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2735900968,"To investigate the dosimetric characteristics of PRESAGEREU dosimeters.Commercially available PRESAGEREU dosimeters (size of 10 mm × 10 mm × 45 mm) were divided into two groups, with one of the groups placed at room temperature of 22°C (RT group) and another group placed at low temperature of 10°C (LT group). A total of 3 dosimeters (set of dosimeters) were irradiated at a time, with doses of 1 Gy, 2 Gy, 4 Gy, 8 Gy, 12 Gy, 16 Gy, and 20 Gy, at a nominal dose rate of 400 MU/min at temperature of 22°C. The dosimeters were irradiated three additional times by delivering the same doses as those during the initial irradiations (4 irradiation cycles). Optical density (OD) was assessed using optical CT scanning.Considering both linearity and sensitivity of the OD curves, R2 above 0.95 and sensitivity above 0.04 ΔOD/Gy were observed at the 1st irradiation (reading time ≤ 6 h) and 2nd irradiation (reading time = 0.5 h) for the RT group. For the LT group, those values were observed at the 1st irradiation (reading time ≤ 2 h), and the 3rd and 4th irradiations (both reading times = 0.5 h). Considering the reproducibility of signals in response to the same dose, dosimeters in the RT group showed average deviations among dosimeters less than 5% (the 1st and 2nd irradiations at the reading time of 0.5 h), while for dosimeters in the LT group showed average deviations among dosimeters less than 6% (the 3rd and 4th irradiations at the reading time of 0.5 h). For the rest, the OD curves were not linear, sensitivities of the dosimeters were lower than 0.04 ΔOD/Gy, and OD deviations at the same dose were larger than 6%.At room temperature, PRESAGEREU dosimeters could be used for dose measurement only for up to two dose measurement sessions. At low temperatures, usage of PRESAGEREU dosimeters for dose measurement seems to be possible from the 3rd irradiation. When reusing PRESAGEREU dosimeters, the OD curve should be re-defined for every measurement session because the shape of this curve depends on the irradiation history."
https://openalex.org/W2734650630,"In order to reconstruct environments associated with Plio-Pleistocene hominins in southern Africa, researchers frequently rely upon the animals associated with the hominins, in particular, animals in the Family Bovidae. Bovids in southern Africa are typically identified by their teeth. However, identifying the taxon of a bovid tooth is challenging due to various biasing factors. Furthermore, inaccurate identification of fossil bovids can have significant consequences on the reconstructed paleoenvironment. Recent research on the classification of bovid fossil teeth has relied on using elliptical Fourier analysis to summarize the shape of the outline of the occlusal surface of the tooth and the resulting harmonic amplitudes. Currently, an expert in the field must manually place landmarks around the edges of each tooth which is slow and time consuming. This study tests whether it is possible to crowdsource this task, while maintaining the necessary level of quality needed to perform a statistical analysis on each tooth. Amazon Mechanical Turk workers place landmarks on the edge of the tooth which is compared to the performance of an expert in the field. The results suggest that crowdsourcing the digitization process is reliable and replicable. With the technical aspects of digitization managed, researchers can concentrate on analyzing and interpreting the data."
