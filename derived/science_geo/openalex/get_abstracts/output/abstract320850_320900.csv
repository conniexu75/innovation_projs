https://openalex.org/W2068468784,The current concern about an anthropogenic impact on global climate has made it of interest to compare the potential effect of various human activities. A case in point is the comparison between the emission of greenhouse gases from the use of natural gas and that from other fossil fuels. This comparison requires an evaluation of the effect of methane emissions relative to that of carbon dioxide emissions. A rough analysis based on the use of currently accepted values shows that natural gas is preferable to other fossil fuels in consideration of the greenhouse effect as long as its leakage can be limited to 3 to 6 percent.
https://openalex.org/W2034087519,"As molecular recognition continues to gain importance in the biological and physical sciences as well as in the technologies of molecular electronics and optics, so has the need for efficient syntheses of chiral molecules. Chemists are fulfilling this need through use of chiral organometallic molecules. These chiral metal complexes precisely discriminate between enantiotopic atoms, groups, or faces in achiral molecules and catalyze production of a broad array of natural or unnatural substances of excellent enantiomeric purity. Because of their ability to efficiently multiply chirality, even on an industrial level, these catalysts promise to exert a general impact on molecular science and engineering."

https://openalex.org/W2085190551,"Eruption of 1-million-year-old tholeiitic basalt >1800 meters below sea level (>18 megapascals) in a backarc rift behind the Bonin arc produced a scoriaceous breccia similar in some respects to that formed during subaerial eruptions. Explosion of the magma is thought to have produced frothy agglutinate which welded either on the sea floor or in a submarine eruption column. The resulting 135-meter-thick pyroclastic deposit has paleomagnetic inclinations that are random at a scale of <2.5 meters. High magmatic water content, which is about 1.3 percent by weight after vesiculation, contributed to the explosivity."
https://openalex.org/W2114839455,"The structural and electronic effects of lead substitution in the high-temperature superconducting materials Pb(x)Bi(2-x)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8) have been characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). Large-area STM images of the Bi(Pb)-O layers show that lead substitution distorts and disorders the one-dimensional superlattice found in these materials. Atomic-resolution images indicate that extra oxygen atoms are present in the Bi(Pb)-O layers. STS data show that the electronic structure of the Bi(Pb)-O layers is insensitive to lead substitution within +/-0.5 electron volt of the Fermi level; however, a systematic decrease in the density of states is observed at approximately 1 electron volt above the Fermi level. Because the superconducting transition temperatures are independent of x(Pb) (x </= 0.7), these microscopic STM and STS data suggest that the lead-induced electronic and structural changes in the Bi(Pb)-O layer do not perturb the electronic states critical to forming the superconducting state in this system."

Similar mineral substances were produced from synthetic solutions containing sodium phosphate and calcium chloride (in addition to a buffer) in the presence of carbonic anhydrase and available carbon dioxide. It is concluded that the carbonate ion is essential to precipitation of bone mineral and that the principal biochemical catalyst in vivo is carbonic anhydrase. Bacteria are not essential to the precipitation, but they probably play a secondary role in connection with the formation of oral calculus, urinary calculus, and so forth."

However, the magnitude of the word-frequency effect was greater than that predicted by a mathematical model denying stimulus words any role in producing the word-frequency effect."
https://openalex.org/W1976836533,"One approach revealed the nature of the piercing-sucking-feeding mechanism of the abutilon whitefly, Trialeurodes abutilonea, a new vector of sweetpotato yellow dwarf virus. It showed the complete stylet from its origin in the rostrum to its termination in the plant's translocation stream. Another approach clearly delineated and confirmed the life cycle of the abutilon whitefly in relation to physical function and duration of each of the six stages."
