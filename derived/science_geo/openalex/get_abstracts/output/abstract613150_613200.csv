https://openalex.org/W2809662051,"Route optimization of hazardous materials transportation is one of the basic steps in ensuring the safety of hazardous materials transportation. The optimization scheme may be a security risk if road screening is not completed before the distribution route is optimized. For road screening issues of hazardous materials transportation, a road screening algorithm of hazardous materials transportation is built based on genetic algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt neural network (GA-LM-NN) by analyzing 15 attributes data of each road network section. A multi-objective robust optimization model with adjustable robustness is constructed for the hazardous materials transportation problem of single distribution center to minimize transportation risk and time. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is designed to solve the problem according to the characteristics of the model. The algorithm uses an improved strategy to complete the selection operation, applies partial matching cross shift and single ortho swap methods to complete the crossover and mutation operation, and employs an exclusive method to construct Pareto optimal solutions. Studies show that the sets of hazardous materials transportation road can be found quickly through the proposed road screening algorithm based on GA-LM-NN, whereas the distribution route Pareto solutions with different levels of robustness can be found rapidly through the proposed multi-objective robust optimization model and algorithm."

Inconsistent results have been published in regard differences in survival between white and black glioblastoma patients. The objective of this to study the association between race and in Glioblastoma patients in the USA during 2010–2014. Methods and findings The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database were used to evaluate race/ethnicity (White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islanders non-Hispanic (API)) and Hispanic) adults patients with first-time diagnosis of glioblastoma (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition [ICD-O-3], codes C711-C714, and histology type 9440/3) from 2010–2014. The primary outcome was 3-year overall survival which was defined as months from diagnosis to death due to any cause and cancer, Kaplan-Meier (KM) and log-rank test were used to compare overall survival times across race groups. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the independent effect of race on 3-year survival. Age, gender, health insurance coverage, primary site, tumor size, extent of surgery and year of diagnosis were included in the adjusted model. The 3-year overall survival for API-non Hispanic (NH) patients decreased by 25% compared with White NH glioblastoma patients (hazard ratio (HR) 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62–0.90)) after adjusting for age, gender, health insurance, primary site, tumor size, and extent of the surgery. Black NH (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80–1.13) and Hispanic (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84–1.21) exhibited similar mortality risks compared with White NH patients. Conclusion Compared with White NH, API NH with glioblastoma have a better survival. The findings from this study can help increase the accuracy of the prognostic outlook for white, black and API patients with GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2809118616,"The MYB transcription factor superfamily is one of the largest superfamilies modulating various biological processes in plants. Over the past few decades, many MYB superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in some plant species. However, genes belonging to the MYB superfamily in peach (Prunus persica) have not been comprehensively identified and characterized although the genome sequences of peach were released several years ago. In total, this study yielded a set of 256 MYB superfamily genes that was divided into five subfamilies: the R2R3-MYB (2R-MYB), R1R2R3-MYB (3R-MYB), MYB-related (1R-MYB), 4R-MYB, and Atypical-MYB subfamilies. These subfamilies contained 128, 4, 109, 1, and 14 members, respectively. The 128 R2R3-MYB subfamily genes in peach were further clustered into 35 groups, and the 109 MYB-related subfamily genes were further clustered into 6 groups: the CCA1-like, CPC-like, TBP-like, I-box-binding-like, R-R-type, and Peach-specific groups. The motif compositions and exon/intron structures within each group within the R2R3-MYB or MYB-related subfamily in peach were highly conserved. The logo sequences of the R2 and R3 repeats of R2R3-MYB subfamily members were highly conserved with those in these repeats of several other plant species. Except for 48 novel peach-specific MYB genes, the remaining 208 out of 256 MYB genes in peach were conserved with the corresponding 198 MYB genes in A. thaliana. Additionally, the 256 MYB genes unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. Eighty-one orthologous pairs of peach/A. thaliana MYB genes were identified among 256 MYB genes in peach and 198 MYB genes in A. thaliana in this study. In addition, 146 pairs of paralogous MYB genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of peach. The expression levels of some of the 51 MYB genes selected for qRT-PCR analysis decreased or increased with red-fleshed fruit development, while the expression patterns of some genes followed no clear rules over the five developmental stages of fruits. This study laid the foundation for further functional analysis of MYB superfamily genes in peach and enriched the knowledge of MYB superfamily genes in plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2809476308,"In omics experiments, variable selection involves a large number of metabolites/ genes and a small number of samples (the n < p problem). The ultimate goal is often the identification of one, or a few features that are different among conditions- a biomarker. Complicating biomarker identification, the p variables often contain a correlation structure due to the biology of the experiment making identifying causal compounds from correlated compounds difficult. Additionally, there may be elements in the experimental design (blocks, batches) that introduce structure in the data. While this problem has been discussed in the literature and various strategies proposed, the over fitting problems concomitant with such approaches are rarely acknowledged. Instead of viewing a single omics experiment as a definitive test for a biomarker, an unrealistic analytical goal, we propose to view such studies as screening studies where the goal of the study is to reduce the number of features present in the second round of testing, and to limit the Type II error. Using this perspective, the performance of LASSO, ridge regression and Elastic Net was compared with the performance of an ANOVA via a simulation study and two real data comparisons. Interestingly, a dramatic increase in the number of features had no effect on Type I error for the ANOVA approach. ANOVA, even without multiple test correction, has a low false positive rates in the scenarios tested. The Elastic Net has an inflated Type I error (from 10 to 50%) for small numbers of features which increases with sample size. The Type II error rate for the ANOVA is comparable or lower than that for the Elastic Net leading us to conclude that an ANOVA is an effective analytical tool for the initial screening of features in omics experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2809563075,"While an association between hypoalbuminemia and increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) is well-established, the risk of AKI development and its severity among patients with elevated serum albumin is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of AKI in hospitalized patients stratified by various admission serum albumin levels.This single-center retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary referral hospital. All adult hospitalized patients who had admission albumin levels available between January 2009 and December 2013 were enrolled. Admission albumin was categorized based on its distribution into six groups (≤2.4, 2.5-2.9, 3.0-3.4, 3.5-3.9, 4.0-4.4, and ≥4.5 mg/dL). The primary outcome was the incidence of hospital-acquired AKI (HAKI). Logistic regression analysis was performed to obtain the odds ratio of AKI for various admission albumin strata using the albumin 3.5 to 3.9 mg/dL (lowest incidence of AKI) as the reference group.Of the total 9,552 studied patients, HAKI occurred in 1,556 (16.3%) patients. The incidence of HAKI among patients with admission albumin ≤2.4, 2.5-2.9, 3.0-3.4, 3.5-3.9, 4.0-4.4, and ≥4.5 mg/dL was 18.3%, 14.3%, 15.5%, 14.2%, 16.7%, and 26.0%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, admission serum albumin levels ≤2.4 and ≥4.5 mg/dL were associated with an increased risk of HAKI with odds ratios of 1.52 (95% CI 1.18-1.94) and 2.16 (95% CI 1.74-2.69), respectively. While stage 1 HAKI was significantly more frequent among patients with admission albumin ≥4.5 mg/dL (23.0% vs. 11.6%, P<0.001), incidence of stage 3 HAKI was higher in those with albumin ≤2.4 mg/dL (2.8% vs 0.3%, P<0.001).Admission serum albumin levels ≤2.4 and ≥4.5 mg/dL were associated with an increased risk for HAKI. Patients with admission albumin ≥4.5 mg/dL had HAKI with a lower intensity when compared with those who had admission albumin levels ≤2.4 mg/dL."
https://openalex.org/W2809207479,"The aim of the study is to analyze the mediating effect of self-esteem on the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological well-being in South American immigrants in Chile. An analytical, cross sectional, non-experimental design was used. We evaluated 853 Peruvians and Colombians living in the northern cities of Arica, Antofagasta, and Santiago de Chile, the capital located in the center of the country. The instruments used were the Ryff Psychological Well-being Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Perceived Discrimination Scale by Basabe, Paez, Aierdi and Jiménez-Aristizabal. We used the estimation method (RWLS) and polychoric correlation matrices, to estimate the effect size and overall fit of the direct effect models of discrimination and self-esteem on psychological well-being, and indirect and total effects of discrimination mediated by self-esteem. While both populations reported similar levels of perceived discrimination, it was found that the means in psychological well-being and self-esteem of the Colombian population were significantly higher than that of the Peruvian population. Regarding self-esteem, the results provided evidence for the possible mediating effect on the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological well-being. This research aims to contribute to the development of interventions seeking to strengthen self-esteem in order to circumvent possible negative consequences of perceived discrimination, as a consequent, improving immigrants´ personal resources to successfully cope with the diverse demands of their new context."
https://openalex.org/W2809369086,"Background The diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is still a challenge in some patients after total joint replacement. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) strongly participates in the arrangement of the host-bacteria response. Therefore, increased levels of IL-6 should accompany every PJI. Purpose The aim of the study was to show diagnostic characteristics of serum IL-6 for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). We also compared the diagnostic values of serum IL-6 with synovial IL-6 (sIL-6) and synovial C-reactive protein (sCRP). Study design We performed a prospective study of 240 patients in whom serum IL-6 was determined before total hip (n = 124) or knee (n = 116) reoperations. The PJI diagnosis was based on the MSIS (Musculoskeletal Infection Society) criteria (2011). Receiver operating characteristic plots were constructed for IL-6, sIL-6, and sCRP. Results PJI was diagnosed in 93 patients, and aseptic revision was diagnosed in 147 patients. The AUC (area under curve) for IL-6 was 0.938 (95% CI; 0.904–0.971). The optimal IL-6 cut-off value for PJI was 12.55 ng/L. Positive and negative likelihood ratios for IL-6 were 8.24 (95% CI; 4.79–14.17) and 0.15 (95% CI; 0.09–0.26), respectively. The optimal sIL-6 and sCRP cut-off values were 20,988 ng/L and 8.80 mg/L, respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratios for sIL-6 were 40.000 (95% CI; 5.7–280.5) and 0.170 (95% CI; 0.07–0.417), respectively. Negative likelihood ratio for sCRP was 0.083 (95% CI; 0.022–0.314). Conclusions The present study identified the cut-off values for serum/synovial IL-6 and synovial CRP for diagnostics of PJI at the site of THA and TKA and separately for each site. The diagnostic odds ratio for serum/synovial IL-6 and synovial CRP is very good. Simultaneous positivity of serum IL-6 either with synovial IL-6 or synovial CRP almost excludes false negative detection of PJI at the site of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2809491669,"Existing concepts can be a major barrier to learning new counterintuitive concepts that contradict pre-existing experience-based beliefs or misleading perceptual cues. When reasoning about counterintuitive concepts, inhibitory control is thought to enable the suppression of incorrect concepts. This study investigated the association between inhibitory control and counterintuitive science and maths reasoning in adolescents (N = 90, 11–15 years). Both response and semantic inhibition were associated with counterintuitive science and maths reasoning, when controlling for age, general cognitive ability, and performance in control science and maths trials. Better response inhibition was associated with longer reaction times in counterintuitive trials, while better semantic inhibition was associated with higher accuracy in counterintuitive trials. This novel finding suggests that different aspects of inhibitory control may offer unique contributions to counterintuitive reasoning during adolescence and provides further support for the hypothesis that inhibitory control plays a role in science and maths reasoning."
https://openalex.org/W2809265353,"Vegetation restoration as an effective sand fixation measure has made great achievements in China. However, soil water conditions deteriorate with the development and maturity of sand-fixing vegetation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between soil water content (SWC) and vegetation coverage (VC) at different portion (top, middle and bottom) on ten sand dunes during the growing season (April to October) in Horqin Sandy Land, northern China. We analyzed the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of SWC under different VC. The results indicate that VC and soil water storage were negatively correlated. The effect of vegetation on soil water storage on the sand dunes was greater in the dry season than the wet season. The VC and coefficient of coefficient of SWC were positively correlated at the 20 to 140 cm soil depth. As VC increased, the effect of drought stress increased at the 20 to 200 cm soil depths. The VC and SWC were negatively correlated at all the three portions of the sand dunes. According to soil water conditions and the concept of wilting humidity at different VC, we found that the suitable VC values were less than 0.46, 0.52, and 0.71 at the top, middle and bottom of the sand dunes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2808924915,"Introduction Whilst the link between physical factors and risk of high altitude (HA)-related illness and acute mountain sickness (AMS) have been extensively explored, the influence of psychological factors has been less well examined. In this study we aimed to investigate the relationship between ‘anxiety and AMS risk during a progressive ascent to very HA. Methods Eighty health adults were assessed at baseline (848m) and over 9 consecutive altitudes during a progressive trek to 5140m. HA-related symptoms (Lake Louise [LLS] and AMS-C Scores) and state anxiety (State-Trait-Anxiety-Score [STAI Y-1]) were examined at each altitude with trait anxiety (STAI Y-2) at baseline. Results The average age was 32.1 ± 8.3 years (67.5% men). STAI Y-1 scores fell from 848m to 3619m, before increasing to above baseline scores (848m) at ≥4072m (p = 0.01). STAI Y-1 scores correlated with LLS (r = 0.31; 0.24–0.3; P<0.0001) and AMS-C Scores (r = 0.29; 0.22–0.35; P<0.0001). There was significant main effect for sex (higher STAI Y-1 scores in women) and altitude with no sex-x-altitude interaction on STAI Y-1 Scores. Independent predictors of significant state anxiety included female sex, lower age, higher heart rate and increasing LLS and AMS-C scores (p<0.0001). A total of 38/80 subjects (47.5%) developed AMS which was mild in 20 (25%) and severe in 18 (22.5%). Baseline STAI Y-2 scores were an independent predictor of future severe AMS (B = 1.13; 1.009–1.28; p = 0.04; r2 = 0.23) and STAI Y-1 scores at HA independently predicted AMS and its severity. Conclusion Trait anxiety at low altitude was an independent predictor of future severe AMS development at HA. State anxiety at HA was independently associated with AMS and its severity."
https://openalex.org/W2809437170,"Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing worldwide concern, which poses unique challenges for the effective prevention and treatment of several infections, especially the ones triggered by organisms producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL). Here, we present the surveillance results of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from intra-abdominal infections (IAI, n = 1,235) and urinary-tract infections (UTI, n = 2,682), collected in Mexico from 2009 to 2015. Susceptibility and ESBL status were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Both E. coli (57%) and K. pneumoniae (12%) were the most frequently reported organisms, as well as the ones with the highest prevalence of ESBL-producing isolates (54% and 39%, respectively). The overall prevalence of ESBL-producing organisms was higher in nosocomial infections than in community-acquired infections (21% vs. 27%). The ESBL rates were 36% for IAI (953/2,682) and 37% for UTI (461/1,235). In addition, ertapenem, imipenem and amikacin were the antibiotics that mostly preserved bacterial susceptibility. Our results show consistency with global trends, although higher than the rates observed in Latin America."
https://openalex.org/W2809674721,"Background Rabies is a fatal encephalitis caused by lyssaviruses, with most human cases worldwide resulting from rabid dog bites. Although effective animal and human vaccines have been available for over 100 years, control efforts have not been adequately implemented on the global scale and rabies remains one of the greatest global zoonotic threats to human health. We conducted a knowledge, attitudes and practices survey in Northern Cameroon to describe dog ownership characteristics, rates of dog bites, and post-bite healthcare seeking behaviors. Methods The survey was performed in four rural Cameroonian communities. A structured community-based questionnaire was conducted over a 20-day period in April 2010, and focused on socio-economic factors correlated with gaps in rabies knowledge. Information pertaining to socio-demographics, as well as attitudes and practices with regard to animal bites and bite treatment practices were recorded. Characteristics of dog ownership such as dog confinement, resources provided to dogs, and dog vaccination status were examined. Human to dog ratios were compared on a linear scale to poverty scores by community. When applicable, 2-tailed Chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests were calculated to determine relationships between variables. We also used One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to identify associations between rabies knowledge and wealth with dog ownership, dog vaccination, and human healthcare seeking behaviors. Independent variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 208 households were enrolled. Respondents were predominantly male (68.3%), with a median age of 43.6 years. Eighty-four households (39.9%) reported owning a total of 141 dogs (human dog ratio 10.4:1). The majority of dogs (61%) were allowed to roam freely. A history of rabies vaccination was reported for 30.8% of owned dogs. Respondents reported 11 bites during the two years preceding the survey (annual bite incidence was 2.6% [95% CI 1.4%– 4.6%]). Only one person (9.1%) received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and none described symptoms of clinical illness consistent with rabies. Respondents who indicated that they would seek medical care and PEP after a dog bite had higher average wealth and rabies knowledge index scores (p = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively). Respondents who indicated that they would seek care from a traditional healer had significantly lower wealth scores, but not significantly different knowledge scores (p < 0.01 and p = 0.49, respectively). Conclusions In the communities evaluated, the majority of dogs were allowed to roam freely and had no history of rabies vaccination; factors that favor enzootic transmission of canine rabies virus. We also identified a strong relationship between poverty and dog ownership. Bite events were relatively common among respondents, and very few victims reported utilizing health services to treat wounds. Increased wealth and knowledge were significantly associated with increased likelihood that a respondent would seek medical care and post-exposure prophylaxis. These findings indicate the need for educational outreach to raise awareness of dog rabies and proper prevention measures."
https://openalex.org/W2808787698,"Optimizing wheat height to maximize yield has been an important aspect which is evident from a successful example of green revolution. Dwarfing genes (Rht) are known for yield gains due to lodging resistance and partitioning of assimilates into ear. The available and commercially exploited sources of dwarfism in Indian spring wheat are Rht1 and Rht2 genes inspite of availability of over 20 dwarfing genes. Rht8 a Gibberellic acid sensitive dwarfing gene is another reduced height gene commercially exploited in some Mediterranean countries. Two F2 populations segregating for Rht1 and Rht8 genes with each comprising 398 and 379 plants were developed by crossing European winter wheat cultivars Beauchamp and Capitole with Indian spring wheat cultivar PBW 621. Different genotypic combinations for Rht1 and Rht8 genes were selected from these populations through linked molecular markers and selected F3:4 lines were evaluated for various agronomic traits in a replicated trial. Reduction in plant height with Rht8 and Rht1 averaged 2.86% and 13.3% respectively as compared to the group of lines lacking dwarfing gene. Reduction was spread along all the internodes of wheat culm and reduction was lower as progress towards the lower internode. Grain number per spike and highest yield was observed in lines carrying only Rht1 gene. Reduction in plant biomass was observed with either of the dwarfing gene. Longest coleoptile length and seedling shoot length averaged 4.4 ± 0.09 cm and 19.5 ± 0.48, respectively was observed in lines lacking any of the dwarfing gene. Negligible reduction of 6.75% and 2.84% in coleoptile length and seedling shoot length, respectively was observed in lines carrying only Rht8 gene whereas F3:4 lines with Rht1 gene showed 21.64% and 23.35% reduction in coleoptile length and seedling shoot length, respectively. Additive effect of genes was observed as double dwarfs showed 43.31% and 43.34% reduction in coleoptile length and seedling shoot length."
https://openalex.org/W2809190890,"Few studies have reported predictive factors of outcome after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine factors influencing mortality and predictors of hemodynamic improvement after PEA.A total of 383 consecutive patients who underwent PEA between January 2005 and December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 150 were fully reevaluated 7.5±1 months after PEA by NYHA class, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), percentage of predicted carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO) and right heart catheterisation.Mortality rates at 1 month, 1 year and 3 years were 2.8%, 6.9% and 7.5%, respectively. Preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) independently predicted 1-month, 1- and 3-year mortality and age predicted mortality at 1 year and 3 years. Significant improvement in NYHA class and 6MWD were observed and PVR decreased from 773±353 to 307±221 dyn.sec.cm-5 (p<0.001). In 96 patients (64%), PVR decreased by at least 50% and/or was reduced to lower than 250 dyn.sec.cm-5. Preoperative cardiac output (CO) and TLCO predicted hemodynamic improvement.PEA is associated with an excellent long-term survival and a marked improvement in clinical status and hemodynamics. Some preoperative factors including PVR, CO and TLCO can predict postoperative outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2808969559,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4 are active in sebaceous glands and play a central role in the development of acne. Still, there is only limited knowledge on their effect on sebocytes. In this work we performed global gene expression profile analysis with functional clustering of the differentially regulated genes of TLR1/2 (PAM3CSK4)- and TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide [LPS])-activated SZ95 sebocytes. Both TLR1/2- and 4-activation promoted inflammation in a similar manner already at an early time-point (6 hours), regulating genes involved in inflammation, wound healing and chemotaxis reflecting a more complex cytokine and chemokine regulation than previously known. Importantly, lipid metabolism, the primary feature of sebocytes, was affected at the level of gene expression only at a later time point (24 hours) indicating that sebocytes prioritize to exert a pro-inflammatory phenotype when confronted with a danger signal. Supporting the biological relevance of our results, a meta-analysis revealed that the genes showing the strongest up-regulation were also found up-regulated in acne. Of these genes, serum amyloid A 1/2 (SAA1/2) was confirmed to be a suitable protein marker for in vivo activated sebocytes, underlining their immune-competence, which is structurally defined within sebaceous glands of acne and rosacea skin samples. Altogether our findings demonstrate that sebocytes are not only positioned at the end point of inflammation but are actively involved in shaping the inflammatory response with putative diagnostic and therapeutic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2809588986,"Using data from 50 long-term permanent plots from across Venezuelan forests in northern South America, we explored large-scale patterns of stem turnover, aboveground biomass (AGB) and woody productivity (AGWP), and the relationships between them and with potential climatic drivers. We used principal component analysis coupled with generalized least squares models to analyze the relationship between climate, forest structure and stem dynamics. Two major axes associated with orthogonal temperature and moisture gradients effectively described more than 90% of the environmental variability in the dataset. Average turnover was 1.91 ± 0.10% year-1 with mortality and recruitment being almost identical, and close to average rates for other mature tropical forests. Turnover rates were significantly different among regions (p < 0.001), with the lowland forests in Western alluvial plains being the most dynamic, and Guiana Shield forests showing the lowest turnover rates. We found a weak positive relationship between AGB and AGWP, with Guiana Shield forests having the highest values for both variables (204.8 ± 14.3 Mg C ha-1 and 3.27 ± 0.27 Mg C ha-1 year-1 respectively), but AGB was much more strongly and negatively related to stem turnover. Our data suggest that moisture is a key driver of turnover, with longer dry seasons favoring greater rates of tree turnover and thus lower biomass, having important implications in the context of climate change, given the increases in drought frequency in many tropical forests. Regional variation in AGWP among Venezuelan forests strongly reflects the effects of climate, with greatest woody productivity where both precipitation and temperatures are high. Overall, forests in wet, low elevation sites and with slow turnover stored the greatest amounts of biomass. Although faster stand dynamics are closely associated with lower carbon storage, stem-level turnover rates and woody productivity did not show any correlation, indicating that stem dynamics and carbon dynamics are largely decoupled from one another."
https://openalex.org/W2809335998,"Purpose One quarter of people with epilepsy have an intellectual disability (ID) and one fifth of people with an ID have epilepsy. Both conditions are associated with higher levels of morbidity, stigma and premature mortality. There have been calls for action to promote more research in this group. We examined if this group are represented adequately in current research. Methods The proportion of research output in epilepsy conferences and publications relevant to ID and the proportion in ID conferences and publications on epilepsy for 2015–2016 were identified. As the percentage of children in the population with epilepsy is 17%, research output of this group was compared with the ID group. Recognised material was classified based on whether it applied to general epilepsy/ID research, children with epilepsy or people with epilepsy and ID. Data was analysed to determine the proportion of presented research specifically identifying people with epilepsy and ID. Results Fewer than 2% of presentations at epilepsy conferences specifically related to the ID and epilepsy group compared to 15% relating to children with epilepsy. Similarly only 1.4% of the research presented at major ID conferences related to those with people with epilepsy and ID. About 5% of published research in the field of epilepsy related to those with ID as compared with 24% for children with epilepsy. Twelve percent of published research in ID specifically identified epilepsy. Conclusion Publications and conference presentations, on the population with epilepsy and comorbid ID is under-represented. Increased research in this area might assist in improving the quality of care for this relatively neglected group."
https://openalex.org/W2808855157,"The breast cancer network constructed from 70 experimentally verified genes is found to follow hierarchical scale free nature with heterogeneous modular organization and diverge leading hubs. The topological parameters (degree distributions, clustering co-efficient, connectivity and centralities) of this network obey fractal rules indicating absence of centrality lethality rule, and efficient communication among the components. From the network theoretical approach, we identified few key regulators out of large number of leading hubs, which are deeply rooted from top to down of the network, serve as backbone of the network, and possible target genes. However, p53, which is one of these key regulators, is found to be in low rank and keep itself at low profile but directly cross-talks with important genes BRCA2 and BRCA3. The popularity of these hubs gets changed in unpredictable way at various levels of organization thus showing disassortive nature. The local community paradigm approach in this network shows strong correlation of nodes in majority of modules/sub-modules (fast communication among nodes) and weak correlation of nodes only in few modules/sub-modules (slow communication among nodes) at various levels of network organization."
https://openalex.org/W2808875542,"The general misconception that γ-lactones are not thermodynamically polymerizable has limited the development of all γ-lactone-based copolymers. A few studies have reported copolymerization of these five-membered cyclic esters with more reactive monomers, yet a systematic investigation of kinetics and thermodynamics is still lacking. To explore the feasibility of the reaction, we combined equilibrium and non-isothermal syntheses for the copolymerization of γ-valerolactone with ϵ-caprolactone, initiated with methoxy polyethyleneglycol and catalyzed by Tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate. Here, we present the polymerization kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for different monomer ratios in the reaction feed. We observed the dependency of enthalpy and entropy of polymerization upon monomer ratio changes, and estimated a linear increase in the activation energy by increasing the γ-valerolactone fraction in the starting monomer mixture. Our data demonstrate that γ-valerolactone can copolymerize with ϵ-caprolactone, but only under specific conditions. The reaction parameters determined in this study will enable preparation of additional γ-valerolactone-based copolymers and development of a family of degradable materials with improved properties in respect to commonly used polyesters."

Thus, the present study aimed to determine the relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and somatization, and between intelligence and somatization in child sexual abuse victims and to elucidate whether type of abuse had an effect on the relationship between PTSD symptoms and somatization. Methods This study evaluated the somatizations (Child Behavioral Checklist/6–18 [CBCL]), PTSD symptoms (Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children [TSCC]), and intelligence levels of 63 sexually abused children. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to predict somatization based on PTSD symptoms, intelligence, age, and type of sexual abuse, and to find moderating effect of type of abuse on the effect of PTSD symptom on somatization. Results PTSD symptoms (β = 0.471, p = 0.001) and intelligence (β = 0.327, p = 0.021) were associated with somatization. Type of abuse was not, by itself, correlated with somatization (β = 0.158, p = 0.281), but it did have a moderating effect on the effect of PTSD symptoms on somatization (Type of abuse*PTSD symptoms, β = -0.299, p = 0.047). PTSD symptoms were associated with somatization only among those who experienced the molestation type of abuse. Conclusions Somatization in sexually abused children was influenced by the severity of PTSD symptoms and intelligence, and the effect of the PTSD symptoms on somatization was moderated by type of abuse. Specifically, the rape type of abuse may attenuate the effect of post-traumatic symptoms on somatization."

Mean score of total knowledge increased from 10.21±3.1 in pretest to 18.90 ± 2.6 in posttest, total attitude from 6.19±1.8 to 10.26±2.3 and self-efficacy from 20.75±6.1 to 34.43 ± 10.1 with (p < 0.001) for all changes. Age, education level and previous home injuries were the significant predicting factors for total knowledge, attitude and self- efficacy of the mothers.Health education improves knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy of the mothers which were obvious regarding home injuries than first aid measures. There is a need for including knowledge about home injuries in the educational curriculum of high schools and universities and to perform training courses to mothers about first aid measures."
https://openalex.org/W2801699003,"Background A new type of influenza virus, known as type D, has recently been identified in cattle and pigs. Influenza D virus infection in cattle is typically asymptomatic; however, its infection in swine can result in clinical disease. Swine can also be infected with all other types of influenza viruses, namely A, B, and C. Consequently, swine can serve as a “mixing vessel” for highly pathogenic influenza viruses, including those with zoonotic potential. Currently, the only antiviral drug available targets influenza M2 protein ion channel is not completely effective. Thus, it is necessary to develop an M2 ion channel blocker capable of suppressing the induction of resistance to the genetic shift. To provide a basis for developing novel ion channel-blocking compounds, we investigated the properties of influenza D virus M2 protein (DM2) as a drug target. Results To test the ion channel activity of DM2, the DNA corresponding to DM2 with cMyc-tag conjugated to its carboxyl end was cloned into the shuttle vector pNCB1. The mRNA of the DM2–cMyc gene was synthesized and injected into Xenopus oocytes. The translation products of DM2–cMyc mRNA were confirmed by immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry analyses. The DM2–cMyc mRNA-injected oocytes were subjected to the two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) method, and the induced inward current was observed. The midpoint (Vmid) values in Boltzmann modeling for oocytes injected with DM2–cMyc RNA or a buffer were −152 and −200 mV, respectively. Assuming the same expression level in the Xenopus oocytes, DM2 without tag and influenza C virus M2 protein (CM2) were subjected to the TEVC method. DM2 exhibited ion channel activity under the condition that CM2 ion channel activity was reproduced. The gating voltages represented by Vmid for CM2 and DM2 were –141 and –146 mV, respectively. The reversal potentials observed in ND96 for CM2 and DM2 were −21 and −22 mV, respectively. Compared with intact DM2, DM2 variants with mutation in the YxxxK motif, namely Y72A and K76A DM2, showed lower Vmid values while showing no change in reversal potential. Conclusion The M2 protein from newly isolated influenza D virus showed ion channel activity similar to that of CM2. The gating voltage was shown to be affected by the YxxxK motif and by the hydrophobicity and bulkiness of the carboxyl end of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2809086773,"Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory bone infection that is caused most commonly by the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Research into staphylococcal induced bone infection is typically conducted using traditional 2D in vitro culture settings, which is not fully representative of the dynamic in vivo environment. In this study we utilised a collagen glycosaminoglycan scaffold, previously developed for bone tissue engineering, as a representative 3D model of infection. The scaffold resisted degradation and retained its pore structure, which is important for cellular function and survival, when seeded with both cells and bacteria. Using this model, we showed that in the presence of S. aureus, osteoblast proliferation was reduced over 21 days. Interestingly however these cells were more metabolically active compared to the uninfected cells and demonstrated increased mineralisation. Protein A (SpA) is a virulence factor found on the surface of S. aureus and has been shown to interact with osteoblasts. When SpA was removed from the surface of S. aureus, the osteoblasts show comparable activity with the uninfected cells-demonstrating the importance of SpA in the interaction between bone cells and S. aureus. Our results suggest that infected osteoblasts are capable of over-compensating for bone loss and bone destruction by increasing mineralisation in a 3D environment, key elements required for ensuring bone strength. It also reinforces our previously established result that S. aureus SpA is a critical mediator in osteomyelitis and might be a potential novel drug target to treat osteomyelitis by preventing the interaction between S. aureus and osteoblasts."

In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of binge eating (BE) symptoms on suicidality and related clinical characteristics in major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 817 community participants with MDD were included. We compared two groups (with and without lifetime BE symptoms). The MDD with BE group was subdivided into a frequent BE (FBE) subgroup (BE symptoms greater than twice weekly) and any BE (ABE) subgroup (BE symptoms greater than twice weekly). The MDD with BE group comprised 142 (17.38%) patients. The FBE and ABE subgroups comprised 75 (9.18%) and 67 (8.20%) patients, respectively. Comorbid alcohol use disorder, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and history of suicide attempt were significantly more frequent in the MDD with BE group than MDD without BE group. Sexual trauma was also reported more frequently in MDD with BE group. No significant differences were observed between the ABE and FBE subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression revealed an association of suicide attempt with BE symptoms and sexual trauma. Structural equation modeling showed that sexual trauma increased BE (β = 0.337, P <0.001) together with alcohol use (β = 0.185, P <0.001) and anxiety (β = 0.299, p<0.001), which in turn increased suicide attempt (β = 0.087, p = 0.011). BE symptoms were associated with suicide attempt in MDD after adjusting for other factors associated with suicidality. BE symptoms also moderated an association between suicide attempt and sexual trauma."
https://openalex.org/W2809485222,"Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain syndrome with a high incidence in females that may involve activation of the immune system. We performed exome sequencing on chemokine genes in a region of chromosome 17 identified in a genome-wide family association study. Methods and findings Exome sequence analysis of 100 FM probands was performed at 17p13.3-q25 followed by functional analysis of SNPs found in the chemokine gene locus. Missense SNPs (413) in 17p13.3-q25 were observed in at least 10 probands. SNPs rs1129844 in CCL11 and rs1719152 in CCL4 were associated with elevated plasma chemokine levels in FM. In a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT), rs1129844 was unequally transmitted from parents to their affected children (p< 0.0074), while the CCL4 SNP was not. The amino acid change (Ala23Thr), resulting from rs1129844 in CCL11, predicted to alter processing of the signal peptide, led to reduced expression of CCL11. The variant protein from CCL4 rs1719152 exhibited protein aggregation and a potent down-regulation of its cognate receptor CCR5, a receptor associated with hypotensive effects. Treatment of skeletal muscle cells with CCL11 produced high levels of CCL4 suggesting CCL11 regulates CCL4 in muscle. The immune association of FM with SNPs in MEFV, a chromosome 16 gene associated with recurrent fevers, had a p< 0.008 TDT for a combined 220 trios. Conclusions SNPs with significant TDTs were found in 36% of the cohort for CCL11 and 12% for MEFV, along with a protein variant in CCL4 (41%) that affects CCR5 down-regulation, supporting an immune involvement for FM."
https://openalex.org/W2808884182,"To appraise the currency, completeness and quality of evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) of acute management of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).We conducted comprehensive searches to March 2016 for published, English-language SRs and RCTs of acute management of moderate to severe TBI. Systematic reviews and RCTs were grouped under 12 broad intervention categories. For each review, we mapped the included and non-included RCTs, noting the reasons why RCTs were omitted. An SR was judged as 'current' when it included the most recently published RCT we found on their topic, and 'complete' when it included every RCT we found that met its inclusion criteria, taking account of when the review was conducted. Quality was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist (trichotomised into low, moderate and high quality).We included 85 SRs and 213 RCTs examining the effectiveness of treatments for acute management of moderate to severe TBI. The most frequently reviewed interventions were hypothermia (n = 17, 14.2%), hypertonic saline and/or mannitol (n = 9, 7.5%) and surgery (n = 8, 6.7%). Of the 80 single-intervention SRs, approximately half (n = 44, 55%) were judged as current and two-thirds (n = 52, 65.0%) as complete. When considering only the most recently published review on each intervention (n = 25), currency increased to 72.0% (n = 18). Less than half of the 85 SRs were judged as high quality (n = 38, 44.7%), and nearly 20% were low quality (n = 16, 18.8%). Only 16 (20.0%) of the single-intervention reviews (and none of the five multi-intervention reviews) were judged as current, complete and high-quality. These included reviews of red blood cell transfusion, hypothermia, management guided by intracranial pressure, pharmacological agents (various) and prehospital intubation. Over three-quarters (n = 167, 78.4%) of the 213 RCTs were included in one or more SR. Of the remainder, 17 (8.0%) RCTs post-dated or were out of scope of existing SRs, and 29 (13.6%) were on interventions that have not been assessed in SRs.A substantial number of SRs in acute management of moderate to severe TBI lack currency, completeness and quality. We have identified both potential evidence gaps and also substantial research waste. Novel review methods, such as Living Systematic Reviews, may ameliorate these shortcomings and enhance utility and reliability of the evidence underpinning clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W2808893930,"Citrus greening disease, or huanglongbing (HLB), is currently one of the most devastating diseases of citrus. The bacteria thought to be responsible for the disease, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus impact the majority of commercial citrus species worldwide. These bacteria are transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, which is now found in most citrus growing regions. With no known cure, ACP-vectored HLB is responsible for significant economic losses to the global citrus industry. A better understanding of the global genetic diversity of D. citri would improve current and future pest management and mitigation programs. To assess the genetic diversity of D. citri in worldwide collections, a total of 1,108 sequences belonging to ACP gathered from 27 countries in the Americas, the Caribbean, Southeast and Southwest Asia were examined for the study. 883 D. citri came from 98 locations in 18 different countries, and were sequenced using a 678bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. Additionally, 225 previously-reported D. citri COI sequences, were also included in our analysis. Analyses revealed 28 haplotypes and a low genetic diversity. This is in accordance with previous reports on the little diversity of D. citri in worldwide populations. Our analyses reveal population structure with 21 haplotypes showing geographic association, increasing the resolution for the source estimation of ACP. This study reveals the distribution of haplotypes observed in different geographic regions and likely geographic sources for D. citri introductions."
https://openalex.org/W2808973343,"Many neurodegenerative retinal diseases are treated with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) delivered by invasive intravitreal injection (IVT). In Diabetic Retinopathy there is a scarcity of effective agents that can be delivered using non-invasive methods, and there are significant challenges in the validation of novel therapeutic targets. ProNGF represents a potential novel target, and IVT administration of a function-blocking anti-proNGF mAb is therapeutic in a mouse model of DR. We therefore compared invasive IVT to less invasive systemic intravenous (IV) and local subconjunctival (SCJ) administration, for therapy of Diabetic Retinopathy. The IV and SCJ routes are safe, afford sustained pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of anti-proNGF mAb, and result in long-term therapeutic efficacy that blocks retinal inflammation, edema, and neuronal death. SCJ may be a more convenient and less-invasive approach for ophthalmic use and may enable reduced frequency of intervention for the treatment of retinal pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2809311896,"Dysregulation of the mitochondrial signaling pathway of apoptosis induction represents a major hurdle in tumor therapy. The objective of the presented work was to investigate the role of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway in the non-small lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 upon induction of apoptosis using the highly bioactive TRAIL derivative Db-scTRAIL. NCI-H460 cells were TRAIL sensitive but an only about 3 fold overexpression of Bcl-2 was sufficient to induce a highly TRAIL resistant phenotype, confirming that the mitochondrial pathway is crucial for TRAIL-induced apoptosis induction. TRAIL resistance was paralleled by a strong inhibition of caspase-8, -9 and -3 activities and blocked their full processing. Notably, especially the final cleavage steps of the initiator caspase-8 and the executioner caspase-3 were effectively blocked by Bcl-2 overexpression. Caspase-9 knockdown failed to protect NCI-H460 cells from TRAIL-induced cell death, suggesting a minor role of this initiator caspase in this apoptotic pathway. Rather, knockdown of the XIAP antagonist Smac resulted in enhanced caspase-3 degradation after stimulation of cells with TRAIL. Of note, downregulation of XIAP had only limited effects on TRAIL sensitivity of wild-type NCI-H460 cells, but resensitized Bcl-2 overexpressing cells for TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In particular, XIAP knockdown in combination with TRAIL allowed the final cleavage step of caspase-3 to generate the catalytically active p17 fragment, whose production was otherwise blocked in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells. Together, our data strongly suggest that XIAP-mediated inhibition of final caspase-3 processing is the last and major hurdle in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in NCI-H460 cells, which can be overcome by Smac in a Bcl-2 level dependent manner. Quantitative investigation of the XIAP/Smac interplay using a mathematical model approach corroborates our experimental data strengthening the suggested roles of XIAP and Smac as critical determinants for TRAIL sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2809487007,"The honey bee has been extensively studied as a model for neuronal circuit and memory function and more recently has emerged as an unconventional model in biogerontology. Yet, the detailed knowledge of neuronal processing in the honey bee brain contrasts with the very sparse information available on glial cells. In other systems glial cells are involved in nutritional homeostasis, detoxification, and aging. These glial functions have been linked to metabolic enzymes, such as glutamine synthetase and glycogen phosphorylase. As a step in identifying functional roles and potential differences among honey bee glial types, we examined the spatial distribution of these enzymes and asked if enzyme abundance is associated with aging and other processes essential for survival. Using immunohistochemistry and confocal laser microscopy we demonstrate that glutamine synthetase and glycogen phosphorylase are abundant in glia but appear to co-localize with different glial sub-types. The overall spatial distribution of both enzymes was not homogenous and differed markedly between different neuropiles and also within each neuropil. Using semi-quantitative Western blotting we found that rapid aging, typically observed in shortest-lived worker bees (foragers), was associated with declining enzyme levels. Further, we found enzyme abundance changes after severe starvation stress, and that glutamine synthetase is associated with food response. Together, our data indicate that aging and nutritional physiology in bees are linked to glial specific metabolic enzymes. Enzyme specific localization patterns suggest a functional differentiation among identified glial types."
https://openalex.org/W2808921683,"Relatively little is known about patterns of health risk behaviors among Middle Eastern youth, including how these behaviors are related to perceived peer norms. In a sample of approximately 2,500 15–24 year old Palestinian youth, perceived engagement of general peers in alcohol consumption, drug use and sexual activity was substantially greater than youths’ own (self-reported) engagement in these activities, suggesting a tendency to overestimate the prevalence of risk-taking behavior among peers. Individual participation in a risk behavior strongly covaries with the perceived levels of both friends’ and peers’ engagement in that behavior (p = 0.00 in each case). In addition, significant clustering of risk behaviors is found: youth who participate in one risk behavior are more likely to participate in others. These findings for a rare representative sample of Middle Eastern youth are strikingly similar to those in the US and Europe. The clustering of behaviors suggests that prevention programs should be structured to deal with a range of connected risk behaviors for which certain youth may be at risk. The findings also suggest that adjusting expectations about peers’ behavior may reduce young Palestinians’ engagement in risk taking."
https://openalex.org/W2809362207,"Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal peroperative chemotherapy (HIPEC), indicated for patients with peritoneal metastases from digestive or gynecological malignancies alike, demonstrates a considerable impact on hemostatic metabolism, both on platelet and on coagulation level. The potential hemostatic interference in CRS and HIPEC is phase dependent. The hypothesis of this prospective cohort study is that the procedure exposed an increased thrombotic risk, resulting in a faster and increased thrombin generation and hyper platelet function.This study explores the combined use of ROTEM (rotational thromboelastometry), PACT (platelet activation test) and CAT (thrombin generation test) assays during CRS and HIPEC with a follow-up of 7 days postoperative in 27 patients with confirmed histological diagnosis of peritoneal disease.Platelet reactivity (relative to before incision values) to CRP (collagen-related peptide) (p value 0.02) and TRAP (thrombin receptor activator peptide) (p value 0.048) seems to be slightly reduced during CRS and HIPEC with regard to αIIbβ3 activation, while P-selectin expression is not affected. During surgery, CAT demonstrates that, the LT (lagtime) (p value 0.0003) and TTP (time-to-thrombin peak) values (p value 0.002) decrease while and the TP (thrombin peak) (p value 0.004) and ETP (endogenous thrombin potential) (p value 0.02) increase. Subsequently, after surgery, the LT and TTP increase and ETP and TP decrease in time. ROTEM EXTEM (extrinsic) MCF (maximum clot firmness) (p value 0.005), INTEM (intrinsic) MCF (p value 0.003) and FIBTEM (fibrinogen) MCF (p value <0.001) decreased during CRS. At day 7 INTEM and FIBTEM MCF values (p values of 0.004 and <0.001) were significantly higher than before surgery. No considerable changes in platelet count and hemoglobin concentration and absence of leukopenia are noticed.This approach detects changes in coagulation much earlier than noticed by standard coagulation tests."

In addition, power outages can lead to death, especially for patients who rely on medical equipment requiring a power supply. Recently, Nankai Trough Earthquakes have been predicted, and much effort has been put into developing countermeasures in Japan. Kochi City on Shikoku Island is expected to suffer in the event of a large tsunami. The present study identifies individuals living in Kochi who need evacuation assistance and depend on electrical medical devices, simulates evacuation behavior and inundation during a tsunami using a geographic information system (GIS), and considers the usefulness of such a GIS. We asked caregivers, including visiting nurses, to introduce us to homecare recipients who rely on a ventilator, an endotracheal suction device, or other medical devices requiring electric power. We received introductions to 52 homecare recipients. Using a GIS, we plotted the area of predicted inundation and the locations of homecare recipients, nursing stations, and welfare evacuation shelters. We predicted evacuation routes, and then analyzed the time difference between the time required for evacuation and tsunami arrival at a welfare evacuation shelter. To measure the effects of the main parameters, we conducted both one-way and multi-way sensitivity analysis. In the event of a tsunami, eight of the homecare recipients living in the forecasted inundation areas in Kochi may face delayed evacuation. Among homecare recipients facing a high possibility of escape delay, 95.2% lived more than 1,800 m from the nearest welfare evacuation shelter. We found that individual evacuation behavior can be simulated by specifying the residence of a homecare recipient and the evacuation route using a GIS."

PDAC remains resistant to the majority of systemic chemotherapies. In this paper, we explore if epigenetic sensitization can improve chemotherapy response in PDAC. Multiple PDAC cell lines were tested with serial concentrations of the epigenetic modulators 5-azacitidine (Aza) and guadecitabine (SGI-110). Guadecitabine was effective at inhibiting the expression of DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and in decreasing cell viability at nanomolar concentrations. We also report that guadecitabine has increased efficacy following a delay period or as we reference, a ‘rest period’. Sensitization with guadecitabine improved response to the chemotherapeutic agent–Irinotecan- as measured by decreased cell viability and accompanied by an increase in caspase activity. Additional studies are needed to understand the mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W2809487024,"Zebrafish primary motor neurons differ from each other with respect to morphology, muscle targets and electrophysiological properties. For example, CaP has 2-3-fold larger densities of both inward and outward currents than do other motor neurons. We tested whether the transcription factor Islet2a, uniquely expressed in CaP, but not other primary motor neurons, plays a role in specifying its stereotypic electrophysiological properties. We used both TALEN-based gene editing and antisense morpholino approaches to disrupt Islet2a function. Our electrophysiology results do not support a specific role for Islet2a in determining CaP’s unique electrical properties. However, we also found that the morphological phenotypes of CaP and a later-born motor neuron differed between islet2a mutants and morphants. Using microarrays, we tested whether the gene expression profiles of whole embryo morphants, mutants and controls also differed. Morphants had 174 and 201 genes that were differentially expressed compared to mutants and controls, respectively. Further, islet2a was identified as a differentially expressed gene. To examine how mutation of islet2a affected islet gene expression specifically in CaPs, we performed RNA in situ hybridization. We detected no obvious differences in expression of islet1, islet2a, or islet2b in CaPs of mutant versus sibling control embryos. However, immunolabeling studies revealed that an Islet protein persisted in CaPs of mutants, albeit at a reduced level compared to controls. While we cannot exclude requirement for some Islet protein, we conclude that differentiation of the CaP’s stereotypic large inward and outward currents does not have a specific requirement for Islet2a."
https://openalex.org/W2809639289,"We examined whether exposure to municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) compromised the stress performance of laboratory-reared fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in a field setting. Adult minnows were caged at two sites upstream and three sites downstream of wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) discharging MWWE into the Bow River, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. At each site one group of fish was sampled after a 26 day exposure to MWWE, while another group was subjected to 1-min air exposure followed by 60-min confinement and then sampled. Fish morphometrics and proximate composition were measured, and whole-body cortisol, glucose and lactate levels assessed as markers of the stress response. The whole-body protein, glycogen and lipid content were higher at the site closest to a WWTP outfall relative to the other downstream and upstream sites. There were no significant differences in whole-body cortisol levels in minnows sampled at sites either upstream or downstream of WWTPs. Acute stressor exposure significantly elevated whole-body cortisol levels in all groups, and this response was not modified by the location of the sampling sites. The whole-body metabolite profile, including glucose and lactate levels, were significantly higher in fish caged immediately downstream from WWTP inputs relative to upstream sites. There was an acute-stressor-mediated increase in whole-body lactate, but not glucose, levels and this response was independent of sampling site. The results reveal that the capacity to evoke an acute stress response was not compromised in fathead minnows caged for 26 days downstream of WWTPs in the Bow River. However, there were changes in the whole-body proximate composition and metabolite levels immediately downstream from the WWTP outfall suggesting greater accumulation of energy stores in these fish. Taken together, our results suggest that environmental factors in addition to contaminants, including higher water temperature and nutrient availability, influence the impact of MWWEs on fish stress performance."
https://openalex.org/W2809675741,"Background Mental disorders in the workplace are a major public health problem. Knowledge of the impact of the psychosocial work environment on mental and behavioral disorders can assist occupational physicians in the identification and description of occupational risk situations, and help to define priority actions. However, no classification for occupational exposure factors is currently available. We aimed to build a thesaurus of “Organizational, Relational, Ethical and other Contributing Factors” (FOREC) linked with the onset of mental and behavioral disorders. Methods The French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES) initiated and supervised a multidisciplinary working group consisting of the representatives of the main French occupational and public health actors. All decisions were accepted on a consensus basis. This collaborative work led to the classification of occupational exposure factors for mental and behavioral disorders in the workplace. To test this thesaurus in clinical practice, a French multicenter study was implemented. Patients were workers referred to the Occupational Disease Centers for mental health issues at work. Factors contributing to mental and behavioral disorders among workers were identified and coded retrospectively from the worker’s point of view using the FOREC thesaurus. Results We recruited 323 workers, aged 44.9±9.2 years, of which 31.3% were men. The most commonly encountered disorders were generalized anxiety disorders (106 workers, 32.8%) and moderate depressive episodes (86 workers, 26.7%). We identified 1357 factors, i.e. an average of 4.2 factors per worker. Among them, 575 (42.4%) were relational and 515 (37.9%) were organizational. All factors identified during consultations were described in the thesaurus. Conclusions We built the first thesaurus of “Organizational, Relational, Ethical and other Contributing Factors” (FOREC) that may help to generate profiles of mental and behavioral disorders at work. Encoding and describing these exposure factors, as well as using a worldwide standardized and shared terminology, will help to identify specific workplace prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2808823843,"The cure rate for late stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has not significantly improved over several decades. New and more effective targets and treatment modalities are urgently needed. RNA-seq analyses of a syngeneic EOC cell pair, representing more and less aggressive tumor cells in vivo were conducted. Bioinformatics analyses of the RNA-seq data and biological signaling and function studies have identified new targets, such as ZIP4 in EOC. Many up-regulated tumor promoting signaling pathways have been identified which are mainly grouped into three cellular activities: 1) cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance; 2) cell skeleton and adhesion changes; and 3) carbohydrate metabolic reprograming. Unexpectedly, lipid metabolism has been the major down-regulated signaling pathway in the more aggressive EOC cells. In addition, we found that hypoxic responsive genes were at the center stage of regulation and detected functional changes were related to cancer stem cell-like activities. Moreover, our genetic, cellular, biochemical, and lipidomic analyses indicated that cells grown in 2D vs. 3D, or attached vs. suspended had dramatic changes. The important clinical implications of peritoneal cavity floating tumor cells are supported by the data proved in this work. Overall, the RNA-seq data provide a landscape of gene expression alterations during tumor progression."

In Mozambique, after roll-out to peripheral facilities, the 12-month retention rate was reported mostly from sites with an electronic patient tracking system (EPTS), representing only 65% of patients. We conducted a nationally representative study, compared 12-month retention at EPTS and non-EPTS sites, and its predictors.Applying a proportionate to population size sampling strategy, we obtained a nationally representative sample of patients who initiated ART between January 2013 and June 2014. We calculated weighted proportions of the patients' status at 12 months after ART initiation, and 12-month incidence of lost to follow-up (LTFU) and death. We assessed determinants of LTFU and death by calculating adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) through multivariate cox-proportional hazard models.Among 19,297 patients sampled, 54.3% were still active, 33.1% LTFU, 2.0% dead, 2.6% transferred-out and 8.0% had unknown status, 12 months after ART initiation. Total attrition rate (LTFU or dead) was 45.5/100PY, higher at facilities without EPTS (51.8/100PY) than with EPTS (37.7/100PY). Clinical stage IV (AHR = 1.7), CD4 count ≤150 (AHR = 1.3) and being pregnant (AHR = 1.6) were significantly associated with LTFU. Clinical stage III or IV (AHR = 2.1 and 3.8), CD4 count ≤150 (AHR = 3.0), not being pregnant (AHR = 3.0), and ART regimens with stavudine (AHR = 4.28) were significantly associated with deaths. Patients enrolled in adherence support groups were 4.6 times less likely to be LTFU, but the number (n = 174) was too small to be significant (p = 0.273).Retention in ART was substantially lower at non-EPTS sites. EPTS should be expanded to all ART sites to facilitate comprehensive routine monitoring of retention in care. Retention in Mozambique is low and needs to be improved, especially among pregnant women and patients with advanced disease at ART initiation. The effect of ART adherence support groups needs to be further monitored."

To increase institutional deliveries, South Asian countries have introduced various forms of Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) schemes that offer women cash if they come to deliver at a health facility. In 2005, Nepal introduced its Safe Delivery Incentive Programme (SDIP)-a cash incentive program nationwide to boost the rate of institutional delivery and care from health professionals at childbirth. This study asks the following research questions: How informed were Nepalese women about the cash incentive program? Does knowledge about the cash incentive program correlate with institutional delivery?Data to answer these questions come from the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). This is a nationally representative data collected from 12,674 women between 15 and 49 years of age, of which 4,036 had given births in the past five years. Multiple logistic regression was employed to predict if knowledge about the cash incentive program increased the odds of institutional delivery controlling for sociodemographic and geographic factors.Approximately 90% of the women knew about the SDIP. About 42% of the women who knew about the SDIP and 13% of the women who did not know about the SDIP had their most recent delivery at a health institution. The odds of institutional delivery increased nearly three-fold (OR = 2.70; CI: 1.59-4.59) among women who knew about the SDIP compared to women who did not know about the SDIP. Other factors that predicted institutional delivery included education, wealth, urban status, first birth, the number of antenatal care visits, and exposure to news media.This study shows that there is a correlation between women's knowledge about the SDIP and increased institutional delivery. Nepal's health and social work professionals should inform all women of reproductive age about the program so that they can make more informed delivery decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2809629564,"Despite the common use of non-fasting measurements for lipid profile in children it remains unclear as to the extent non-fasting conditions have on laboratory results of lipids measurements. We aimed to assess the impact of non-fasting lipid profile on the occurrence of dyslipidemia in children.Basic lipid profile including: total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG), as well as small, dense-LDL-C (sd-LDL-C), apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], were measured in 289 presumably healthy children aged 9-11 in both fasting and non-fasting condition. The clinical impact of non-fasting lipid profile was evaluated individually for each child with estimation of false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) results.The highest percentage of FP results in non-fasting condition was observed for TG (42.3%) being significantly higher when compared to FN results (p = 0.003). In contrast, the highest percentage of FN results in a non-fasting state were shown for LDL-C (14.3%), but the difference was statistically insignificant when compared to FP results. When comparing fasting and non-fasting lipid profile a number of significant differences was shown for: TG (p<0.001), HDL-C (p = 0.002) LDL-C (p<0.001) and ApoAI (p<0.001), respectively. The occurrence of dyslipidemia, recognized on the basis of non-fasting lipids was significantly higher (p = 0.010) when compared to fasting lipid profile.A higher occurrence of dyslipidemia, based on the measurement of non-fasting lipids in children, is suggestive of possible disorders in lipid metabolism. However, accurate identification of dyslipidemia by assessment of non-fasting lipids requires the establishment of appropriate cut-off values for children."
https://openalex.org/W2809115344,"Background Striae gravidarum is a common skin problem of considerable cosmetic concern for many pregnant women. Various risk factors associated with the development of striae have been reported, with conflicting results. Objectives To analyze the risk factors of striae gravidarum in Chinese primiparous women and to provide evidence relevant to the prevention of this condition. Methods Singleton primiparous pregnant women who were hospitalized for delivery were included, and relevant data were collected. Independent risk factors associated with striae gravidarum in women with and those without striae gravidarum were identified using logistic regression. Results Among 213 singleton primiparous pregnant women, 125 had striae gravidarum, yielding a prevalence of up to 58.9%. There was a significant variation (P < 0.05, odds ratio >1) between the striae gravidarum and non-striae gravidarum groups in terms of several factors, including younger maternal age, weight gain during pregnancy, body mass index gain, uterine height, abdominal girth, and positive family history. Factors such as maternal height, birth weight, systemic disease, skin type, and neonatal gender did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. Conclusion This study showed that the independent risk factors for striae gravidarum in primiparous women were younger maternal age, weight gain during pregnancy, body mass index gain, uterine height, abdominal girth, and a positive family history. The severity of striae gravidarum was associated with weight gain during pregnancy, body mass index gain, abdominal girth, and timing of the onset of striae gravidarum."
https://openalex.org/W2809418249,"The Loreto region of the Peruvian Amazon faces many obstacles to health care delivery. The majority of the population is river-bound and lives below the poverty line, with some of the worst health indicators in Peru. To overcome these barriers and fill a gap in health services, an NGO-based provider known as the Vine Trust has been providing care since 2001 via a mobile ship clinic called the Amazon Hope. This study presents an assessment of the Amazon Hope, first reporting health indicators of the program´s catchment area, services provided, and program utilization. It then describes perceptions of the program by community members and health workers, the program's strengths and weaknesses in contributing to health service delivery, and provides recommendations addressing limitations. The qualitative analysis included 20 key informant interviews with community members and health service providers. In the quantitative analysis, 4,949 residents of the catchment area were surveyed about medical histories, experiences with the program, and suggestions for improvement. The survey showed poor indicators for reproductive health. The AH clinic was the main provider of health care among those surveyed. Community members reported satisfaction with the program's quality of care, and health workers felt the program provided a unique and necessary service. However, community members requested prior notification and additional services, while health workers described misunderstandings in community-tailored care, and difficulties with continuity of care and coordination. Data show that the program has been successful in providing quality health care to a population but has room to improve in its health service delivery. Suggested improvements are provided based on participant suggestions and relevant literature. The study sheds light on the important role of mobile clinics in Peru, and the methodology can serve as a model for assessing the role of mobile clinics in other remote settings."
https://openalex.org/W2809310308,"Vancomycin is known to be unintentionally eliminated by continuous renal replacement therapy, and the protein bound fraction of vancomycin is also known to be different in adults and children. However, there are only a few studies investigating the relationship between the dose of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) parameters and serum concentration of vancomycin in pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to determine clinical and demographic parameters that significantly affect serum vancomycin concentrations. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary university children’s hospital. Data from oliguric patients who underwent CVVHDF and vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring were collected. The correlation between factors affecting serum concentration of vancomycin was analyzed using mixed effect model. A total of 177 serum samples undergoing vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring were analyzed. The median age of study participants was 2.23 (interquartile range, 0.3–11.84) years, and 126 (71.19%) were male patients. Serum concentration of vancomycin decreased significantly as the effluent flow rate (EFR; P < 0.001), dialysate flow rate (DFR; P = 0.009), replacement fluid flow rate (RFFR; P = 0.008), the proportion of RFFR in the sum of DFR and RFFR (P = 0.025), and residual urine output increased. The adjusted R2 of the multivariate regression model was 0.874 (P < 0.001) and the equation was as follows: Vancomycin trough level (mg/L) = (0.283 × daily dose of vancomycin [mg/kg/d]) + (365.139 / EFR [mL/h/kg])–(15.842 × residual urine output [mL/h/kg]). This study demonstrated that the serum concentration of vancomycin was associated with EFR, DFR, RFFR, the proportion of RFFR, and residual urine output in oliguric pediatric patients receiving CVVHDF."
https://openalex.org/W2808740654,"The co-occurrence of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the northern Gulf of Mexico cetacean Unusual Mortality Event have raised questions about the stability of inshore bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) populations throughout the region. Several factors could have contributed to the ongoing event, but little attention has been paid to the potential effects of increased search effort and reporting of strandings associated with oil spill response activities, which were widespread for an extended period. This study quantified the influence of increased search effort by estimating the number of bottlenose dolphin strandings reported by oil spill responders and comparing monthly stranding rates with and without response-related records. Results showed that response teams reported an estimated 58% of strandings during the Active Response period within the study area. Comparison of Poisson rates tests showed that when responder-influenced stranding records were removed, the monthly stranding rates from the Active Response period (May 2010 –April 2014) were similar to the Post-Removal Actions Deemed Complete period (May 2013 –March 2015) (e.g., p = 0.83 for remote areas in Louisiana). Further, analyses using the Getis-Ord Gi* spatial statistic showed that when response-related stranding reports were removed from the Active Response period, significant spatial clustering of strandings (p < 0.05) was reduced by 48% in coastal Louisiana. Collectively, these results suggest that increased search effort resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response throughout remote portions of the Unusual Mortality Event geographic region had the capacity to increase reporting and recovery of marine mammal strandings to unusually high levels. To better understand how stranding data relates to actual mortality, more work is needed to quantify dolphin population size, population trends, and carcass detection rates including the role of search effort. This is vital for understanding the status of a protected species within the northern Gulf of Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W2809075661,"A common limiting factor in the throughput of gastrointestinal endoscopy units is the availability of space for patients to recover post-procedure. This study sought to identify predictors of abnormally long recovery time after colonoscopy performed with procedural sedation. In clinical research, this type of study would be performed using only one regression modeling approach. A goal of this study was to apply various ""machine learning"" techniques to see if better prediction could be achieved.Procedural data for 31,442 colonoscopies performed on 29,905 adult patients at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed to identify potential predictors of long recovery times. These data included the identities of hospital personnel, and the initial statistical analysis focused on the impact of these personnel on recovery time via multivariate logistic regression. Secondary analyses included more information on patient vitals both to identify secondary predictors and to predict long recoveries using more complex techniques.In univariate analysis, the endoscopist, procedure room nurse, recovery room nurse, and surgical technician all showed a statistically significant relationship to long recovery times, with p-value below 0.0001 in all cases. In the multivariate logistic regression, the most significant predictor of a long recovery time was the identity of the recovery room nurse, with the endoscopist also showing a statistically significant relationship with a weaker effect. Complex techniques led to a negligible improvement over simple techniques in prediction of long recovery periods.The hospital personnel involved in performing a colonoscopy show a strong association with the likelihood of a patient spending an abnormally long time recovering from the procedure, with the most pronounced effect for the nurse in the recovery room. The application of more advanced approaches to improve prediction in this clinical data set only yielded modest improvements."
https://openalex.org/W2809525648,"Kalmia angustifolia is a boreal ericaceous shrub that can rapidly spread on black spruce forest cutovers in eastern Canada, where CPRS (i.e. Cutting with Protection of Regeneration and Soils"") is practiced. The proliferation of Kalmia often coincides with a reduction in the growth rate of regenerating black spruce seedlings. We report on a study where we compared the local effects of Kalmia and black spruce seedling patches (i.e. two types of ""Vegetation"") on chemical and biochemical soil properties in CPRS cutovers within mesic spruce-moss and xeric spruce-lichen ecosystems, as well as in four mature spruce-moss forests (i.e. three ""Site Types""). Results from 13C-CPMAS-NMR revealed lower O-alkyl C (i.e. carbohydrates), higher aromatic C (i.e. lignin and other phenolics) and higher carbonyl-C (i.e. amide-C and carboxyl groups) in spruce-moss than in spruce-lichen forest floors (F-horizon). In spite of these distinctions, we observed only a small number of Site Type x Vegetation interactions controlling soil properties. Vegetation had a significant effect on ten forest floor properties. Most notably, Kalmia patches had higher concentrations of condensed tannins and lower mineral N cycling. On the other hand, Site Type had a relatively greater effect on the deeper podzolic-B horizons, where mineral N and microbial activity were higher in mature spruce-moss forests than in the cutovers. Green and senescent Kalmia leaves collected at these sites had higher N, tannin and phenolic concentrations than green and senescent spruce needles. A 25 month litter bag study found lower decomposition of Kalmia leaf litter in spruce patches on spruce-lichen cutovers compared to spruce patches on spruce-moss cutovers, or to Kalmia patches on spruce-lichen cutovers. Given that black spruce seedlings obtain most of their nutrients from the forest floor, our results suggest that CPRS may have long-term negative effects on black spruce forest productivity if the spread of Kalmia is left unchecked."
https://openalex.org/W2809627967,"Lymphatic filariasis is a complex parasitic disease having a spectrum of clinical parameters which are critical in deciding the severity of the pathogenesis. Individuals residing in the endemic areas are categorized into different clinical groups such as: EC (endemic controls-free of disease and infection), AS (asymptomatic carriers- free of disease but carries both antigens and microfilaria (Mf) in circulation), CR (cryptic-free of disease and Mf but having circulatory antigen) and CH (chronic-having manifestations of elephantiasis and hydrocele). The immune response to the parasitic infection is well studied, whereas the protective mechanism explaining the fate of antigenemia and filaremia between AS and CR group remains unexplained. Increased anti-Mf antibodies have been implicated for Mf clearance in experimental infection models whereas its role in clinical filariasis is not known. Here, we followed up two groups of 24 and 33 CR cases for 18 and 36 months respectively and analyzed both the clinical parameters and the anti-filarial antibody response. The humoral response to both whole filarial antigen and Mf antigens as well as recombinant active parasitic antigens was significantly higher in CR cases than AS individuals, whereas the clinical parameters remain unchanged. This study made insights into the protective immune mechanism responsible for the clearance of Mf from circulation in CR individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2809582156,"Little is known about the contextual variability in osteoporosis medication utilization. Our aims were 1) to describe variations in utilization and spending on osteoporotic medication between the Primary Care Health Zones (PHZ) of the Valencia region, Spain, 2) to analyze observed variations using Small Area Variation Analysis methods, and 3) to quantify the influence of the specialized care level on variations in utilization. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional ecological study of expenditure and utilization of five therapeutic groups marketed as osteoporosis treatments in Spain in 2009. The unit of analysis was the PHZ (in total 240) nested in the 23 Hospital Healthcare Departments (HHD) of the region of Valencia, covering a population of about 4.9 million inhabitants. Drug utilization was measured by dispensed Defined Daily Dose per 1000 women aged 50 years old and over and day (DID) per PHZ and cost was measured by the annual osteoporosis drug cost per woman aged 50 and older as well as the average price of DDD (Defined Daily Dose) in each PHZ. We calculated Indirect Standardized Drug Utilization Ratios (ISR) and we used Spearman's correlation to analyze associations between the ISRs of the different therapies. The average osteoporosis drug consumption was 119.1 DID, ranging from 77.6 to 171.3 DID (2.2 times higher) between PHZs in the 5th and 95th percentiles. Annual expenditure also showed a two-fold variation among PHZs. Average prices of the DDD by therapeutic group showed very low or no variation, although they differed substantially among therapeutic groups. Regarding the standardized consumption of osteoporotic drugs, HHDs explained a substantial part (39%) of the variance among PHZs. In conclusion, there is considerable variability in the volume and choice of anti-osteoporotic treatments between PHZs. with HHDs explaining an important proportion of the variation in utilization. Interventions aimed at reducing variation to improve appropriate care should take into account both the PHZ and HHD levels of care."
