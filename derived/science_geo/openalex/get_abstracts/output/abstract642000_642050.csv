https://openalex.org/W2982311673,"Autophagy has been demonstrated to be vital for kidney homeostasis and is centrally implicated in the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Lithium is a potent autophagy inducer in a number of cell types. However, it remains uncertain whether its autophagic activity is associated with a beneficial effect on renal tubular cells in AKI. This study aimed to examine the effect of lithium on renal autophagy in cisplatin-induced AKI. Mice or renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in culture were exposed to cisplatin-induced acute injury in the presence or absence of lithium treatment. AKI or tubular cell injury was evaluated, and cell signaling associated with autophagy was examined. Lithium pretreatment prominently ameliorated acute renal tubular damage in mice exposed to cisplatin insult, associated with enhanced autophagy in renal tubules, as assessed by measuring microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)BII/I expression and autophagosome formation. Consistently, in cisplatin-injured renal tubular cells in vitro, lithium enhanced autophagic activities, improved cell viability, and attenuated cell death. Mechanistically, lithium triggered AMPK-α phosphorylation and activation, which in turn positively correlated with the induced expression of autophagy-related molecules, like mammalian target of rapamycin and LC3BII/I. AMPK-α activation is likely required for lithium-induced tubular cell autophagy and protection in cisplatin-induced AKI because blockade of AMPK-α phosphorylation by compound C markedly abrogated lithium-induced autophagosome formation and mitigated the protective effect of lithium on AKI. Our findings suggest that lithium represents a promising therapeutic strategy for protecting renal tubular cells against cisplatin-induced AKI by enhancing autophagy via AMPK-α activation.-Bao, H., Zhang, Q., Liu, X., Song, Y., Li, X., Wang, Z., Li, C., Peng, A., Gong, R. Lithium targeting of AMPK protects against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by enhancing autophagy in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells."

However, the molecular details of these processes in male germ cells remain to be addressed. Here, using isolated murine sperm cells, ultra-low–input native ChIP-Seq (ULI-NChIP-Seq), and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation patterns and histone 3 Lys-9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) modifications during mouse spermatogenesis. We found that DNA methylation and H3K9me3 have distinct sequence preferences and dynamics in promoters and repeat elements during spermatogenesis. H3K9me3 modifications in histones at gene promoters were highly enriched in round spermatids. H3K9me3 modification on long terminal repeats (LTRs) and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) was involved in silencing active transcription from these regions in conjunction with reestablishment of DNA methylation. Furthermore, H3K9me3 remodeling on the X chromosome was involved in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and in partial transcriptional reactivation of sex chromosomes in spermatids. Our findings also revealed the DNA methylation patterns and H3K9me3 modification profiles of paternal and maternal germline imprinting control regions (gICRs) during spermatogenesis. Taken together, our results provide a genome-wide map of H3K9me3 modifications during mouse spermatogenesis that may be helpful for understanding male reproductive disorders.

Biocides or disinfectants are widely used antibacterial agents used to eradicate the effect of A. baumannii on inanimate objects and health care environments. In the current study, the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine has been investigated against carbapenem-resistant (RS-307, RS-7434, RS-6694, and RS-122), and sensitive (ATCC-19606 and RS-10953) strains of A. baumannii. We have determined growth kinetics, antimicrobial susceptibility, ROS production, lipid peroxidation, cell viability using flow cytometry assay (FACS), and membrane integrity by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The effect of chlorhexidine on the bacterial membrane has also been investigated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The present study showed that 32μg/ml chlorhexidine treatment results in the decreased bacterial growth, CFU count and cell viability. The antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine is due to the elevated ROS production and higher lipid peroxidation. These biochemical changes result in the membrane damage and alteration in the membrane proteins, phospholipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids as evident from the FTIR and SEM data. Therefore, chlorhexidine has the potential to be used in the hospital setups to remove the spread of A. baumannii."

In this study, we aimed to describe risk factors for resistance to third generation cephalosporins and prognostic factors, including the impact of third generation cephalosporins resistance, in patients with HM and BSIs caused by E. coli. Three hundred forty-two cases of E. coli BSIs were collected during the study period (from January 2016 to December 2017). The percentage of resistance to third generation cephalosporins was 25.7%. In multivariate analysis, the variables recent endoscopic procedures, culture-positive surveillance rectal swabs for multidrug-resistant bacteria, antibiotic prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones, and prolonged neutropenia were independently associated with bloodstream infections caused by a third generation cephalosporins resistant E. coli. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 7.1%. Cox regression revealed that significant predictors of mortality were acute hepatic failure, septic shock, male sex, refractory/relapsed HM, and third generation cephalosporins resistance by E. coli isolate. In conclusion, resistance to third generation cephalosporins adversely affected the outcomes of bloodstream infections caused by E. coli in our cohort of HM patients. We also found a significant correlation between prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones and resistance to third generation cephalosporins by E. coli isolates."

In the present study, 19 microsatellite markers were employed to evaluate the genetic diversity and the genetic affiliations across 20 Cypriot durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum) landraces, 13 landraces from the broader Mediterranean basin and 22 modern varieties. Cluster analysis depicted a clear separation among modern varieties and landraces, regardless of their origin. Landraces presented the highest genetic variation (average discriminating power of 0.89) and a high number of private alleles (131) was detected; underlying the unique genetic mark-up of this genepool. AMOVA revealed that the highest variability was detected within the landraces originating from Cyprus and landraces from the broader Mediterranean basin. The Cypriot landrace ‘Kyperounda’ was selected for further evaluation of its’ intra-genetic variation and it was determined that genetic diversity was higher in accessions conserved as sublines (He 0.643–0.731) than bulks (He 0.384–0.469). Bayesian analysis revealed substantial admixture within ‘Kyperounda’ accessions, depicted also by Principal Coordinate Analysis. The findings of the current manuscript emphasize that high intra-genetic diversity is retained when landraces are conserved as sublines in ex situ collections, while landraces that are conserved as bulks have a higher risk of bottleneck. Hence, a more exhausting diversity evaluation is needed in order to fully utilize landraces in breeding schemes and to prevent the loss of genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2982564879,"Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a precursor to pneumococcal disease. Several host and environmental factors have been associated with pneumococcal carriage, however few studies have examined the relationship between host factors and pneumococcal carriage density. We sought to identify risk factors for pneumococcal carriage and density using data from cross-sectional pneumococcal carriage surveys conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic before and after the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected infants from aged 5–8 weeks old (n = 999) and children aged 12–23 months (n = 1,010), pneumococci detected by quantitative PCR, and a risk factor questionnaire completed. Logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and pneumococcal carriage and density. In infants aged 5–8 weeks, living in a household with two or more children under the age of five years (aOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.39–2.79) and low family income (aOR 1.64; 95% CI 0.99–2.72) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. For children aged 12–23 months, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms (aOR 2.64; 95% CI 1.97–3.53), two or more children under five in the household (aOR 2.40; 95% CI 1.80–3.20), and rural residence (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35–2.50) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. PCV13 vaccination was negatively associated with carriage of PCV13 serotypes (aOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44–0.83). URTI symptoms (p < 0.001), current breastfeeding (p = 0.005), rural residence (p = 0.012), and delivery by Caesarean section (p = 0.035) were associated with higher mean pneumococcal density in pneumococcal carriers (both age groups combined). This study provides new data on pneumococcal carriage and density in a high disease burden setting in southeast Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2982466980,"African polymorphisms in the gene for Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) confer a survival advantage against lethal trypanosomiasis but also an increased risk for several chronic kidney diseases (CKD) including HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). APOL1 is expressed in renal cells, however, the pathogenic events that lead to renal cell damage and kidney disease are not fully understood. The podocyte function of APOL1-G0 versus APOL1-G2 in the setting of a known disease stressor was assessed using transgenic mouse models. Transgene expression, survival, renal pathology and function, and podocyte density were assessed in an intercross of a mouse model of HIVAN (Tg26) with two mouse models that express either APOL1-G0 or APOL1-G2 in podocytes. Mice that expressed HIV genes developed heavy proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, and had significant losses in podocyte numbers and reductions in podocyte densities. Mice that co-expressed APOL1-G0 and HIV had preserved podocyte numbers and densities, with fewer morphologic manifestations typical of HIVAN pathology. Podocyte losses and pathology in mice co-expressing APOL1-G2 and HIV were not significantly different from mice expressing only HIV. Podocyte hypertrophy, a known compensatory event to stress, was increased in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G0, but absent in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G2. Mortality and renal function tests were not significantly different between groups. APOL1-G0 expressed in podocytes may have a protective function against podocyte loss or injury when exposed to an environmental stressor. This was absent with APOL1-G2 expression, suggesting APOL1-G2 may have lost this protective function."
https://openalex.org/W2982364331,"Fairness concern behavior is extremely common in social life, and many scholars are beginning to pay attention to this behavior. In this study, we investigate a two-echelon construction supply chain that consists of a general contractor and a subcontractor under cap-and-trade policy. We study the carbon emission reduction decisions and profit distribution mechanism in the construction supply chain with fairness concern and cap-and-trade. We use the Nash bargaining model to describe the fairness concerns of the construction supply chain members and use the co-opetition model to portray the profit distribution. We show that the fairness concern can impose an adverse influence on firms' profits and decrease the magnitude of their carbon emission reductions. The subcontractor's fairness concern causes greater losses to the construction supply chain's profit. We further demonstrate the impact of fairness concern on the optimal decisions of the general contractor and the subcontractor through numerical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2982514750,"Discovering technology opportunities from the opinion of users can promote successful technological development by satisfying the needs of users. However, although previous approaches using opinion mining only have classified various needs of users into positive or negative categories, they cannot derive the main reasons for their opinion. To solve this problem, this research proposes an approach to exploring technology opportunity by structuring user needs with a concept of opinion trigger of objects and functions of the technology-based products. To discover technology opportunity, first, an opinion trigger is identified from review data using Naïve Base classifier and natural language processing. Second, the opinion triggers and patent keywords that have a similar meaning in context are clustered to discover the needs of the user and need-related technology. Then, the sentimental values of needs are calculated through graph-based semi-supervised learning. Finally, the needs of the user are classified in resolving the problem of vacant technology to discover technology opportunity. Then, an R&D strategy of each opportunity is suggested based on opinion triggers, patent keywords, and their property. Based on the concept of opinion trigger-based methodology, a case study is conducted on automobile-related reviews, extracting the customer needs and presenting important R&D projects such as an extracted need (cargo transportation) and its R&D strategy (resolving contradiction). The proposed approach can analyze the needs of user at a functional level to discover new technology opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2982543793,"Aluminum (Al3+) toxicity is a typical abiotic stress that severely limits crop production in acidic soils. In this study, an RIL (recombinant inbred line, F12) population derived from the cross of Zhonghuang 24 (ZH 24) and Huaxia 3 (HX 3) (160 lines) was tested using hydroponic cultivation. Relative root elongation (RRE) and apical Al3+ content (AAC) were evaluated for each line, and a significant negative correlation was detected between the two indicators. Based on a high-density genetic linkage map, the phenotypic data were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with these traits. With composite interval mapping (CIM) of the linkage map, five QTLs that explained 39.65% of RRE and AAC variation were detected on chromosomes (Chrs) Gm04, Gm16, Gm17 and Gm19. Two new QTLs, qRRE_04 and qAAC_04, were located on the same region of bin93-bin94 on Chr Gm04, which explained 7.09% and 8.98% phenotypic variation, respectively. Furthermore, the results of the expression analysis of candidate genes in the five genetic regions of the QTLs showed that six genes (Glyma.04g218700, Glyma.04g212800, Glyma.04g213300, Glyma.04g217400, Glyma.04g216100 and Glyma.04g220600) exhibited significant differential expression between the Al3+ treatment and the control of two parents. The results of qRT-PCR analysis indicated that Glyma.04g218700 was upregulated by Al3+ treatment with the hundreds-fold increased expression level and may be a candidate gene with potential roles in the response to aluminum stress. Therefore, our efforts will enable future functional analysis of candidate genes and will contribute to the strategies for improvement of aluminum tolerance in soybean."
https://openalex.org/W2982392564,"Robust, real-time event detection from physiological signals acquired during long-term ambulatory monitoring still represents a major challenge for highly-artifacted signals. In this paper, we propose an original and generic multi-feature probabilistic detector (MFPD) and apply it to real-time QRS complex detection under noisy conditions. The MFPD method calculates a binary Bayesian probability for each derived feature and makes a centralized fusion, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The method is evaluated on two ECG databases: 1) the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database from Physionet containing clean ECG signals, 2) a benchmark noisy database created by adding noise recordings of the MIT-BIH noise stress test database, also from Physionet, to the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Results are compared with a well-known wavelet-based detector, and two recently published detectors: one based on spatiotemporal characteristic of the QRS complex and the second, as the MFDP, based on feature calculations from the University of New South Wales detector (UNSW). For both benchmark Physionet databases, the proposed MFPD method achieves the lowest standard deviation in sensitivity and positive predictivity (+P) despite its online algorithm architecture. While the statistics are comparable for low-to mildly artifactual ECG signals, the MFPD outperforms reference methods for artifacted ECG with low SNR levels reaching 87.48 ± 14.21% in sensitivity and 89.39 ± 14.67% in +P as compared to 88.30 ± 17.66% and 86.06 ± 19.67% respectively from UNSW, the best performing reference method. With demonstrations on the extensively studied QRS detection problem, we consider that the proposed generic structure of the multi-feature probabilistic detector should offer promising perspectives for long-term monitoring applications for highly-artifacted signals."
https://openalex.org/W2982610772,"Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. We investigated the presence of E. granulosus-specific DNA in the serum of CE patients by detecting the cytochrome c oxidase I (cox1) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit I (nad1) mitochondrial genes. Serum and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cyst tissue samples of 80 CE patients were analyzed. The extracted DNA of samples was submitted to PCR amplification of cox1 and nad1 genes, and products were sequenced and genotyped. Nineteen (23.8%; 95% CI 15.8–34.1) serum and 78 (97.5%; 95% CI 91.3–99.3) FFPE cyst tissue samples were successfully amplified with at least one gene. Echinococcus DNA was detected in the sera of 15.0% (95% CI: 8.8–24.4) and 10.0% (95% CI: 5.2–18.5) and in cyst tissue of 91.3% (95% CI: 83.0–95.7) and 83.8% (95% CI: 74.2–90.3) of 80 patients by cox1 and nad1 gene, respectively. Four genotypes of E. granulosus were distinguished in the CE patients, with predominance of genotype G1, followed by G3, G2, and G6. The finding of E. granulosus DNA in 23.8% of serum samples from CE patients confirmed that E. granulosus releases cell-free DNA into the circulatory system, but quantities may be inadequate for the diagnosis of CE. Genotype G1 predominance suggests the sheep-dog cycle as the primary route of human infection."
https://openalex.org/W2982706738,"Hepatitis C infection is a global public health problem. This study was designed to identify the risk factors associated with hepatitis C infection among adult patients in Kedah state, Malaysia. A matched, hospital-based, case-control study was conducted at a tertiary hospital. Cases were adult (aged ≥ 18 years) patients with positive serology test results for hepatitis C virus antibody and detectable hepatitis C virus RNA from January 2015 to December 2018, and controls were age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched patients who were not infected with hepatitis C virus. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data on demographic characteristics and previous exposure to selected risk factors among the study participants. Associations between hepatitis C and demographic and risk factors were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. A total of 255 case-control patient pairs were enrolled. The multivariable analysis indicated that having a history of blood or blood product transfusion before 1992 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.73-13.81), injection drug use (AOR = 6.60, 95% CI: 3.66-12.43), imprisonment (AOR = 4.58, 95% CI: 1.62-16.40), tattooing (AOR = 3.73, 95% CI: 1.37-12.00), having more than one sexual partner (AOR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.16-3.69), piercing (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.04-2.80), and having only secondary education (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.06-3.57) were independently associated with hepatitis C. No associations were found between health care occupation, needle-prick injury, surgical procedures, haemodialysis, acupuncture, cupping, or contact sports and hepatitis C infection. These findings demonstrate that hepatitis C risk is multifactorial. Having a history of blood or blood product transfusion before 1992, injection drug use, imprisonment, tattooing, having more than one sexual partner, piercing, and having only secondary education were associated with increased odds of hepatitis C."

https://openalex.org/W2982391139,"Focal adhesion pathway is one of the key molecular pathways affected by suboptimal culture conditions during embryonic development. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hyaluronic acid (HA) are believed to be involved in the focal adhesion pathway function by regulating the adherence of the molecules to the extracellular matrix. However, regulatory and molecular mechanisms through which the EGF and HA could influence the embryo development is not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of continued or stage specific supplementation of EGF and/or HA on the developmental competence and quality of bovine preimplantation embryos and the subsequent consequences on the expression and DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway. The results revealed that, the supplementation of EGF or HA from zygote to the blastocysts stage reduced the level of reactive oxygen species and increased hatching rate after thawing. On the other hand, HA decreased the apoptotic nuclei and increased blastocyst compared to EGF supplemented group. Gene expression and DNA methylation analysis in the resulting blastocysts indicated that, combined supplementation of EGF and HA increased the expression of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway while supplementation of EGF, HA or a combination of EGF and HA during the entire preimplantation period changed the DNA methylation patterns of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway. On the other hand, blastocysts developed in culture media supplemented with EGF + HA until the 16-cell stage exhibited higher expression level of genes involved in focal adhesion pathway compared to those supplemented after the 16-cell stage. Conversely, the DNA methylation level of candidate genes was increased in the blastocysts obtained from embryos cultured in media supplemented with EGF + HA after 16-cell stage. In conclusion, supplementation of bovine embryos with EGF and/or HA during the entire preimplantation period or in a stage specific manner altered the DNA methylation and expression patterns of candidate genes involved in the focal adhesion pathway which was in turn associated with the observed embryonic developmental competence and quality."
https://openalex.org/W2982462442,"Human newborns spend up to 18 hours sleeping. The organization of their sleep differs immensely from adult sleep, and its quick maturation and fundamental changes correspond to the rapid cortical development at this age. Manual sleep classification is specifically challenging in this population given major body movements and frequent shifts between vigilance states; in addition various staging criteria co-exist. In the present study we utilized a machine learning approach and investigated how EEG complexity and sleep stages evolve during the very first weeks of life. We analyzed 42 full-term infants which were recorded twice (at week two and five after birth) with full polysomnography. For sleep classification EEG signal complexity was estimated using multi-scale permutation entropy and fed into a machine learning classifier. Interestingly the baby's brain signal complexity (and spectral power) revealed developmental changes in sleep in the first 5 weeks of life, and were restricted to NREM (""quiet"") and REM (""active sleep"") states with little to no changes in state wake. Data demonstrate that our classifier performs well over chance (i.e., >33% for 3-class classification) and reaches almost human scoring accuracy (60% at week-2, 73% at week-5). Altogether, these results demonstrate that characteristics of newborn sleep develop rapidly in the first weeks of life and can be efficiently identified by means of machine learning techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2982467833,"High‐mobility group box (HMGB)1 and HMGB2 proteins are the subject of intensive research because of their involvement in DNA replication, repair, transcription, differentiation, proliferation, cell signaling, inflammation, and tumor migration. Using inducible, stably transfected human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) capable of the short hairpin RNA‐mediated knockdown (KD) of HMGB1 and HMGB2 , we provide evidence that deregulation of HMGB1 or HMGB2 expression in hESCs and their differentiated derivatives (neuroectodermal cells) results in distinct modulation of telomere homeostasis. Whereas HMGB1 enhances telomerase activity, HMGB2 acts as a negative regulator of telomerase activity in the cell. Stimulation of telomerase activity in the HMGB2‐deficient cells may be related to activation of the PI3K/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase‐3β/ β‐catenin signaling pathways by HMGB1, augmented TERT/telomerase RNA subunit transcription, and possibly also because of changes in telomeric repeat‐containing RNA (TERRA) and TERRA‐polyA + transcription. The impact of HMGB1/2 KD on telomerase transcriptional regulation observed in neuroectodermal cells is partially masked in hESCs by their pluripotent state. Our findings on differential roles of HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins in regulation of telomerase activity may suggest another possible outcome of HMGB1 targeting in cells, which is currently a promising approach aiming at increasing the anticancer activity of cytotoxic agents.—Kučírek, M., Bagherpoor, A.

https://openalex.org/W2982501266,"Intensive care is care for critically ill patients with potentially reversible conditions. Patient selection for intensive care should be based on potential benefit but since demand exceeds availability, rationing is needed. In Tanzania, the availability of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) is very limited and the practices for selecting patients for intensive care are not known. The aim of this study was to explore doctors' experiences and perceptions of ICU referral and admission processes in a university hospital in Tanzania.We performed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with fifteen doctors involved in the recent care of critically ill patients in university hospital in Tanzania. Inductive conventional content analysis was applied for the analysis of interview notes to derive categories and sub-categories.Two main categories were identified, (i) difficulties with the identification of critically ill patients in the wards and (ii) a lack of structured triaging to the ICU. A lack of critical care knowledge and communication barriers were described as preventing identification of critically ill patients. Triaging to the ICU was affected by a lack of guidelines for admission, diverging ideas about ICU indications and contraindications, the lack of bed capacity in the ICU and non-medical factors such as a fear of repercussions.Critically ill patients may not be identified in general wards in a Tanzanian university hospital and the triaging process for the admission of patients to intensive care is convoluted and not explicit. The findings indicate a potential for improved patient selection that could optimize the use of scarce ICU resources, leading to better patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2982593906,"Targeting activated fibroblasts, including myofibroblast differentiation, has emerged as a key therapeutic strategy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, there is no available therapy capable of selectively eradicating myofibroblasts or limiting their genesis. Through an integrative analysis of the regulator genes that are responsible for the activation of IPF fibroblasts, we noticed the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding protein, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), as a potential target molecule for IPF. Herein, we have employed a 25-mer novel peptide, MARCKS phosphorylation site domain sequence (MPS), to determine if MARCKS inhibition reduces pulmonary fibrosis through the inactivation of PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling in fibroblast cells. We first observed that higher levels of MARCKS phosphorylation and the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were notably overexpressed in all tested IPF lung tissues and fibroblast cells. Treatment with the MPS peptide suppressed levels of MARCKS phosphorylation in primary IPF fibroblasts. A kinetic assay confirmed that this peptide binds to phospholipids, particularly PIP2, with a dissociation constant of 17.64 nM. As expected, a decrease of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate pools and AKT activity occurred in MPS-treated IPF fibroblast cells. MPS peptide was demonstrated to impair cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in multiple IPF fibroblast cells in vitro as well as to reduce pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-treated mice in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that MPS peptide decreases α-SMA expression and synergistically interacts with nintedanib treatment in IPF fibroblasts. Our data suggest MARCKS as a druggable target in pulmonary fibrosis and also provide a promising antifibrotic agent that may lead to effective IPF treatments.-Yang, D.

https://openalex.org/W2982418079,"Cisplatin (CP) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutics in the treatment of human cancers. However, the beneficial effects of CP are limited by the toxic effects, especially nephrotoxicity. Fluorofenidone (AKFPD) is a promising multifunctional antifibrosis pyridinone drug discovered by our group. But there is no evidence of its protective effects against acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of AKFPD on CP-induced AKI in vivo and in vitro. Compared with the model group, treatment with AKFPD effectively ameliorated kidney damages. In order to elucidate the mechanisms, we discovered that AKFPD treatment notably alleviated generation of reactive oxygen species, reduced the phosphorylation levels of MAPKs (ERK1 and 2, JNKs, and p38), suppressed inflammatory response, inhibited apoptosis, and abated the expression of CP transporters (organic cation transporter 2 and copper transport protein 1) compared with the model group. Moreover, because renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced AKI and LPS-induced AKI are the major models representative of renal transplantation-correlated AKI and sepsis-related AKI, which are also the main causes of AKI, we have also proved the effectiveness of AKFPD on these models. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AKFPD is a potent drug for CP-, IRI-, and LPS-caused AKI and elucidate the underlying mechanism.-Jiang, Y., Quan, J., Chen, Y., Liao, X., Dai, Q., Lu, R., Yu, Y., Hu, G., Li, Q., Meng, J., Xie, Y., Peng, Z., Tao, L.

Similar acceleration by YidC was observed for MtlA integration. YidC mutants with amino acid substitutions in the hydrophilic cavity inside the membrane were defective in the acceleration of the Sec-independent integration. Of note, MPIase was up-regulated upon YidC depletion.

https://openalex.org/W2982551798,"Background and aim The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-strand RNA virus that infects millions of people worldwide. Recent advances in therapy have led to viral cure using two- and three- drug combinations of direct acting inhibitors of viral replication. CCR5 is a chemokine receptor that is expressed on hepatocytes and represents a key co-receptor for HIV. We evaluated the effect of CCR5 blockade or knockdown on HCV replication in Huh7.5JFH1 cells. Methods Cells were exposed to varying concentrations of maraviroc (CCR5 inhibitor), cenicriviroc (CCR2/CCR5 inhibitor), sofosbuvir (nucleotide polymerase inhibitor), or raltegravir (HIV integrase inhibitor). Results HCV RNA was detected utilizing two qualitative strand-specific RT-PCR assays. HCV core antigen and NS3 protein was quantified in the supernatant and cell lysate, respectively. siRNA was utilized to knockdown CCR5 gene expression in hepatocytes. Alternatively, anti-CCR5 antibodies were employed to block the receptor. Supernatant levels of HCV RNA (expressed as fold change) were not reduced in the presence of raltegravir but were reduced 8.55-fold and 12.42-fold with cenicriviroc and maraviroc, respectively. Sofosbuvir resulted in a 16.20-fold change in HCV RNA levels. HCV core and NS3 protein production was also reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Two distinct anti-CCR5 antibodies also resulted in a significant reduction in HCV protein expression, as did siRNA knockdown of CCR5 gene expression. Conclusions These data provide evidence that CCR5 modulation could have a significant effect on HCV replication in an in vitro system. Further evaluation of the role of CCR5 inhibition in clinical settings may be warranted."

Successive stages are postulated to be the most highly related. Endorsement is presumed to decrease by stage. The model has been supported in most but not all elements in various studies. The procedural character has not yet been investigated in one integrative model. The aim of this study was to test the progressive model of self-stigma in three respects: I) successive stages have the strongest associations, II) endorsements decrease with each stage, and III) the procedural character can be represented by one serial mediation model.A cross-sectional computer-based survey was conducted in two samples of patients with depression; one online sample (NA = 550; only self-report) and one clinical face-to-face sample (NB = 180; screening by treatment staff). The inclusion criteria were, age of 18-70 years, sufficient cognitive abilities and German language skills. IBM SPSS statistics 24 was used for Cronbach's alphas, descriptive statistics, Spearman correlations, and Mann-Whitney-U tests. The PROCESS procedure for SPSS Version 3.00 was used for mediation analyses.The results support the progressive model of self-stigma in people with depression in most respects: Endorsements for stereotype awareness were higher than for personal agreement and self-concurrence, and no relevant difference was found between personal agreement and self-concurrence. Successive stages had the strongest associations, with the exception of the association between stereotype awareness and self-esteem, which was higher than the association between stereotype awareness and personal agreement and self-concurrence. The association between stereotype awareness and self-esteem was mediated via personal agreement and self-concurrence.The progressive model of self-stigma offers a theoretical foundation for the process research of self-stigma. Longitudinal research may investigate predictive effects and whether different stages of self-stigma require specific consideration in their prediction, consequences, and potential interventions."

P. aeruginosa uses its type III secretion system to secrete various effector proteins directly into mammalian host cells. ExoU is a potent type III secretion system effector that, after secretion, localizes to the inner cytoplasmic membrane of eukaryotic cells, where it exerts its phospholipase A2 activity upon interacting with ubiquitin and/or ubiquitinated proteins. In this study, we used site-directed spin-labeling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to examine the interaction of ExoU with soluble analogs of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). We found that dioctanoyl PI(4,5)P2 binds to and induces conformational changes in a C-terminal four-helix bundle (4HB) domain of ExoU implicated previously in membrane binding. Other soluble phosphoinositides also interacted with the 4HB but less effectively.

https://openalex.org/W2982346066,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections are a leading cause of death by an infectious agent. Survival within host phagocytic cells is one mechanism by which S. aureus evades antibiotic treatment. A novel THIOMAB™ antibody-antibiotic conjugate (TAC) strategy was developed to kill S. aureus intracellularly and mitigate the spread of infection. In this report, we used a longitudinal whole-body bioluminescence imaging method to study the antibacterial dynamics of TAC alone or in combination with vancomycin in a mouse infection model. Injections of stably luminescent S. aureus bacteria into mice resulted in exponential increases in whole body bioluminescence with a reduction in body weight and survival rate. Vancomycin, a standard-of-care antibiotic, suppressed bacterial growth in mice. However, bacterial growth rebounded in these animals once treatment was discontinued. In contrast, single dose of TAC showed rapid reduction of bioluminescence intensity, which persisted for up to 19 days. The combination of TAC and vancomycin achieved a more sustained and significantly greater reduction of bioluminescence compared with vancomycin alone. In summary, the present study showed an imaging method to longitudinally assess antibacterial drug dynamics in mice and demonstrated that TAC monotherapy or in combination with vancomycin had superior and sustained activity compared to vancomycin alone."
https://openalex.org/W2982569543,"Domestic violence and refuge services in Australia In Australia and internationally, domestic violence is a major cause of homelessness for women and children and yet provision for accommodation for this user-group is not well documented or understood. When designing emergency accommodation, the concerns, preferences, and perspectives of individuals who access refuge services must be sought in order to create spaces that are conducive to the needs of this diverse and vulnerable group. An empathic ‘lens’ can provide meaningful insights that can inform the design of refuge services specifically targeted at addressing these needs. This paper describes an authentic interdisciplinary learning experience for nursing, architecture and landscape students at a university in Sydney, Australia, and presents the results of a study designed to measure the impact of this initiative on participants’ empathy towards women and children who access refuge services as a result of homelessness and/or domestic violence. Empathy levels were measured using the Comprehensive State Empathy Scale, a validated measurement tool. An authentic interdisciplinary learning experience The learning experience consisted of collaborative meetings with stakeholders from the refuge sector, fieldwork, individual research, exchanging ideas and problem-solving in teams. Students then developed design guides for refuges that demonstrated their emerging understanding of the specific needs and perspectives of the issues faced by women and children who had experienced violence and found themselves homeless. Pre-post Comprehensive State Empathy Scale results indicated that the empathy levels of nursing and landscape students increased and those of architecture students decreased, however, these results were not statistically significant. Building empathy in teaching and learning The significance of the results from this study include an ability to compare the changes in empathy in students working collaboratively on a project and to ascertain possible reasons for this using a validated measurement tool. As empathy is one of the strongest negative correlates of prejudice, authentic teaching and learning activities, such as the one described in this paper, have the potential to positively impact the lived experience of women and children leaving situations of domestic violence."
https://openalex.org/W2982655487,"Background The communication of prognosis represents an ethical and clinical challenge in medical practice due to the inherent uncertain character of prognostic projections. The literature has stressed that the mode of communicating prognoses has an impact on patients’ hope, which is considered to play a major role in adapting to illness and disability. In light of this, this study aims to explore health professionals’ (HPs) perceptions of the role of hope in rehabilitation and to examine if and how they use strategies to maintain hope when discussing prognostic information with patients. Methods Eleven qualitative semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of HPs were conducted at two rehabilitation clinics in the Canton of Ticino, Switzerland. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results The HPs perceive hope in rehabilitation as a double-edged sword. Three main strategies were identified to maintain hope while avoiding false hope: 1) giving space for self-evaluation; 2) tailoring the communication of prognostic information; and 3) supporting the patient in dealing with the prognosis. These strategies are particularly suitable when HPs consider that patients might not be ready to accept the prognosis, due to their expectations for recovery. Conclusions The strategies identified here support a person-centered approach to the communication of prognosis and are in line with existing protocols for the communication of unfavorable medical information. The findings emphasize the need for strengthening communication and inter-professional collaboration skills of rehabilitation HPs."
https://openalex.org/W2982544614,"Eukaryotic ribosomal biogenesis is a high-energy-demanding and complex process that requires hundreds of trans-acting factors to dynamically build the highly-organized 40S and 60S subunits. Each ribonucleoprotein complex comprises specific rRNAs and ribosomal proteins that are organized into functional domains. The RNA exosome complex plays a crucial role as one of the pre-60S-processing factors, because it is the RNase responsible for processing the 7S pre-rRNA to the mature 5.8S rRNA. The yeast pre-60S assembly factor Nop53 has previously been shown to associate with the nucleoplasmic pre-60S in a region containing the foot structure assembled around the 3' end of the 7S pre-rRNA. Nop53 interacts with 25S rRNA and with several 60S assembly factors, including the RNA exosome, specifically, with its catalytic subunit Rrp6 and with the exosome-associated RNA helicase Mtr4. Nop53 is therefore considered the adaptor responsible for recruiting the exosome complex for 7S processing. Here, using proteomics-based approaches in budding yeast to analyze the effects of Nop53 on the exosome interactome, we found that the exosome binds pre-ribosomal complexes early during the ribosome maturation pathway. We also identified interactions through which Nop53 modulates exosome activity in the context of 60S maturation and provide evidence that in addition to recruiting the exosome, Nop53 may also be important for positioning the exosome during 7S processing. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the exosome is recruited much earlier during ribosome assembly than previously thought, suggesting the existence of additional interactions that remain to be described."
https://openalex.org/W2982686753,"Decapod crustaceans, such as alvinocaridid shrimps, bythograeid crabs and galatheid squat lobsters are important fauna in the hydrothermal vents and have well adapted to hydrothermal vent environments. In this study, eighteen mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of hydrothermal vent decapods were used to explore the evolutionary history and their adaptation to the hydrothermal vent habitats. BI and ML algorithms produced consistent phylogeny for Decapoda. The phylogenetic relationship revealed more evolved positions for all the hydrothermal vent groups, indicating they migrated from non-vent environments, instead of the remnants of ancient hydrothermal vent species, which support the extinction/repopulation hypothesis. The divergence time estimation on the Alvinocarididae, Bythograeidae and Galatheoidea nodes are located at 75.20, 56.44 and 47.41–50.43 Ma, respectively, which refers to the Late Cretaceous origin of alvinocaridid shrimps and the Early Tertiary origin of bythograeid crabs and galatheid squat lobsters. These origin stories are thought to associate with the global deep-water anoxic/dysoxic events. Total eleven positively selected sites were detected in the mitochondrial OXPHOS genes of three lineages of hydrothermal vent decapods, suggesting a link between hydrothermal vent adaption and OXPHOS molecular biology in decapods. This study adds to the understanding of the link between mitogenome evolution and ecological adaptation to hydrothermal vent habitats in decapods."

Functional and quantitative MRI could be more accurate. We aimed to examine the value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with fractional anisotropy (FA) measurements of the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord in patients with ALS. Patients and methods Fourteen patients with ALS and 15 sex- and age-matched controls were examined with DTI at a 3T MRI scanner. Region-of-interest (ROI) based fractional anisotropy measurements were performed at the levels C2-C4, C5-C7 and Th1-Th3. ROIs were placed at different anatomical locations of the axial cross sections of the spinal cord. Results FA was significantly reduced in ALS patients in anterolateral ROIs and the whole cross section at the C2-C4 level and the cross section of the Th1-Th3 level. There was a trend towards a statistically significant FA reduction in the anterolateral ROIs at the C5-C7 level in ALS patients. No significant differences between patients and controls were found in posterior ROIs. Conclusion FA was reduced in ROIs representing the motor tracts in ALS patients. DTI with FA measurements is a promising method in this circumstance. However, for DTI to become a valuable and established method in the diagnostic workup of ALS, larger studies and further standardisation are warranted."

Although those compounds are known for their biological activities, only the anti-inflammatory activity of chromones isolated from the underground parts has been evaluated. There are no studies of the pharmacological properties of the aerial parts of D. vandellianum. The present study was carried out to determine the phytochemical profile and antinociceptive activity of the methanol extract, fractions and isolated compounds of leaves of D. vandellianum. The phytochemical profile was performed by HLPC-DAD-ESIMSn and pure substances obtained were characterized by MS and NMR spectroscopy. The antinociceptive activity was assessed using the formalin assay in mice, and the motor function in the rotarod test. ME and all the fractions obtained from ME produced antinociceptive effects. Among them, the ethyl ether fraction was the most active. Data from HPLC-DAD-ESIMSn showed that the ethyl ether fraction presented 42 compounds. The major compounds isolated from this fraction—gallic acid, methyl gallate and 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-d-glucopyranose–were tested and produced antinociceptive effects. Gallic acid, methyl gallate and 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-d-glucopyranose at antinociceptive doses did not affect the motor performance in mice in the rotarod test. This work is the first report of the occurrence of gallotanins in D. vandellianum. In addition, the pharmacological study showed that D. vandellianum leaves present antinociceptive activity, probably induced by gallic acid, methyl gallate and 1,2,6-tri-O-galloyl-β-d-glucopyranose."

This study explores the ALPH's health care needs and programmatic gaps in health systems for the care of ALPH in India. Forty-nine in-depth interviews were conducted with purposively selected primary and key stakeholders in India. Thematic analysis utilizing grounded theory was performed in QSR NUD*IST 6. Stakeholders explicitly recognized adolescent HIV to be a critical public health issue which requires a separate mandate in India. It was found that none of the health policies in India focus on adolescent age group; ALPH is therefore even more neglected population. No/partial HIV disclosure to ALPH is the first crisis for retention in care continuum and adherence to the treatment becomes sub-optimal. Unmet needs of transitioning from paediatric to adult care in existing settings was the major gap. Age-specific counselling guidelines and counselling skills among HCPs were found lacking where tailored counseling and capacity building of HCPs was an expectation. Need of holistic approach for adolescents led to consensus on establishing 'adolescent transition clinic' with a strict 'no' for 'standalone Adolescent HIV' clinics. School setting having peer-based counselling provision was recommended. Age disaggregated health data is required to inform the policymakers about adolescents’ specific needs for developing interventions. Situational analysis to identify and shape health priorities of adolescents is recommended.

Making decisions that affect the lives of children is an unenviable task assigned to social services in countries around the world. The consequences of incorrectly labelling children as being at risk of abuse or missing signs that children are unsafe are well-documented. Evidence-based decision-making tools are increasingly common in social services provision but few, if any, have used social network data. We analyse a child protection services dataset that includes a network of approximately 5 million social relationships collected by social workers between 1996 and 2016 in New Zealand. We test the potential of information about family networks to improve accuracy of models used to predict the risk of child maltreatment. We simulate integration of the dataset with birth records to construct more complete family network information by including information that would be available earlier if these databases were integrated. Including family network data can improve the performance of models relative to using individual demographic data alone. The best models are those that contain the integrated birth records rather than just the recorded data. Having access to this information at the time a child’s case is first notified to child protection services leads to a particularly marked improvement. Our results quantify the importance of a child’s family network and show that a better understanding of risk can be achieved by linking other commonly available datasets with child protection records to provide the most up-to-date information possible."
https://openalex.org/W2982378178,"Guzmania monostachia is an epiphytic tank bromeliad that displays the inducible CAM photosynthesis under stressful conditions and had the highest stomata density in the leaf apex, while the base portion has the highest density of trichomes, which are specialized structures used to acquire water and nutrients from the tank solution. In order to correlate the genetic factors behind these morpho-physiological characteristics along the leaf blade of G. monostachia, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the functional enriched pathways and unigenes that could play a role in the apical, middle and basal leaf portions. A total of 653 million reads were used for de novo transcriptome assembly, resulting in 48,051 annotated unigenes. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among distinct leaf regions revealed that 806 DEGs were upregulated in the apex compared to the middle portion, while 9685 DEGs were upregulated in the apex and 9784 DEGs were upregulated in the middle portions compared to the base. Our outcomes correlated some DEGs and identified unigenes with their physiological functions, mainly suggesting that the leaf apex was related to the regulation of stomatal movement, production of chlorophyll, cellular response to stress, and H2O2 catabolic process. In contrast, the middle portion showed DEGs associated with the transport of amino acids. Furthermore, DEGs from the leaf base were mainly correlated with responses to nutrients and nitrogen compounds, regulation of potassium ion import, response to water deprivation, and trichome branching, indicating that, at least in part, this leaf portion can replace some of the root functions of terrestrial plants. Therefore, possibly candidate unigenes and enriched pathways presented here could be prospected in future experimental work, opening new possibilities to bioengineer non-inducible CAM plants and/or improve the fertilization use efficiency by increasing leaf nutrient acquisition of crop plants."
https://openalex.org/W2982435346,"Information diffusion has been widely discussed in various disciplines including sociology, economics, physics or computer science. In this paper, we generalize the linear threshold model in signed networks consisting of both positive and negative links. We analyze the dynamics of the spread of information based on balance theory, and find that a signed network can generate path dependence while structural balance can help remove the path dependence when seeded with balanced initialized active nodes. Simulation shows that the diffusion of information based on positive links contradicts that based on negative links. More positive links in signed networks are more likely to activate nodes and remove path dependence, but they can reduce predictability that is based on active states. We also find that a balanced structure can facilitate both the magnitude and speed of information diffusion, remove the path dependence, and cause polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2982537833,"In large scale systems of embodied agents, such as robot swarms, the ability to flock is essential in many tasks. However, the conditions necessary to artificially evolve self-organised flocking behaviours remain unknown. In this paper, we study and demonstrate how evolutionary techniques can be used to synthesise flocking behaviours, in particular, how fitness functions should be designed to evolve high-performing controllers. We start by considering Reynolds’ seminal work on flocking, the boids model, and design three components of a fitness function that are directly based on his three local rules to enforce local separation, cohesion and alignment. Results show that embedding Reynolds’ rules in the fitness function can lead to the successful evolution of flocking behaviours. However, only local, fragmented flocking behaviours tend to evolve when fitness scores are based on the individuals’ conformity to Reynolds’ rules. We therefore modify the components of the fitness function so that they consider the entire group of agents simultaneously, and find that the resulting behaviours lead to global flocking. Furthermore, the results show that alignment need not be explicitly rewarded to successfully evolve flocking. Our study thus represents a significant step towards the use of evolutionary techniques to synthesise collective behaviours for tasks in which embodied agents need to move as a single, cohesive group."
https://openalex.org/W2982540714,"Introduction Previous studies have reported that the rate of FEV1 decline over time is increased in HIV patients but the mechanisms underlying this observation are unclear. Since current HIV treatment with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) results in very good immune-viral control, we hypothesized that HAART should normalize the elevated rate of FEV1 decline previously reported in HIV patients if it was somehow related to the immune alterations caused by HIV, particularly in never smokers or quitters, since smoking is a well established risk factor for accelerated FEV1 decline in the general population. Methods We explored this hypothesis in a prospectively recruited cohort of 188 HIV (smoker and non-smoker) patients treated with HAART in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) and followed-up for 6 years. The cross-sectional characteristics of this cohort have been published elsewhere. Results We found that: (1) HAART resulted in good immune-viral control; (2) the rate of FEV1 decline remained abnormally elevated, even in non-smokers and quitters; and, (3) alcohol abuse during follow-up was related to FEV1 decline in these patients. Discussion Despite adequate immune-viral control by HAART, lung function decline remains increased in most HIV patients, even in non-smokers and quitters. Alcohol abuse is a preventable risk factor to decrease the accelerated FEV1 decline in this population."

Therefore, general protein hallmarks of foldedness must be queried to provide an efficient and plastic quality control process that supports the evaluation of a large number of substrates. Regardless of cellular location, exposed hydrophobic regions appear to be a defining signature of folding intermediates, misfolded proteins, or unassembled oligomers—all forms of protein that are frequently recognized by molecular chaperones and should be retained in the ER (10Ellgaard L.

The ER is also an oxidizing environment that supports the formation of disulfide bonds assisted by a family of ER-resident oxidoreductases (12Bulleid N.J. Ellgaard L.

Glycosidases and transferases orchestrate the glycan composition based on protein structural features, supporting binding and sorting of glycoproteins by quality control carbohydrate-binding factors.

Whereas the use of multiple quality control interrogation mechanisms that are based on the features of the specific protein is thought to maximize coverage and minimize mistakes, the interplay between these various quality control mechanisms is poorly understood. For instance, if there is overlap or redundancy in coverage, how is it determined which quality control process dominates? Or can multiple pathways query the same protein? Serpins have been used extensively as model substrates to study protein quality control, as mutations in several inhibitory serpins are associated with degradation and accumulation of these proteins in the ER (21Liu Y.

This metastability and the need to avoid alternative conformations that might be more stable when folding likely make serpin maturation particularly problematic and may provide an explanation for why serpin misfolding is associated with a large number of pathologies, or serpinopathies (26Davies M.J. Lomas D.A. The molecular aetiology of the serpinopathies.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40 (18289918): 1273-128610.1016/j.biocel.2007.12.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Functional, properly folded, inhibitory serpins form inactive covalent complexes, with their cognate proteases providing a simple activity assay to determine whether a secreted serpin has successfully folded. The human serpin antithrombin III (ATIII) is an inhibitory serpin that is modified by multiple N-linked glycans. The three native ATIII disulfide bonds have been used to map its cellular folding pathway (27Chandrasekhar K. Ke H. Wang N. Goodwin T. Gierasch L.M. Gershenson A. Hebert D.N. Cellular folding pathway of a metastable serpin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113 (27222580): 6484-648910.1073/pnas.1603386113Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). ATIII inhibits thrombin, thus playing an essential role in the blood coagulation cascade. Mutations in ATIII are commonly associated with thrombosis, and some of these mutations also lead to accumulation of ATIII in the ER (25Corral J. de la Morena-Barrio M.E. Vicente V. The genetics of antithrombin.Thromb. Res. 2018; 169 (30005274): 23-2910.1016/j.thromres.2018.07.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Perry D.J. Carrell R.W.

Therefore, ATIII provides an apt model substrate to explore various ER quality control processes. Here, we made use of ATIII variants with disrupted folding by mutating native Cys residues to Ala. We hypothesized that these variants would be targets for the thiol-based quality control pathway. We also predicted that these variants would be compromised in their folding in such a way that they would present nonnative hydrophobic surfaces and potentially glycan signals. Thus, these variants should reveal the interplay and hierarchy of ER quality control systems. We found that quality control of ATIII relied solely on thiol-dependent quality control, and diversion from the thiol-dependent quality control pathway led to improper secretion of misfolded and inactive protein. These results demonstrate that ER quality control pathways do not necessarily act redundantly and the general features of a substrate do not automatically dictate which quality control pathways will be engaged. As shown previously, the three intramolecular disulfide bonds of ATIII (Cys-8/Cys-128, Cys-21/Cys-95, and Cys-247/Cys-430) are required for folding to the functional, metastable conformation (27Chandrasekhar K. Ke H. Wang N. Goodwin T. Gierasch L.M. Gershenson A. Hebert D.N. Cellular folding pathway of a metastable serpin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We began to explore how the ERQC handles misfolded ATIII by determining the fate of ATIII with all of its Cys residues mutated to Ala (Cys-less ATIII). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with WT or Cys-less ATIII were pulsed for 30 min with [35S]Met/Cys and chased for the designated times (Fig. 1A). ATIII from the lysates and media was then immunoisolated using antibodies directed toward the C-terminal Myc tag present on the ATIII constructs. Samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. As expected, secreted ATIII shows two bands due to incomplete glycosylation at Asn-135 (29Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Bock S. Partial glycosylation of antithrombin III asparagine-135 is caused by the serine in the third position of its N-glycosylation consensus sequence and is responsible for production of the β-antithrombin III isoform with enhanced heparin affinity.Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (7599134): 8433-844010.1021/bi00026a026Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the level of secretion of WT and Cys-less ATIII was similar, reaching levels in the media after 3 h of chase of 48.0 and 43.6%, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). Strikingly, the remaining in-cell ATIII fraction for both constructs remained stable, as degradation did not appear to occur even for Cys-less ATIII (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4 and 9–12). Normally, the ERQC machinery interrogates proteins as they traverse the secretory pathway, sensing whether their native structures have been reached (8Määttänen P. Gehring K. Bergeron J.J.

Miller E.A. Secretory protein biogenesis and traffic in the early secretory pathway.Genetics. 2013; 193 (23396477): 383-41010.1534/genetics.112.142810Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To assess the completeness of folding of Cys-less ATIII, the activity of the product secreted into the media was analyzed by gel shifts due to its ability to form a covalent inhibitory complex with its target protease, thrombin. When the protease thrombin cleaves the reactive center loop of the serpin ATIII, an acyl bond is formed between the loop of ATIII and thrombin. The formation of the covalent complex can be visualized by a gel shift on SDS-PAGE. Inactive ATIII does not demonstrate this gel shift, whereas partially active ATIII, although not functional as a thrombin inhibitor, can act as a substrate for thrombin while not forming a covalent bond. This leads to ATIII being cleaved and running at a lower molecular weight (Fig. 1C). Cells were pulsed for 30 min and chased for 3 h, and ATIII from lysate and media samples was immunoisolated. Protease inhibition by serpins requires large conformational changes (23Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Structure of a serpin-protease complex shows inhibition by deformation.Nature. 2000; 407 (11057674): 923-92610.1038/35038119Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 24Dementiev A. Dobó J.

Therefore, prior to performing the activity assay, ATIII was eluted from the beads and antibody using excess Myc-peptide to remove steric constraints. The eluted fraction was equally divided between thrombin-treated and nontreated samples and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Whereas WT ATIII in the media was active as shown by the formation of a thrombin and ATIII complex (Fig. 1C, lane 4), Cys-less ATIII was completely inactive (Fig. 1C, lane 8). Thrombin not only cannot form a complex with misfolded Cys-less ATIII, it also does not have an accessible reactive center loop, as there was no ATIII cleaved band from the media sample observed upon thrombin addition. To further characterize the state of folding of the secreted Cys-less ATIII, we used protease sensitivity. A natively folded protein should be relatively resistant to protease digestion as compared with an unfolded protein as, generally, natively folded proteins adopt more compact conformations that expose fewer sites for cleavage. Cells were pulsed for 30 min and chased for 3 h, and ATIII was immunoprecipitated from media samples. Samples were then divided equally between untreated samples and trypsin-treated for either 0, 15, 30, or 60 min. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Secreted Cys-less ATIII showed significantly higher protease sensitivity compared with WT (Fig. 1, D and E). This result indicates that Cys-less ATIII is secreted like a natively folded protein, despite the fact that it is an inactive and significantly misfolded protein. Both the secretion of Cys-less ATIII and its stability in the cell suggest that it is evaluated as properly folded by the ERQC network even though it has not achieved its native, functional fold. There is a formal possibility that Cys-less ATIII is being improperly secreted and misevaluated by the ER quality control network because it is secreted via an unconventional secretory pathway, thereby escaping ERQC. In traversing the full secretory pathway, glycoproteins trafficked from the ER pass through the Golgi, where their glycans are extensively remodeled to receive complex glycans. However, proteins that pass through recently identified pathways for unconventional secretion, both including and excluding the ER, can bypass portions of the canonical secretory pathway such as the Golgi and thus lack remodeled complex glycans (33Fatal N. Suntio T. Makarow M. Selective protein exit from yeast endoplasmic reticulum in absence of functional COPII coat component sec13p.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13 (12475940): 4130-414010.1091/mbc.02-05-0082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Rabouille C.

The differential susceptibility of secretory proteins to glycosidases PNGase F, which can cleave both complex and high-mannose glycans acquired in the Golgi, and Endo H, which can only cleave high-mannose glycans, can be used to ask whether a given protein has traversed the canonical secretory pathway. Proteins carrying glycans found in the ER or on secreted proteins that have bypassed the Golgi are sensitive to both PNGase F and Endo H, whereas proteins carrying glycans that have passed through the Golgi are sensitive to PNGase F and resistant to Endo H. Glycosidase sensitivity, analyzed by size shifts using SDS-PAGE, can therefore be used as an assay for unconventional secretion. As expected, both WT and Cys-less ATIII in the cell lysate were sensitive to PNGase F and Endo H, indicating that cellular ATIII mainly resides in the ER. In contrast, both WT and Cys-less ATIII from the cell media were sensitive to PNGase F and resistant to Endo H (Fig. 1E, lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12), showing that both had received complex glycans due to passage through the Golgi. Therefore, the Cys-less variant of ATIII utilizes the conventional secretory pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that Cys-less ATIII, an inactive and misfolded protein, evades ER protein quality control and instead is secreted similarly to WT ATIII. These results support the hypothesis that free thiols are essential for ERQC recognition of misfolded ATIII and its consequent retention in the ER. Concomitantly, evasion of thiol-dependent quality control in this case allowed improper secretion rather than attempts by a complementary quality control branch to correct the misfolding or action of the ER-associated degradation pathway to eliminate the misfolded product. According to the recently discovered cellular pathway of disulfide bond formation for ATIII, the C-terminal disulfide, Cys-247/Cys-430, must form first in order for the two N-terminal disulfides, Cys-8/Cys-128 and Cys-21/Cys-95, to form properly (27Chandrasekhar K. Ke H. Wang N. Goodwin T. Gierasch L.M. Gershenson A. Hebert D.N. Cellular folding pathway of a metastable serpin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113 (27222580): 6484-648910.1073/pnas.1603386113Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). If the C-terminal disulfide is mutated, this model predicts that the remaining two disulfides would not form, leading to the generation of free thiols that may support ER retention. In contrast, this model predicts that mutating either pair of Cys residues that comprise the two N-terminal disulfides, C8A/C128A or C21A/C95A, allows the two remaining disulfides to form, reconciling all thiols into disulfides. This previous work, which elucidated the disulfide formation pathway of homogeneously glycosylated ATIII missing the partially recognized N-linked glycan at position Asn-135, led to the predictions that ATIII quality control is mediated, at least in part, by free thiols directing ER retention (27Chandrasekhar K. Ke H. Wang N. Goodwin T. Gierasch L.M. Gershenson A. Hebert D.N. Cellular folding pathway of a metastable serpin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113 (27222580): 6484-648910.1073/pnas.1603386113Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To characterize the disulfide requirements for proper ATIII quality control and secretion, and to test the predictions for ATIII disulfide mutants, the secretion rates of the three disulfide mutants (C8A/C128A, C21A/C95A, and C247A/C430A) and WT ATIII (all constructs possessing all four native glycosylation sites) were analyzed via pulse-chase in cells. Transfected cells were pulsed for 30 min with [35S]Met/Cys and chased for the designated times. Samples were analyzed by nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (Fig. 2A). Secretion of C247A/C430A ATIII was significantly reduced compared with WT, C8A/C128A, and C21A/C95A ATIII (Figs. 1B and 2A (lanes 13–15)). After a 2-h chase, WT secretion levels reached 50% compared with 8% for C247A/C430A ATIII. The secretion of the N-terminal disulfide mutants, ATIII C8A/C128A and C21A/C95A, was similar to WT secretion levels. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE displayed an increase in disulfide-linked adducts for all mutants compared with WT ATIII. Similar levels of aggregated ATIII were found in the Triton-insoluble fractions for all constructs (Fig. 2A, lanes 16–18). Whereas secreted WT ATIII was active, as observed by the formation of the thrombin-ATIII complex (Fig. 2C, lane 4), the disulfide mutants displayed little activity and did not form an inhibitory complex (Fig. 2C, lanes 8, 12, and 16). This demonstrates that all of the ATIII disulfide mutants analyzed are inactive proteins, including C8A/C128A and C21A/C95A ATIII, which were efficiently secreted into the cell media. Thus, like Cys-less ATIII, the ATIII N-terminal disulfide mutants were mistakenly evaluated as natively folded by the ER quality control process. By contrast, the inactive C247A/C430A ATIII construct, which lacked the key early forming disulfide previously shown to be critical for initiation of proper folding, was properly retained. A question that emerges from these data is whether secretion correlates with protection or inaccessibility of thiols. To address this question, a PEG-maleimide (PEG-Mal) modification gel-shift assay was performed on the ATIII mutants. PEG-Mal modifies exposed free thiols, and the bulky PEG group causes an increase in mass that can be visualized by a gel shift. Transfected cells were pulsed for 30 min and then chased for 30 min. Lysate and medium samples were split equally, and one half was treated with PEG-Mal and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. For all ATIII constructs analyzed, secreted ATIII found in the media had insignificant levels of PEG-Mal modification, which in turn indicates near absence of accessible free thiols (Fig. 2D, lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16; see Fig. 2E for quantification). This result suggests that in ATIII constructs that are successfully secreted to the media, any thiols had either formed disulfide bonds or were otherwise inaccessible, most likely through partial folding. The level of accessible thiols modifiable by PEG-MAL for WT, C8A/C128A, and C21A/C95A ATIII constructs in cell lysates was similar, ranging from 55 to 72% (Fig. 2E). In contrast, the level of C247A/C430A ATIII modified by PEG-Mal was 89%, arguing that in this construct, there is little sequestration of the Cys thiols. This result supports the model that the disulfide between Cys-247 and Cys-430 is critical for folding, and its absence leads to poor formation of the two N-term"
https://openalex.org/W2982625052,"Background The aim of this study was to investigate whether some associations between histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) and favorable neonatal outcomes might be linked to those of antenatal steroids (AS) by determining the separate as well as the combined associations of HCA and AS with neonatal outcomes in very low birth weight infants (VLBWIs). Methods This was a population-based study of VLBWIs born at 20–33 weeks’ gestation between January 2013 and December 2015 from the Korean Neonatal Network. A total of 4652 VLBWIs were enrolled for prevalence study. Of these, 2900 singleton VLBWIs were used for outcome analyses to evaluate individual associations of HCA and AS simultaneously with correction for potential perinatal factors and an interaction term of HCA and AS. Results The overall prevalence of HCA was 34.9% (1623 VLBWIs). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that HCA was associated with decreased mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29–0.91; P = 0.022), AS were associated with reduction in mortality (aOR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39–0.90; P = 0.014) and neonatal seizure (aOR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37–0.86; P = 0.008), and a combination of HCA and AS was associated with remarkably lowered severe intraventricular hemorrhage by interacting with each other (aOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25–0.88; P = 0.019). Conclusions We suggest that in VLBWIs HCA and AS may be favorable independent factors for neonatal outcome and may also work in synergy for neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2982349735,"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a serious hematologic malignancy that occurs in children and young adults. Current therapies include intensive chemotherapy and ionizing radiation that preferentially kill malignant cells. Unfortunately, they are frequently accompanied by unintended negative impacts, including the induction of cellular senescence and long-term toxicities in normal host tissues. Whether these senescent cells resulting from therapy increase the susceptibility to relapse or secondary cancers is unknown. Using transgenic and pharmacological approaches to eliminate doxorubicin-induced senescent cells in a Notch-driven T-ALL relapse mouse model, we find that these cells inhibit tumor recurrence, suggesting that senescence in response to treatment suppresses tumorigenesis. This finding, together with extensive evidence from others demonstrating that age-associated health problems develop dramatically earlier among childhood cancer survivors compared to age-matched counterparts, suggests a relationship between therapy-induced senescence and tumorigenesis. Although cancer risk is increased through accelerated premature-aging in the long run, therapy-induced senescence appears to protect survivors from recurrence, at least in the short run."
https://openalex.org/W2982592377,"Classification of facial traits (e.g., lip shape) is an important area of medical research, for example, in determining associations between lip traits and genetic variants which may lead to a cleft lip. In clinical situations, classification of facial traits is usually performed subjectively directly on the individual or recorded later from a three-dimensional image, which is time consuming and prone to operator errors. The present study proposes, for the first time, an automatic approach for the classification and categorisation of lip area traits. Our approach uses novel three-dimensional geometric features based on surface curvatures measured along geodesic paths between anthropometric landmarks. Different combinations of geodesic features are analysed and compared. The effect of automatically identified categories on the face is visualised using a partial least squares method. The method was applied to the classification and categorisation of six lip shape traits (philtrum, Cupid’s bow, lip contours, lip-chin, and lower lip tone) in a large sample of 4747 faces of normal British Western European descents. The proposed method demonstrates correct automatic classification rate of up to 90%."
https://openalex.org/W2982348271,"Attachment theory states that children learn to trust in their parent's availability and support if they repeatedly experience that their parents respond sensitively to their needs during distress. Attachment is thus developed and shaped by day-to-day interactions, while at the same time, each interaction is a momentary expression of the attachment relation. How attachment-related behaviors of mother and child follow upon each other during interactions in middle childhood, and how these sequences differ in function of attachment quality, has hardly been studied up to now. To fill this gap, we analyzed the micro-coded interaction of 55 mother-child dyads (27 girls, 28 boys, mean age: 10.3) after a standardized stress-induction. Results reveal that all mother-child dyads show a loop between positive mother and child behaviors. This pattern is complemented with a loop of negative mother and child behaviors in low-trust and more avoidantly attached children: these children tend to handle negative mother behavior less well as they show more negative behavior and less positive behavior in response to negative maternal behavior. More anxiously attached children also show less positive behavior, but react positively on collaborative interactions. The micro-coded interactions thus reveal important insights that inform practitioners and advance attachment theory."
https://openalex.org/W2982662276,"α0-Thalassemia is an inherited hematological disorder caused by the deletion of α-globin genes. The Southeast Asian deletion (--SEA) is the most common type of α0-thalassemia observed in Southeast Asian countries. Regarding WHO health policy, an effective α0-thalassemia screening strategy is needed to control new severe α-thalassemia cases. In this study, a monoclonal antibody panel was used to develop immunochromatographic (IC) strip tests for detecting the Hb Bart's and ζ-globin chain. Among 195 samples, all α0-thalassemia traits (78 α0-thalassemia (--SEA) and 4 α0-thalassemia (--THAI)) had low MCV or MCH values. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the IC strip tests for ζ-globin and Hb Bart's for screening α0-thalassemia (--SEA) within the low MCV or MCH samples were 100%, 65.2%, 90.7%, 100% and 96.2%, 47.8%, 86.6%, 78.6%, respectively. All 4 α0-thalassemia (--THAI) traits were negative for ζ-globin chains but positive for Hb Bart's using the IC strip tests. These results led to a α0-thalassemia screening being proposed in which blood samples are first evaluated by MCV, MCH and Hb typing. Samples with high MCV and MCH values are excluded for the presence of the α0-thalassemia gene. Samples with low MCV or MCH values are assayed using the developed IC strip tests, where only samples testing positive are further assayed for α0-thalassemia by PCR. Patients with Hb H, EA Bart's or EF Bart's diseases do not need to use this IC strip assay. Thus, in this study, a simple and cost effective α0-thalassemia point of care test was developed."
https://openalex.org/W2982422227,"Dysregulated skeletal muscle metabolism (DSMM) is associated with increased inter- and intramuscular fat deposition in low birth weight (L) individuals. The mechanisms behind DSMM in L individuals are not completely understood but decreased muscle mass and shifts in lipid and carbohydrate utilisation may contribute. Previously, we observed lower fat oxidation in a porcine model of low birth weight. To elucidate the biological activities underpinning this difference microfluidic arrays were used to assess mRNA associated with lipid metabolism in longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) skeletal muscle samples from thirty-six female L and normal birth weight (N) pigs. Plasma samples were collected from a sub-population to measure metabolite concentrations. Following overnight fasting, skeletal muscle and plasma samples were collected and the association with birth weight, diet and age was assessed. Reduced dietary fat was associated with decreased LD intermuscular fat deposition and beta-oxidation associated mRNA, in both birth weight groups. Lipid uptake and intramuscular fat deposition associated mRNA was reduced in only L pigs. Abundance of ST mRNA associated with lipolysis, lipid synthesis and transport increased in both birth weight groups. Lipid uptake associated mRNA reduced in only L pigs. These changes were associated with decreased plasma L glucose and N triacylglycerol. Post-dietary fat reduction, LD mRNA associated with lipid synthesis and inter- and intramuscular fat deposition increased in L, whilst beta-oxidation associated mRNA remains elevated for longer in N. In the ST, mRNA associated with lipolysis and intramuscular fat deposition increased in both birth weight groups, however this increase was more significant in L pigs and associated with reduced beta-oxidation. Analysis of muscle lipid metabolism associated mRNA revealed that profile shifts are a consequence of birth weight. Whilst, many of the adaptions to diet and age appear to be similar in birth weight groups, the magnitude of response and individual changes underpin the previously observed lower fat oxidation in L pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2982392583,"Synthetic chemical lures mimicking pheromones or food attractants are essential tools in eradication programs for invasive species. However, their uses in programs aiming to control or eradicate terrestrial gastropods are largely unexplored. The goal of this study was to find a synthetic attractant that could aid in the eradication or management of the giant African snail (Lissachatina fulica). Field studies in Hawaii showed that a commercial papaya-flavored oil attracted snails. Analysis of the odor profile of the oil identified a total of 22 chemicals, which comprised > 98% of the volatile compounds emitted by the oil. A synthetic blend was reconstructed that mirrored the release rates of the papaya oil odors. In laboratory and field bioassays, the reconstructed blend, applied to cotton wicks as water and canola oil or water and mineral emulsions, attracted more snails than the water and oil emulsion control wicks. Field studies in Hawaii and Florida showed that the reconstructed blend in an oil emulsion was not attractive to non-target species such as butterflies or bees. The snails were attracted from distances > 1 m and entered traps baited with the attractant emulsion. When tested in the South Florida giant African snail eradication program, direct ground application of the reconstructed papaya-flavored oil emulsion increased the number of snails killed by over 87% compared to water emulsion controls. Integrating tactics using the synthetic papaya oil attractant into control measures should increase the effectiveness of eradication and management programs."
https://openalex.org/W2982607662,"Leptin, a critical mediator of feeding, metabolism and diabetes, is expressed on an incidental basis according to satiety. The genetic regulation of leptin should similarly be episodic.Data from three mouse cohorts hosted by the Jackson Laboratory- 402 (174F, 228M) F2 Dilute Brown non-Agouti (DBA/2)×DU6i intercrosses, 142 Non Obese Diabetic (NOD/ShiLtJ×(NOD/ShiLtJ×129S1/SvImJ.H2g7) N2 backcross females, and 204 male Nonobese Nondiabetic (NON)×New Zealand Obese (NZO/HlLtJ) reciprocal backcrosses-were used to test for loci associated with absolute residuals in plasma leptin and arcsin-transformed percent fat ('phenotypic dispersion'; PDpLep and PDAFP). Individual data from 1,780 mice from 43 inbred strains was also used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for dispersion in each trait.Several loci for PDpLep were detected, including possibly syntenic Chr 17 loci, but there was only a single position on Chr 6 for PDAFP. Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to diabetes and energy regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body fat, an accrued progressive character. Genetic effects on incidental phenotypes such as leptin might be effectively characterized with randomization-detection methodologies in addition to classical approaches, helping identify incipient or borderline cases or providing new therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2982598436,"There are few studies investigating the natural course of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the community. We assessed resolution of NAFLD in a general population cohort of urban Sri Lankans adults.Participants were selected by age-stratified random sampling from electoral lists. They were initially screened in 2007 and re-evaluated in 2014. On both occasions structured interview, anthropometric-measurements, liver ultrasonography, and biochemical/serological tests were performed. NAFLD was diagnosed on ultrasound criteria for fatty liver, safe-alcohol consumption (<14-units/week for men, <7-units/week for women) and absence of hepatitis B/C markers. Non-NAFLD was diagnosed on absence of any ultrasound criteria for fatty liver and safe-alcohol consumption. Resolution of NAFLD was defined as absence of ultrasound criteria for fatty liver. Changes in anthropometric indices [Weight, Body-Mass-Index (BMI), waist-circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR)], clinical [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] and biochemical measurements [Triglycerides (TG), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Total Cholesterol (TC), HbA1c%] at baseline and follow-up were compared.Of the 2985 original study participants, 2148 (71.9%) attended follow-up after 7 years. This included 705 who had NAFLD in 2007 and 834 who did not have NAFLD in 2007. Out of 705 who had NAFLD in 2007, 11(1.6%) changed their NAFLD status due to excess alcohol consumption. After controlling for baseline values, NAFLD patients showed significant reduction in BMI, weight, WHR, HDL and TC levels and increase in HbA1c levels compared to non-NAFLD people. Despite this, none of them had complete resolution of NAFLD.We did not find resolution of NAFLD in this general population cohort. The observed improvements in anthropometric, clinical and biochemical measurements were inadequate for resolution of NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2982636043,"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) may be caused by oxidative stress. An important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the methylglyoxal-derived formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE). Methylglyoxal is detoxified by Glyoxalase I (GLO1). A reduction in GLO1 activity results in increased ROS. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GLO1 have been linked to various inflammatory diseases. Here, we analyzed whether common GLO1 variants are associated with alcoholic (ACP) and non-alcoholic CP (NACP).Using melting curve analysis, we genotyped a screening cohort of 223 ACP, 218 NACP patients, and 328 controls for 11 tagging SNPs defined by the SNPinfo LD TAG SNP Selection tool and the functionally relevant variant rs4746. For selected variants the cohorts were extended to up to 1,441 patient samples.In the ACP cohort, comparison of genotypes for rs1937780 between patients and controls displayed an ambiguous result in the screening cohort (p = 0.08). However, in the extended cohort of 1,441 patients no statistically significant association was found for the comparison of genotypes (p = 0.11), nor in logistic regression analysis (p = 0.214, OR 1.072, 95% CI 0.961-1.196). In the NACP screening cohort SNPs rs937662, rs1699012, and rs4746 displayed an ambiguous result when patients were compared to controls in the recessive or dominant model (p = 0.08, 0.08, and 0.07, respectively). Again, these associations were not confirmed in the extended cohorts (rs937662, dominant model: p = 0.07, logistic regression: p = 0.07, OR 1.207, 95% CI 0.985-1.480) or in the replication cohorts for rs4746 (Germany, p = 0.42, OR 1.080, 95% CI 0.673-1.124; France, p = 0.19, OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76-1.06; China, p = 0.24, OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.90-1.54) and rs1699012 (Germany, Munich; p = 0.279, OR 0.903, 95% CI 0.750-1.087).Common GLO1 variants do not increase chronic pancreatitis risk."

Considering that language structure emerges from language use, naturalistic data were utilised from two conversational corpora. 12 types of connectives showed significant expansion, with the conditional conjunction si ‘if’ presenting the greatest advance, followed by que ‘that’ used as relative pronoun with explicit antecedent and as completive conjunction. We observed that the interordination and subordination relationships progressed more than those of coordination; however, certain connective elements between coordinated constructions displayed a more notable expansion as discourse markers, in the interactional level."
