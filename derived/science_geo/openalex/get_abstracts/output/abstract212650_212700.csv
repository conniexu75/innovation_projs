https://openalex.org/W2004793118,"5-Trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (F(3)TDR) has potent therapeutic antiviral activity in herpes simplex infection of the rabbit cornea with strains of herpes virus both sensitive and resistant to 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, and in corneal infection with vaccinia. 5-Trifluoromethyl uracil is not therapeutically active in herpetic keratitis."
https://openalex.org/W2056744131,"The protein from human plasma which forms an enzymatically active complex with trypsin and is able to protect trypsin from inhibition by soybean trypsin inhibitor has been shown to be an α2-macroglobulin. It was obtained from the lipid-poor euglobulin of Cohn Fraction III-0, and appears to be closely related to the 19S-glycoprotein or α2-macroglobulin"
https://openalex.org/W2005185279,"RNA, prepared from strain L fibroblasts which were incubated for 30 minutes in radioactive cytidine, was examined by quantitative DNA-RNA hybridization tests, autoradiography, and sedimentation analysis. About 60 percent of the radioactive RNA consists of 38 to 45S molecules located in the nucleoli and capable, under certain circumstances, of forming hybrids with DNA. Unlabeled 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA can compete with these components for DNA sites, indicating that the conversion of nucleolar RNA to ribosomal RNA occurs in such a way that base sequences are preserved. The polydisperse components associated with the chromatin region contain base sequences different from ribosomal and 4S RNA, and consequently have a uniquely high specific activity. These components are the only detectable hybridizing species in unfractionated preparations of RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2011612644,"The study of children with symmetrical nonprogressive muscle weakness and hypotonia has previously led to the discovery of two new disorders of striated muscle. A third myopathy in a child with hypotonia and proximal weakness is reported. Cytochemical and electron-microscopic studies reveal large, bizarre, interfibrillary and subsarcolemmal mitochondria in muscle obtained by biopsy. Smooth muscle of the vascular wall did not show such abnormalities nor did leucocytes or intramuscular nerves with cytochemical techniques. The basal metabolic rate of the patient was within normal limits."
https://openalex.org/W2072860222,"A sensitive and specific gas chromatographic technique for estimating concentrations of the anesthetic adjuvants, gamma-butyrolactone and gamma-hydroxybutyrate, in tissues has been developed. These substances do not appear to occur endogenously in either the blood or the brain of common laboratory animals. The onset and duration of anesthesia caused by the administration of either compound is correlated with the concentration of gamma-hydroxybutyrate in the brain, rather than with that of the corresponding lactone."
https://openalex.org/W1970314924,"The amount of extracellular polysaccharide produced by eight species of green and blue-green algae ranges from 174 milligrams per liter to 557 milligrams per liter. Most of the polymers are composed of four monosaccharides: a hexose, a pentose, a methyl pentose, and uronic acid. The production of excessive amounts of these photosynthetic end products will undoubtedly influence the effective recycling time of growth media in life-support systems."
https://openalex.org/W2054879642,Four variants of human erythrocyte lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are described. One of these is similar to the one previously described by Boyer and is interpreted as a variant of LDH-B. The other three are thought to represent variants of LDH-A. Studies of families indicate that LDH-A and LDH-B are under separate genetic control and are inherited as autosomal co-dominants. Evidence is presented that the LDH-A locus is not closely linked to the loci for the ABH and Duffy blood group systems.
https://openalex.org/W2037871571,"Utilization of long-lived messenger RNA appears to be the exception rather than the rule in cells which are differentiating and synthesizing large amounts of specialized product at the same time. The fact that polyribosomes synthesize protein after RNA synthesis is turned off by actinomycin D is used to demonstrate messenger RNA of long half-life. The data suggest that most tissues examined have short-lived messenger RNA's, but the ocular lens can synthesize protein after an incubation of 24 hours in 40 microg of actinomycin D per milliliter. A common basis for the presence of long-lived messenger RNA in the cells of the lens, the feather, and in reticulocytes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2114047176,"Botulinum toxin was given in large intravenous doses to 7- and 12- day chick embryos. Atrophy of skeletal muscle resulted without significant atrophy of other organs. The histological appearance of muscle was consistent with denervation. The results suggest that neural acetylcholine release may play a significant role in ""trophic transmission"" from nerve to muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1972598005,"Cats were injected intravenously with metaraminol, an amine which depletes norepinephrine from the sympathetic nerve endings; their hearts were then perfused in vitro. Stimulation of the sympathetic nerve supply released metaraminol from the hearts, demonstrating that a synthetic compound can replace norepinephrine and serve as a transmitter at adrenergic nerve endings"
https://openalex.org/W2016688489,Cystathionine was absent in the cerebrum of a patient with homocystinuria. This supports the theory that the enzymatic defect in homocystinuria is deficiency of cystathionine synthetase.
https://openalex.org/W2032598345,"Virogenic cell cultures of a hamster ependymoma originally produced by Simian Virus 40 were treated with proflavine, hydrogen peroxide, or mitomycin C. Induction of virus synthesis was observed. Similar experiments with hamster cells transformed by adenovirus type 12 or polyoma virus gave negative results"
https://openalex.org/W2020280833,"Addition of phytohemagglutinin and of streptolysin S to in vitro cultures of leukocytes of normal and agammaglobulinemic subjects resulted in mitosis of lymphocytes and their differentiation to plasma cells. In contrast, specific antigens induced mitosis and differentiation of lymphocytes of normal but not of agammaglobulinemic donors. The data suggest that the absence of plasma cells in agammaglobulinemia is not in itself responsible for failure of antibody production, but is rather the morphologic concomitant of the primary defect (failure of antibody production on exposure to antigenic stimulus)."
https://openalex.org/W2083150658,"Structural differences between two antigenic types (designated C and Z) of gamma-globulins, both of low molecular weight, produced in "" Heavy chain"" disease are revealed by their relative susceptibilities to enzymatic degradation by papain and the nature of the cleavage products. Corresponding structural differences exist between the respective type C and type Z myeloma gamma(2)-globulins. These structural differences are tentatively assigned to the H-chains, and more specifically to the portion of the H-chain contained in the fast-moving (F) fragment of papain-treated gamma(2)-globulins."
https://openalex.org/W1946518019,"Male mice of two inbred strains and one hybrid strain were observed for sexual behavior for 42 consecutive days. Half the males of each strain were then castrated, and daily testing was continued until the ejaculatory reflex was lost. Strain differences were found in ejaculatory frequency both before and after castration."
https://openalex.org/W2081973231,"Administration of lobuloalveolar mammogenic hormones (for a period insufficient to induce alveolar differentiation) to immature mice prior to cultivation of their mammary glands in chemically defined, hormone-supplemented media resulted in lobuloalveolar growth in vitro comparable to that of late pregnancy. No such growth occurred in cultures of mammary tissues from mice not treated with hormones. The use of tissues from hormone-treated donors might serve as a valuable tool for studies concerned with differentiation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2068285892,"The intraperitoneal injection of multiple doses of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUDR) into pregnant mice produced abnormalities limited to the hind limbs of the offspring. This effect is probably a result of a metabolic lesion. When injected into newborn mice, BUDR did not increase the incidence of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2037676904,"The heart of the freshwater turtle has a functional ventricular septal defect. In ambient air there is some shunting of blood from the left to the right ventricle through the defect. During prolonged diving or N(2) inhalation, the shunt is reversed and blood from the tissues bypasses the lung and enters the aorta directly. This adaptation appears to be based on the exclusive use of anaerobic glycolysis as an energy source during prolonged diving."
https://openalex.org/W2053393231,In patients with breast and prostate cancer hormone excretion patterns differ in a similar way from patterns in persons without cancer.
https://openalex.org/W1974689514,"A potassium-activated phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes polyribonucleotides to 5'-mononucleotides has been purified approximately 600-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli B. The purified enzyme appears to be specific for single-stranded polyribonucleotides: helical forms are not hydrolyzed, nor do they inhibit the hydrolysis of single-stranded chains."
https://openalex.org/W2104577207,"When two different taste stimuli are presented, one to the left and the other to the right side of the tongue, they may add together to a sensation in the middle of the tongue, or they may stay separated. This phenomenon can be used to show that the four primary taste sensations seem to form two well-differentiated groups. Warm and cold stimuli act similarly to the four primary taste stimuli, thus separating the sensations on the tongue into two groups: bitter, warm, sweet; and sour, cold, salty."
https://openalex.org/W2031520513,"Soils from DDT-sprayed forest stands in New Brunswick and Maine contained DDT residues. The residues increased in successive samplings between 1958 and 1961, although no new spray was applied. The increase suggests that DDT residues may persist for several years in tree canopies but are ultimately carried into the soil"
https://openalex.org/W2031411207,"Twin lambs were divided into two groups: an unmothered group consisting of one of each pair of twins separated from its mother at birth, and a mothered group consisting of the other member of each pair reared by its mother. Lambs in both groups were placed individually on a ""visual cliff"" once every hour. In all instances lambs in the mothered group exhibited ""cliff avoidance"" behavior before those in the unmothered group. In another experiment, mothered lambs were fitted with translucent goggles for half the time required by unmothered lambs, matched on the basis of sex and birth weight, to acquire depth perception. Again, in all instances the mothered, goggled lambs avoided the cliff before the unmothered lambs."
https://openalex.org/W1994067989,"Living tomato hair cells were directly injected with tobacco mosaic virus or tobacco mosaic virus RNA with a fine glass needle. Use of a fluorescent tobacco mosaic virus antibody showed the presence of the virus protein in the nucleus 6 to 18 hours after the injection. As time of infection progressed, staining of the cytoplasm became more prominent."
https://openalex.org/W1971717400,Ribonuclease induces many puffs in salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila busckii. The left arm of chromosome 2 was analyzed in detail; in this arm seven puffs were induced in a definite sequence.
https://openalex.org/W2072237057,Hydra pirardi contracts spontaneously and in response to external stimuli of light and mechanical agitation. Inhibition of these contractions occurs when the animal feeds on Artemia salina or when reduced glutathione is present in the environment. Such inhibition demonstrates the control of one receptor-effector system by another in hydra.
https://openalex.org/W2073100310,"Phenolic reagents which uncouple oxidative phosphorylation are bound to the protein moiety of mitochondria. This interaction may induce configurational changes in the enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation, and these changes could be responsible for the uncoupling phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2075613755,"Both an aqueous Balpha(OH)(2) extract and an acetone-benzene extract of unburned cigarette tobacco produced skin tumors when painted on mice previously treated with 125 microg of7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. The extract from as little as 0.5 cigarette per day was effective. The data are of interest in connection with epidemiological evidence that tobacco chewing is a cause of oral cancer. The data also suggest that tumor-promoting agents in cigarette smokemay have their source in the unburned tobacco"
https://openalex.org/W2074816141,"The Dalmatian coach hound appears to lack a mediated transport system for uric acid, which can be demonstrated in the erythrocytes of other dogs by hypoxanthine inhibition of uric acid uptake. This transport deficiency may be a manifestation of a genetic defect which has different metabolic consequences in the liver, in the kidney, and in other tissues, depending on the direction of their differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2019615668,"Spleen cell suspensions obtained from mice immunized with sheep erythrocytes form localized zones of hemolysis (""antibody plaques"") when incubated in agar gel containing sheep red blood cells and complement. Plaque formation can be inhibited by prior incubation in vitro with spleen cell suspensions from another strain of mice previously sensitized to the first by spleen cell transplant. Suppression of plaque formation was found to be quantitatively related to the number of cells incubated and apparently reflected a homograft reaction in vitro of one spleen cell population against another. Plaque inhibition may be a useful indicator of transplantation immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4253260159,"Intravenous injection of H-1 virus into pregnant hamsters early in gestation produces an embryocidal and teratogenic effect. The congenital malformations, the presence of inclusion bodies in the fetuses, and the fact that the maternal animals are not affected by this virus, are points of similarity to the teratogenic effects of rubella virus and cytomegalic-inclusion disease virus in man."
https://openalex.org/W2089299829,"Ion communication between the halves (blastomere) of a dividing cell (Asterias forbesi egg), as determined electrically, diminishes progressively during division as a cell membrane junction forms at the plane of cleavage. Virtually all communication is lost towards the end of division by the time the first intercellular space becomes continuous with the exterior. Resting membrane potentials in both cell halves are essentially equal and constant throughout division."
https://openalex.org/W116042493,"Let me recapitulate. I am not happy with developments in the behavioral sciences. I wonder whether science does actually stand divorced from the intention, motive, and character of the scientist. I suspect that some of our current philosophies in science, whether so conceived or not, encourage and abet a science of the trivial. I believe we should recognize that, as epistemology, the empirical rule cannot stand alone. The great advances in science are associated with its grand conceptions even more than with its discoveries. We often mistakenly assume that the rule of objectivity has traditionally divided the character of science from that of the scientist. This is far from true. The objectivity of 18th- and 19th- century science was believed to be a function not so much of methodology and procedure as of the honesty and integrity of the scientist. Michael Faraday had this to say about the matter (3, p. 233): It puzzles me greatly to know what makes the successful philosopher [scientist]. Is it industry and perseverance, with a moderate proportion of good sense and intelligence? Is not a modest assurance or earnestness a requisite? Do not many fail because they look rather to the renown to be acquired than to the pure acquisition of knowledge, and the delight which the contented mind has in acquiring it for its own sake? I am sure I have seen many who would have been good and successful pursuers of science, and have gained themselves a high name, but that it was the name and the reward they were always looking forward to-the reward of the world's praise. In such there is always a shade of envy or regret over their minds, and I cannot imagine a man making discoveries in science under these feelings. As to Genius and its Power, there may be cases; I suppose there are. I have looked long and often for a genius for our own laboratory, but I have never found one. But I have seen many who would, I think, if they submitted themselves to a sound self-applied discipline of mind, have become successful experimental philosophers. Are these issues native only to behavioral science? Earlier, I laid at Skinner's door much of the blame for an unreasonable complacency regarding the disposition of modern behavioral science. In all fairness to Skinner, however, it is only correct to acknowledge that the same problem is evident in other areas of science. Skinner appears to be a spokesman, in the behavioral sciences, for one of those famous ""Zeitgeists."" Let me quote a series of observations by Paul Weiss, a biologist at the Rockefeller Institute, New York City, from a paper entitled ""Experience and experiment in biology"" (5): Without imagination one can contrive infinite variations of experimental set-ups, all of them novel, yet utterly uninteresting, inconsequential, insignificant. The mere fact that something has not been done or tried before is not sufficient reason for doing or trying it. . . . But is not scientific history full of instances of accidental discovery of the unexpected? True again, but he who does expect something will be on the alert even for the unexpected, while he who just ambles, looking for nothing in particular, is prone to miss even the obvious. . . . We see instruments turning from servants into tyrants, forcing the captive scientist to mass-produce and market senseless data beyond the point of conceivable usefulness-a modern version of the Sorcerer's Apprentice. . . . Finally, I recommend study of N. W. Storer's article ""The coming changes in American science"" (6). Storer, a sociologist at Harvard University, feels that prior to 1940 the basic currency in science was professional recognition. This in turn reinforced certain fundamental values-a high emphasis on communication; dedication of the individual and a tendency to work in small, select groups; a spurning of worldly gain and a proclivity for basic research. Today, professional recognition is being replaced by more common currencies-money, power, and worldly prestige. The result is a shift of values in science: numbers are no longer small or groups select; communication and professional recognition are viewed as means to gain money, power, and prestige rather than as ends in themselves; basic research is giving way to a kind of imposter with a thinly disguised commercial goal. I do not know how to resolve the issues in modern science. It seems to me we may be troubled by the embarrassments of too much success. Will we continue to succeed if we do not change our ways? Maybe, but not as magnificently I am sure as we could if we did change them. We cannot do anything about our numbers-nor would I want us to forswear all worldly possessions. We can examine critically and revise certain of our guiding philosophies. We can follow a suggestion of P. H. Abelson (7) and alter granting procedures so that institutions, as well as individuals, are given support. In the end, however, the major force for change resides in the minds and hearts of scientists who share a concern about science."
https://openalex.org/W1989657078,Increased resistance to the sterilizing effects of apholate was observed in two colonies of Aedes aegypti (L.) exposed in the larval stage of each generation to concentrations of apholate that induced about 90 to 40 percent sterility in the eggs laid by the ensuing adults.
https://openalex.org/W2005850118,"Exogenous reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide was not oxidized by mitochondria but by cytoplasmic hydrogen-accepting systems catalyzed by lactic, α-glycerophosphate, and malic dehydrogenases. The three enzymes were found in all tissues of the mouse; the amount of activity of each enzyme differed in the various tissues, however. It is suggested that each tissue has a unique pattern for oxidation of extramitochondrial diphosphopyridine nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W2066560987,A highly alpha-helical subunit has been isolated from the heavy-mero-myosin portion of myosin. This molecule has a helix content of about 73 percent and an amino acid composition similar to that of light meromyosin. The presence of this subunit supports the current view that the myosin molecule consists of a long helical rod with a globular region at one end.
https://openalex.org/W2073845648,"Crosses between plants of Haplopappus gracilis (n = 2) and a race with three pairs of chromosomes (tribivalens) gave a highly fertile five-chromosome hybrid. In both races the chromosomes with the satellites appear homologous, but the other two tribivalens chromosomes pair with the A chromosome (without a satellite) of H. gracilis. Disjunction from the resulting trivalent is preferential: the A chromosome goes to one pole and the two tribivalens chromosomes to the other."
https://openalex.org/W2042455491,"Dormant seeds of different species tolerate varying amounts of ionizing radiation, species having smaller nuclei in the apical meristem generally withstanding greater exposure. Nuclear volume (in μ3) multiplied by radiation exposure (in roentgens) equals a constant, estimated from 12 species to be (10.14 ± 1.17) × 106. From nuclear volumes alone, predictions of radiation response for two unknown species were made; experimental values in both cases fell below the 95 percent but within the 99 percent confidence intervals of the predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2068830368,"The median frontal organ of Thermobia domestica (Packard) and the median ocellus of Tricholepidion gertschi Wygodzinsky were compared with respect to location, innervation, and fine structure. The data suggest that the two organs are homologous. Elementary neurosecretory granules were not found in the median frontal organ, but multivesicular bodies are present in both the frontal organ and ocellus"
https://openalex.org/W2075088974,Adrenergic fibers in isolated iris preparations were demonstrated histochemically by means of the formaldehyde condensation technique. In the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) there was a net uptake of norepinephrine added in vitro by the adrenergic fibers producing a striking increase in fluorescence. In the absence of ATP only a slight increase in fluorescence was observed when the tissue was exposed to high concentrations of norepinephrine.
https://openalex.org/W2030097351,"The incidence of polyploidy (specifically, in this case, the doubling of the stemline chromosome number) induced by x-rays in cells cultured in vitro is about the same for both ""near-diploid"" and ""near-tetraploid"" sublines of the Chinese hamster. Endoreduplication is a principal cytological mechanism for this form of induced polyploidy."
https://openalex.org/W2003325157,"In addition to indole-3-glycerolphosphate, an unreported reaction product has been detected in incubation mixtures containing tryptophan synthetase from Neurospora, indole, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. This product has been tentatively identified as an indole derivative. Since this compound is not formed in incubation mixtures initially containing only enzyme and indole-3-glycerolphosphate, it was concluded that indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthesis and breakdown are not simply the forward and reverse components of a reversible reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2007529434,"Erythrocyte mosaicism for hemoglobin types is demonstrated in a pair of dizygotic cattle twins. Both twins were of hemoglobin type AB in the direct tests. However, when hemoglobin types were ascertained on the two populations of red cells comprising the mosaic, one population proved to be hemoglobin type A and the other, type B. Since the ratio of the two populations of red cells was approximately 60:40, there was no evidence from the direct tests suggesting mosaicism for hemoglobin types. The results, as might be expected on theoretical grounds, provide evidence that synthesis of hemoglobin of one type in a mixed clone is not influenced by synthesis of hemoglobin of another type."
