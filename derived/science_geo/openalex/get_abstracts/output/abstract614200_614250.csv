https://openalex.org/W2860743873,"Physical function declines in old age, portending disability, increased health expenditures, and mortality. Cellular senescence, leading to tissue dysfunction, may contribute to these consequences of aging, but whether senescence can directly drive age-related pathology and be therapeutically targeted is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that transplanting relatively small numbers of senescent cells into young mice is sufficient to cause persistent physical dysfunction, as well as to spread cellular senescence to host tissues. Transplanting even fewer senescent cells had the same effect in older recipients and was accompanied by reduced survival, indicating the potency of senescent cells in shortening health- and lifespan. The senolytic cocktail, dasatinib plus quercetin, which causes selective elimination of senescent cells, decreased the number of naturally occurring senescent cells and their secretion of frailty-related proinflammatory cytokines in explants of human adipose tissue. Moreover, intermittent oral administration of senolytics to both senescent cell-transplanted young mice and naturally aged mice alleviated physical dysfunction and increased post-treatment survival by 36% while reducing mortality hazard to 65%. Our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent cells can cause physical dysfunction and decreased survival even in young mice, while senolytics can enhance remaining health- and lifespan in old mice."

https://openalex.org/W2830196912,"The incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) increases with age and mortality exceeds 90% when diagnosed after age 65. Most cases arise without any detectable early symptoms and patients usually present with the acute complications of bone marrow failure1. The onset of such de novo AML cases is typically preceded by the accumulation of somatic mutations in preleukaemic haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that undergo clonal expansion2,3. However, recurrent AML mutations also accumulate in HSPCs during ageing of healthy individuals who do not develop AML, a phenomenon referred to as age-related clonal haematopoiesis (ARCH)4-8. Here we use deep sequencing to analyse genes that are recurrently mutated in AML to distinguish between individuals who have a high risk of developing AML and those with benign ARCH. We analysed peripheral blood cells from 95 individuals that were obtained on average 6.3 years before AML diagnosis (pre-AML group), together with 414 unselected age- and gender-matched individuals (control group). Pre-AML cases were distinct from controls and had more mutations per sample, higher variant allele frequencies, indicating greater clonal expansion, and showed enrichment of mutations in specific genes. Genetic parameters were used to derive a model that accurately predicted AML-free survival; this model was validated in an independent cohort of 29 pre-AML cases and 262 controls. Because AML is rare, we also developed an AML predictive model using a large electronic health record database that identified individuals at greater risk. Collectively our findings provide proof-of-concept that it is possible to discriminate ARCH from pre-AML many years before malignant transformation. This could in future enable earlier detection and monitoring, and may help to inform intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2783064655,"The pattern of somatic mutations observed at diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been well-characterized. However, the premalignant mutational landscape of AML and its impact on risk and time to diagnosis is unknown. Here we identified 212 women from the Women's Health Initiative who were healthy at study baseline, but eventually developed AML during follow-up (median time: 9.6 years). Deep sequencing was performed on peripheral blood DNA of these cases and compared to age-matched controls that did not develop AML. We discovered that mutations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, DNMT3A, TET2 and spliceosome genes significantly increased the odds of developing AML. All subjects with TP53 mutations (n = 21 out of 21 patients) and IDH1 and IDH2 (n = 15 out of 15 patients) mutations eventually developed AML in our study. The presence of detectable mutations years before diagnosis suggests that there is a period of latency that precedes AML during which early detection, monitoring and interventional studies should be considered."

https://openalex.org/W2812344549,"Chromatin folding contributes to the regulation of genomic processes such as gene activity. Existing conformation capture methods characterize genome topology through analysis of pairwise chromatin contacts in populations of cells but cannot discern whether individual interactions occur simultaneously or competitively. Here we present multi-contact 4C (MC-4C), which applies Nanopore sequencing to study multi-way DNA conformations of individual alleles. MC-4C distinguishes cooperative from random and competing interactions and identifies previously missed structures in subpopulations of cells. We show that individual elements of the Î²-globin superenhancer can aggregate into an enhancer hub that can simultaneously accommodate two genes. Neighboring chromatin domain loops can form rosette-like structures through collision of their CTCF-bound anchors, as seen most prominently in cells lacking the cohesin-unloading factor WAPL. Here, massive collision of CTCF-anchored chromatin loops is believed to reflect 'cohesin traffic jams'. Single-allele topology studies thus help us understand the mechanisms underlying genome folding and functioning."

https://openalex.org/W2851535791,"Pancreatic beta cell loss is a key factor in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but therapies to halt this process are lacking. We previously reported that the approved antihypertensive calcium-channel blocker verapamil, by decreasing the expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein, promotes the survival of insulin-producing beta cells and reverses diabetes in mouse models1. To translate these findings into humans, we conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial ( NCT02372253 ) to assess the efficacy and safety of oral verapamil added for 12 months to a standard insulin regimen in adult subjects with recent-onset T1D. Verapamil treatment, compared with placebo was well tolerated and associated with an improved mixed-meal-stimulated C-peptide area under the curve, a measure of endogenous beta cell function, at 3 and 12 months (prespecified primary endpoint), as well as with a lower increase in insulin requirements, fewer hypoglycemic events and on-target glycemic control (secondary endpoints). Thus, addition of once-daily oral verapamil may be a safe and effective novel approach to promote endogenous beta cell function and reduce insulin requirements and hypoglycemic episodes in adult individuals with recent-onset T1D."
https://openalex.org/W2837542075,"Over 90% of genetic variants associated with complex human traits map to non-coding regions, but little is understood about how they modulate gene regulation in health and disease. One possible mechanism is that genetic variants affect the activity of one or more cis-regulatory elements leading to gene expression variation in specific cell types. To identify such cases, we analyzed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq profiles from stimulated primary CD4+ T cells in up to 105 healthy donors. We found that regions of accessible chromatin (ATAC-peaks) are co-accessible at kilobase and megabase resolution, consistent with the three-dimensional chromatin organization measured by in situ Hi-C in T cells. Fifteen percent of genetic variants located within ATAC-peaks affected the accessibility of the corresponding peak (local-ATAC-QTLs). Local-ATAC-QTLs have the largest effects on co-accessible peaks, are associated with gene expression and are enriched for autoimmune disease variants. Our results provide insights into how natural genetic variants modulate cis-regulatory elements, in isolation or in concert, to influence gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2812975072,"Recent research has focused on environmental effects that control tissue functionality and systemic metabolism. However, whether such stimuli affect human thermogenesis and body mass index (BMI) has not been explored. Here we show retrospectively that the presence of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the season of conception are linked to BMI in humans. In mice, we demonstrate that cold exposure (CE) of males, but not females, before mating results in improved systemic metabolism and protection from diet-induced obesity of the male offspring. Integrated analyses of the DNA methylome and RNA sequencing of the sperm from male mice revealed several clusters of co-regulated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), suggesting that the improved metabolic health of the offspring was due to enhanced BAT formation and increased neurogenesis. The conclusions are supported by cell-autonomous studies in the offspring that demonstrate an enhanced capacity to form mature active brown adipocytes, improved neuronal density and more norepinephrine release in BAT in response to cold stimulation. Taken together, our results indicate that in humans and in mice, seasonal or experimental CE induces an epigenetic programming of the sperm such that the offspring harbor hyperactive BAT and an improved adaptation to overnutrition and hypothermia. How heavy a person is and how much active brown fat they have depends on their father and the season in which they were conceived."
https://openalex.org/W2871400816,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of collagen in the lung, leading to chronically impaired gas exchange and death1-3. Oxidative stress is believed to be critical in this disease pathogenesis4-6, although the exact mechanisms remain enigmatic. Protein S-glutathionylation (PSSG) is a post-translational modification of proteins that can be reversed by glutaredoxin-1 (GLRX)7. It remains unknown whether GLRX and PSSG play a role in lung fibrosis. Here, we explored the impact of GLRX and PSSG status on the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, using lung tissues from subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, transgenic mouse models and direct administration of recombinant Glrx to airways of mice with existing fibrosis. We demonstrate that GLRX enzymatic activity was strongly decreased in fibrotic lungs, in accordance with increases in PSSG. Mice lacking Glrx were far more susceptible to bleomycin- or adenovirus encoding active transforming growth factor beta-1 (AdTGFB1)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, whereas transgenic overexpression of Glrx in the lung epithelium attenuated fibrosis. We furthermore show that endogenous GLRX was inactivated through an oxidative mechanism and that direct administration of the Glrx protein into airways augmented Glrx activity and reversed increases in collagen in mice with TGFB1- or bleomycin-induced fibrosis, even when administered to fibrotic, aged animals. Collectively, these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of exogenous GLRX in treating lung fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2847857000,"Chaperones TAPBPR and tapasin associate with class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I) to promote optimization (editing) of peptide cargo. Here, we use solution NMR to investigate the mechanism of peptide exchange. We identify TAPBPR-induced conformational changes on conserved MHC-I molecular surfaces, consistent with our independently determined X-ray structure of the complex. Dynamics present in the empty MHC-I are stabilized by TAPBPR and become progressively dampened with increasing peptide occupancy. Incoming peptides are recognized according to the global stability of the final pMHC-I product and anneal in a native-like conformation to be edited by TAPBPR. Our results demonstrate an inverse relationship between MHC-I peptide occupancy and TAPBPR binding affinity, wherein the lifetime and structural features of transiently bound peptides control the regulation of a conformational switch located near the TAPBPR binding site, which triggers TAPBPR release. These results suggest a similar mechanism for the function of tapasin in the peptide-loading complex."
https://openalex.org/W2827951800,"The ability to produce creative solutions is a key part of expert performance. The aim of this study was to identify the visual search behaviors that underpin superior creative performance of skilled soccer players during simulated 11-a-side match play. Players (N = 44) were required to interact with a representative life-size video-based simulation of attacking situations whilst in possession of the ball. Clips were occluded at a key moment and they were required to play the ball in response to each situation presented. Moreover, they were required to name other additional actions they could execute for each situation. Creative performance on the task was measured using the three criteria of originality, flexibility, and fluency of decisions. Visual search behaviors were examined using a portable eye-movement registration system. Players were classified as most- (n = 11) or least-creative (n = 11) based on their performance on the representative task. The most-creative players produced more appropriate, original, flexible, and fluid decisions compared to least-creative players. The creativity-based differences in judgment were underpinned by differences in visual search strategy. Most-creative players employed a broader attentional focus including more fixations of shorter duration and towards more informative locations of the display compared with least-creative players. Moreover, most-creative players detected teammates in threatening positions earlier in the attacking play. Creative performance is underpinned by different underlying visual processes when compared to less-creative performance, which appears to be crucial in facilitating more creative solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2869644630,"Itch and pain are refractory symptoms of many ocular conditions. Ocular itch is generated mainly in the conjunctiva and is absent from the cornea. In contrast, most ocular pain arises from the cornea. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using genetic axonal tracing approaches, we discover distinct sensory innervation patterns between the conjunctiva and cornea. Further genetic and functional analyses in rodent models show that a subset of conjunctival-selective sensory fibers marked by MrgprA3 expression, rather than corneal sensory fibers, mediates ocular itch. Importantly, the actions of both histamine and nonhistamine pruritogens converge onto this unique subset of conjunctiva sensory fibers and enable them to play a key role in mediating itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis. This is distinct from skin itch, in which discrete populations of sensory neurons cooperate to carry itch. Finally, we provide proof of concept that selective silencing of conjunctiva itch-sensing fibers by pruritogen-mediated entry of sodium channel blocker QX-314 is a feasible therapeutic strategy to treat ocular itch in mice. Itch-sensing fibers also innervate the human conjunctiva and allow pharmacological silencing using QX-314. Our results cast new light on the neural mechanisms of ocular itch and open a new avenue for developing therapeutic strategies. A molecularly defined set of sensory fibers expressing MrgprA3 mediate ocular itch via specific anatomical projections to the conjunctiva, which can be targeted therapeutically in rodent models."
https://openalex.org/W2873849039,"Despite the introduction of more than one dozen new antiepileptic drugs in the past 20 years, approximately one-third of people who develop epilepsy continue to have seizures on mono- or polytherapy1. Viral-vector-mediated gene transfer offers the opportunity to design a rational treatment that builds on mechanistic understanding of seizure generation and that can be targeted to specific neuronal populations in epileptogenic foci2. Several such strategies have shown encouraging results in different animal models, although clinical translation is limited by possible effects on circuits underlying cognitive, mnemonic, sensory or motor function. Here, we describe an autoregulatory antiepileptic gene therapy, which relies on neuronal inhibition in response to elevations in extracellular glutamate. It is effective in a rodent model of focal epilepsy and is well tolerated, thus lowering the barrier to clinical translation."
https://openalex.org/W2838828608,"Background The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in South Korea is increasing. Although extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) are an important factor in the clinical outcomes of IBD patients, EIMs have not yet been investigated in Korea. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of EIMs in Korean IBD patients. Methods The 2014 claims data from the National Health Insurance System (NHIS) of Korea were used. IBD patients were identified by codes for Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) in the NHIS registration system for rare or intractable diseases. International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition codes were used to identify EIM cases. To estimate the prevalence of EIMs in the general population of Korea, we used national sample data. Standardized prevalence ratios (SPRs) were calculated to compare the prevalence rates of EIMs among IBD patients to those among the general population of Korea. Results A total of 13,925 CD patients and 29,356 UC patients were identified. CD and UC patients were different in terms of demographics and utilization of medication. Among the 17 EIMs investigated, pyoderma gangrenosum, osteomalacia, Sweet syndrome, and scleritis were observed in very few patients. The SPRs were greater than 1 for all EIMs. Aphthous stomatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis were highly prevalent in both CD and UC patients, but the SPRs of the EIMs were not high. Conclusion The study confirmed that EIMs are more prevalent among IBD patients than among the general population of Korea. The prevalence of EIMs in IBD patients suggests the need for greater attention and effort in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2866498412,"The pathophysiological functions of the signaling molecules matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14) and integrin Î±vÎ²3 in various types of cancer are believed to derive from their collaborative activity in promoting invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, as shown in vitro and in vivo. The two effectors act in concert in a cell-specific manner through the localization of pro-MMP-2 to the cell surface, where it is processed to intermediate and matured MMP-2. The matured MMP-2 product is localized to the cell surface via its binding to integrin Î±vÎ²3. The MMP-14/MMP-2/integrin Î±vÎ²3 axis thus constitutes an attractive putative target for therapeutic interventions, but the development of inhibitors that target this axis remains an unfulfilled task. To address the lack of such multitarget inhibitors, we have established a combinatorial approach that is based on flow cytometry screening of a yeast-displayed N-TIMP2 (N-terminal domain variant of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2) mutant library. On the basis of this screening, we generated protein monomers and a heterodimer that contain monovalent and bivalent binding epitopes to MMP-14 and integrin Î±vÎ²3. Among these proteins, the bi-specific heterodimer, which bound strongly to both MMP-14 and integrin Î±vÎ²3, exhibited superior ability to inhibit MMP-2 activation and displayed the highest inhibitory activity in cell-based models of a MMP-14-, MMP-2-, and integrin Î±vÎ²3-dependent glioblastoma and of endothelial cell invasiveness and endothelial capillary tube formation.

Finally, MMP-14 has been shown to participate catalytically in the maturation of the integrin Î±v subunit and to correlate with Î²3 chain proteolytic cleavage and processing, both of which lead to functional activation of integrin Î±vÎ²3, thus modulating the adhesive, migratory, and metastatic behavior of tumor cells (23Deryugina E.I.

MMP-14 and integrin Î±vÎ²3 work in concert to facilitate the processing and maturation of MMP-2 (21Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Postnova T.I. DiScipio R. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y.

This maturation is initiated by activation of pro-MMP-2 into intermediate MMP-2 in a process that is facilitated by two molecules of MMP-14 and one molecule of FL-TIMP2, the full-length molecule of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2). Through its N-terminal domain, FL-TIMP2 binds to the catalytic site of one MMP-14 molecule, leading to MMP-14 inhibition. Through its C-terminal domain, cell-surface localized FL-TIMP2 binds to pro-MMP-2, thereby bringing it into the proximity of a second (catalytically active) MMP-14 molecule, which processes pro-MMP-2 into the MMP-2 intermediate form (21Deryugina E.I.

Conversion of the intermediate MMP-2 into matured MMP-2 takes place in an integrin Î±vÎ²3-dependent process, but the details of this specific maturation mechanism remain to be elucidated (21Deryugina E.I.

It is the latter two forms of MMP-2 (i.e. intermediate and matured) that are able to degrade ECM components and to promote invasiveness (27Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M.

Importantly, although MMP-2 is a secreted protein, localization of matured MMP-2 on cancer and endothelial cell surfaces, via integrin Î±vÎ²3, was found to increase cell invasiveness and angiogenesis (19Brooks P.C.

Given the complexity and redundancy of the MMP-14, MMP-2, and integrin Î±vÎ²3 signaling networks that result from the cross-talk between these effectors, it is likely that multicomponent therapeutics capable of perturbing parallel nodes of these critical pathways that are associated with angiogenesis and metastasis would be a promising means to combat drug resistance in various cancers, including melanoma (22Hofmann U.B.

Indeed, such a notion has attracted considerable attention for other systems and has accelerated the development of mixture therapeutics targeted at other cross-reactive signaling networks, such as vascular endothelial growth factorâepidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (30Kummar S.

Nonetheless, despite their significant clinical success, mixture therapeutics have several well known limitations, including additive on- and off-target toxicity (32Al-Lazikani B. Banerji U. Workman P. Combinatorial drug therapy for cancer in the post-genomic era.Nat.

Combination versus sequential single-agent therapy in metastatic breast cancer.Oncologist. 2002; 7 (12454315): 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, their use is limited by the requirement to provide preclinical data demonstrating that the mixture has greater than additive activity or more durable responses than those obtained with mono-therapy (34Yap T.A. Omlin A. de Bono J.S. Development of therapeutic combinations targeting major cancer signaling pathways.J. Clin.

These limitations may be overcome by exploiting the enormous potential of combinatorial approaches for engineering multispecificity into natural protein ligands (35Papo N. Silverman A.P. Lahti J.L.

In this paper, we demonstrate that concurrent targeting of MMP-14 and integrin Î±vÎ²3 with bi-specific inhibitors offers enhanced therapeutic benefits compared with the respective mono-treatments. We show that these bi-specific inhibitors are the first reported proteins that target all the known functions that result from cross-talk between MMP-14 and integrin Î±vÎ²3, namely cancer cell invasion, angiogenesis, and MMP-2 activation and localization to the cell surface. The bi-specific inhibitors were derived from the 127-amino acid N-terminal domain of WT TIMP-2 (N-TIMP2WT) and that of an N-TIMP2 variant, designated N-TIMP25M, which was previously designed by our group for high affinity and specificity toward MMP-14 in preference to other MMPs (38Arkadash V. Yosef G. Shirian J. Cohen I. Horev Y. Grossman M. Sagi I. Radisky E.S. Shifman J.M. Papo N.

An overriding consideration in the design of the above inhibitors was the need for specificity, because MMP family members are also found in nonmalignant cells, and some MMPs, such as MMP-8 and MMP-12, exhibit anti-tumorigenic functions (39Folgueras A.R. PendÃ¡s A.M. SÃ¡nchez L.M. LÃ³pez-Otin C. Matrix metalloproteinases in cancer: from new functions to improved inhibition strategies.Int. J. Dev.

It is thus not surprising that inhibitors with narrow or single MMP specificity have greater therapeutic potential than nonspecific inhibitors (42Nuti E. Tuccinardi T. Rossello A.

As we have shown previously, specificity toward MMP-14 in preference to other MMPs can be obtained by utilizing N-TIMP25M (38Arkadash V. Yosef G. Shirian J. Cohen I. Horev Y. Grossman M. Sagi I. Radisky E.S. Shifman J.M. Papo N. Development of high affinity and high specificity inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase 14 through computational design and directed evolution.J. Biol.

One of the main challenges that we had to address was engineering specificity for integrin Î±vÎ²3 binding, because the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide motif typical of many natural ECM ligands, including fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, and osteopontin, is also recognized by other integrins, including those containing the Î±v subunit and integrins Î±5Î²1 and Î±iibÎ²3 (45Plow E.F.

To generate mutated N-TIMP2 variants with binding specificity toward integrin Î±vÎ²3, we exploited the substantial differences between the above ligands in the three-dimensional orientations of flexible solvent-exposed loops containing the RGD motif; these differences are a function of the particular amino acid residues flanking the RGD sequence and hence dictate the integrin-binding affinity and specificity of the ligands (46Li R.

Polybromo 1 (PBRM1 or BAF180) is hypothesized to function as the nucleosome-recognition subunit of the PBAF chromatin-remodeling complex and is frequently mutated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Previous studies have applied in vitro methods to explore the binding specificities of the six individual PBRM1 BDs. However, BD targeting to histones and the influence of neighboring BD on nucleosome recognition have not been well characterized. Here, using histone microarrays and intact nucleosomes to investigate the histone-binding characteristics of the six PBRM1 BDs individually and combined, we demonstrate that BD2 and BD4 of PBRM1 mediate binding to acetylated histone peptides and to modified recombinant and cellular nucleosomes. Moreover, we show that neighboring BDs variably modulate these chromatin interactions, with BD1 and BD5 enhancing nucleosome interactions of BD2 and BD4, respectively, whereas BD3 attenuated these interactions. We also found that binding pocket missense mutations in BD4 observed in ccRCC disrupt PBRM1âchromatin interactions and that these mutations in BD4, but not similar mutations in BD2, in the context of full-length PBRM1, accelerate ccRCC cell proliferation. Taken together, our biochemical and mutational analyses have identified BD4 as being critically important for maintaining proper PBRM1 function and demonstrate that BD4 mutations increase ccRCC cell growth. Because of the link between PBRM1 status and sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, these data also suggest the relevance of BD4 as a potential clinical target.

The functional redundancy and promiscuous binding of BDs to acetylated lysines suggest a multivalent model in which linked domains mediate cooperative interactions with combinations of histone PTMs (8Ruthenburg A.J.

For example, BPTF, a member of the NURF chromatin-remodeling complex, contains a BD and PHD that mediate interaction with nucleosomes harboring H3K4me3 and H4K16ac (12Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Milne T.A.

Tandem domains can also demonstrate autoregulatory function (13VanDemark A.P. Kasten M.M. Ferris E. Heroux A. Hill C.P. Cairns B.R.

Because of relationships between these protein domains, consideration of BD context is critical when assessing the targeting specificity of these proteins. PBRM1 (polybromo-1, PB1, BAF180), a member of the PBAF SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, is unique among chromatin reader proteins as it contains six tandem BDs. No other protein contains more than two BDs, and other components of the SWI/SNF complex contain at most a single BD. The presence of multiple BDs suggests that PBRM1 may act as the nucleosome recognition subunit of the PBAF complex (14Lemon B. Inouye C. King D.S. Tjian R.

PBRM1 is mutated in â¼40% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) (15Varela I. Tarpey P. Raine K. Huang D. Ong C.K. Stephens P. Davies H. Jones D. Lin M.-L. Teague J. Bignell G. Butler A.

However, the role of PBRM1 loss in ccRCC development remains unclear. How the multiple BDs of PBRM1 mediate chromatin interaction would provide insights into the function of PBRM1 and could suggest a role for PBRM1 mutation in the development of ccRCC.

However, because biologically relevant recognition of the histone tails is in context of a multimeric nucleosome, synthetic peptides may offer a restricted representation of native binding interactions. Also, because these studies were performed with individual BDs, the relationship between neighboring BDs on histone recognition has remained unexplored. The reliance on synthetic peptides, experimental variation, and a low affinity for individual BDs to acetyl lysine residues (18Charlop-Powers Z. Zeng L. Zhang Q. Zhou M.-M. Structural insights into selective histone H3 recognition by the human Polybromo bromodomain 2.Cell Res. 2010; 20 (20368734): 529-53810.1038/cr.2010.43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have limited the robustness and consistency of prior studies. In this study, we explored the binding characteristics of the six PBRM1 BDs, both individually and in tandem, to histone peptides and to intact nucleosomes. We assessed the impact of kidney cancerâassociated mutations in the context of individual and tandem BDs, and full-length PBRM1 to highlight regions within the BDs that are critical for PBRM1 function. We observed selective binding of individual BDs as well as the influence of neighboring BD on peptides and nucleosome interactions, together suggesting a unique role for BD4. We compiled PBRM1 mutations observed in kidney cancers from several studies, including The Cancer Genome Atlas KIRC project (19Hakimi A.A. Ostrovnaya I. Reva B. Schultz N. Chen Y.-B. Gonen M. Liu H.

We focused on the nonsynonymous missense mutations (17% of total) based on the hypothesis that these mutations would be located in cancer-relevant functional domains in PBRM1. In contrast to frameshift mutations that were distributed throughout the gene, missense mutations tended to cluster within the BDs, specifically in and proximal to BD4 (p < 0.05 by permutation) (Fig. 1A). BD4 harbored five missense mutations, including two at highly conserved amino acids (Y580C and N601K). No missense mutations were identified in BD3. One mutation was identified in BD2, I252R, a nonconserved residue. We then evaluated the amino acid sequence conservation between the six PBRM1 BDs. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed (23Sokal R. Michener C. A statistical method for evaluating systematic relationships.Univ. Kans. Sci. Bull. 1958; 38: 1409-1438Google Scholar). The comparison included the BDs from SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCA2 (BRM), the other BD-containing components of the SWI/SNF complex. The BDs segregated into three clusters (Fig. 1B). BD2 and BD4 shared the greatest sequence similarity (50.7%) and grouped together with the SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 BDs. BD1 clustered with BD3 (42.3%); BD5 clustered with BD2 (39%) and BD4 (42%). BD6 was most distinct, exhibiting less than 26% sequence similarity to the other BDs. We next identified those amino acids that influenced clustering (Fig. 1C). Alignment of the six BDs revealed that seven amino acids were conserved across all BDs. Among these was a tyrosine residue within the AB-loop that is the site of a missense mutation in ccRCC (Y580C in BD4). Because BD6 shares the least sequence similarity to the other BDs, we focused on residues conserved between BDs 1â5. Residues conserved between these BDs are enriched in the ZA-loop and termini of helix Î±B, regions that help form the hydrophobic pocket. Amino acids that distinguish BD2 and BD4 were clustered within the ZA-loop and Î±A and Î±C helices. To determine how amino acids may direct the function of each BD, we mapped conserved amino acids onto a published NMR solution structure of the BD2/H3K14ac complex (Fig. 1D) (18Charlop-Powers Z. Zeng L. Zhang Q. Zhou M.-M. Structural insights into selective histone H3 recognition by the human Polybromo bromodomain 2.Cell Res. 2010; 20 (20368734): 529-53810.1038/cr.2010.43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Conserved residues cluster in and around the BD binding pocket. Three of the residues shared uniquely by BD2 and BD4 reside within the region of Î±C helix that forms the hydrophobic pocket. These residues are proximal to the conserved asparagine that likely mediates interaction with acetylated H3K14 and have been shown to help establish histone interactions (18Charlop-Powers Z. Zeng L. Zhang Q. Zhou M.-M. Structural insights into selective histone H3 recognition by the human Polybromo bromodomain 2.Cell Res. 2010; 20 (20368734): 529-53810.1038/cr.2010.43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two amino acids shared by BD2 and BD4 are in the ZA-loop predicted to be near the N terminus of the histone tail. In contrast, BD1, BD3, and BD5 share fewer conserved residues at regions that interface with the histone tail (Fig. S1), suggesting that these BDs may have weaker binding interactions with histone tails. To test for an association between sequence composition and histone recognition, we examined the binding of each BD to histone PTMs using a microarray platform. The histone microarrays consist of >200 synthetic peptides reflecting the core histone tails (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) modified with one or more known PTMs (24Rothbart S.B. Krajewski K. Strahl B.D. Fuchs S.M. Peptide microarrays to interrogate the âhistone code.â.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 512 (22910205): 107-13510.1016/B978-0-12-391940-3.00006-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). GST-tagged BDs were incubated with the arrays, and interactions were quantified with a fluorescent anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2A). Binding was rank-ordered relative to the highest signal in the array. BD2 and BD4 recognized a similar pattern of H3 PTMs, with a marked preference for peptides containing H3K14ac alone or in combination with other acetylated amino acids. Acetylation at other sites was not associated with BD2 or BD4 binding. BD1, BD3, and BD5 weakly interacted with H3K14ac modified peptides when in combination with H3K4ac and H3K18ac. Minimal binding of BD2 and BD4 to the unmodified H3 tail was detected, demonstrating that binding is to the histone tail modification, not the tail itself. BDs 1 and 5 weakly bound to various monoacetylated peptides, including H3K18ac. However, this binding intensity was similar to that of the unmodified tail. BD6 demonstrated minimal binding to all peptides. The overall pattern of binding to modified H3 histone tail peptides reflected their sequence conservation (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the BD sequence determines the function of the individual domains. Because the interaction of BDs with histone tail peptides may only partially reflect how histone tails are recognized in the context of an intact nucleosome (4Filippakopoulos P. Picaud S. Mangos M.

We used a range of enzyme concentrations to ensure that the pool of nucleosomes would broadly reflect chromatin states (Fig. S2A). Purified nucleosomes contained all four core histones (Fig. 2C). Bead-bound GST-tagged BDs were incubated with the cellular nucleosomes, and enriched histone PTMs were detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D). We found that BD2 and BD4 strongly interacted with nucleosomes, whereas BD5 only weakly bound nucleosomes. No binding was detected for BD1, BD3, and BD6. We then identified the PTMs that were enriched on BD-bound nucleosomes (Fig. 2E). Because individual nucleosomes likely harbor multiple PTMs, observed PTMs may directly or indirectly mediate BD binding. Nucleosomes bound by BD2 and BD4 were preferentially marked by H3K14ac, consistent with the peptide results. Bound nucleosomes were also enriched for H3K4me3. Because binding to H3K4me3 was not observed on the peptide array, we hypothesized that BD-bound nucleosomes harbor both H3K14ac and H3K4me3, with binding primarily mediated by acetylation. The use of mononucleosomes excluded the possibility that binding was mediated by neighboring nucleosomes. To directly test the effect of each PTM on nucleosome binding, we then used unmodified recombinant nucleosomes, those exclusively modified by either H3K14ac or H3K4me3 (Fig. 2F, Fig. S2B). No BD bound the unmodified nucleosomes. Only BD2 and BD4 bound nucleosomes harboring H3K14ac. Limited binding to H3K4me3-marked nucleosomes was also detected. Because binding to H3K4me3 was unexpected, we assessed the relative binding affinity to H3K14ac and H3K4me3 by varying the concentration of NaCl in the binding reaction (Fig. 2G). In contrast to unmodified nucleosomes for which interaction was completely disrupted by 150 mm NaCl, BD2 and BD4 interaction with H3K14-acetylated and H3K4-trimethylated nucleosomes persisted to 300 mm NaCl, although increased binding to H3K14ac-modified was observed. Taken together, these data demonstrate that, in vitro, BD2 and BD4 are able to interact with nucleosomes marked with a wide range of PTMs but are mediated through a direct interaction with H3K14ac and/or H3K4me3. BDs often exist in tandem with other chromatin reader domains to facilitate binding specificity (4Filippakopoulos P. Picaud S. Mangos M. Keates T. Lambert J.P. Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Felletar I.

We hypothesized that neighboring PBRM1 BDs would influence BD2 and BD4 binding. To explore this idea, we generated and FPLC purified five overlapping tandem BDs (Fig. 3A). Circular dichroism (CD) demonstrated similar structures for all single and tandem BDs (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the results from single BDs, only tandem domains that included either BD2 or BD4 bound nucleosomes (Fig. 3C). BD5â6 failed to interact with nucleosomes. Similar to that observed with the individual BDs, the tandem BDs preferentially recognized nucleosomes harboring H3K14ac and H3K4me3 (Fig. 3D). Intriguingly, the combination of BD1 with BD2 and BD5 with BD4 enhanced binding to nucleosomes, whereas the combination of BD3 with either BD2 or BD4 decreased binding. We then directly compared nucleosome binding of individual BDs with tandem BDs (Fig. 3E). We found that BD1â2 showed enhanced binding over BD2 alone, and BD4â5 showed enhanced binding over BD4 alone (Fig. 3F). As BD1 and BD5 do not bind nucleosomes individually (Fig. 2D), the enhanced binding of BD1â2 and BD4â5 suggests that the BDs must cooperate to facilitate histone interactions. Strikingly, the addition of BD3 to either BD2 or BD4 decreased binding below that observed with the individual BD. As before, we then used recombinant nucleosomes to assess binding to nucleosomes exclusively modified by H3K14ac or H3K4me3 (Fig. 3G). At low salt concentrations, BD1â2 and 4â5 bound H3K14ac, H3K4me3, and unmodified nucleosomes. BD2â3 and 3â4 weakly bound H3K14ac and H3K4me3. Similar to our previous findings, binding of either BD2 or BD4 to H3K14ac-marked nucleosomes was attenuated by the presence of BD3. Neither BD3 containing tandem BD bound unmodified nucleosomes. BD5â6 failed to bind any nucleosomes. As before, we varied the salt concentration in the binding reaction (Fig. 3H). Increased NaCl fully disrupted BD4â5 binding to the unmodified nucleosomes. Binding to H3K14ac- and H3K4me3-modified nucleosomes persisted at high salt concentration, although more binding to H3K14ac was evident. These data suggest that, in vitro, BD4â5 can bind either H3K14ac or H3K4me3, although binding to H3K14ac is favored. We unexpectedly observed that several of the PBRM1 BDs interact with H4 tail peptides, with the degree of interaction inversely related to acetylation state (Fig. 4A). Assayed on the peptide microarray, BDs 1â5 interacted with the unmodified and monoacetylated N terminus of H4 to various degrees. Limited binding by BDs 1â5 to diacetylated H4K5+K12 and H4K8+K16 was detected. Binding was not detected to triacetylated and tetraacetylated H4 tails. Unlike binding to the H3 tail, the BD binding patterns for H4 did not correspond to sequence conservation, suggesting these interactions may occur outside of the conserved binding pocket. To determine whether nucleosomes bound by the BDs demonstrated selective enrichment for specific H4 tail modifications, we examined three histone H4 modifications: H4K5ac, H4K16ac, and tetraacetylated H4 (H4K5ac, K8ac, K12ac,"
https://openalex.org/W2858779744,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are unique populations of cells that can self-renew and generate different cancer cell lineages. Although CSCs are believed to be a promising target for novel therapies, the specific mechanisms by which these putative therapeutics could intervene are less clear. Nitric oxide (NO) is a biological mediator frequently up-regulated in tumors and has been linked to cancer aggressiveness. Here, we search for targets of NO that could explain its activity. We find that it directly affects the stability and function of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), known to drive the stemness of lung cancer cells. We demonstrated that NO promotes the CSC-regulatory activity of Oct4 through a mechanism that involves complex formation between Oct4 and the scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1). In the absence of NO, Oct4 forms a molecular complex with Cav-1, which promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of Oct4. NO promotes Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Cav-1 at tyrosine 14, disrupting the Cav-1:Oct4 complex. Site-directed mutagenesis and computational modeling studies revealed that the hydroxyl moiety at tyrosine 14 of Cav-1 is crucial for its interaction with Oct4. Both removal of the hydroxyl via mutation to phenylalanine and phosphorylation lead to an increase in binding free energy (ÎGbind) between Oct4 and Cav-1, destabilizing the complex. Together, these results unveiled a novel mechanism of CSC regulation through NO-mediated stabilization of Oct4, a key stem cell transcription factor, and point to new opportunities to design CSC-related therapeutics. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are unique populations of cells that can self-renew and generate different cancer cell lineages. Although CSCs are believed to be a promising target for novel therapies, the specific mechanisms by which these putative therapeutics could intervene are less clear. Nitric oxide (NO) is a biological mediator frequently up-regulated in tumors and has been linked to cancer aggressiveness. Here, we search for targets of NO that could explain its activity. We find that it directly affects the stability and function of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), known to drive the stemness of lung cancer cells. We demonstrated that NO promotes the CSC-regulatory activity of Oct4 through a mechanism that involves complex formation between Oct4 and the scaffolding protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1). In the absence of NO, Oct4 forms a molecular complex with Cav-1, which promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of Oct4. NO promotes Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Cav-1 at tyrosine 14, disrupting the Cav-1:Oct4 complex. Site-directed mutagenesis and computational modeling studies revealed that the hydroxyl moiety at tyrosine 14 of Cav-1 is crucial for its interaction with Oct4.

These cells have characteristics similar to those of normal stem cells, in particular, an ability to self-renew and generate different cell lineages (3Shackleton M.

Such ability is believed to facilitate the progression of cancers and their aggressive behaviors (4Lobo N.A. Shimono Y. Qian D. Clarke M.F. The biology of cancer stem cells.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Increasing evidence also suggests that CSCs possess several virulent features that make them invasive and resistant to chemo/radiotherapy (5Chang J.C.

The successful establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells that form fully differentiated cells has revealed that the differentiated cells retain the capacity to revert to stem cells, and certain regulatory transcription factors, such as octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), Nanog, c-Myc, Klf4, Sox2, and Lin28, are essential for somatic cell reprogramming (6Takahashi K.

Likewise, cancer dedifferentiation is evident and has been linked to cancer progression and aggressive behaviors (8Gabbert H. Wagner R. Moll R. Gerharz C.-D.

Similar to somatic cell reprogramming, tumor dedifferentiation is a reversal of cell development to a more immature state. Such discovery has led to an interest in uncovering the origin of CSCs and targeting these cells for therapy. In cancer, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog have been shown to associate with the stemness of cells by sustaining the level of stem cellârelated proteins, such as CD133, ALDH1A1, and ABCG2 (10Liu A. Yu X. Liu S. Pluripotency transcription factors and cancer stem cells: small genes make a big difference.Chin. J. Cancer. 2013; 32 (23419197): 483-487PubMed Google Scholar). Induced expression of the Oct4 gene and transmembrane delivery of the Oct4 protein were shown to induce the dedifferentiation of melanoma cells to CSC-like cells with a strong reduction in melanocytic markers and acquisition of spheroid-forming ability (11Kumar S.M.

In lung cancer, the expression of Oct4 correlates with aggressive behaviors and CSC properties (12Karoubi G. Gugger M. Schmid R. Dutly A.

In recent years, the role of the microenvironment in cancer progression has increasingly been recognized (18Quail D.F. Joyce J.A.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator frequently up-regulated in lung cancer microenvironment (19Liu P.F. Zhao D.H. Qi Y. Wang J.G. Zhao M. Xiao K. Xie L.X.

Cav-1 is required for the formation of caveolae as well as its function, including endocytosis, lipid homeostasis, and signal transduction (28Liu P. Rudick M. Anderson R.G.

Furthermore, the co-expression of Cav-1 and NOS in certain cancers has been reported (33Yokomori H. Oda M. Yoshimura K. Nomura M. Wakabayashi G. Kitajima M. Ishii H. Elevated expression of caveolin-1 at protein and mRNA level in human cirrhotic liver: relation with nitric oxide.J.

In addition, the caveolin-scaffolding domain of Cav-1 exhibits proteinâprotein interactions with NOS, which resulted in a decrease of the cellular function of NOS (34Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J.

However, detailed mechanisms and their cross-talk remain to be investigated. Oct4 is a key CSC mediator that promotes the expression of other CSC factors, and its introduction into cancer cells induces cancer stemness (36Chen Y.C. Hsu H.S. Chen Y.W. Tsai T.H. How C.K. Wang C.Y. Hung S.C. Chang Y.L. Tsai M.L. Lee Y.Y. Ku H.H. Chiou S.H. Oct-4 expression maintained cancer stem-like properties in lung cancer-derived CD133-positive cells.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3 (18612434): e263710.1371/journal.pone.0002637Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We found that Oct4 interacts with Cav-1 and that such interaction is under the regulation of NO. In this study, we hypothesized that Cav-1 regulates the cellular level of Oct4, and therefore it influences CSCs in lung cancer via a NO-dependent mechanism. Using molecular techniques and computer modeling approaches, we demonstrated for the first time that Cav-1 forms a molecular complex with Oct4 and regulates its expression through ubiquitinâproteasome-mediated degradation. We also investigated the roles of NO in complex formation and stem properties of lung cancer cells, and unveiled a novel mechanism of CSC regulation that may lead to a better understanding of cancer cell biology under nitrosative oxidative stress conditions, which may be exploited for CSC-targeted therapy. To study the potential regulation of CSCs by NO, we first characterized the optimal dose response to NO in human lung cancer cells. Subconfluent monolayers of human lung cancer H460 cells were exposed to various concentrations of DPTA NONOate, a well-established NO donor, for 24 h, and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. At the concentration range of 0â40 Î¼m, the NO donor was found to have no significant effect on cell viability; however, at 80 Î¼m or higher, a significant decrease in cell viability was observed in the treated cells (Fig. 1A). Apoptosis and necrosis studies by Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide (PI) assays also showed that the low-dose (<40 Î¼m) DPTA NONOate had no significant effect on DNA condensation/fragmentation or nuclear PI fluorescence (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating the lack of apoptotic and necrotic cell death under the test conditions. To determine the effect of NO on the spheroid-forming ability of lung cancer cells under nonattachment conditions, H460, H23, and H292 cells were treated with 0â40 Î¼m DPTA NONOate for 5 days, and their spheroid-forming capacity was evaluated by seeding them at low density on ultralow attached plates. Time courses of spheroid formation for H460, H23, and H292 cells at 10, 20, and 40 days post-seeding are depicted in Fig. 1, D, G, and J, whereas quantitative analyses of the spheroid number and size are shown in Fig. 1, E/F, H/I, and K/L, respectively. A significant increase in the number of spheroids formed at 20 days was recorded for the H460 and H292 cells treated with 10 Î¼m or higher concentrations of DPTA NONOate, whereas a similar increase was observed for H23 cells at 5 Î¼m or higher concentrations. At 40 days post-seeding, a significant increase in spheroid number was observed in H460, H23, and H292 cells treated with 5 Î¼m or higher concentrations of NONOate. However, none of the treated cells showed a significant change in the spheroid number at 10 days. Fig. 1, F, I, and L, shows the relative spheroid size of the treated and untreated H460, H23, and H292 cells, respectively. Although the spheroid size of the treated cells was smaller than that of the control cells at 10 days, a significant increase in the spheroid size was observed at 20 and 40 days for all cell lines tested. At 20 days post-seeding, the increase in spheroid size was observed at the treatment dose of 10 Î¼m or higher concentration for H460 and H292 cells and at 5 Î¼m or higher concentration for H23 cells. At 40 days post-seeding, all cell lines exhibited a significant increase in spheroid size at the treatment dose of 5 Î¼m or higher concentration. These results indicate that nontoxic concentrations of DPTA NONOate promote spheroid formation of lung cancer H460, H23, and H292 cells. Stem cell markers such as CD133, ALDH1A1, and ABCG2 and stemness transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog are commonly accepted as key drivers or markers of CSCs (10Liu A. Yu X. Liu S. Pluripotency transcription factors and cancer stem cells: small genes make a big difference.Chin. J. Cancer. 2013; 32 (23419197): 483-487PubMed Google Scholar). We used these proteins to verify the CSC-inducing effect of NO in the tested lung cells. H460 cells were cultivated in the presence or absence of DPTA NONOate (5â40 Î¼m) for 1, 3, and 5 days, and the expression level of these markers was assessed by Western blotting. Fig. 2, AâC, shows a dose- and time-dependent expression of CD133, ABCG2, ALDH1A1, and Oct4 in response to the NO treatment. No significant changes in the expression level of these proteins were observed 1 day after the treatment (Fig. 2D). At 3 days, an increased expression of Oct4 was seen at the treatment dose of 10 Î¼m, whereas CD133 expression was up-regulated at 20 and 40 Î¼m (Fig. 2E). Surprisingly, we observed a reduction in Sox2 expression at 3 days after the treatment with 20 and 40 Î¼m DPTA NONOate. Fig. 2F further shows the up-regulation of CD133, ALDH1A1, and Oct4 at 5 days post-treatment with 10 Î¼m or higher concentrations of DPTA NONOate and a decrease in Sox2 expression at the dose of 10 Î¼m or higher. To confirm the above finding, we performed immunofluorescence experiments assessing the expression of CSC markers CD133 and Oct4 in H460 cells following NO exposure. The cells were treated with 40 Î¼m DPTA NONOate for 5 days and analyzed for CD133 and Oct4 expression by immunofluorescence staining. Consistent with the Western blotting results, the immunofluorescence results indicate the up-regulation of CD133 and Oct4 expression in the treated lung cancer cells (Fig. 2G). The expression levels of stemness-associated proteins in response to the NO donor treatment were also assessed in H23 and H292 cells. Fig. 2, H and J, shows that treatment of H23 cells with DPTA NONOate for 5 days induced an up-regulation of CD133 and ABCG2 at the treatment dose of 5 Î¼m or higher, whereas an increase in Oct4 and ALDH1A1 was observed at the dose of 20 Î¼m or higher. Fig. 2, I and K, shows the results of NO treatment in H292 cells. A significant increase in Oct4 expression was seen at the treatment dose of 5 Î¼m or higher and at 20 Î¼m or higher for CD133, ABCG2, and ALDH1A1. These results along with the spheroid formation results support the regulatory role of NO in controlling the stemness of lung cancer cells. Two different passages of H460 cells treated with DPTA NONOate and their nontreated counterparts were subjected to microarray analysis as mentioned under âExperimental procedures.â The gene probe list of the chip is shown in Table S1. The CU-DREAM (37Aporntewan C. Mutirangura A. Connection up- and down-regulation expression analysis of microarrays (CU-DREAM): a physiogenomic discovery tool.Asian Biomed. 2011; 5: 257-26210.5372/1905-7415.0502.034Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) program was used to analyze the raw data, and gene probes with significant differences (p < 0.05) were chosen for further evaluation using the Bioconductor R statistic program. The heat map generated from the Bioconductor R statistics program (Fig. 3A) illustrates the intensity detected for different gene probes. H460 control cell samples were labeled control 1 and control 2, and the DPTA NONOateâtreated cells were labeled as DPTA NONOate 1 and DPTA NONOate 2. The high-resolution microarray heat map image is available in Fig. S1. The computer program bracket links two samples that have similar genotypes. As expected, control 1 and control 2 displayed expression profiles distinct from those of NO-treated 1 and 2. The probed gene with significant differences (p < 0.01) (Table S2) was selected as the next interpretation. Although the mRNA level of Oct4 analyzed by microarray in NO-treated cells was not significantly altered (Table S2), the Oct4 protein expression was significantly up-regulated (Fig. 2), suggesting that the NO may not regulate Oct4 up-regulation via transcriptional means but may affect the protein stability. The genes displayed significant differences (p < 0.01) (Table S2) between treatments, and control groups were subjected for Gene Ontology (GO) using Enrichr (an integrative web-based and mobile software application; http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.

Fig. 3B shows the analyzed results by Enrichr-EhEA-2016 indicating the TF names and PubMed IDs of ChIP-seq experiments; a list of NO-mediated gene expression changes that matched the gene list in each ChIP-seq; and the p value calculated from matched and unmatched genes in each ChIP-seq. The results showed that genes altered by NO treatment are the regulated target genes of various TFs, including Ap2-Î±, Ets1, Jar1d1A, Oct4, Myc, Sall4, Klf4, E2A, Top2B, Maf, and Stat3 (Fig. 3B). To verify the effect of NO in regulation of CSCs through Oct4 activity, the Oct4-targeted genes were analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3C). The mRNA expression of COLEC12, LAMP1, MYH3, PER3, ROS26, and UBE2S genes were up-regulated after treatment with NO in a concentration-dependent manner. The RT-PCR results were consistent with the results from the microarray analysis. Fig. 3D indicates the selected NO-mediated gene alteration (only genes of which their mRNA expression is controlled by Oct4) and its primer sequences.

The characterization of PfATP4 has been hampered by the inability thus far to achieve its functional expression in a heterologous system. Here, we optimized a membrane ATPase assay to probe the function of PfATP4 and its chemical sensitivity. We found that cipargamin inhibited the Na+-dependent ATPase activity present in P. falciparum membranes from WT parasites and that its potency was reduced in cipargamin-resistant PfATP4-mutant parasites. The cipargamin-sensitive fraction of membrane ATPase activity was inhibited by all 28 of the compounds in the âMalaria Boxâ shown previously to disrupt ion regulation in P. falciparum in a cipargamin-like manner. This is consistent with PfATP4 being the direct target of these compounds. Characterization of the cipargamin-sensitive ATPase activity yielded data consistent with PfATP4 being a Na+ transporter that is sensitive to physiologically relevant perturbations of pH, but not of [K+] or [Ca2+]. With an apparent Km for ATP of 0.2 mm and an apparent Km for Na+ of 16â17 mm, the protein is predicted to operate at below its half-maximal rate under normal physiological conditions, allowing the rate of Na+ efflux to increase in response to an increase in cytosolic [Na+]. In membranes from a cipargamin-resistant PfATP4-mutant line, the apparent Km for Na+ is slightly elevated.

https://openalex.org/W2817199556,"Purpose Rosuvastatin calcium (ROSCa) is a poorly soluble drug with bioavailability not exceeding 20%. Decreasing the particle size may enhance its solubility, dissolution rate and bioavailability. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to prepare ROSCa nanoparticles by wet milling technique using planetary ball mill. The codesign between formulation and stabilization of nanoparticles was studied to achieve both high dissolution as well as bioavailability. Methodology ROSCa nanosuspensions was prepared by wet milling technique using planetary ball mill, by applying milling ball size of 0.1 mm at speed of 800 rpm for 3 cycles each cycle composed of 10 minutes. HPMC, PVP k-30, pluronic F-127, Tween 80 and PEG 6000 were used as stabilizers. The nanosuspensions were then freeze-dried, and the dried nanoparticles were evaluated for particle size, zeta potential, in-vitro dissolution test, XRPD and in-vivo study. Results ROSCa nanoparticles stabilized with 10% PVP (P3) had a good stability with smallest particle size, which in turn enhanced the dissolution rate. The particle size of the leading formula was 461.8 Â± 16.68 nm with zeta potential of -31.8 Â± 7.22 mV compared to untreated drug that has a particle size of 618Î¼m. The percent of ROSCa dissolved after 1 hour enhanced significantly which reached 72% and 58.25% for leading nanoparticle formula and untreated ROSCa, respectively (P < 0.05). The in-vivo study of ROSCa from the leading nanoparticle formula showed a significant enhancement in the Cmax after 2 h (82.35 ng/ml) compared to 9.2 ng/ml for untreated drug. Conclusion Wet milling technique is a successful method to prepare ROSCa nanoparticles. From different stabilizer used, PVP (10%) was able to produce stable nanoparticle with small particle size which significantly enhance the dissolution rate and pharmacokinetics parameters of ROSCa."
https://openalex.org/W2834279661,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ cycling is governed by the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a). Abnormal SR Ca2+ cycling is thought to be the primary cause of Ca2+ alternans that can elicit ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. Although alterations in either RyR2 or SERCA2a function are expected to affect SR Ca2+ cycling, whether and to what extent altered RyR2 or SERCA2a function affects Ca2+ alternans is unclear. Here, we employed a gain-of-function RyR2 variant (R4496C) and the phospholamban-knockout (PLB-KO) mouse model to assess the effect of genetically enhanced RyR2 or SERCA2a function on Ca2+ alternans. Confocal Ca2+ imaging revealed that RyR2-R4496C shortened SR Ca2+ release refractoriness and markedly suppressed rapid pacingâinduced Ca2+ alternans. Interestingly, despite enhancing RyR2 function, intact RyR2-R4496C hearts exhibited no detectable spontaneous SR Ca2+ release events during pacing. Unlike for RyR2, enhancing SERCA2a function by ablating PLB exerted a relatively minor effect on Ca2+ alternans in intact hearts expressing RyR2 WT or a loss-of-function RyR2 variant, E4872Q, that promotes Ca2+ alternans. Furthermore, partial SERCA2a inhibition with 3 Î¼m 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) also had little impact on Ca2+ alternans, whereas strong SERCA2a inhibition with 10 Î¼m tBHQ markedly reduced the amplitude of Ca2+ transients and suppressed Ca2+ alternans in intact hearts. Our results demonstrate that enhanced RyR2 function suppresses Ca2+ alternans in the absence of spontaneous Ca2+ release and that RyR2, but not SERCA2a, is a key determinant of Ca2+ alternans in intact working hearts, making RyR2 an important therapeutic target for cardiac alternans.

For instance, the CPVT-causing, gain-of-function (GOF) RyR2 mutation R4496C has been shown to reduce the refractoriness of SR Ca2+ release in the mouse trabecular muscle (39Ferrantini C. Coppini R.

Therefore, it remains unclear whether enhanced RyR2 function suppresses or promotes Ca2+ alternans. These seemingly conflicting observations also raise an important question of why enhanced RyR2 activity and shortened refractoriness of SR Ca2+ release are unable to suppress Ca2+ alternans in the isolated RyR2 R4496C mutant cells. One possible explanation is that enhanced RyR2 activity would increase the propensity for spontaneous Ca2+ release (SCR), such as Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ waves, which in turn would promote Ca2+ alternans (25Qu Z.

SR Ca2+ reuptake, another important aspect of SR Ca2+ cycling, is also believed to play an important role in Ca2+ alternans.

Interestingly, atrial overexpression of SERCA2a has little effect on cardiac alternans (53Nassal M.M. Wan X. Laurita K.R. Cutler M.J.

Hence, the effect of altered SERCA2a activity on Ca2+ alternans is complex and variable, and the relative contribution of altered RyR2 and SERCA2a activity to the genesis of Ca2+ alternans is also unclear. In the present study, we carried out laser-scanning confocal Ca2+ imaging of cardiomyocytes in intact WT and RyR2 mutant hearts that exhibited little spontaneous Ca2+ release. We assessed the impact of the GOF RyR2 R4496C mutation on SR Ca2+ release refractoriness and Ca2+ alternans and the effects of inhibiting or enhancing SERCA2a activity on Ca2+ alternans in intact hearts. We demonstrate that genetically enhancing RyR2 function shortens Ca2+ release refractoriness and suppresses Ca2+ alternans in intact hearts without producing spontaneous SR Ca2+ release. We also demonstrate that genetically enhancing SERCA2a function by phospholamban (PLB) ablation had a relatively minor impact on Ca2+ alternans in intact hearts. Furthermore, we found that modest inhibition of SERCA2a function also had little impact on Ca2+ alternans in intact hearts. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the activity of RyR2, but not SERCA2a, is a major determinant of Ca2+ alternans in intact working mouse hearts. We have recently shown that genetically suppressing RyR2 function lengthens the refractoriness of SR Ca2+ release in intact hearts (32Zhong X. Sun B. Vallmitjana A. Mi T. Guo W. Ni M. Wang R. Guo A.

It derives mainly from the root and rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. Although the role of P. cuspidatum root in angiogenesis has been reported, the active chemical or chemicals responsible for such function is not known. Here, polydatin was proposed to bind VEGF, which therefore altered the functions of VEGF in angiogenesis. Several lines of evidence supported the pharmaceutical effects of polydatin in VEGF-induced angiogenesis. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, polydatin inhibited VEGF-stimulated cell proliferation, cell migration, and tube formation. Moreover, polydatin showed suppressive effects on the subintestinal vessel formation in zebrafish embryos. In signaling cascades, polydatin application attenuated VEGF-induced phosphorylations of VEGF receptor 2 and JNK. Moreover, the VEGF-induced phosphorylations of Akt, eNOS, and Erk were significantly decreased in the presence of polydatin. In parallel, the formation of reactive oxygen species, triggered by VEGF, was markedly decreased under polydatin application. Thus, our results supported the angiogenic roles of polydatin, as well as its signaling mechanism in blocking VEGF-mediated responses.

Although histopathological findings associated with this condition have been reported, only limited data is available on health variables with clinical application. The objectives of this study were to 1) to compare morphometrics, clinicopathological variables, and immune functions of DTs to a group of apparently healthy loggerhead turtles to better understand the pathophysiology of the condition and 2) to assess health parameters in live debilitated turtles as they recovered during rehabilitation in order to identify potential prognostic indicators. We examined and sampled 43 DTs stranded from North Carolina to Florida for 47 health variables using standardized protocols to further characterize the condition. DTs were grouped into categories of severity of the condition, and those that survived were sampled at four time points through rehabilitation. All groups and time points were compared among DTs and to clinically healthy loggerhead turtles. Compared to healthy turtles, DTs had significantly lower body condition index, packed cell volume (PCV), total white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocytes, glucose (Glc), total protein, all protein fractions as determined by electrophoresis, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), Ca:P ratio, potassium (K), lymphocyte proliferation, and greater heterophil toxicity and left-shifting, uric acid (UA), aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lysozyme, and respiratory burst. From admission to recovery, hematology and plasma chemistry data improved as expected. The most informative prognostic indicators, as determined by correlations with a novel severity indicator (based on survival times), were plastron concavity, P, albumin, total solids, UA, lymphocyte proliferation, WBC, K, Glc, Ca:P, and PCV.

Here, we examined the role of the Bcl2-associated athanogene (BAG) family of Hsp70-specific nucleotide-exchange factors in the biogenesis and functional correction of genetic variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) whose mutations cause cystic fibrosis (CF). We show that siRNA-mediated silencing of BAG1 and -3, two BAG members linked to the clearance of misfolded proteins via the UPS and autophagy pathways, respectively, leads to functional correction of F508del-CFTR and other disease-associated CFTR variants. BAG3 silencing was the most effective, leading to improved F508del-CFTR stability, trafficking, and restoration of cell-surface function, both alone and in combination with the FDA-approved CFTR corrector, VX-809. We also found that the BAG3 silencingâmediated correction of F508del-CFTR restores the autophagy pathway, which is defective in F508del-CFTRâexpressing cells, likely because of the maladaptive stress response in CF pathophysiology. These results highlight the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting the cellular chaperone system to improve the functional folding of CFTR variants contributing to CF and possibly other protein-misfoldingâassociated diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2871777065,"The objective of this study was to determine the impact of postnatal dexamethasone treatment on the neonatal unit on the school age lung function of very prematurely born children. Children born prior to 29 weeks of gestational age had been entered into a randomised trial of two methods of neonatal ventilation (United Kingdom Oscillation Study). They had comprehensive lung function measurements at 11 to 14 years of age. One hundred and seventy-nine children born at a mean gestational age of 26.9 (range 23-28) weeks were assessed at 11 to 14 years; 50 had received postnatal dexamethasone. Forced expiratory flow at 75% (FEF75), 50%, 25% and 25-75% of the expired vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow and forced vital capacity and lung volumes including total lung capacity and residual volume were assessed. Lung function outcomes were compared between children who had and had not been exposed to dexamethasone after adjustment for neonatal factors using linear mixed effects regression. After adjustment for confounders all the mean spirometry results were between 0.38 and 0.87 standard deviations lower in those exposed to dexamethasone compared to the unexposed. For example, the mean FEF75 z-score was 0.53 lower (95% CI 0.21 to 0.85). The mean lung function was lower as the number of courses of dexamethasone increased. In conclusion, postnatal dexamethasone exposure was associated with lower mean lung function at school age in children born extremely prematurely.

https://openalex.org/W2818010261,"Cell surface expression of type A GABA receptors (GABAARs) is a critical determinant of the efficacy of inhibitory neurotransmission. Pentameric GABAARs are assembled from a large pool of subunits according to precise co-assembly rules that limit the extent of receptor structural diversity. These rules ensure that particular subunits, such as Ï1 and Î²3, form functional cell surface ion channels when expressed alone in heterologous systems, whereas other brain-abundant subunits, such as Î± and Î³, are retained within intracellular compartments. Why some of the most abundant GABAAR subunits fail to form homomeric ion channels is unknown. Normally, surface expression of Î± and Î³ subunits requires co-assembly with Î² subunits via interactions between their N-terminal sequences in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, using molecular biology, imaging, and electrophysiology with GABAAR chimeras, we have identified two critical residues in the transmembrane domains of Î± and Î³ subunits, which, when substituted for their Ï1 counterparts, permit cell surface expression as homomers. Consistent with this, substitution of the Ï1 transmembrane residues for the Î± subunit equivalents reduced surface expression and altered channel gating, highlighting their importance for GABAAR trafficking and signaling. Although not ligand-gated, the formation of Î± and Î³ homomeric ion channels at the cell surface was revealed by incorporating a mutation that imparts the functional signature of spontaneous channel activity. Our study identifies two single transmembrane residues that enable homomeric GABAAR subunit cell surface trafficking and demonstrates that Î± and Î³ subunits can form functional ion channels."

We evaluated the field performance, feasibility, and acceptability of a dual rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for HIV and syphilis test in antenatal clinic settings in Nigeria.Participants were recruited at 12 antenatal clinic sites in three states of Nigeria. All consenting individuals were tested according to the national HIV testing algorithm, as well as a dual RDT, the SD BIOLINE HIV/Syphilis Duo Test (Alere, USA), in the clinic. To determine sensitivity, specificity and concordance, whole blood samples were obtained for repeat RDT performance in the laboratory, as well as reference tests for HIV and syphilis. Dual test acceptability and operational characteristics were assessed among participants and clinic staff. The prevalence of HIV among the 4,551 enrollees was 3.0% (138/4551) using the national clinic-based HIV testing algorithm. Positive and negative percent agreement of the HIV component of the dual RDT were 100.0% (95% CI 99.7-100.0) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.7-100.0) respectively, when compared with the national rapid testing algorithm. The prevalence of syphilis, using TPHA as the reference test, was low at 0.09% (4/4550). The sensitivity of the syphilis component of the dual RDT could not be calculated as no positive results were observed for patients that were positive for syphilis by TPHA. Each of the only four TPHA-positive specimens had RPR titers of 1:1 (neat), indicative of non-active syphilis. The specificity of the syphilis component of the dual RDT was 99.9% (95% CI 99.8-100.0). The dual RDT received favorable feasibility ratings among antenatal care clinic staff. Acceptability among study participants was high with most women reporting preference for rapid dual HIV/syphilis testing.The SD BIOLINE HIV/Syphilis Duo Test showed a high overall diagnostic accuracy for HIV and a high specificity for syphilis diagnosis in antenatal clinic settings.

Results Of all 65 maternal deaths in Suriname 29 (45%) were sepsis-related. These women were mostly of low socio-economic class (n = 23, 82%), of Maroon ethnicity (n = 14, 48%) and most deaths occurred postpartum (n = 21, 72%). Underlying causes were pneumonia (n = 14, 48%), wound infections (n = 3, 10%) and endometritis (n = 3, 10%). Bacterial growth was detected in 10 (50%) of the 20 available blood cultures. None of the women with sepsis as underlying cause of death received antibiotic treatment within the first hour, although most women fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of sepsis upon admission. In 27 (93%) of the 29 women from which sufficient information was available, substandard care factors were identified: delay in monitoring in 16 (59%) women, in diagnosis in 17 (63%) and in treatment in 21 (78%). Conclusion In Suriname, a middle-income country, maternal mortality could be reduced by improving early recognition and timely diagnosis of sepsis, vital signs monitoring and immediate antibiotic infusion (within the golden hour)."
https://openalex.org/W2853845647,"To determine profiles of urban runners based on socio-demographic, health, motivational, training characteristics and running-related beliefs and behaviours.Mixed, exploratory, sequential study with two stages: 1) quantitative, using an online survey; and 2) qualitative, using semi-structured interviews with runners from the previous stage. Participants were recruited via: running routes commonly attended by runners, eight races, previous databases and social media networks. The survey collected information on six dimensions: (1) socio-demographic; (2) health; (3) motivations; (4) training characteristics; (5) running-related behaviour; and (6) beliefs and perceptions about health. Profiles were identified using a two-step hierarchical clustering analysis. Subsequently, 15 interviews were conducted with participating runners across each of the identified profiles. Qualitative analysis complemented the profiles characterization, explaining motivations to start and continue running, beliefs about risk factors and injury prevention, and the physical therapist's role in rehabilitation. Statistical analysis from stage one was conducted using SPSS 22 with a confidence level of 5%. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic and content analyses.A total of 821 surveys were analysed (46% female), mean aged 36.6Â±10.0 years. Cluster analysis delineated four profiles (n = 752) according to years of running experience, weekly running volume and hours of weekly training. Profiles were named ""Beginner"" (n = 163); ""Basic"" (n = 164); ""Middle"" (n = 160) and ""Advanced"" (n = 265). Profiles were statistically different according to sex, age, years of running experience, training characteristics, previous injuries and use of technological devices (p<0.05). There were identified motivations to start and continue running. Beliefs about risk factors vary among stretching, footwear, training surface and overload. Runners identified the physical therapist as a specialist, involved in the rehabilitation process and showing empathy towards the patient. The identification of these profiles allows the generation of future prospective studies and clinical trials to evaluate risk and prognostic factors targeting specific populations of runners, with the ultimate aim of reducing running-related injury."
https://openalex.org/W2838179443,"Breast milk plays an important role in immune development in early life and protects against diseases later in life. A wide range of the beneficial effects of breast milk are attributed to human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) as well as components such as vitamin D3 (VitD3) or TGFÎ². One mechanism by which HMOs might contribute to immune homeostasis and protection against disease is the induction of a local tolerogenic milieu. In this study we investigated the effect of the HMOs 6â-sialyllactose (6âSL) and 2â-fucosyllactose (2âFL) as well as prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (GOS) on DC differentiation and maturation. Isolated CD14+ monocytes were cultured for six days in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 with or without 6âSL, 2âFL, GOS, VitD3 or TGFÎ². Additionally, immature VitD3DC, TGFÎ²DC and moDC were used as different DC types to investigate the effect of 6âSL, 2âFL and GOS on DC maturation. Surface marker expression and cytokine production was measured by flow cytometry and cytometric bead array, respectively. Unlike TGFÎ² and vitD3, the oligosaccharides 6âSL, 2âFL and GOS did not influence DC differentiation. Next, we studied the effect of 6âSL, 2âFL and GOS on maturation of moDC, VitD3DC and TGFÎ²DC that showed different profiles of HMO-binding receptors. 6âSL, 2âFL and GOS did not modulate LPS-induced maturation, even though their putative receptors were present on the different DCs types. Thus, whereas VitD3 and TGFÎ² halt DC differentiation, which results in phenotypically distinct tolerogenic DCs, 6âSL, 2âFL and GOS do not alter DC differentiation or maturation of in vitro differentiated DC types."
https://openalex.org/W2861636972,"Sperm samples used on fertilization strongly influence the in vitro production (IVP) rates. However, sperm traits behind this effect are not stated consistently until now. This study aimed to evaluate the isolated and combined effect of some sperm traits (MB: total motility before PercollÂ® gradient, MA: total motility after PercollÂ® gradient, AI: acrosome integrity, MI: membrane integrity, MP: mitochondrial membrane potential, and CR: chromatin resistance) on IVP rates. This is the first study focusing on the isolated effect of distinct traits. For this purpose, the experiment was divided in three steps. In first step, to study behavior of traits sperm samples (n = 63 batches) were analyzed and ranked based on each trait. In second step, samples ranked were selected from target ranks regions and allocated in groups of four to five batches, creating Higher and Lower groups, according to two different approaches. One aimed to form groups that differed to all sperm traits simultaneously (effect of combined traits). The other aimed to form groups that differed only to a single sperm trait while no differences were observed for the remaining traits (effect of each isolated trait). In third step, for each group successfully formed in step 2, sperm samples were individually and prospectively used for IVP. Cleavage, embryo development and blastocyst rates were recorded and compared between Higher and Lower of respective trait groups. Surprisingly, evaluation of isolated effects revealed that lower levels of MB, AI and MP resulted in higher embryo development and blastocyst rates (p<0.05), which was not observed on cleavage rate. We conclude that sperm traits strongly influence embryo development after in vitro fertilization (IVF), affecting the zygote competence to achieve blastocyst stage. Individually, levels of MB, AI or MP could be some of the key traits that may define IVP efficiency on current systems of embryo production."
https://openalex.org/W2826578344,"Clinical and subclinical mastitis affects 30% of cows and is regarded as the most significant economic burden on the dairy farm reducing milk yield and quality and increasing culling rate. A proprietary Acoustic Pulse Therapy (APT) device was developed specifically for treating dairy cows. The APT device was designed to produce deep penetrating acoustic pulses that are distributed over a large treated area at a therapeutic level. This paper presents findings from a clinical assessment of this technology for the treatment of dairy cows with subclinical and clinical mastitis. In subclinical mastitis, a group of 116 cows from 3 herds were identified with subclinical intramammary infection and enrolled in the study; 78 cows were assigned to the treatment group and 38 cows to the control group. Significant differences (P<0.001) were found where 70.5% of the cows in the treatment group returned to normal milk production, compared with only 18.4% of the control group. Daily milk yields of the treated cows increased significantly (P<0.05) and the percentage of cows with log somatic cell count under 5.6 cells/mL was significantly higher (P<0.001). Milk of the infected quarters appeared normal with lactose greater than 4.8%, but this difference was not significant. Of the treated cows with identified bacteria, 52.6% of the quarters were cured, while in the control group only 25.0% (P<0.001). Specifically, all cows identified with Escherichia coli in the treatment group were cured, with 66.6% cured with no intervention in the control. Spontaneous cure of glands infected with coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) and Streptococci was low while treatment successfully increased the cure of CNS from 13.3% to 53.8% and that of Streptococci from 18.2% to 36.4%. Of the 4 cows identified with Staphylococcus aureus, 3 were cured. The clinical mastitis study group included 29 infected cows that were submitted either to a gold standard antibiotic treatment subgroup of 16 cows (n = 16) or to an APT treatment subgroup of 13 cows (n = 13). A cure of 18.7% was shown for the antibiotic treatment, of which logSCC returned to <5.6 cell/mL and 56.2% were culled. A cure of 76.9% was shown for the APT treatment with only one cow culled (7.7%)."
https://openalex.org/W2873713174,"Background Implementation of risk-based prostate cancer screening has been proposed as a means to reduce the harms of PSA screening. Little is known, however, about the factors influencing menâs decision to attend a prostate cancer screening based on a risk assessment. Method We sent postal invitations with a login to a survey to 10.000 men, three months before invitation to a risk-based prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer specific worry, prostate cancer-related knowledge, health behaviour, and health related quality of life were used as predictors of subsequent participation. Participation to risk-based prostate cancer screening was defined as providing a blood sample for the STHLM3 trial, a study evaluating a risk-based model that predicts the risk for aggressive prostate cancer. Results With a response rate of 20%, 1.347 men (70%) participated in ensuing risk-based prostate cancer screening three months later whereas 568 men (30%) declined participation in the STHLM3-study. These decliners reported less worry and feeling less vulnerable to prostate cancer and responded âDo not knowâ more often than participants when asked questions about prostate cancer knowledge. Participants reported greater benefits of prostate testing (p = 0.0005), less barriers to prostate testing (p<0.0001), and higher intention to attend prostate cancer testing (p<0.0001) than decliners. Finally, participants reported better overall health than decliners (p<0.0001). Conclusion Prostate cancer worry, PC knowledge, health behaviour and quality of life were identified as predictors of participation in risk-based prostate cancer screening. Targeting these predictors may improve the participation rates. These results can inform policymaking for future population-based prostate cancer screening programs that should address potential worry in men and lack of knowledge about prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2951900754,"In this study, we present a scheme for the reconstruction of cellular morphology and the inference of mechanical forces in the early C. elegans embryo. We have developed and bench-marked a morphological reconstruction scheme that transforms flourescence-based in vivo images of membranes into a point cloud of smoothed surface patches, which facilitates an accurate estimation of membrane curvatures and the angles between membranes. Assuming an isotropic and homogeneous distribution of tensions along individual membranes, we infer a pattern of forces that are 7% deviated from force balance at edges, and 10% deviated from the Young-Laplace relation across membranes. We demonstrate the stability of our inference scheme via a sensitivity analysis, and the reproducibility of our image-analysis and force inference pipelines."
https://openalex.org/W2816635606,"Objectives Our aim was to prospectively determine whether quantitative computed tomography (CT) scores, consisting of simplified indices for liver remodeling and attenuation, may predict liver fibrosis in abdominal CT scans. Materials and methods This cross-sectional, prospective study was approved by the local IRB (Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern). Written informed consent was given from all patients undergoing study-MR exams. Between 02/16 and 05/17, four different liver fibrosis scores (CRL-R = caudate-right-lobe ratio, LIMV-, LIMA- and LIMVA-fibrosis score, with âLIMâ for liver imaging morphology, âVâ for liver vein diameter and âAâ for attenuation) were calculated in 1534 consecutive abdominal CT scans, excluding patients with prior liver surgery and liver metastasis. Patients were invited to undergo magnetic resonance (MR) elastography as the non-invasive gold standard to evaluate liver fibrosis. MR elastography shear modulus â¥2.8 kPa was defined as beginning liver fibrosis, while â¥3.5 kPa was defined as significant liver fibrosis (which would correspond to fibrosis stage F2 or higher in histology). Cutoff values, sensitivities and specificities obtained from the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were then calculated in 141 patients who followed the invitation for MR elastography. To mitigate selection bias, prevalence was estimated in the screened total population (n = 1534) by applying the cutoff values with sensitivities and specificities calculated in the MR elastography sub-group. Positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were then calculated. Results Fibrosis scores including liver vein attenuation LIMA-FS and LIMVA-FS showed higher areas under the ROC curves (0.96â0.97) than CRL-R (0.82) to detect significant liver fibrosis, while LIMV-FS showed good performance as well (0.92). The prevalence-corrected PPV were 29% for CRL-R, 70% for LIMV-FS, 76% for LIMA-FS and 82% for LIMVA-FS. Conclusion CT fibrosis scores, notably LIMA-FS and LIMVA-FS, may predict significant liver fibrosis on routine abdominal CT scans."
https://openalex.org/W2847268589,"Background Icariin, a major active flavonoid glucoside, is widely used for the treatment of bone injury and rebuilding in the clinic because of its roles in suppressing osteoblastogenesis and promoting osteogenesis. The senescence-accelerated mouse SAMP6 was accepted as a useful murine model to reveal the mechanism of senile osteoporosis and the therapeutic mechanism of drug activity. However, little is known about the characteristics of SAMP6 osteoblasts and the associated regulatory roles of icariin. Methods We isolated and cultured osteoblasts from SAMP6 or SAMR1 mice and compared their proliferation, migration, and differentiation by performing the CCK-8 assay, cell counting assay, EdU staining, cell cycle analysis, ALP staining and activity measurement, Alizarin red staining, and RT-qPCR analysis to measure the levels of osteoblast markers, including RUNX2, Colla1 and Oc. To assess the effects of icariin on BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation, after BMP-2 treatment, osteoblast markers were analyzed by RT-qPCR and semi-quantitative Western blotting. The effects of icariin on connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were measured by RT-qPCR. shRNA targeting CTGF mRNA was employed to knockdown its expression level in osteoblasts. Results The SAMP6 osteoblasts presented decreased the development and differentiation activity compared with SAMR1 osteoblasts, indicating that they are the potential mechanisms underlying age-associated disease. Moreover, SAMP6 osteoblasts presented upregulated CTGF compared with SAMR1 osteoblasts. Icariin enhanced BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation by downregulating CTGF expression, which tightly regulates osteoblast differentiation. By downregulating CTGF, icariin treatment upregulated phosphate-Smad1/5/8, indicating its activating effects on the BMP signaling pathway. Conclusion These results suggest that decreased osteoblast development and function potentially contributes to age-associated disease. Icariin exerts enhancing effects on BMP-2-mediated osteoblast development via downregulating CTGF."
https://openalex.org/W2854234505,"Among elderly, the use of serious games steadily increases. Research shows that anthropomorphising digital agents (i.e., ascribing human characteristics to them) has positive short-term consequences on interactions with digital agents. However, whether these effects can also be observed over a long-term period and in a real-life setting is unknown. In two studies, we investigated the important long-term consequences of anthropomorphism among older adults (age > 50) to increase involvement in serious games. Participants read either a story that highly anthropomorphized the digital agent of a training game, or a low anthropomorphism story about that agent. To investigate long-term effect, they played the training game for three weeks, and gaming data was assessed (number of games played, time of playing, points gained). While on the short-term, the anthropomorphic story increased the humanness of the agent (Study 1), no long-term effects where found (Study 2). Furthermore, an anthropomorphic story had no influence on the gaming outcome. Our results inform app developers about which techniques are useful to humanise digital agents."
https://openalex.org/W2856050391,"We assessed the effectiveness of a biofortified maize line (4BtxHC) which accumulates high levels of antioxidant carotenoids that also expressed the insecticidal Cry1Ac Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) gene against the European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis. This line had been previously engineered to accumulate carotenoids specifically in the seed endosperm, whereas the Bt gene was expressed constitutively. The concentrations of Bt toxin (Cry 1Ac) in the leaves of the 4Bt and 4BtxHC lines were not significantly different at 47Â±6 Î¼g/g of fresh weight (FW); neither were they in the kernels of both lines (35Â±3 Î¼g/g FW). The kernels and leaves were toxic to the larvae of O. nubilalis. However, the insecticidal activity was substantially lower (ca. 20%) than that of lines that expressed only Bt in spite that the two lines showed a quantity of toxin not significantly different in kernels or in leaves. Although the reduced effectiveness of Cry1Ac in kernels may not be entirely surprising, the observation of the same phenomenon in vegetative tissues was unexpected. When semi-artificial diets containing kernels from 4Bt supplemented with different levels of Î²-carotene were used in insect bioassays, the Î²-carotene moderated the effectiveness of the Bt similarly to the plant material with carotenoid enrichment. To elucidate the biochemical basis of the reduced effectiveness of Bt toxin in the carotenoid-enriched plants, we measured the activity of three enzymes known to be implicated in the detoxification defence, namely, catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase. Whereas Cry1Ac expression significantly increased SOD and CAT enzymatic activity in the absence of carotenoids, carotenoids, either in 4BtxHC or in artificial diets enriched with Î²-carotene, significantly lowered CAT activity. Carotenoids can therefore moderate the susceptibility of the maize borer O. nubilalis to Cry1Ac, and we hypothesize that their role as antioxidants could explain this phenomenon via their scavenging of reactive oxygen species produced during Cry1Ac detoxification in the larvae. The involvement of this mechanism in the decreased mortality caused by Cry1Ac when carotenoids are present in the diet is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2869495737,"The combined application of nitrogen (N) and zinc (Zn) fertilizers is a promising agronomic strategy for the biofortification of wheat grain with Zn for human nutrition. A glasshouse experiment was carried out to assess the effects of supplying N on the uptake, translocation and accumulation of Zn in tissues of two wheat genotypes (Quartzo and BRS Parrudo) with contrasting potential for grain Zn biofortification. Winter wheat genotypes were grown to maturity in 5 cm diameter, 100 cm length tubes filled with a mixture of sand, grit and gravel (40:40:20 v/v/v) over a layer of 0.1 m3 of gravel, and supplied a full nutrient solution with low Zn (0.15 Î¼M) or high Zn (2.25 Î¼M) and low N (0.4 mM) or high N (4.0 mM) concentrations. High N supply increased biomass production, Zn concentration and Zn content of straw and grain in both Quartzo and BRS Parrudo. Grain Zn content more than doubled when the supplies of Zn and N were both increased from low to high in both genotypes. Quartzo had a greater grain yield than BRS Parrudo. BRS Parrudo had greater grain Zn concentration and Zn content than Quartzo. A greater N supply promoted better uptake, translocation to the shoot and accumulation of Zn within the grain. Quartzo and BRS Parrudo differed in their partitioning of biomass and Zn between tissues. It might be possible to combine the greater grain yield of Quartzo with the greater grain Zn accumulation of BRS Parrudo to deliver a greatly improved genotype for human food security."
https://openalex.org/W2823235332,"Background Cytotoxic neural stem cells (NSCs) have emerged as a promising treatment for Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant primary pediatric brain tumor. The lack of accurate pre-clinical models incorporating surgical resection and tumor recurrence limits advancement in post-surgical MB treatments. Using cell lines from two of the 5 distinct MB molecular sub-groups, in this study, we developed an image-guided mouse model of MB surgical resection and investigate intra-cavity NSC therapy for post-operative MB. Methods Using D283 and Daoy human MB cells engineered to express multi-modality optical reporters, we created the first image-guided resection model of orthotopic MB. Brain-derived NSCs and novel induced NSCs (iNSCs) generated from pediatric skin were engineered to express the pro-drug/enzyme therapy thymidine kinase/ganciclovir, seeded into the post-operative cavity, and used to investigate intra-cavity therapy for post-surgical MB. Results We found that surgery reduced MB volumes by 92%, and the rate of post-operative MB regrowth increased 3-fold compared to pre-resection growth. Real-time imaging showed NSCs rapidly homed to MB, migrating 1.6-fold faster and 2-fold farther in the presence of tumors, and co-localized with MB present in the contra-lateral hemisphere. Seeding of cytotoxic NSCs into the post-operative surgical cavity decreased MB volumes 15-fold and extended median survival 133%. As an initial step towards novel autologous therapy in human MB patients, we found skin-derived iNSCs homed to MB cells, while intra-cavity iNSC therapy suppressed post-surgical tumor growth and prolonged survival of MB-bearing mice by 123%. Conclusions We report a novel image-guided model of MB resection/recurrence and provide new evidence of cytotoxic NSCs/iNSCs delivered into the surgical cavity effectively target residual MB foci."

In this study, six ZmGPDH genes were obtained by a thorough search against maize genome, and designated as ZmGPDH1-6, respectively. The structural and evolutionary analyses showed that the ZmGPDHs family had typical conserved domains and similar protein structures as the known GPDHs from other plant species. ZmGPDHs were divided into NAD+-dependent type A form (ZmGPDH1-5) and FAD-dependent type B form (ZmGPDH6) based on their N-terminal sequences. Four full length ZmGPDHs were fused with GFP fusion proteins, and their subcellular localization was determined. ZmGPDH1 and ZmGPDH3 were located to the cytosol and mainly recruited to the surface of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas ZmGPDH4 and ZmGPDH5 were located in the chloroplast. The transcriptional analysis of the ZmGPDHs in different maize tissues revealed relatively high level of transcripts accumulation of ZmGPDHs in roots and early stage developing seeds. Furthermore, we examined the transcriptional responses of the six GPDH genes in maize under various abiotic stresses, including salt, drought, alkali and cold, and significant induction of ZmGPDHs under osmotic stresses was observed. Together, this work will provide useful information for deciphering the roles of GPDHs in plant development and abiotic stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2812976466,"The Sec61 complex is the primary cotranslational protein translocation channel in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The structural transition between the closed inactive conformation of the Sec61 complex and its open and active conformation is thought to be promoted by binding of the ribosome nascent-chain complex to the cytoplasmic surface of the Sec61 complex. Here, we have analyzed new yeast Sec61 mutants that selectively interfere with cotranslational translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum. We found that a single substitution at the junction between transmembrane segment TM7 and the L6/7 loop interferes with cotranslational translocation by uncoupling ribosome binding to the L6/7 loop from the separation of the lateral gate transmembrane spans. Substitutions replacing basic residues with acidic residues in the C-terminal tail of Sec61 had an unanticipated impact upon binding of ribosomes to the Sec61 complex. We found that similar charge-reversal mutations in the N-terminal tail and in cytoplasmic loop L2/3 did not alter ribosome binding but interfered with translocation channel gating. These findings indicated that these segments are important for the structural transition between the inactive and active conformations of the Sec61 complex. In summary our results have identified additional cytosolic segments of the Sec61 complex important for promoting the structural transition between the closed and open conformations of the complex.

The Sec complex is composed of the Sec61 heterotrimer plus the tetrameric Sec62/Sec63 complex (7Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A.

Sec71p and Sec72p are fungi-specific subunits of the Sec62/Sec63 complex. The Sec complex, unlike the Sec61 or Ssh1 complexes, does not bind ribosomes directly (14Prinz A. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U. Sec61p is the main ribosome receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biol. Chem. 2000; 381 (11076036): 1025-102910.1515/BC.2000.126Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ssh1p cannot replace Sec61p in the Sec complex (8Finke K. Plath K. Panzer S. Prehn S.

Ribosome profiling experiments using organelle-specific proximity labeling indicate that the majority of yeast secretome proteins, including previously identified substrates of the yeast posttranslational translocation pathway (1Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum.J.

Ribosome profiling of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)âbound ribosome did not reveal a difference in distribution for ribosomes translating integral membrane proteins and secretory proteins in yeast (16Chartron J.W. Hunt K.C. Frydman J. Cotranslational signal-independent SRP preloading during membrane targeting.Nature. 2016; 536 (27487213): 224-22810.1038/nature19309Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The latter observations led to the conclusion that yeast SRP is responsible for ER targeting of virtually all ribosomes synthesizing secretome proteins except for the tail-anchored membrane proteins that are targeted by the Get2 protein (17del Alamo M. Hogan D.J. Pechmann S. Albanese V. Brown P.O. Frydman J.

However, rapid inactivation of yeast SRP combined with ER-specific ribosome profiling indicates that ribosomes synthesizing SRP-independent substrates remain ER-localized in SRP-deficient cells (18Costa E.A. Subramanian K. Nunnari J. Weissman J.S. Defining the physiological role of SRP in protein-targeting efficiency and specificity.Science. 2018; 359 (29348368): 689-69210.1126/science.aar3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, SRP-dependent secretome proteins including integral membrane proteins are mistargeted to the mitochondria in SRP-deficient cells (18Costa E.A. Subramanian K. Nunnari J. Weissman J.S. Defining the physiological role of SRP in protein-targeting efficiency and specificity.Science. 2018; 359 (29348368): 689-69210.1126/science.aar3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Sec72p, which contains a tetratricopeptide repeat domain, can interact with both the cytosolic Hsp70 protein Ssa1p and the ribosome-bound Hsp70 protein Ssb1p (19Tripathi A. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Rapoport T.A. Two alternative binding mechanisms connect the protein translocation Sec71-Sec72 complex with heat shock proteins.J. Biol.

Mutagenesis of the Hsp70-binding sites in Sec72p revealed that these interactions contribute to targeting of nascent carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) to the Sec complex. Thus, Hsp70 binding to yeast secretome proteins that have less hydrophobic signal sequences may play a critical role in selective delivery of this class of secretome proteins to the Sec complex. Structural insight into the Sec61 complex has been provided by X-ray crystal structures of archaebacterial SecYEÎ² (20Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C.

With respect to ribosomeâSec61 interactions, the structures show that the L6/7 and L8/9 cytosolic loops project well above the membrane surface. We had identified mutations in the L6/7 and the L8/9 loops of Sec61p that are critical for cotranslational protein translocation. Specifically, point mutations in cytosolic loop 6/7 (R275E) and loop 8/9 (R406E) of yeast Sec61p cause cotranslational translocation defects (24Cheng Z. Jiang Y. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Identification of cytoplasmic residues of Sec61p involved in ribosome binding and cotranslational translocation.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168 (15631991): 67-7710.1083/jcb.200408188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The L8/9 segment is particularly critical for ribosome binding, as the R406E mutation in yeast Sec61p causes a complete block in binding of nontranslating ribosomes (24Cheng Z. Jiang Y. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Identification of cytoplasmic residues of Sec61p involved in ribosome binding and cotranslational translocation.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168 (15631991): 67-7710.1083/jcb.200408188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Early cryo-EM structures of yeast and mammalian protein translocation complexes revealed three to four contact sites between the translating ribosome and the cytoplasmic face of the protein translocation channel (25MÃ©nÃ©tret J.F.

The two major contact sites (C2 and C4) are near the polypeptide exit tunnel on the 60S ribosomal subunit and correspond to interactions between the 26S rRNA with cytoplasmic loops L6/7 and L8/9 of Sec61Î±. A more recent higher resolution structure of an RNCâSec61 complex confirmed the location of L6/7 and L8/9 contact sites and revealed a single additional contact between the ribosome and the N terminus of Sec61Î³ (27Voorhees R.M. FernÃ¡ndez I.S. Scheres S.H. Hegde R.S. Structure of the mammalian ribosome-Sec61 complex to 3.4 â« resolution.Cell. 2014; 157 (24930395): 1632-164310.1016/j.cell.2014.05.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thus, the existence of additional contact sites near the N terminus and C terminus of Sec61Î± (26Becker T. Bhushan S. Jarasch A. Armache J.P. Funes S. Jossinet F. Gumbart J. Mielke T. Berninghausen O. Schulten K. Westhof E. Gilmore R. Mandon E.C. Beckmann R.

Notably, the N terminus of Sec61 (residues 1â23) and the C-terminal 10 residues of Sec61 (residues 467â476) were not resolved in several RNCâSec61 complex structures (27Voorhees R.M. FernÃ¡ndez I.S. Scheres S.H. Hegde R.S. Structure of the mammalian ribosome-Sec61 complex to 3.4 â« resolution.Cell. 2014; 157 (24930395): 1632-164310.1016/j.cell.2014.05.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 28Gogala M.

We have introduced point mutations that replace conserved basic residues with acidic residues in several cytoplasmically exposed segments of Sec61p to determine whether these regions of yeast Sec61 are important for the cotranslational translocation pathway. Charge-reversal substitutions in the C-terminal tail of Sec61 caused protein translocation defects and blocked ribosome binding when combined with the sec61 R275E mutation in the L6/7 loop. Although charge-reversal substitutions in the N terminus and the L2/3 region caused cotranslational protein translocation defects, these point mutations did not have any impact on ribosome-binding activity. Instead, we propose that the N-terminal and L2/L3 mutations interfere with the transition between the inactive and active conformations of the Sec61 complex. Biochemical experiments (29Prinz A. Behrens C. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Kalies K.U.

Charge-reversal substitutions in cytoplasmic loops L6/7 and L8/9 of Sec61 (e.g. R275E in L6/7 and R406E in L8/9) (Fig. 1, A and B) cause cotranslational translocation defects (24Cheng Z. Jiang Y. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Identification of cytoplasmic residues of Sec61p involved in ribosome binding and cotranslational translocation.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168 (15631991): 67-7710.1083/jcb.200408188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which in the case of the sec61 R406E allele can be explained by a complete block in 80S ribosome-binding activity. Despite the improved resolution of ribosomeâSec61 complex structures, it is unclear how RNCâSec61 contacts promote the transition between the closed and open conformations. Based on an alignment between the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii SecY sequence and a collection of 125 diverse eukaryotic Sec61 sequences (Fig. 1C), we identified conserved arginine and lysine residues in the N terminus (Arg-5 and Lys-11) and the C terminus (Lys-464 and Lys-470) of S. cerevisiae Sec61 (Fig. 1A, residues shown as blue spheres). It should be noted that a basic amino acid that aligns with S. cerevisiae Lys-470 is less well-conserved, yet roughly 40% of the Sec61 sequences we examined contain a basic residue in this vicinity in addition to the conserved basic residue that aligns with Lys-464. The conformation of the L2/3 loop differs markedly between the M. jannaschii SecYEÎ² crystal structure and cryo-EM structures of ribosomeâSec61 complexes (26Becker T. Bhushan S. Jarasch A.

For that reason, we targeted conserved basic residues at the tip of the L2/L3 loop (Lys-108 Arg-111). We constructed three plasmids harboring pairs of charge-reversal substitutions (sec61 R5E K11E, sec61 K464E K470E, and sec61 K108E R111E). Regardless of the targeting pathway, insertion of the signal sequence into the signal sequenceâbinding site depends upon a partial separation of the lateral gate of the Sec61 complex which is composed of TM2, TM3, TM7, and TM8 of Sec61p (20Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. X-ray structure of a protein-conducting channel.Nature. 2004; 427 (14661030): 36-4410.1038/nature02218Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). We also examined aligned Sec61 sequences at the junction between the L6/7 loop and TM7 and noticed several invariant bulky hydrophobic residues (Leu-285, Phe-286, Tyr-287) at this boundary (Fig. 1C, L6/7âTM7 junction). The sec61 L285G mutant was constructed to test whether the enhanced flexibility expected from a glycine substitution at this site would interfere with lateral gate opening in response to RNC binding to the Sec61 complex (Fig. 1B). Elimination of the auxiliary Ssh1 translocation channel causes a relatively minor decrease in cell growth rate (24Cheng Z. Jiang Y. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Identification of cytoplasmic residues of Sec61p involved in ribosome binding and cotranslational translocation.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168 (15631991): 67-7710.1083/jcb.200408188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of genes encoding subunits of the SRP or the signal recognition particle receptor (SR) causes severe growth defects (30Ogg S.C. Poritz M.A. Walter P. Signal recognition particle receptor is important for cell growth and protein secretion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol.

Consequently, sec61 alleles can be identified which selectively interfere with the cotranslational protein translocation pathway by screening for mutations that cause growth and translocation defects in an ssh1Î strain (24Cheng Z. Jiang Y. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Identification of cytoplasmic residues of Sec61p involved in ribosome binding and cotranslational translocation.J.

We replaced epitope-tagged Sec61 (Sec61âV5) with the untagged sec61 mutants using a plasmid shuffle procedure in yeast strains that either express (SSH1) or do not express (ssh1Î) Ssh1p, the pore-forming subunit of the auxiliary cotranslational protein translocation channel. The resulting yeast strains were maintained in synthetic media containing ethanol and glycerol (SEG) prior to conducting growth rate or protein translocation assays to minimize cellular adaptation to the Sec61p mutations and to prevent the accumulation of petite mutants. Yeast strains that lack the Ssh1p translocation channel display a 10â20% decrease in growth rate relative to a WT strain (8Finke K. Plath K. Panzer S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T.

As shown previously (24Cheng Z. Jiang Y. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Identification of cytoplasmic residues of Sec61p involved in ribosome binding and cotranslational translocation.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168 (15631991): 67-7710.1083/jcb.200408188Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), expression of the Ssh1p complex suppresses the growth defect of the positive control strain (sec61 R275E R406E) at both temperatures (Fig. 2A). All four of the new sec61 mutants displayed growth rate defects that were more severe at 37 Â°C than at 30 Â°C in the ssh1Î background. Growth rate defects were comparable to that displayed by the previously characterized sec61 R275E R406E mutant and were fully suppressed by the presence of the Ssh1p complex (Fig. 2A). The observed growth rate defects are not because of reduced stable expression of the sec61 mutant protein relative to WT Sec61p as protein immunoblots revealed only minor differences in Sec61p immunoreactivity between WT and mutant strains (Fig. S1). We can conclude that the sec61 mutants are not misfolded as these sec61 alleles are viable at 37 Â°C in the absence of the Ssh1p complex unlike the classical temperature-sensitive sec61â2 allele (8Finke K. Plath K. Panzer S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T.

The midgut consists of two bulbous gastric caeca and a tubular ventriculus. The general organization of the gastric caeca is similar to that of the ventriculus. They are composed of a peritrophic membrane, an epithelium, a basal lamina and muscle layer from the inside to outside. Three types of cells were identified: regenerative, principal, and endocrine. Regenerative cells occur in groups (called nidi) at the base of principal cells. Principal cells grow from regenerative cells. Rare endocrine cells are scattered throughout the epithelium. Principal cells exhibit intense secretory activity, and regional differences in their ultrastructure were observed along the entire midgut. The microvilli are longer than those in any other region in the posterior region of the midgut. Lysosomes, multivesicular bodies (MVBs), autophagosomes, abundant Golgi apparatuses and lipid droplets primarily occur in the gastric caeca. Three pathways of secretion (merocrine, apocrine and holocrine) occur within the midgut epithelium, and a distinctive type of apocrine bleb was found in the gastric caeca. Therefore, these gastric caeca may be evolving toward a special type of gland."
https://openalex.org/W2881356922,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) form during early embryogenesis with a supply of maternal mRNAs that contain shorter poly(A) tails. How translation of maternal mRNAs is regulated during PGC development remains elusive. Here we describe a small-molecule screen with zebrafish embryos that identified primordazine, a compound that selectively ablates PGCs. Primordazineâs effect on PGCs arises from translation repression through primordazine-response elements in the 3â² UTRs. Systematic dissection of primordazineâs mechanism of action revealed that translation of mRNAs during early embryogenesis occurs by two distinct pathways, depending on the length of their poly(A) tails. In addition to poly(A)-tail-dependent translation (PAT), early embryos perform poly(A)-tail-independent noncanonical translation (PAINT) via deadenylated 3â² UTRs. Primordazine inhibits PAINT without inhibiting PAT, an effect that was also observed in quiescent, but not proliferating, mammalian cells. These studies reveal that PAINT is an alternative form of translation in the early embryo and is indispensable for PGC maintenance. Primordazine inhibits poly(A)-tail-independent noncanonical translation (PAINT) in early zebrafish embryos and in mammalian cells under select conditions, an effect mediated by deadenylated 3Ê¹ UTRs that results in ablation of primordial germ cells."

Thus, as primary outcome measures, we analyzed the association of pre-operative FXIII activity and post-operative chest tube drainage (CTD) loss with transfusion requirements post-operatively. Secondary outcomes included the influence of cyanosis and sex on transfusion.Our retrospective analysis (2009-2010) encompassed a single center series of 76 cardio-surgical cases with CPB (0-17 years, mean age 5.61 years) that were post-operatively admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The observational period was 48 hours after cardiac surgery. Blood cell counts and coagulation status, including FXIII activity were routinely performed pre- and post-operatively. The administered amount of blood products and volume expanders was recorded electronically, along with the amount of CTD loss. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate the associations (odds ratios) of variables with post-operative transfusion needs.FXIII activities remained stable following CPB surgery. There was no association of pre- and post-operative FXIII activities and transfusion of blood products or volume expanders in the first 48 hours after surgery. Similarly, FXIII showed no association with CTD loss. Cyanosis and female sex were associated with transfusion rates.Although essentially involved in wound healing and clotting after surgery, FXIII activity does not serve as a valid predictor of post-operative transfusion need."

Whether these molecules modulate systemic inflammatory conditions remains unknown. We hypothesized that an amylin hexapeptide that forms fibrils can attenuate the systemic inflammatory response in a murine model of sepsis. To test this hypothesis, mice were pre-treated with either vehicle or amylin hexapeptide (20 Î¼g) at 12 hours and 6 hours prior to intraperitoneal (i.p.) lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 20 mg/kg) administration. Illness severity and survival were monitored every 6 hours for 3 days. Levels of pro- (IL-6, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines were measured via ELISA at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after LPS (i.p.). As a metric of lung injury, pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) barrier function was tested 24 hours after LPS administration by comparing lung wet-to-dry ratios, Evanâs blue dye (EBD) extravasation, lung histology and caspase-3 activity. Compared to controls, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide significantly reduced mortality (p<0.05 at 72 h), illness severity (p<0.05), and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, while IL-10 levels were elevated (p<0.05). Amylin pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, as demonstrated by decreased lung water and caspase-3 activity (p<0.05, versus PBS). Hence, in a murine model of systemic inflammation, pretreatment with amylin hexapeptide reduced mortality, disease severity, and preserved lung barrier function. Amylin hexapeptide may represent a novel therapeutic tool to mitigate sepsis severity and lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2841847646,Stable Schiff bases containing a furoxan moiety are synthesized as single regioisomers by the reaction of 3-methyl-2-oxy-furazan-4-carbaldehydewith various amino compounds at room temperature. The structures of synthesized compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The effect of synthesized Schiff bases containing a furoxan moiety on biological generation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in plant tissues was investigated for the first time by fluorescence microscopy and the released NO identified as nitrite with Griess reagent. There is a good correlation between the biological generation of NO determined by fluorescence microscopy and with Griess reagent. Some of the synthesized compounds exhibited both nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species generation abilities and represent potential NO donors in plant tissues.
https://openalex.org/W2830462761,"Drug delivery to the brain is challenging due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier. Mathematical modeling and simulation are essential tools for the deeper understanding of transport processes in the blood, across the blood-brain barrier and within the tissue. Here we present a mathematical model for drug delivery through capillary networks with increasingly complex topologies with the goal to understand the scaling behavior of model predictions on a coarse-to-fine sequence of grids. We apply our model to the delivery of L-Dopa, the primary drug used in the therapy of Parkinsonâs Disease. Our model replicates observed blood flow rates and ratios between plasma and tissue concentrations. We propose an optimal network grain size for the simulation of tissue volumes of 1 cm3 that allows to make reliable predictions with reasonable computational costs."
