As previously documented, they form monogamous pair bonds with females with whom they will share parental duties of nest-building, incubation, and feeding of the young. In addition, however, they routinely seek promiscuous copulations with other females, both before and after pair-bonding."
https://openalex.org/W2155842321,The distribution of dissolved aluminum in open ocean waters is probably controlled by the solution of aluminum from atmospherically derived particles and bottom sediments balanced against scavenging by siliceous shells of dead organisms. Variations in the aluminum concentration within vertical hydrographic profiles are small as compared to those for other trace metals. Aluminum concentrations in the Atlantic and Pacific are inversely related to the silica contents of these oceans.

https://openalex.org/W1977835922,"At high ambient temperatures, honeybees regulate head teriperature by evaporative cooling of regurgitated honeycrop contents. Thoracic temperature is secondarily stabilized as heat flows from thorax to head by means of passive conduction and physiological facilitation resulting from accelerated blood flow. The mechanism permits flight at the extraordinarily high ambient temperature of 46 degrees C without overheating the head and thorax despite prodigious amounts of heat produced as a by-product of flight metabolism. In contrast, at low ambient temperatures, thoracic rather than head temperature is regulated; no liquid is regurgitated, and the head is heated passively by conduction both in flight and while stationary."
https://openalex.org/W2007630169,"The root systems of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. var. Russet Burbank) treated with CO2 for 12 hours showed an increase in dry matter as early as 2 days after the treatment. When treated plants were allowed to grow for 3 to 6 weeks there was a substantial increase in tuberization. In addition, there was an increase in stolon length, number of tubers per stolon, and overall dry weight after the enrichment of the root zone with CO2. Plants treated with CO2 showed higher concentrations of malic and citric acids and of the cations Mg2+ and Ca2+. The effect of CO2 was more dramatic when CO2 was applied to the root zone than when it was applied to the shoots."
https://openalex.org/W2079796881,"Aerosol samples collected from eight geographically distinct locations in South America during the austral winter of 1976 and summer of 1977 with six-stage cascade impactors show a tropospheric sulfur background concentration of about 50 nanograms per cubic meter of air in the fine-particle mode (1 micrometer in aerodynamic diameter). Time-sequence filter samples, taken concurrently at most locations, show an average non-sea spray related sulfur concentration of about 85 nanograms per cubic meter. These concentrations are substantially lower than most published nonurban values for the Northern Hemisphere obtained by similar sampling and analysis techniques and may represent a natural tropospheric background level of aerosol sulfur."
https://openalex.org/W2127925307,"The intrinsic self-diffusion coefficient (D) for cesium-134 in a granitic melt containing 6.1 to 6.3 percent (by weight) of dissolved H(2)O is three to four orders of magnitude higher than the values reported for chemically similar but dry granitic glass. For the temperature interval 700 degrees to 800 degrees C and a confining pressure of 2 kilobars, cesium diffusivity is given by D = 7.19 x 10(-5) exp (- 19.52 x 10(3)/RT), where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature; the activation energy of about 20 kilocalories per mole is less than half the value for H(2)O-free glass. The observed increase in ionic mobility that accompanies solution of H(2)O implies sharply reduced equilibration times for chemical processes that occur in H(2)2O-bearing silicate melts."
https://openalex.org/W2048036484,"Earlier workers have described a submarine gas seep in Norton Sound having an unusual mixture of petroleum-like, low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. Actually, only about 0.04 percent of the seeping gas is hydrocarbons and 98 percent is carbon dioxide. The isotopic compositions of carbon dioxide (delta(13)C(PDB) = -2.7 per mil) and methane (delta(13)C(PDB) = -36 per mil, where PDB is the Peedee belemnite standard) indicate that geothermal processes are active here."

The West Antarctic ice sheet during the late Wisconsin was at least 30 percent wider than it is today, and Holocene retreat of its margins has added about 6 meters to the world sea level."

https://openalex.org/W2030694558,"Participants in the September 1979 United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development (UNCSTD) were disappointed in the results, which they had counted on to help diminish some of the gap between the industrialized and the developing worlds. The conference developed a plan of action in broad terms of developing an intergovernmental committee to oversee R and D projects and calling for equal opportunities for men and women in science careers. Little room for agreement was found on some of the controversial legal and political issues, however. Pressures to develop a new economic order were countered as impractical by the industrialized countries. Positive signs are noted in the participants' willingness to minimize nationalism and the large contingent of scientists present. US delegates, although they were excluded from some of the decision making, are hopeful that Congress will approve funds for the international committee and that the mechanism for technology transfer can be improved."
