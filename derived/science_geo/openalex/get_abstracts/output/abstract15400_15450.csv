https://openalex.org/W2078769454,"It is often supposed that highly repetitious DNA's arise only as a result of unusual mechanisms or in response to selective pressure. My arguments and simulations suggest, by contrast, that a pattern of tandem repeats is the natural state of DNA whose sequence is not maintained by selection. The simulations show that periodicities can develop readily from nonreptitious DNA as a result of the random accumulation of random mutations and random homology-dependent unequal crossovers. The lengths of these periodicities, and the patterns of subrepeats within them, would fluctuate in evolution, with the probability of a given pattern being dependent on the unknown exact nature of the crossover mechanism. Qualitatively, then, unequal crossover provides a reasonable and uncontrived explanation for the prevalence of highly repeated sequences in DNA and for the patterns of periodicity they evince."

The absence of complete reversal does not appear to be caused by inadequate doses of naloxone since doses higher than 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight did not increase the antagonism. It is suggested that stimulation-produced analgesia may result, at least in part, from release of an endogenous, narcotic-like substance, such as that recently reported by other investigators."
https://openalex.org/W2065306616,"We have shown that 252Cf-PDMS is capable of producing mass spectra of quasi-molecular ions for a wide variety of compounds, including amino acids, moderately large peptides, nucleotides, and natural products. Positive and negative ion mass spectra can be obtained, and in many cases quasi-molecular ions are observed in both. The method is nondestructive, as only a relatively few molecules are used and samples can be recovered after the measurement is made. Fragmentation patterns are obtained which can yield structure information. The present sensitivity of the method is at the nanogram level and there are possibilities for reducing this to picograms. The mass resolution is sufficient to give elemental identification up to mass 500. This may be extended to higher masses with improved time-of-flight techniques. There are indications that 252Cf-PDMS may extend the mass range of molecules that can be studied to as high as 3000 or more."

The increases in brain acetylcholine after treatment with physositigmine (an inhibitor of actylcholinesterase) or after consumption of a diet high in choline are additive, suggesting that choline acts by increasing acetylcholine synthesis."

An early wave is maximal over the frontal cortex and is elicited by the warning stimulus. A later wave, maximal over the motor cortex, precedes the imperative stimulus and is identified with preparation for motor response."
https://openalex.org/W1582697238,"The ionophoretic capabilities of phospholipids have been examined by direct measurement in a Pressman cell of the phospholipid-mediated translocation of cations across an organic phase separating two aqueous phases. Cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid were the most active inonophores among the phospholipids tested, with activities comparable to that of X537A in respect to the translocation of divalent cations. Cardiolipin translocates both divalent and monovalent cations at approximately equal rates. The ionophoretic activity of cardiolipin could be modulated by other phospholipids (inhibition), by butacaine (stimulation), by complexation with cytochrome c (inhibition), and by ruthenium red and lanthanum (inhibition). The rate of translocation of cations mediated by cardiolipin was independent of pH over a wide pH range (5.4 to 8.3). The same general pattern of properties observed for cardiolipin applied to phosphatidic acid except for stimulation by butacaine. Complexation of phospholipid mixtures, such as asolectin or mitochondrial lipid, with reduced cytochrome c, enhanced the ionophoretic capability of these phospholipids by 1 order of magnitude. The complex thus formed has the properties of a polyionophore. The possible physiological significance of this enormous ionophoretic potential of phospholipids is examined."
https://openalex.org/W1599956369,"The state of aggregation found in water-soluble preparations of an hepatic membrane protein responsible for the clearance of serum asialoglycoproteins has been shown to result from the self-associating properties of a single oligomeric protein. The smallest functional unit identifiable in aqueous solution possessed an estimated molecular weight of 500,000 with each of the successive components increasing in size by an equal amount to form an oligomeric series bearing an integral ratio of 1:2:3:4:5. The tendency towards self-association was promptly and completely reversed by the addition of Triton X-100 with the concomitant appearance of a single component. Extensive treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate permitted the identification and isolation of two subunits with estimated molecular weights of 48,000 and 40,000, respectively. Amino acid and carbohydrate analyses revealed both subunits to be glycoproteins with a closely similar, but not identical, composition."

https://openalex.org/W1512047600,"Total protein synthesis in perfused livers of fed rats was determined by measuring the rate of valine incorporation based on the specific activity of valine attached to tRNA. Rates were not significantly altered when perfusate valine was increased from 0.40 to 5 mM and were similar to values calculated earlier from the specific activity of extracellular valine at a concentration of 15 mM. Overall protein degradation, computed from the sum of the rates of synthesis and the total increase of free intra- and extracellular valine, corresponded closely to the increase of free valine that occurred between 5 and 15 min after the addition of cycloheximide. In the latter experiments advantage was taken of the fact that the previously established suppressive effect of cycloheximide on proteolysis does not begin initially with the inhibition of synthesis, but 15 min later. Thus, the release of valine from 5 to 15 min was assumed to represent rates of protein degradation in effect prior to the addition of cycloheximide. The close agreement found among these independent assessments of protein metabolism thus appears to eliminate much of the previous uncertainty in the quantitation of hepatic protein turnover. In the course of these studies we noted that the specific activity of valyl-tRNA attained steady state values that were intermediate between specific activities of the extracellular and intracellular pools, but appeared to reach a steady state sooner than that of intracellular valine. To evaluate these early events more precisely, the specific activity of valine in tRNA and the intracellular pool was measured in a series of single-pass perfusion experiments where extracellular valine concentration and specific activity were held constant. The intracellular valine specific activity rose with a half-life of 1.2 min. By contrast, the rise in the specific activity of valyl-tRNA was biphasic: the initial phase of the valyl-tRNA curve was rapid, while the second phase had a half-life equal to that of intracellular valine. These data show that at physiological concentrations of valine, valyl-tRNA derives its amino acids from both the extracellular and cytoplasmic pools, and that at least some tRNA is charged by extracellular amino acids before they mix with intracellular amino acid pools, possibly from a precursor pool at or near the cell membrane."

Isoproterenol eliminated rapid muscle-induced egg movements, yet the egg and its surrounding cells reached the site of fertilization within normal time limits.

Systematic fractionation of the extract of Euphorbia esula L. led to characterization of a major antileukemic component as the new diterpenoid diester, ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate. Similar fractionation of Croton oil led to characterization of phorbol 12-tiglate 13-decanoate as an active principle."

https://openalex.org/W1495364601,"The uptake and metabolism of [14C]choline in dissociated rat brain embryo cell cultures was examined as a function of the extracellular choline concentration. Choline uptake did not follow normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but rather exhibited two components with apparent Km of 0.016 mM and 0.96 mM. At low choline concentrations (high affinity uptake) most of the [14C]choline label was present in the phosphocholine fraction prior to the appearance of label in phospholipids. At high choline concentrations (low affinity uptake) a large proportion of the radioactivity was converted into acetylcholine. The dissimilarities between the formation of phosphocholine and acetylcholine as a function of choline concentration might be explained by the existence of two mutually independent enzymatic activities with different Km affinities for choline. Kinetic data augmented by double label studies, suggested that formation of choline phosphoglyceride proceeds entirely via a phosphocholine intermediate. Nearly all radioactivity in the lipid fraction is incorporated into choline phosphoglycerides. A higher turnover rate of choline incorporation into choline phosphoglycerides, accompanied by an increase in the levels of glycerophosphocholine, was observed in older cultures as compared to younger cultures. The metabolic implications of these findings in cultured brain cells in comparison with other in vitro systems are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2031509954,"Although the great number of electronic states available to an excited molecule might seem to preclude a coherent picture of photochemical reaction mechanisms, it is possible to bring out some basic features common to a great many reactions. The electronic states of the primary diradical intermediates, surface crossings, topicity, and avoided surface crossings have been shown to be essential components of the electronic theory of photochemical reactions. Diradicals have four important electronic states. Knowing these states, and making a simple electron count, it is possible to draw state correlation diagrams. Some diagrams show a typical surface crossing of the ground singlet state with the lowest (singlet, triplet) pair of excited states, with clear-cut consequences of quantum yields under various conditions. In other reactions the surfaces stay apart. The critical discriminating feature that determines the type of correlation diagram is the topicity. Photochemical reactions can be classified according to topicity, which is useful in interpreting their mechanisms (53). Avoided surface crossings can also be classified into different types. Figure 7, which illustrates the interplay of a covalent and an ionic surface responsible for photochemical electron transfer, is a typical multidimensional representation of a photochemical reaction. The chemical behavior of the excited zwitterionic states of common intermediates, such as twisted ethylene or diallyl, reflects the quantum mechanical nature of photochemical processes. In these states, for perfectly symmetric systems, charge oscillates back and forth between two symmetry-equivalent sites. Slight geometric perturbations can create a sudden polarization of the excited molecule, with localization of almost a full charge at one end of the molecule. A photon is transformed into an electrical signal thanks to an appropriate molecular distortion. Nature may have used this simple process in the N-retinylidene visual chromophore to trigger an electrical response to vision."
https://openalex.org/W1538349558,"The carbohydrate content of bovine rhodopsin was investigated and found to be different from previously reported values. Rod outer segments were isolated from dark-adapted bovine retinas by sucrose flotation and purified by sucrose density contrifugation. Rhodopsin was extracted with detergents and purified by chromatographic procedures involving calcium phosphate/celite chromatography followed by affinity chromatograpy on concanavalin A-Sepharose (or in some cases, gel filtration on agarose). Purified preparations of rhodopsin had A278/A498 ratios of 1.6 to 2.0. After treatment of the rhodopsin with chloroform/methanol (2/1) to remove lipids and detergents, the carbohydrate content was measured by gas-liquid chromatography, colorimetric and enzymatic analyses, paper chromatography, and electrophoresis. Rhodopsin was found to have about 9 mol of mannose and 5 mol of glucosamine per mol of visual pigment. A molar ratio of mannose/glucosamine of about 2 was also found in samples of rhodopsin obtained from two other laboratories. The amino acid analysis was similar to previously published values."
https://openalex.org/W1545031061,"Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (I-HYP) is a chemically defined, high affinity, high specific activity beta-adrenergic antagonist that interacts with a single site on the turkey erythrocyte membrane. Study of the interaction of agonists, antagonists, and congeners with this site and concomitant alterations in adenylate cyclase activity have been carried out in the presence of high or low concentrations of guanine nucleotide. The results help clarify the relationship between binding and activation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase and the role of guanine nucleotides in modulating this interaction. There is a close correlation between binding constants (KD) for inhibitors determined by analysis of competitive displacement of 125I-HYP from receptor, and apparent affinities (Ki) for inhibition of adenylate cyclase. For activators, however, there is up to a 10-fold difference between KD and apparent affinity (KDapp) for adenylate cyclase activation at low guanine nucleotide concentration (10(-6) M guanylylimidodiphosphate). This difference is virtually abolished by employing higher nucleotide concentrations (10(-5) M guanylylimidodiphosphate) without significantly altering receptor affinity. This suggests that guanine nucleotides act by modulating receptor-enzyme interactions rather than hormone-receptor interactions. Moreover, several beta-adrenergic analogs previously shown to have no effect on adenylate cyclase in the absence of nucleotide, are partial agonists in the presence of 10(-5) M guanylylimidodiphosphate. Parallel analyses for a series of agonists and antagonists for adenylate cyclase activation and receptor interaction show affinities for levorotatory isomers generally 100-fold greater than for dextrorotatory isomers. Thus stereoconfiguration at the beta carbon clearly influences affinity of agonists or antagonists. Affinity is also importantly influenced by the nature of the aromatic ring as well as the N-alkyl group. The complexity of structure-function relationships for these compounds requires a redefinition of structural requirements for beta-adrenergic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1484817245,"Hydroxybenzylpindolol (HYP) is a specific and highly potent beta-adrenergic antagonist. Monoiodination of HYP produces an equally high affinity inhibitor of binding to and activation of the beta receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase in turkey erythrocyte membranes. Monoiodohydroxybenzylpindolol was isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Mass spectroscopy showed that the iodine was contained in the phenolic moiety of the molecule. 125I-HYP was purified in tracer amounts by ion exchange chromatography; specific activities were achieved (1500 to 2000 Ci/mmol) approaching theoretical for 1 mol of iodine/mol of HYP. 125I-HYP interacts with a single stereospecific site with affinity of 4 to 5 X 10(10) M-1 by Scatchard analysis. Maximal binding capacity was 0.2 to 0.3 pmol/mg of membrane protein. If recovery of receptor were complete, this would correspond to 400 to 600 receptor sites per cell. Kinetic analyses of the on and off reactions gave a kinetically derived KA in good agreement with that derived from thermodynamic methods both at 20 degrees and 37 degrees. No evidence is found in these experiments for cooperative interaction of ligands with the receptor system. Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol thus represents a high affinity, high specific activity ligand of established chemical structure which should prove useful in studying the interaction of other blockers and agonists with the beta-adrenergic receptor in this and other biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1592614293,"(Na+ + K+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (NaK-ATPase) consists of two polypeptide chains, a large polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 100,000, and a sialoglycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 40,000. Cross-linking of purified NaK-ATPase with the (o-phenanthroline)2-cupric ion complex (CP) results in the reversible formation of dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers of the large polypeptide and loss of NaK-ATPase activity. ATPase activity is partially recovered if NaK-ATPase is incubated with beta-mercaptoethanol after treatment with CP. In contrast to these results, if NaK-ATPase is cross-linked in crude canine kidney microsomes, only a dimer of the large polypeptide is formed. No cross-linking of the sialoglycoprotein to the large polypeptide is detected when NaK-ATPase is cross-linked in purified form. However, when NaK-ATPase is reacted with CP in either purified or microsomal form, the sialoglycoprotein cross-links to itself yielding a high molecular weight aggregate. The results show that the functional subunit structure of NaK-ATPase consists of at least two large polypeptides."

Since the activity of testosterone reductases is rate limiting for testosterone metabolism in the liver, the effect of prolonged ethanol consumption by rats and human volunteers on the activities of these microsomal and cytosolic enzymes was studied. In rats, long-term ethanol ingestion doubled microsomal 5alpha-testosterone reductase activity, a major pathway for testosterone metabolism, while in human volunteers the activity was increased two- to fivefold. These changes may play a role in the altered androgenic activity of the chronic alcoholic."

https://openalex.org/W1563796393,"Subcellular fractions of high purity (including plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, nuclei, and cytoplasm) were prepared from isolated adipocytes, and the peptide components were examined by detergent gel electrophoresis. Each fraction except the endoplasmic reticulum exhibited a unique and reproducible complement of major peptides. Although the endoplasmic reticulum was distinctive in its enzymic markers, its peptide components showed striking homologies with certain species in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The two major adipocyte glycopeptides appear to be contained in the plasma membrane, inasmuch as they followed the distribution of 5'-nucleotidase. Incubation of adipocytes with extracellular 32Pi led to a uniform rate of incorporation of 32P into cellular peptides, with steady-state incorporation reached by 2 hours. Plasma membrane, mitochondria, nuclei, and cytoplasm all contained a distinctive complement of from two to five major phosphopeptides of different molecular weights. The majority of endoplasmic reticulum phosphopeptides exhibited molecular weights closely similar to those of certain species in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The phosphopeptides of the plasma membrane exhibited the highest absolute 32P incorporation of all phosphopeptides, next was the single major mitochondiral phosphopeptide. All fractions except the mitochondria contained, in addition to the few major phosphopeptides, numerous minor 32P-labeled phosphopeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1583680219,"In extension of a previous study with yeast glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (Kawaguchi, A., and Bloch, K. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 5793-5800), the structural changes accompanying the inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase and several malate dehydrogenases by palmitoyl-CoA and by sodium dodecyl sulfate have been investigated. Palmitoyl-CoA converts liver glutamate dehydrogenase to enzymatically inactive dimeric subunits (Mr = 1.2 X 10(5)) and tightly binds to the dissociated enzyme. Removal of the inhibitor from the palmitoyl-CoA-dimer complex fails to regenerate enzyme activity. The Ki values for palmitoyl-CoA inhibition of malate dehydrogenases (oxalacetate reduction) are, for the enzyme from pig heart mitochondria, 1.8 muM, 500 muM from pig heart supernatant, and 10 muM from chicken heart supernatant. These inhibitions are readily reversible. Palmitoyl-CoA does not alter the quaternary structure of any of the malate dehydrogenases and binds only weakly to these enzymes. Mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase assayed in the direction malate to oxalacetate is much less sensitive to palmitoyl-CoA, with Ki values of 50 muM at pH 10 and greater than 50 muM at pH 7.4. While the differences in palmitoyl-CoA sensitivity in the forward and backward reactions catalyzed by mitochondrial dehydrogenase are unexplained, a physiological rationale for these differential effects is offered. Sodium dodecyl sulfate dissociates the various dehydrogenases to monomeric subunits in contrast to the more selective effects of palmitoyl-CoA."

One contains poly(A) tracts and the other is devoid of poly(A). Sucrose gradient analyses showed that the poly(A) containing protamine mRNA (poly(A) (+)) sedimented IN THE 6 S region with a shoulder in the 4 S region while the protamine mRNA devoid of poly(A) (poly(A) (-)) appeared to sediment at about 4 S and could not be resolved from tRNA. Analysis of the poly(A) (+) protamine mRNA by boundary sedimentation in an analytical ultracentrifuge showed a sedimentation coefficient of 5.7 S, a value which gives rise to an estimate of 165 to 170 nucleotides per molecule. The poly(A) (+) protamine mRNA migrated as a single species in formamide-containing polyacrylamide gels and its mobility in relation to markers of tRNA (4 S) and 5 S RNA was consistent with its sedimentation velocity of 6 S.

https://openalex.org/W1862391892,"In order to study the effects of chemical modifications of the vinyl groups of heme on oxygen and carbon monoxide binding to myoglobin, apomyoglobins from horse heart were reconstituted with six different hemins with various side chains. Laser flash photolysis experiments of these reconstituted myoglobins showed that the combination rate constants for oxygen (k') and carbon monoxide (l') were closely related to the electron-attractive properties of the side chains. The k' values obtained in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 20 degrees were 0.83 (meso-), 2.4 (deutero-), 1.1 (reconstituted proto-), 1.2 (native proto-), 1.5 (2-formyl-4-vinyl-), 1.9 (2-vinyl-4-formyl-), and 2.7 X 10(7) M-1 S-1 (2,4-diformylmyoglobins), and the corresponding l' values were 2.8, 18, 4.8, 5.1, 7.1, 15, and 35 X 10(5) M-1 S-1, respectively. These rate constants tend to increase as the electron-withdrawing power of the side chains increases, indicating that reduced electron density of the iron atom of heme in myoglobin favors the combination reaction for both oxygen and carbon monoxide. Equilibrium constants (L) between carbon monoxide and various myoglobins were also determined by measuring the partition coefficients (M) between oxygen and carbon monoxide for the myoglobins, and were also found to be closely related to the electronic properties (pK3 of porphyrin) of the heme side chains. The equilibrium association constants for carbon monoxide thus obtained increased with a decrease in pK3 value of the porphyrin. This order was completely opposite to the case of the oxygen binding reaction. The dissociation rate constants for oxygen (k) and carbon monoxide (l) were calculated from the equilibrium and the combination rate constants. The dissociation rate constants showed a similar characteristic to the combination rate constants and increased with the increase in electron attractivity of heme side chains. The concomitant increase in both the combination and dissociation rate constants with increase in electronegativity of the iron atom suggests that these reactions have different rate determining steps, although such a reaction process is contradictory to the generally accepted concept that in a reversible reaction, both on and off reactions proceed through the same transition state. In the on reaction sigma bond formation appears to be dominant, while in the off reaction eta bond break-up is more important."

Similar insulin-dependent increases in microsomal fatty acid CoA ligase specific activities were observed using an assay based on the conversion of [3H]CoA to fatty acyl-[3H]CoA. Fatty acid CoA ligase activity was predominately (about 80%) associated with the microsomal fraction. The insulin-dependent increase in microsomal fatty acid CoA ligase specific activity was maximal in 2 to 5 min at 400 microunits/ml. At 10 min, 80 to 100 microunits of insulin/ml caused a maximal increase in fatty acid CoA ligase specific activity. Similar apparent Km values for ATP, CoA, and fatty acid were observed for fatty acid CoA ligase activity in microsomal preparations from control and insulin-exposed cells. These data suggest that fatty acid CoA ligase activity is regulated in adipose tissue by insulin. Such regulation may serve to promote the capture of fatty acid and thereby, triacylglycerol synthesis in adipose tissue."

Movement between land and water was characterized by a decrease in body temperature, which suggests that it is was not simply a proximate heat-seeking response. After the movements had been in phase with the altered light cycles for a time, they spontaneously shifted back into phase with the natural light cycl.

This fraction contained 65% of the specific 125I-NGF binding of P2. Following hypoosmotic lysis by water, Fraction B was separated into seven fractions, O, D, E, F, G, H, and I, by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The specific 125I-NGF binding was localized with the denser fractions, G, H, and I, with about a 10-fold purification as compared to the original homogenate. However, only 65% of the binding of Fraction B was found in the sum of the tertiary fractions, indicating that some loss of specific binding accompanied the lysis. By means of marker enzymes and macromolecules, as well as electron microscopy, it was determined that the distribution of cellular components of embryonic tissue in this fractionation technique is very similar to that observed for adult brain tissue. Thus, the properties of the NGF receptors determined in whole brain, which are remarkably similar to those found in peripheral neurons, are the properties of the receptors that appear to be located in the developing synaptosomal structures."
https://openalex.org/W1978256184,Closed-circular proviral DNA of Moloney leukemia virus has been purified from a 10(7) excess of cellular and mitochondrial DNA. The DNA can be visualized in the electron microscope and has the contour length of a molecule with a moleculecular weight of about 5.5 + 10(6). Electron microscopic observation of a hybrid between viral RNA and this circular DNA confirms the viral origin of this molecule.
https://openalex.org/W1578734629,"A low molecular weight RNA fraction possessing protamine mRNA activity was prepared from rainbow trout testis polysomes. Addition of low molecular weight RNA to a Krebs II ascites S-30 cell-free protein synthesis system strongly stimulated [14C]arginine incorporation into acid-insoluble material. This stimulation was completely abolished by 10-4 M aurintricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis at the level of initiation. Starch gel electrophoresis showed that labeled arginine was incorporated in vitro into products identical with both authentic protamine and histones as found previously (Gilmour, R. S., and Dixon, G. H. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 4621-4627). The 4 to 6 S RNA fraction, isolated from the polysomal low molecular weight RNA by sucrose gradient fractionation, enhanced the incorporation of [14C]arginine into acid-insoluble material and when this product was examined by starch gel electrophoresis, it co-migrated with authentic rainbow trout protamine."
https://openalex.org/W1492683190,"Human peripheral lymphocytes were incubated with Phaseolus vulgaris phytohemagglutinin. The induction of glutamine-utilizing carbamyl phosphate synthetase (EC 2.7.2.5) and aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2) for pyrimidine biosynthesis de novo and the induction of uridine kinase were observed as described previously (Ito, K., and Uchino, H. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 4060-4065; Ito, K., and Uchino, H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 389-392; Lucas, Z.J. (1967) Science 156, 1237-1240). By the addition of 1 mM guanine to the culture, the induction of the former two enzymes was inhibited, while that of uridine kinase was not, and even accelerated. An increase in the rate of [14C] bicarbonate incorporation into the acid-soluble uridine nucleotides via the de novo pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis after phytohemagglutinin stimulation was inhibited by guanine, the incorporation rate being almost at the level of the control culture without phytohemagglutinin. Guanosine had a similar effect on pyrimidine biosynthesis. The induction of the three enzymes mentioned above was completely inhibited by adenine (1 mM). Guanine and guanosine seem to have a unique inhibitory effect on the induction of glutamine-utilizing carbamyl phosphate synthetase and aspartate transcarbamylase."
https://openalex.org/W1526456821,"The membrane sidedness of Pi interaction in reactions which characterize reversal of the Ca2+ pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle was investigated. Vesicles previously loaded with calcium [32P]phosphate were incubated with 0.1 mM ADP and different concentrations of nonradioactive Pi. Alternatively, vesicles loaded with nonradioactive calcium phosphate were incubated in a medium containing 32Pi. The rates of Ca2+ efflux and ATP synthesis were siginficantly activated only when Pi was included in the assay medium. Although the Pi contained by the vesicles crosses the membrane at a rate proportional to the Ca2+ efflux, [gamma-32P]ATP was synthesized only when 32Pi interacted with the outer surface of the membrane. Similarly, ATP in equilibrium 32Pi or ITP in equilibrium 32Pi exchange could be measured only when the external pool of Pi was labeled. Both for ATP synthesis and for the ITP in equilibrium Pi exchange reaction, membrane phosphorylation by 32Pi was negligible unless the external pool of Pi was labeled. The ionophore X-537 A increased the rate of Ca2+ efflux but inhibited the synthesis of ATP. During reversal of the Ca2+ pump, Pi apparently interacts with the membrane only at the outer surface, and at a site different from that where Ca2+ crosses the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2150762724,"Studies with an insect juvenile hormone mimic and the insecticide dieldrin have shown that enzymatic processes in the rumen reduce the epoxide moiety in these compounds to an olefin. This reaction is apparently microbial in origin and does not involve an observable intermediate. Epoxide reductions in the digestive tract of ruminants and possibly other mammals may be important in the detoxication of biologically active epoxides, including pesticides, alkylating agents, and carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W2094254180,"Teleosts living in some mid-water pelagic regions of the Pacific are hypoxic or anaerobic during most of the day and become aerobic only during their diurnal migrations to and from the sea surface. The blood oxygen capacities of these fishes are among the lowest ever reported, and the oxygen dissociation curves show a very low affinity for oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1600743409,"The relationship of structure to function in the recognition of ribonuclease S-peptide by S-protein was studied by several methods. Liquid phase peptide synthesis was employed to generate analogs of S-peptide in which from 1 to 8 residues were deleted from the NH2-terminal end of the S-peptide. Additional derivatives were made by substitutions in the NH2-terminal three amino acids or by modifying the S-peptide analogs by trifluoroacetylation. The analogs were generated in the following way. S-Peptide was cleaved with chymotrypsin. The fragment obtained, RNase(9-20), was purified and lengthened step by step using liquid phase peptide synthesis. A second set of analogs were prepared by cleavage of CF3CO-S-peptide with elastase and the resulting CF3CO-RNase(7-20), similarly lengthened. The various analogs of S-peptide were tested in their capacity to combine with S-protein and regenerate biological activity as measured by Vmax and Kb. This work shows a positive contribution of every one of the first 8 NH2-terminal residues of S-peptide to the molecular recognition of S-protein in the presence of RNA substrate. Substitution of the first 3 residues by alanine or blocking of the free amino groups decreases recognition, indicating that the original primary structure is the most favorable one."
https://openalex.org/W2010553098,"A report of an association of chromosome breakage and birth defects with spray adhesive exposure resulted in a ban on the sale of these products and nationwide publicity warning exposed women. Six months later the ban was removed; the association could not be confirmed. Replies to questionnaires sent to medical genetics centers throughout the United States revealed that more than 1100 inquiries had been received and more than 1200 working days were expended because of the issue. Eleven exposed women underwent diagnostic amniocentesis, and one elected to abort her fetus. Eight other women who were exposed also elected to do so, but without first undergoing diagnostic amniocentesis. The episode illustrates some of the unexpected and unnecessary consequences that can arise from the false identification of an environmental agent as a mutagen or teratogen."
https://openalex.org/W2065002294,"The membrane potential of the horizontal cell of the axolotl is highly dependent on the extracellular concentration of sodium. Experimental results reported here are consistent with the suggestion that in the dark the receptors release a synaptic transmitter which increases primarily the sodium conductance of the postsynaptic membrane. Externally applied aspartate or glutamate depolarizes the horizontal cell membrane and eliminates the light response of the horizontal cell. However, it appears to increase the conductances of the postsynaptic membrane to several ions rather than just to sodium ions."
https://openalex.org/W2049687396,Intravenous administration of nicotinic acid to the anesthetized dog prior to thermal trauma reduced plasma loss at 10 minutes after burn from 7 milliliters per kilogram to less than 2 millimeters per kilogram. During the next 50 minutes plasma loss was the same in treated and untreated animals. An additional dose of nicotinic acid 30 minutes after burn prevented this further loss.
