https://openalex.org/W2902127691,"The passage of time is tracked by counting oscillations of a frequency reference, such as Earth's revolutions or swings of a pendulum. By referencing atomic transitions, frequency (and thus time) can be measured more precisely than any other physical quantity, with the current generation of optical atomic clocks reporting fractional performance below the $10^{-17}$ level. However, the theory of relativity prescribes that the passage of time is not absolute, but impacted by an observer's reference frame. Consequently, clock measurements exhibit sensitivity to relative velocity, acceleration and gravity potential. Here we demonstrate optical clock measurements surpassing the present-day ability to account for the gravitational distortion of space-time across the surface of Earth. In two independent ytterbium optical lattice clocks, we demonstrate unprecedented levels in three fundamental benchmarks of clock performance. In units of the clock frequency, we report systematic uncertainty of $1.4 \times 10^{-18}$, measurement instability of $3.2 \times 10^{-19}$ and reproducibility characterised by ten blinded frequency comparisons, yielding a frequency difference of $[-7 \pm (5)_{stat} \pm (8)_{sys}] \times 10^{-19}$. While differential sensitivity to gravity could degrade the performance of these optical clocks as terrestrial standards of time, this same sensitivity can be used as an exquisite probe of geopotential. Near the surface of Earth, clock comparisons at the $1 \times 10^{-18}$ level provide 1 cm resolution along gravity, outperforming state-of-the-art geodetic techniques. These optical clocks can further be used to explore geophysical phenomena, detect gravitational waves, test general relativity and search for dark matter."
https://openalex.org/W2902713146,"The NLRP3 inflammasome, which has been linked to human inflammatory diseases, is activated by diverse stimuli. How these stimuli activate NLRP3 is unknown. Here we show that different NLRP3 stimuli lead to disassembly of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). NLRP3 is recruited to the dispersed TGN (dTGN) through ionic bonding between its conserved polybasic region and negatively charged phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) on the dTGN. The dTGN then serves as a scaffold for NLRP3 aggregation into multiple puncta, leading to polymerization of the adaptor protein ASC, thereby activating the downstream signalling cascade. Disruption of the interaction between NLRP3 and PtdIns4P on the dTGN blocked NLRP3 aggregation and downstream signalling. These results indicate that recruitment of NLRP3 to dTGN is an early and common cellular event that leads to NLRP3 aggregation and activation in response to diverse stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2903489697,"The placenta is the extraembryonic organ that supports the fetus during intrauterine life. Although placental dysfunction results in major disorders of pregnancy with immediate and lifelong consequences for the mother and child, our knowledge of the human placenta is limited owing to a lack of functional experimental models1. After implantation, the trophectoderm of the blastocyst rapidly proliferates and generates the trophoblast, the unique cell type of the placenta. In vivo, proliferative villous cytotrophoblast cells differentiate into two main sub-populations: syncytiotrophoblast, the multinucleated epithelium of the villi responsible for nutrient exchange and hormone production, and extravillous trophoblast cells, which anchor the placenta to the maternal decidua and transform the maternal spiral arteries2. Here we describe the generation of long-term, genetically stable organoid cultures of trophoblast that can differentiate into both syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast. We used human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing to confirm that the organoids were derived from the fetus, and verified their identities against four trophoblast-specific criteria3. The cultures organize into villous-like structures, and we detected the secretion of placental-specific peptides and hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) by mass spectrometry. The organoids also differentiate into HLA-G+ extravillous trophoblast cells, which vigorously invade in three-dimensional cultures. Analysis of the methylome reveals that the organoids closely resemble normal first trimester placentas. This organoid model will be transformative for studying human placental development and for investigating trophoblast interactions with the local and systemic maternal environment. An in vitro system that generates three-dimensional cultures of extraembryonic fetal trophoblast cells that differentiate into the two main types of trophoblast can be used to study human placental development."

https://openalex.org/W2806593114,"Mutations that attenuate homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair promote tumorigenesis and sensitize cells to chemotherapeutics that cause replication fork collapse, a phenotype known as ‘BRCAness’1. BRCAness tumours arise from loss-of-function mutations in 22 genes1. Of these genes, all but one (CDK12) function directly in the HR repair pathway1. CDK12 phosphorylates serine 2 of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain heptapeptide repeat2–7, a modification that regulates transcription elongation, splicing, and cleavage and polyadenylation8,9. Genome-wide expression studies suggest that depletion of CDK12 abrogates the expression of several HR genes relatively specifically, thereby blunting HR repair3–7,10,11. This observation suggests that the mutational status of CDK12 may predict sensitivity to targeted treatments against BRCAness, such as PARP1 inhibitors, and that CDK12 inhibitors may induce sensitization of HR-competent tumours to these treatments6,7,10,11. Despite growing clinical interest, the mechanism by which CDK12 regulates HR genes remains unknown. Here we show that CDK12 globally suppresses intronic polyadenylation events in mouse embryonic stem cells, enabling the production of full-length gene products. Many HR genes harbour more intronic polyadenylation sites than other expressed genes, and these sites are particularly sensitive to loss of CDK12. The cumulative effect of these sites accounts for the enhanced sensitivity of HR gene expression to CDK12 loss, and we find that this mechanism is conserved in human tumours that contain loss-of-function CDK12 mutations. This work clarifies the function of CDK12 and underscores its potential both as a chemotherapeutic target and as a tumour biomarker. The kinase CDK12 suppresses usage of intronic polyadenylation sites and thereby promotes the expression of genes involved in homologous recombination DNA repair."

https://openalex.org/W3104977741,"The broadening of atomic emission lines by high-velocity motion of gas near accreting supermassive black holes is an observational hallmark of quasars. Observations of broad emission lines could potentially constrain the mechanism for transporting gas inwards through accretion disks or outwards through winds. The size of this broad-line region has been estimated by measuring the light travel time delay between the variable nuclear continuum and the emission lines - a method known as reverberation mapping. In some models the emission lines arise from a continuous outflow, whereas in others they are produced by orbiting gas clouds. Directly imaging such regions has not hitherto been possible because of their small angular sizes (< 0.1 milli-arcseconds). Here we report a spatial offset (with a spatial resolution of ten micro-arcseconds or about 0.03 parsecs for a distance of 550 million parsecs) between the red and blue photo-centres of the broad Paschen-{\alpha} line of the quasar 3C 273 perpendicular to the direction of its radio jet. This spatial offset corresponds to a gradient in the velocity of the gas and thus implies that the gas is orbiting the central supermassive black hole. The data are well fitted by a broad-line-region model of a thick disk of gravitationally bound material orbiting a black hole of 300 million solar masses. We infer a disk radius of 150 light days; a radius of 100-400 light days was found previously using reverberation mapping. The rotation axis of the disk aligns in inclination and position angle with the radio jet. Our results support the methods that are often used to estimate the masses of accreting supermassive black holes and to study their evolution over cosmic time."

https://openalex.org/W2902388368,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is protective against kidney injury, but the molecular mechanisms of this protection are poorly understood1,2. Nitric oxide-based cellular signalling is generally mediated by protein S-nitrosylation, the oxidative modification of Cys residues to form S-nitrosothiols (SNOs). S-nitrosylation regulates proteins in all functional classes, and is controlled by enzymatic machinery that includes S-nitrosylases and denitrosylases, which add and remove SNO from proteins, respectively3,4. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the classic metabolic intermediate co-enzyme A (CoA) serves as an endogenous source of SNOs through its conjugation with nitric oxide to form S-nitroso-CoA (SNO-CoA), and S-nitrosylation of proteins by SNO-CoA is governed by its cognate denitrosylase, SNO-CoA reductase (SCoR)5. Mammals possess a functional homologue of yeast SCoR, an aldo-keto reductase family member (AKR1A1)5 with an unknown physiological role. Here we report that the SNO-CoA-AKR1A1 system is highly expressed in renal proximal tubules, where it transduces the activity of eNOS in reprogramming intermediary metabolism, thereby protecting kidneys against acute kidney injury. Specifically, deletion of Akr1a1 in mice to reduce SCoR activity increased protein S-nitrosylation, protected against acute kidney injury and improved survival, whereas this protection was lost when Enos (also known as Nos3) was also deleted. Metabolic profiling coupled with unbiased mass spectrometry-based SNO-protein identification revealed that protection by the SNO-CoA-SCoR system is mediated by inhibitory S-nitrosylation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) through a novel locus of regulation, thereby balancing fuel utilization (through glycolysis) with redox protection (through the pentose phosphate shunt). Targeted deletion of PKM2 from mouse proximal tubules recapitulated precisely the protective and mechanistic effects of S-nitrosylation in Akr1a1-/- mice, whereas Cys-mutant PKM2, which is refractory to S-nitrosylation, negated SNO-CoA bioactivity. Our results identify a physiological function of the SNO-CoA-SCoR system in mammals, describe new regulation of renal metabolism and of PKM2 in differentiated tissues, and offer a novel perspective on kidney injury with therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2901182059,"The mid-latitude westerly winds of the Southern Hemisphere play a central role in the global climate system via Southern Ocean upwelling1, carbon exchange with the deep ocean2, Agulhas leakage (transport of Indian Ocean waters into the Atlantic)3 and possibly Antarctic ice-sheet stability4. Meridional shifts of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds have been hypothesized to occur5,6 in parallel with the well-documented shifts of the intertropical convergence zone7 in response to Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) events— abrupt North Atlantic climate change events of the last ice age. Shifting moisture pathways to West Antarctica8 are consistent with this view but may represent a Pacific teleconnection pattern forced from the tropics9. The full response of the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation to the DO cycle and its impact on Antarctic temperature remain unclear10. Here we use five ice cores synchronized via volcanic markers to show that the Antarctic temperature response to the DO cycle can be understood as the superposition of two modes: a spatially homogeneous oceanic ‘bipolar seesaw’ mode that lags behind Northern Hemisphere climate by about 200 years, and a spatially heterogeneous atmospheric mode that is synchronous with abrupt events in the Northern Hemisphere. Temperature anomalies of the atmospheric mode are similar to those associated with present-day Southern Annular Mode variability, rather than the Pacific–South American pattern. Moreover, deuterium-excess records suggest a zonally coherent migration of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds over all ocean basins in phase with Northern Hemisphere climate. Our work provides a simple conceptual framework for understanding circum-Antarctic temperature variations forced by abrupt Northern Hemisphere climate change. We provide observational evidence of abrupt shifts in the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds, which have previously documented1–3 ramifications for global ocean circulation and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These coupled changes highlight the necessity of a global, rather than a purely North Atlantic, perspective on the DO cycle. The position of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds responds immediately to abrupt North Atlantic climate events of the last ice age, with a spatially heterogeneous impact on Antarctic climate."
https://openalex.org/W2902898030,"The entry of foreign DNA into many mammalian cell types triggers the innate immune system, a complex set of responses to prevent infection by pathogens. One aspect of the response is the potent epigenetic silencing of incoming viral DNAs1, including the extrachromosomal DNAs that are formed immediately after infection by retroviruses. These unintegrated viral DNAs are very poorly transcribed in all cells, even in permissive cells, in contrast to the robust expression that is observed after viral integration2-5. The factors that are responsible for this low expression have not yet been identified. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for genes that are required for silencing an integrase-deficient MLV-GFP reporter virus to explore the mechanisms responsible for repression of unintegrated viral DNAs in human cells. Our screen identified the DNA-binding protein NP220, the three proteins (MPP8, TASOR and PPHLN1) that comprise the HUSH complex-which silences proviruses in heterochromatin6 and retrotransposons7,8-the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, and other host factors that are required for silencing. Further tests by chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that NP220 is the key protein that recruits the HUSH complex, SETDB1 and the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC4 to silence the unintegrated retroviral DNA. Knockout of NP220 accelerates the replication of retroviruses. These experiments identify the molecular machinery that silences extrachromosomal retroviral DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2903485994,"Plants have evolved complex systems to rapidly respond to severe stress conditions, such as heat, cold, and dehydration. Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A (DREB2A) is a key transcriptional activator that induces many heat- and drought-responsive genes, increases tolerance to both heat and drought stress, and suppresses plant growth in Arabidopsis thaliana. DREB2A expression is induced by stress, but stabilization of the DREB2A protein in response to stress is essential for activating the expression of downstream stress-inducible genes. Under nonstress growth conditions, an integral negative regulatory domain (NRD) destabilizes DREB2A, but the mechanism by which DREB2A is stabilized in response to stress remains unclear. Here, based on bioinformatics, mutational, MS, and biochemical analyses, we report that Ser/Thr residues in the NRD are phosphorylated under nonstress growth conditions and that their phosphorylation decreases in response to heat. Furthermore, we found that this phosphorylation is likely mediated by casein kinase 1 and is essential for the NRD-dependent, proteasomal degradation of DREB2A under nonstress conditions. These observations suggest that inhibition of NRD phosphorylation stabilizes and activates DREB2A in response to heat stress to enhance plant thermotolerance. Our study reveals the molecular basis for the coordination of stress tolerance and plant growth through stress-dependent transcriptional regulation, which may allow the plants to rapidly respond to fluctuating environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2902166958,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a neuromodulation method used for treatment of epilepsy and depression. Transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) has been gaining popularity as a noninvasive alternative to VNS. Previous tVNS neuroimaging studies revealed brain (de)activation patterns that involved multiple areas implicated in tinnitus generation and perception. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to explore the effects of tVNS on brain activity in patients with tinnitus.Thirty-six patients with chronic tinnitus received tVNS to the inner tragus, cymba conchae, and earlobe (sham stimulation).The locus coeruleus and nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem were activated in response to stimulation of both locations compared with the sham stimulation. The cochlear nuclei were also activated, which was not observed in healthy subjects with normal hearing. Multiple auditory and limbic structures, as well as other brain areas associated with generation and perception of tinnitus, were deactivated by tVNS, particularly the parahippocampal gyrus, which was recently speculated to cause tinnitus in hearing-impaired patients.tVNS via the inner tragus or cymba conchae suppressed neural activity in the auditory, limbic, and other tinnitus-related non-auditory areas through auditory and vagal ascending pathways in tinnitus patients. The results from this study are discussed in the context of several existing models of tinnitus. They indicate that the mechanism of action of tVNS might be involved in multiple brain areas responsible for the generation of tinnitus, tinnitus-related emotional annoyance, and their mutual reinforcement."
https://openalex.org/W2902174834,"Speech recognition (SR) has been improved significantly by artificial neural networks (ANNs), but ANNs have the drawbacks of biologically implausibility and excessive power consumption because of the nonlocal transfer of real-valued errors and weights. While spiking neural networks (SNNs) have the potential to solve these drawbacks of ANNs due to their efficient spike communication and their natural way to utilize kinds of synaptic plasticity rules found in brain for weight modification. However, existing SNN models for SR either had bad performance, or were trained in biologically implausible ways. In this paper, we present a biologically inspired convolutional SNN model for SR. The network adopts the time-to-first-spike coding scheme for fast and efficient information processing. A biological learning rule, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), is used to adjust the synaptic weights of convolutional neurons to form receptive fields in an unsupervised way. In the convolutional structure, the strategy of local weight sharing is introduced and could lead to better feature extraction of speech signals than global weight sharing. We first evaluated the SNN model with a linear support vector machine (SVM) on the TIDIGITS dataset and it got the performance of 97.5%, comparable to the best results of ANNs. Deep analysis on network outputs showed that, not only are the output data more linearly separable, but they also have fewer dimensions and become sparse. To further confirm the validity of our model, we trained it on a more difficult recognition task based on the TIMIT dataset, and it got a high performance of 93.8%. Moreover, a linear spike-based classifier-tempotron-can also achieve high accuracies very close to that of SVM on both the two tasks. These demonstrate that an STDP-based convolutional SNN model equipped with local weight sharing and temporal coding is capable of solving the SR task accurately and efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W2798887531,"Refraction is a well-known optical phenomenon that alters the direction of light waves propagating through matter. Microscopes, lenses and prisms based on refraction are indispensable tools for controlling the properties of light beams at visible, infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. The large absorption of extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) radiation in matter, however, hinders the development of refractive lenses and prisms in this spectral region. Here, we demonstrate control over the refraction of XUV radiation by using a gas jet with a density gradient across the XUV beam profile. A gas phase prism is demonstrated that leads to a frequency-dependent deflection of the XUV beam. The strong deflection in the vicinity of atomic resonances is further used to develop a deformable XUV refractive lens, with low absorption and a focal length that can be tuned by varying the gas pressure. Our results provide novel opportunities in XUV science and open a route towards the transfer of refraction-based techniques including microscopy and nanofocusing, which are well established in other spectral regions, to the XUV domain."
https://openalex.org/W2900734333,"In many physical networks, including neurons in the brain1,2, three-dimensional integrated circuits3 and underground hyphal networks4, the nodes and links are physical objects that cannot intersect or overlap with each other. To take this into account, non-crossing conditions can be imposed to constrain the geometry of networks, which consequently affects how they form, evolve and function. However, these constraints are not included in the theoretical frameworks that are currently used to characterize real networks5–7. Most tools for laying out networks are variants of the force-directed layout algorithm8,9—which assumes dimensionless nodes and links—and are therefore unable to reveal the geometry of densely packed physical networks. Here we develop a modelling framework that accounts for the physical sizes of nodes and links, allowing us to explore how non-crossing conditions affect the geometry of a network. For small link thicknesses, we observe a weakly interacting regime in which link crossings are avoided via local link rearrangements, without altering the overall geometry of the layout compared to the force-directed layout. Once the link thickness exceeds a threshold, a strongly interacting regime emerges in which multiple geometric quantities, such as the total link length and the link curvature, scale with the link thickness. We show that the crossover between the two regimes is driven by the non-crossing condition, which allows us to derive the transition point analytically and show that networks with large numbers of nodes will ultimately exist in the strongly interacting regime. We also find that networks in the weakly interacting regime display a solid-like response to stress, whereas in the strongly interacting regime they behave in a gel-like fashion. Networks in the weakly interacting regime are amenable to 3D printing and so can be used to visualize network geometry, and the strongly interacting regime provides insights into the scaling of the sizes of densely packed mammalian brains. A modelling framework is presented to determine the optimal layout and physical properties of networks in which the nodes and links have physical sizes and intersections between components is prohibited."
https://openalex.org/W2902966659,"U.S. smoking prevalence is declining at a slower rate in rural than urban settings and contributing to regional health disparities. Cigarette smoking among women of reproductive age is particularly concerning due to the potential for serious maternal and infant adverse health effects should a smoker become pregnant. The aim of the present study was to examine whether this rural-urban disparity impacts women of reproductive age (ages 15–44) including pregnant women. Data came from the ten most recent years of the U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2007–2016). We estimated prevalence of current smoking and nicotine dependence among women categorized by rural-urban residence, pregnancy status, and trends using chi-square testing and multivariable modeling while adjusting for common risk factors for smoking. Despite overall decreasing trends in smoking prevalence, prevalence was higher among rural than urban women of reproductive age overall (χ2(1) = 579.33, p < .0001) and among non-pregnant (χ2(1) = 578.0, p < .0001) and pregnant (χ2(1) = 79.69, p < .0001) women examined separately. An interaction between residence and pregnancy status showed adjusted odds of smoking among urban pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (AOR = .58, [.53 –.63]) were lower than those among rural pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (AOR = 0.75, [.62 –.92]), consistent with greater pregnancy-related smoking cessation among urban pregnant women. Prevalence of nicotine dependence was also higher in rural than urban smokers overall (χ2(2) = 790.42, p < .0001) and among non-pregnant (χ2(2) = 790.58, p < .0001) and pregnant women examined separately (χ2(2) = 63.69, p < .0001), with no significant changes over time. Associations involving residence and pregnancy status remained significant in models adjusting for covariates (ps < 0.05). Results document greater prevalence of smoking and nicotine dependence and suggest less pregnancy-related quitting among rural compared to urban women, disparities that have potential for direct, multi-generational adverse health impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2952471533,"The recent 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks rang the bell to call upon global efforts to assist resource-constrained countries to strengthen public health surveillance system for early response. Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening.This was a mixed-method research study. Quantitative data were to analyze completeness and timeliness of surveillance system performance from national District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) during October 2014 to September 2016. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district and 7 key informants of the IDSR system implementation and administration at district and national levels.The current IDSR system showed relatively good completeness (73.1%) but poor timeliness (40.2%) of total expected monthly reports nationwide and zero weekly reports during the study period. Major implementation gaps were lack of weekly report and trainings. The challenges of IDSR implementation revealed through qualitative data included case identification, compiling reports for timely submission and inadequate resources.The differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice were huge. The developing information technology infrastructure in Malawi and emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology can be opportunities for the country to overcome these challenges and improve surveillance system to have better timeliness for the outbreaks and unusual events detection."
https://openalex.org/W2902098988,"High-grain diets are strongly associated with metabolic disorders in beef steers. Metabolomics can be used to explore the relationship between diet and metabolic changes, but no study has reported rumen and plasma metabolomics profiling associated with increasing dietary corn proportions in the diet of beef steers. Therefore, 12 steers paired according to similar body weights and body condition scores were randomly allocated to one of two diets: a low-corn (28.76%) diet (LCD) with a 40:60 ratio of concentrate to roughage and a high-corn (48.76%) diet (HCD) with a 60:40 ratio of concentrate to roughage. Metabolomics profiling by ultra-high-performance liquid tandem chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS) showed that steers fed the HCD had increased rumen and plasma carbohydrate metabolites and amino acids, which contributed to the growth of the beef steers. However, the rumen acidity and ruminal and plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations significantly increased with the increase amounts of corn in the diet. In total, 717 rumen metabolites and 386 plasma metabolites were identified. By multivariate analysis, 144 rumen and 56 plasma metabolites were further identified that were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.05 and variable influence on projection > 1). The differential metabolites in the rumen and plasma were associated with different metabolic pathways, and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism were common key metabolic pathways for the two biofluids. In conclusion, the high-corn diet improved the growth performance of beef steers but decreased the ruminal pH and increased the LPS and harmful metabolites in the rumen and blood, which has implications for the incidence of metabolic diseases. The identified differential metabolites in both the rumen and plasma and the related metabolic pathways may contribute to the exploration of potential biomarkers for high-corn diet-based metabolic diseases."

In the present study, we examined the potential involvement of SIRT2 in type I IFN signaling and its role in the induction of IFN responses. We report that SIRT2 controls IFN-driven gene transcription via a novel mechanism involving control of phosphorylation of STAT1 on serine 727. Furthermore, we provide evidence that SIRT2-dependent STAT1 phosphorylation is important for transcriptional activation of ISGs. At the outset we examined whether IFNβ treatment of Sirt2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) leads to phosphorylation of STAT1. Whereas IFNβ treatment of Sirt2+/+ MEFs resulted in phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727, IFNβ-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727 was defective in Sirt2−/− MEFs (Fig. 1A). By contrast, there was no SIRT2-dependent requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, as both Sirt2+/+ and Sirt2−/− MEFs exhibited IFNβ-inducible phosphorylation of STAT1 on Tyr-701 (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the potential involvement of other sirtuins in the control of IFNα/β–dependent STAT1 serine phosphorylation, we employed Sirt1−/− and Sirt6−/− MEFs. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, IFNα/β–dependent serine phosphorylation of STAT1 occurs in both Sirt1−/− and Sirt6−/− MEFs, to similar levels observed in their WT counterparts, Sirt1+/+ and Sirt6+/+ MEFs. To further establish the role of SIRT2 in the regulation of type I IFN–dependent STAT1 serine phosphorylation, we conducted studies in U937 hematopoietic cells, stably expressing control shRNA or SIRT2 shRNA (Fig. 1E). As show in Fig. 1F, IFNβ–dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727 was substantially impaired in cells expressing SIRT2 shRNA. To define the mechanisms by which SIRT2 activity may regulate type I IFN–dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727, we examined whether this event requires deacetylation of CDK9 on Lys residue 48. Previous studies have established that Lys-48 in CDK9 is a major SIRT2 downstream target and its deacetylation is required for activation of CDK9 (29Zhang H. Park S.H. Pantazides B.G. Karpiuk O. Warren M.D. Hardy C.W. Duong D.M. Park S.J. Kim H.S. Vassilopoulos A. Seyfried N.T. Johnsen S.A. Gius D. Yu D.S. SIRT2 directs the replication stress response through CDK9 deacetylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23898190): 13546-1355110.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Notably, there is evidence that silencing another member of the CDK family, CDK8, affects IFNγ–induced phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727 (30Bancerek J. Poss Z.C. Steinparzer I. Sedlyarov V. Pfaffenwimmer T. Mikulic I. Dölken L. Strobl B. Müller M. Taatjes D.J. Kovarik P. CDK8 kinase phosphorylates transcription factor STAT1 to selectively regulate the interferon response.Immunity. 2013; 38 (23352233): 250-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether CDK9 controls phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 in the type I IFN system. Specific siRNA–mediated knockdown of CDK9 in SET-2 cells resulted in a reduction of type I IFN-induced STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). In vitro kinase assays were performed to directly determine whether STAT1 is phosphorylated by the CDK9 kinase after IFNβ treatment. These studies demonstrated that STAT1 is a substrate for the kinase activity of CDK9 (Fig. 2B). Importantly, such CDK9-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 was defective in Sirt2−/− MEFs compared with Sirt2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 2C), suggesting that SIRT2 could mediate the activation of CDK9 via deacetylation in an IFNβ–dependent manner. In parallel studies in which we ectopically expressed CDK9 wildtype (WT) plasmid in Sirt2−/− MEFs, we observed an increase in the phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727. In contrast, expression of a mutant CDK9 in which Lys-44 was mutated to arginine (K44R) and therefore cannot be deacetylated, showed no significant increase in the IFN–dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 at Ser-727 as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, mutation of CDK9 on Lys-48 to arginine (K48R), thereby blocking acetylation of the SIRT2-specific deacetylation target residue, induced potent phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727 in Sirt2−/− MEFs (Fig. 2D), suggesting that SIRT2-dependent deacetylation of CDK9 on Lys-48 controls phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727 after IFNβ treatment. Having established that SIRT2 is required for type I IFN-induced STAT1 Ser-727 phosphorylation and cognizant that STAT1 is essential for transcription of ISGs, we next examined whether SIRT2 activity is required for IFN–dependent transcriptional activation of ISGs, using Illumina gene expression microarrays. Analysis of microarray data revealed IFN-inducible differential expression of 370 genes in Sirt2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3, A and C) and 240 genes in Sirt2−/− MEFs (Fig. 3, B and C). Although 198 genes were differentially expressed upon IFNβ treatment in both Sirt2+/+ and Sirt2−/− MEFs (Fig. 3C), 44 of those genes showed higher expression in Sirt2+/+ MEFs compared with Sirt2−/− MEFs (Table S1, genes expressed higher are highlighted in red). Moreover, 172 genes were found to be differentially expressed only in IFNβ-treated Sirt2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3, C and D, and Table S2), whereas 42 genes were differentially expressed only in IFNβ-treated Sirt2−/− MEFs (Fig. 3, C and E, and Table S3). To further characterize the differentially expressed genes found only in IFNβ-treated Sirt2+/+ MEFs, gene set pathways and process enrichment analyses were performed. The group of genes whose transcriptional induction by IFNβ is Sirt2-dependent (Table S2) were associated with pathways involved in the defense response to virus, lymphocyte migration, inflammatory responses, regulation of innate immune responses, regulation of erythrocyte differentiation, regulation of growth, and positive regulation of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (Fig. 3F and Table S4), suggesting that SIRT2 might play an important role in type I IFN–dependent biological functions. In further studies, we confirmed the requirement for SIRT2 activity in the expression of several key ISGs using quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). As anticipated, expression of several ISGs was defective in the absence of Sirt2. Specifically, induction of Oasl2, Cxcl10, Isg15, and Isg54 by IFNβ was significantly defective in Sirt2−/− MEFs compared with Sirt2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 4A). We also determined whether SIRT2 activity is required for expression of ISG protein products. IFNβ treatment of Sirt2+/+ MEFs resulted in induction of ISG15 protein, however, this induction was defective in Sirt2−/− MEFs (Fig. 4B, left panel). Similar results were obtained with human U937 stably expressing control shRNA or SIRT2 shRNA (Fig. 4B, right panel).Figure 4Requirement of SIRT2 activity for type I IFN–dependent gene transcription and protein expression.

Depletion of Sirt2 in MEFs resulted in decreased cellular sensitivity to type I IFN-induced antiproliferative responses (Fig. 5A). Next, we examined the role of SIRT2 in the generation of type I IFN–dependent anti-leukemic activity in cells expressing the JAK2(V617F) mutation, which is a critical pathogenic mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasms (31Kiladjian J.J. Mesa R.A. Hoffman R. The renaissance of interferon therapy for the treatment of myeloid malignancies.Blood. 2011; 117 (21389325): 4706-471510.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we performed studies involving siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRT2 in human erythroleukemia HEL cells and in SET-2 cells derived from an essential thrombocythemia patient at the megakaryoblastic leukemic transformation phase that express the JAK2(V617F) mutation (32Quentmeier H. MacLeod R.A. Zaborski M. Drexler H.G. JAK2 V617F tyrosine kinase mutation in cell lines derived from myeloproliferative disorders.Leukemia. 2006; 20 (16408098): 471-47610.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and are sensitive to type I IFN–mediated growth inhibition (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 5B, IFNα treatment significantly reduced proliferation of SET-2 cells, however, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRT2 (Fig. S2A) decreased the sensitivity of these cells to the antiproliferative effects of IFNα. Similarly, IFNα treatment suppressed the growth of primitive malignant hematopoietic precursors from HEL cells transfected with control siRNA, but this inhibition was suppressed by SIRT2 knockdown (Fig. 5C and Fig. S2B), indicating a requirement for SIRT2 in the generation of the inhibitory effects of type I IFNs on JAK2(V617F)-transformed cells. We also determined the potential involvement of SIRT2 in the generation of type I IFN anti-leukemic responses in the BCR-ABL expressing KT-1 leukemic cell line (33Yanagisawa K. Yamauchi H. Kaneko M. Kohno H. Hasegawa H. Fujita S. Suppression of cell proliferation and the expression of a bcr-abl fusion gene and apoptotic cell death in a new human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KT-1, by interferon-α.Blood. 1998; 91 (9427720): 641-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IFNα treatment suppressed growth of KT1-derived primitive leukemic progenitors (CFU-L) in clonogenic assays in methylcellulose (Fig. 5D). However, these suppressive effects were blocked by siRNA-mediated SIRT1/2 knockdown (Fig. S2C), indicating that SIRT1/2 activity is required for IFNα–dependent anti-leukemic effects. In further studies, we examined whether engagement of SIRT activity is necessary for the generation of the suppressive effects of IFNα on normal hematopoiesis. Normal human bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells were transfected with siRNA to knockdown the expression of SIRT1/2 and the inhibitory effects of IFNα were determined. As anticipated, treatment with IFNα resulted in significant suppression of normal myeloid (CFU-GM) and early erythroid (BFU-E) hematopoietic progenitors growth in colony formation assays (Fig. S3). Targeted inhibition of SIRT1/2 reversed these effects (Fig. S3). Together, these data indicate that SIRT2 activity is required for induction of type I IFN-driven antiproliferative effects in both normal and malignant cells.

https://openalex.org/W2902290505,"Oxidative stress results in activation of several signal transduction pathways controlled by the PERK-substrate NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2); meanwhile the ongoing cell division cycle has to be blocked. It has been recently shown that Cyclin D1 got immediately down-regulated via PERK pathway in response to oxidative stress leading to cell cycle arrest. However, the effect of NRF2 on cell cycle regulation has not been explored yet. We aimed to reveal a crosstalk between PERK-substrate NRF2 and the key elements of cell cycle regulatory network upon oxidative stress using molecular biological techniques- Although Cyclin D1 level remained constant, its activity was blocked by various stoichiometric inhibitors (such as p15, p21 and p27) even at low level of oxidative stress. The activity of these CDK inhibitors completely disappeared, when the addition of oxidative agent was combined with silencing of either PERK or NRF2.This further confirms the important role of NRF2 in blocking Cyclin D1 with stoichiometric inhibitors at early stage of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2902106847,"The modelling of deceptions in game theory and decision theory has not been well studied, despite the increasing importance of this problem in social media, public discourse, and organisational management. This paper presents an improved formulation of the extant information-theoretic models of deceptions, a framework for incorporating these models of deception into game and decision theoretic models of deception, and applies these models and this framework in an agent based evolutionary simulation that models two very common deception types employed in “fake news” attacks. The simulation results for both deception types modelled show, as observed empirically in many social systems subjected to “fake news” attacks, that even a very small population of deceivers that transiently invades a much larger population of non-deceiving agents can strongly alter the equilibrium behaviour of the population in favour of agents playing an always defect strategy. The results also show that the ability of a population of deceivers to establish itself or remain present in a population is highly sensitive to the cost of the deception, as this cost reduces the fitness of deceiving agents when competing against non-deceiving agents. Diffusion behaviours observed for agents exploiting the deception producing false beliefs are very close to empirically observed behaviours in social media, when fitted to epidemiological models. We thus demonstrate, using the improved formulation of the information-theoretic models of deception, that agent based evolutionary simulations employing the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma can accurately capture the behaviours of a population subject to deception attacks introducing uncertainty and false perceptions, and show that information-theoretic models of deception have practical applications beyond trivial taxonomical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2902839015,"Release of extracellular vesicles (EV) by Gram-negative and positive bacteria is being frequently reported. EV are nano-sized, membrane-derived, non-self-replicating, spherical structures shed into the extracellular environment that could play a role in bacteria-host interactions. Evidence of EV production in bacteria belonging to the class Mollicutes, which are wall-less, is mainly restricted to the genus Acholeplasma and is scanty for the Mycoplasma genus that comprises major human and animal pathogens. Here EV release by six Mycoplasma (sub)species of clinical importance was investigated. EV were obtained under nutritional stress conditions, purified by ultracentrifugation and observed by electron microscopy. The membrane proteins of EV from three different species were further identified by mass spectrometry as a preliminary approach to determining their potential role in host-pathogen interactions. EV were shown to be released by all six (sub)species although their quantities and sizes (30–220 nm) were very variable. EV purification was complicated by the minute size of viable mycoplasmal cells. The proteins of EV-membranes from three (sub)species included major components of host-pathogen interactions, suggesting that EV could contribute to make the host-pathogen interplay more complex. The process behind EV release has yet to be deciphered, although several observations demonstrated their active release from the plasma membrane of living cells. This work shed new light on old concepts of “elementary bodies” and “not-cell bound antigens”."

However, to date there has scant study of hypertension in relation to menstrual characteristics and abnormalities. We hypothesize that adverse menstrual characteristics are associated with an increase the prevalence of hypertension and that this relationship is exacerbated by obesity.Our study leverages 178,205 healthy female participants (mean age = 29) in a population-based cross-sectional study in Tianjin, China. Menstrual characteristics including menstrual cycle length and regularity, menstrual bleeding length, menstrual blood loss and dysmenorrhea were assessed by self-reported questionnaires, and hypertension was diagnosed by physician. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the relationships between menstrual characteristics and hypertension.Normal length menstrual cycle (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03-1.41), oligomenorrhea (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.12-2.07), irregular cycle (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.22-1.93), and light menstrual blood loss (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.06-1.72) were associated with hypertension among women who are overweight or obese, but not among women who are normal weight. Longer menstrual bleeding duration (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.24-1.67) and dysmenorrhea were associated with increased prevalence of hypertension (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.14-1.41) in all young women.The prevalence of hypertension is higher among women with menstrual abnormalities, and this association is modified by overweight and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2902330969,"The discovery and use of fluorescent proteins revolutionized cell biology by allowing the visualization of proteins in living cells. Advances in fluorescent proteins, primarily through genetic engineering, have enabled more advanced analyses, including Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and the development of genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors. These fluorescence protein-based sensors are highly effective in cells grown in monolayer cultures. However, it is often desirable to use more complex models including tissue explants, organoids, xenografts, and whole animals. These types of samples have poor light penetration owing to high scattering and absorption of light by tissue. Far-red light with a wavelength between 650-900nm is less prone to scatter, and absorption by tissues and can thus penetrate more deeply. Unfortunately, there are few fluorescent proteins in this region of the spectrum, and they have sub-optimal fluorescent properties including low brightness and short fluorescence lifetimes. Understanding the relationships between the amino-acid sequences of far-red fluorescence proteins and their photophysical properties including peak emission wavelengths and fluorescence lifetimes would be useful in the design of new fluorescence proteins for this region of the spectrum. We used both site-directed mutagenesis and gene-shuffling between mScarlet and mCardinal fluorescence proteins to create new variants and assess their properties systematically. We discovered that for far-red, GFP-like proteins the emission maxima and fluorescence lifetime have a strong inverse correlation."

Erectile dysfunction was defined as IIEF-5 ≦21.Finally, we included 1056 participants (993 street, 63 hospital KAs) with a mean age of 27.4 ±6.2 years. ED presented in 30.8% of all KAs. and Hospital KAs were more subject to having ED than street KAs (69.6% vs. 28.0%, p<0.01). Multi-variate analysis revealed that risk factor for male ED were age ≧30 years (OR = 1.765). Subgroup analysis on male street KAs disclosed that abstinence ≧3 months is a protective factor for ED. Lower urinary tract symptoms (ICSI+ICPI ≧12) was prevalent in KAs and multivariate analysis disclosed that significant risk factors for LUTS (ICSI+ICPI ≧12) were age ≧30 years, duration ≧24 months and co-use of other illicit drugs.Male ED and LUTS were frequently observed in the ketamine abusers. We suggested that street ketamine abuse should be considered in young men presented with ED and LUTS in the clinics."
https://openalex.org/W2903216643,"Background Elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection requires high diagnostic rates and universal access to treatment. Around 40% of infected individuals are unaware of their infection, which indicates that effective screening strategies are needed. We analyzed the efficiency (incremental cost-utility ratio, ICUR) of 3 HCV screening strategies: a) general population of adults, b) high-risk groups, and c) population with the highest anti-HCV prevalence plus high-risk groups. Methods An analytical decision model, projecting progression of the disease over a lifetime, was used to establish the candidate population for HCV screening. HCV data were obtained from the literature: anti-HCV prevalence (0.56%-1.54%), viremic patients (31.5%), and percentage of undiagnosed persons among those with viremia (35%). It was assumed that most patients would be treated and have HCV therapy response (98% SVR); transition probabilities, utilities, and disease management annual costs were obtained from the literature. Efficiency over the life of patients under the National Health System perspective was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and total cost (screening, diagnosis, pharmacological and disease management). A discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and outcomes. Results Screening of the adult population would identify a larger number of additional chronic hepatitis C cases (N = 52,694) than screening the highest anti-HCV prevalence population plus high-risk groups (N = 42,027) or screening high-risk groups (N = 26,128). ICUR for the general population vs. high-risk groups was €8914/QALY gained per patient (€18,157 incremental cost and 2.037 QALY). ICUR for the general population vs. population with highest anti-HCV prevalence plus high-risk groups was €7,448/QALY gained per patient (€7,733 incremental cost and 1.038 QALY). These ICUR values are below the accepted efficiency threshold (€22,000-€30,000). Conclusion HCV screening and treatment of the general adult population is cost-effective compared to screening of high-risk groups or the population with the highest anti-HCV prevalence plus high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2903550449,"Bald’s eyesalve is an Anglo-Saxon medicinal remedy that has been used through ancient times to treat eye sty infections and may represent a source of ancientbiotics. This study assessed the efficacy of Bald’s eyesalve against several strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including a multi-drug resistant phenotype, and identified the principal compound conveying antibacterial activity. Bald’s eyesalve formulations were produced by combining garlic, onion or leek, wine, bovine bile, and brass, with specific ingredient omissions in several formulations, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 9 days. Bald’s eyesalve formulation ES-GBBr exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Fractionation of ES-GBBr using molecular size exclusion and organic solvent partitioning isolated its antibacterial activity to the small molecule nonpolar fraction, and 1D 1H NMR revealed the identity of the antibacterial agent to be allicin. Depletion of allicin from this fraction by addition of exogenous cysteine established that all observable growth inhibition originated from allicin. Quantification of allicin demonstrated that its concentration was significantly greater in ES-GBBr compared to the ES-O formulation; however, this was not due to greater yield. The antibacterial activity of allicin against S. aureus was antagonized by other ingredients within Bald’s eyesalve, whereas they were additive or synergistic against P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that neither leek nor onion is necessary for the antibacterial efficacy of Bald’s eyesalve against S. aureus or P. aeruginosa, and while allicin was identified as the principal antibacterial agent present, its activity is influenced differentially in the presence of additional Bald’s eyesalve ingredients when used against S. aureus compared to P. aeruginosa. Ancientbiotics may provide a source of promising antibacterials; however, identifying the source of activity and assessing distinct formulations for cooperative effects are essential to using ancient remedies, such as Bald’s eyesalve, effectively against drug resistant pathogens."

The aim of this study is to explore the health seeking practices and factors contributing to delay in TB diagnosis. Methods This study was based on explorative qualitative research using a constructivist grounded theory approach. A total of 61 TB patients in the intensive phase of treatment were recruited as informants in the study. Six focus group discussions and 15 in-depth interviews were used to collect data. Data were analysed through three step coding using the grounded theory approach. Results Participants adopted different treatment pathways as they sought care from a pluralistic health care system involving traditional healers, herbalists, private clinic, drug shops and the public health sector. The study revealed an explanatory model of factors leading to delay illustrated by the participant’s expression “I suffered for a long time.” The model is comprised of three categories that lead to delays, namely individual, social-cultural and structural factors. Conclusion There is a need to improve timely diagnosis of TB through innovative approaches such as intensive case finding. Similarly, the health-care system should decentralize TB services as much as possible and offer free diagnostic services to increase accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W2902137174,"Cerebral palsy (CP) encompasses a group of non-progressive brain disorders that are often acquired through perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. Injury leads to a cascade of cell death events, resulting in lifetime motor and cognitive deficits. There are currently no treatments that can repair the resulting brain damage and improve functional outcomes. To date, preclinical research using neural precursor cell (NPC) transplantation as a therapy for HI brain injury has shown promise. To translate this treatment to the clinic, it is essential that human-derived NPCs also be tested in animal models, however, a major limitation is the high risk of xenograft rejection. A solution is to transplant the cells into immune-deficient rodents, but there are currently no models of HI brain injury established in such a cohort of animals. Here, we demonstrate that a model of HI brain injury can be generated in immune-deficient Prkdc knockout (KO) rats. Long-term deficits in sensorimotor function were similar between KO and wildtype (WT) rats. Interestingly, some aspects of the injury were more severe in KO rats. Additionally, human induced pluripotent stem cell derived (hiPSC)-NPCs had higher survival at 10 weeks post-transplant in KO rats when compared to their WT counterparts. This work establishes a reliable model of neonatal HI brain injury in Prkdc KO rats that will allow for future transplantation, survival, and long-term evaluation of the safety and efficacy of hiPSC-NPCs for neonatal brain damage. This model will enable critical preclinical translational research using human NPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2808195529,"Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) dysfunction contributes to diabetes-induced delay in endothelium repair after vessel injury, prominently associated with diabetic cardiovascular complications such as neointima formation. ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) promotes cholesterol efflux to HDL, which may favorably affect EPC function. However, whether ABCG1 improves EPC function, especially in diabetes, remains unknown. Here we investigated the role of ABCG1 in EPCs by using Tie2-mediated ABCG1 transgenic (Tie2- ABCG1Tg) mice. Mice were injected with streptozotocin to induce diabetes mellitus. As compared with wild-type (WT) mice, in Tie2- ABCG1Tg mice, diabetes-impaired EPC migration and tube formation were reversed. In vitro gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies further revealed that ABCG1-overexpressing EPCs showed increased migration and tube formation and differentiation via the Lck/Yes-related novel protein tyrosine kinase /Akt/endothelial NO synthase pathway by enhancing cellular cholesterol efflux. Finally, type 1 and type 2 diabetic mouse models with arterial injury were intravenously injected with labeled EPCs from WT or Tie2- ABCG1Tg mice. Re-endothelialization in diabetic mice was improved to a greater extent by injection of ABCG1-overexpressing than WT EPCs. Our study demonstrated that ABCG1 in EPCs improved repair after vascular injury in diabetes by increasing EPC function such as migration, tube formation and differentiation, and subsequent re-endothelialization. ABCG1 might be a promising therapeutic target for diabetes-associated vascular diseases.-Shi, Y., Lv, X., Liu, Y., Li, B., Liu, M., Yan, M., Liu, Y., Li, Q., Zhang, X., He, S., Zhu, M., He, J., Zhu, Y., Zhu, Y., Ai, D.

Furthermore, AF leads to a hypercoagulable state, which in turn promotes the development of a substrate for AF and disease progression in the experimental setting. The aim of this study was to identify pathways associated with LA remodeling in AF patients using untargeted proteomics approach.Peripheral blood samples of 48 patients (62±10 years, 63% males, 59% persistent AF) undergoing AF catheter ablation were collected before ablation. 23 patients with left atrial low voltage areas (LVA), defined as <0.5 mV, and 25 patients without LVA were matched for age, gender and CHA2DS2-VASc score. Untargeted proteome analysis was performed using LC-ESI-Tandem mass spectrometry in a label free intensity based workflow. Significantly different abundant proteins were identified and used for pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis.Analysis covered 280 non-redundant circulating plasma proteins. The presence of LVA correlated with 30 differentially abundant proteins of coagulation and complement cascade (q<0.05).This pilot proteomic study identified plasma protein candidates associated with electro-anatomical remodeling in AF and pointed towards an imbalance in coagulation and complement pathway, tissue remodeling and inflammation."

Design Cross-sectional observational study. Settings Community-based medical checkups, called specific health checkups started in Japan since 2008. This checkup includes standard medical examinations as well as a specific questionnaire related to lifestyle habits. Participants Overall, 47,842 subjects (males = 16,913, 35.4%) aged ≥40 years who underwent a Japanese specific health checkup in 2014 in Kanazawa city were included. Main outcome measures Association between 12 lifestyle habits-related questionnaires and the presence of ASCVD, including coronary artery disease and stroke. The questionnaire included the following 12 questions on lifestyle habits: 1) weight gain (>10 kg/20 years), 2) exercise (>30 min, twice a week, >1 year), 3) daily walking or equivalent (>1 h), 4) walking faster (than others in the same generation), 5) body weight changes (>3 kg/year), 6) eating faster (than others in the same generation), 7) eating within 2 h before going to bed (more than three times a week), 8) having a snack after dinner (more than three times a week), 9) skipping breakfast (more than three times a week), 10) daily drinking (alcohol), 11) heavy drinking (more than 60 g ethanol/day), and 12) good sleeping. Results Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that walking faster (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69–0.79, p < 0.0003), body weight changes (>3 kg/year, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.16–1.37, p < 0.0003), eating faster (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.03–1.15, p = 0.003), daily drinking (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.76–0.89, p < 0.0003), and good sleeping (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.79–0.93, p < 0.0003) were independently associated with ASCVD. Subjects with a high lifestyle habits risk score (number of bad habits: 7–12) had significantly higher odds for ASCVD than those with a low risk score (number of bad habits: 0–3, OR = 1.78, 95%CI = 1.62–1.95, p < 0.0003). Conclusion Simple questionnaires related to lifestyle habits were associated with self-reported ASCVD."

In this study, we performed preliminary evaluation of the possibility of conducting MEOR at Mae Soon reservoir, an onshore reservoir in Northern Thailand. The reservoir's physicochemical characteristics, including the characteristics of the wells, the oil-bearing sandstone cores, and the reservoir's produced water, were determined. The microbiological characteristics of the oil wells in the reservoir were also investigated by submerging the reservoir's sandstone core samples, obtained from 6 oil wells, in the reservoir's produced water and in the produced water added with inorganic nutrients (KNO3 and NaH2PO4). The uncultured bacteria in both treatments were determined, using tagged 16S rRNA gene amplicon with Ion Torrent Sequencing Analysis. The effects of inorganic nutrients and the reservoir's parameters on the bacterial communities were analysed. A total number of 16,828 OTUs were taxonomically classified into 89 classes and 584 genera. In the controls (sandstone cores submerged in the produced water), the dominant bacterial populations were related to Deinococcus-Thermus, and Betaproteobacteria; while in the nutrient treated samples, there was a marked increase in the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in three samples. Thermus, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas were the most abundant genera, and these are potential microorganisms for MEOR. Analysis of correlations between physiochemical properties of the reservoir and bacterial genera, using spearman's correlation analysis, suggested that some of the reservoir's properties, especially of the well and the rock, could influence some bacterial genera. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the effect of inorganic nutrients on alteration of bacterial communities attached to reservoir's rock, and how the bacterial, physical, and chemical properties of a reservoir were co-analysed to serve as a basis for designing a MEOR process."
https://openalex.org/W2902918753,"Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has revealed that brain regions can be grouped into functional brain networks (fBNs) or communities. A community in fMRI analysis signifies a group of brain regions coupled functionally with one another. In neuroimaging, functional connectivity (FC) measure can be utilized to quantify such functionally connected regions for disease diagnosis and hence, signifies the need of devising novel FC estimation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method of learning FC by constraining its rank and the sum of non-zero coefficients. The underlying idea is that fBNs are sparse and can be embedded in a relatively lower dimension space. In addition, we propose to extract overlapping networks. In many instances, communities are characterized as combinations of disjoint brain regions, although recent studies indicate that brain regions may participate in more than one community. In this paper, large-scale overlapping fBNs are identified on resting state fMRI data by employing non-negative matrix factorization. Our findings support the existence of overlapping brain networks."

We investigated the demographic data, diameter and sources of graft, onset time, location, scope, time of healing and treatment of epithelial defects, as well as other postoperative complications and graft clarity. 114 of the 594 grafts (19.2%) that developed epithelial defects were included in the epithelial defects group, while the other 480 patients were classified in the non-defect group. The mean age of patients with epithelial defects was statistically greater than that of patients without epithelial defects (P = 0.006). The epithelial defects group accounted for a larger proportion of male patients (P<0.001). The proportion of patients with a graft diameter >9mm in the epithelial defect group (29.8%) was more than that in the non-defects group (16.3%) (P = 0.001). The incidence of epithelial defects significantly differed among the pathogenic causes of infectious keratitis (P = 0.002). The incidence of graft infection (21.1%, 9.2%, respectively, P<0.001) and graft dysfunction (7.9%, 2.5%, respectively, P = 0.012) in the epithelial defect group was higher than in the non-defects group. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that male sex (P = 0.001), age ≥ 60 years (P = 0.024), graft diameter >9mm (P = 0.001), bacterial (P = 0.039) and herpes simplex keratitis (P = 0.008), rheumatism (P = 0.031) and cancer treated with chemo- or radiotherapy (P = 0.032) were independent risk factors for epithelial defects. Graft clarity after epithelial defects were significantly differed between fungal and viral infections (P<0.001). We found that being an elderly male patient, a graft diameter >9 mm, bacterial and viral keratitis and systemic diseases (including rheumatism and cancer treated with chemo- or radiotherapy) were independent risk factors for postoperative epithelial defects."

We sought to develop an improved protocol for CRISPR/Cas9 that would correct mutations without unintended consequences. As a case study, we focused on achondroplasia, a common genetic form of dwarfism defined by missense mutation in the Fgfr3 gene that results in glycine to arginine substitution at position 374 in mice in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (Fgfr3-G374R), which corresponds to G380R in humans. First, we designed a GFP reporter system that can evaluate the cutting efficiency and specificity of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Using the sgRNA selected based on our GFP reporter system, we conducted targeted therapy of achondroplasia in mice. We found that we achieved higher frequency of precise correction of the Fgfr3-G374R mutation using Cas9 protein rather than Cas9 mRNA. We further demonstrated that targeting oligos of 100 and 200 nucleotides precisely corrected the mutation at equal efficiency. We showed that our strategy completely suppressed phenotypes of achondroplasia and whole genome sequencing detected no off-target effects.

This paper addresses the mechanism design problem of the 4PL for selecting a third party logistics (3PL) provider who involves loss-averse behavior to form a longer-term strategic partnership in multi-attribute reverse auctions. Due to fluctuating costs of energy or labor and unintentional delivery failures like traffic jam or technology malfunctions, we consider two incomplete attributes, namely cost uncertainty and delivery risk. Integrating the loss-averse behavior of 3PLs, based on the prospect theory, the bid decision model is constructed to obtain 3PLs' bidding strategies. The corresponding efficient and optimal scoring auctions that consist of cost-sharing contract and contingent penalty are developed to maximize the ex ante expected profit of the system or the 4PL depending on whether the 4PL is willing to cooperate or not. Theoretical analysis verified by numerical examples illustrates the advantage of the proposed mechanisms. Impacts of model parameters on the 4PL's decision are also investigated and managerial insights are presented."

Recreational boating is a very important component of the diverse maritime traffic in the southeastern United States. The seasonal distribution of offshore recreational vessels in waters off the coast of Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia was modeled using several techniques (Poisson, negative binomial, hurdle and zero inflated modes, generalized additive models, and generalized mixed models) and by combining map-based information provided by recreational boaters with environmental and geographical variables to find the most parsimonious model. Based on model performance, the final model analysis was conducted using a GAM approach with a negative binomial distribution. The best seasonal models explained between 86.1%– 88.6% of the total deviance. For most seasons, a model that included latitude, longitude, interaction between latitude and longitude, chlorophyll a concentration, and abundance of artificial reefs resulted in the best fit. The only exception was the model for the summer season, which did not include chlorophyll a concentration. Given the complexity of the study area, with a number of maritime activities and several marine species co-occurring, these models could provide information to analyze the distribution and overlap of recreational boating trips with other maritime activities (e.g., cargo ships, commercial vessels) and species (e.g., right whales, sea turtles, sharks).

https://openalex.org/W2903452814,"The giant pandas’ (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) reproductive strategy is unique among mammals. Yet there are characteristics of giant panda behaviour we do not fully understand. Probably one of the least understood is the assumption that in captivity virtually all giant panda females rear only one cub when twins are born and abandon the other if given the chance. So far, only two females have raised twins simultaneously, but just with intensive human assistance. This case-study marks the first successful rearing of giant panda twins in captivity entirely by the mother. Using video data for detailed behavioural observations, we provide the first behavioural assessment of a giant panda female raising two cubs simultaneously without direct human assistance or disturbance. We compared the maternal behaviour during the denning period of twin cubs raised in 2016 with two singleton cubs born 2007 and 2010. YANG YANG, the dam, rested less and interacted more with the twins than with the singletons in the first month postpartum and invested a greater part of her daily time budget on rearing the twins. We discuss potential favourable factors for the autonomous twin-rearing of a female giant panda, which could serve as a model for similar efforts elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2883876032,"Binge drinking, an increasingly common form of alcohol consumption, is associated with increased mortality and morbidity; yet, its effects on the immune system's ability to defend against infectious agents are poorly understood. Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis can occur in healthy humans, yet binge alcohol use is progressively being recognized as a major risk factor. Although our previous studies demonstrated that binge alcohol exposure results in reduced alveolar macrophage function and increased Burkholderia virulence in vitro, no experimental studies have investigated the outcomes of binge alcohol on Burkholderia spp. infection in vivo.In this study, we used the close genetic relatives of B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis E264 and B. vietnamiensis, as useful BSL-2 model systems. Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were administered alcohol comparable to human binge drinking episodes (4.4 g/kg) or PBS intraperitoneally 30 min before a non-lethal intranasal infection. In an initial B. thailandensis infection (3 x 105), bacteria accumulated in the lungs and disseminated to the spleen in alcohol administered mice only, compared with PBS treated mice at 24 h PI. The greatest bacterial load occurred with B. vietnamiensis (1 x 106) in lungs, spleen, and brain tissue by 72 h PI. Pulmonary cytokine expression (TNF-α, GM-CSF) decreased, while splenic cytokine (IL-10) increased in binge drunk mice. Increased lung and brain permeability was observed as early as 2 h post alcohol administration in vivo. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was significantly decreased, while intracellular invasion of non-phagocytic cells increased with 0.2% v/v alcohol exposure in vitro.Our results indicate that a single binge alcohol dose suppressed innate immune functions and increased the ability of less virulent Burkholderia strains to disseminate through increased barrier permeability and intracellular invasion of non-phagocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2902654642,"Background Rising antibiotic resistance poses a challenge to the management of febrile neutropenia in patients with haematological malignancies receiving chemotherapy. Aim We studied an alternating first-line antibiotic strategy to determine its impact on all-cause mortality and bacteremia rates in patients with febrile neutropenia. Methods An alternating first-line antibiotic strategy was established in mid-2013. Data for 2012 (before strategy implementation) and 2014 (post-strategy implementation) were compared. Antibiotic Heterogeneity Index (AHI) for each of the two time-periods was also calculated. Findings There were 2012 admissions (26082 patient-days) in 2012 and 1843 admissions (24331 patient-days) in 2014. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of patients in the two groups. The defined daily doses (DDD) of cefepime (CEF) fell while the DDD of piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) rose in 2014 compared with 2012. Vancomycin DDD fell in 2014. The AHI was 0.466 in 2012 and 0.582 in 2014. The difference in all-cause mortality was not statistically significant. There was no difference in rates of bacteremia with CEF-resistant, PTZ-resistant and carbapenem-resistant gram-negative organisms in the two groups. Rates of new cases of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 2.38/1000 and 2.59/1000 patient-days in 2012 and 2014 respectively. Rates of new cases of Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) were 1.84/1000 and 1.81/1000 patient-days in 2012 and 2014 respectively. There was no Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) bacteremia in 2012 and 1 in 2014. Conclusion An alternating first-line antibiotic strategy resulted in an increase in antibiotic heterogeneity, without increasing mortality. There was also no significant increase in bacteremia rates."

https://openalex.org/W2902377646,"Ischemia-induced left ventricular (LV) wall thickening compromises the hemodynamic effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, accurate assessment of the severity of ischemia-induced LV wall thickening during CPR is challenging. We investigated, in a swine model, whether hemodynamic parameters, including end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) level, are linearly associated with the severity of ischemia-induced LV wall thickening during CPR of consistent quality. We retrospectively analyzed 96 datasets for ETCO2 level, arterial pressure, LV wall thickness, and the percent of measured end-diastolic volume (%EDV) relative to EDV at the onset of ventricular fibrillation from eight pigs. Animals underwent advanced cardiovascular life support based on resuscitation guidelines. During CPR, LV wall thickness progressively increased while %EDV progressively decreased. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressure and ETCO2 level were significantly correlated with LV wall thickness and %EDV. Linear mixed effect models revealed that, after adjustment for significant covariates, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were not associated with LV wall thickness or %EDV. ETCO2 level had a significant linear relationship with %EDV (P = 0.004). However, it could explain only 28.2% of the total variance of %EDV in our model. In conclusion, none of the hemodynamic parameters examined in this study appeared to provide sufficient information on the severity of ischemia-induced LV wall thickening."
https://openalex.org/W2902371821,"Classic Gestalt examples of perceptual grouping entail arrays of disconnected surfaces that are grouped on the basis of the surfaces' relative similarity or proximity. However, most natural environments contain multiple objects, each with multiple, connected surfaces. Moreover, an object in a scene is likely to partially occlude other objects in the 2-dimensional retinal projection of the scene. A central question, therefore, is how the visual system forms a 3-dimensional representation of multi-object scenes by determining which surfaces belong to which objects. To this end, a recently developed dynamic grouping methodology determines whether pairs of surfaces are grouped together on the basis of the direction in which motion is perceived across a surface when its luminance is perturbed. It is shown using this method that the visible surfaces of a partially occluded object are perceptually grouped when they are plausibly connected and represented in a depth plane behind the occluding object. Invisible connectivity (amodal completion) as well as connectivity established by a visible surface have a powerful influence on the grouping of surfaces. However, for neither kind of connectivity is grouping affected by the distance between the surfaces. This absence of a distance/proximity effect on grouping is obtained when the space between to-be-grouped surfaces is filled with other surfaces. It contrasts with the strong effect of distance/proximity on the grouping of disconnected surfaces, and on the clarity of illusory contours formed between disconnected contours. It is concluded that distance/proximity is an operative grouping variable only when there is empty space between the to-be-grouped surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2903048582,"Tuberculosis (TB) occurs in a wide range of mammalian species and thus poses a health risk to humans living or working in close proximity with TB infected animals. Despite a high incidence of M. bovis infections in domestic or wildlife species tuberculosis infections in rhinoceros have so far been very limited. Over the past 53 years, tuberculosis of the respiratory tract has been confirmed in just 22 rhinoceros, most of those infected not by M. bovis but M. tuberculosis. However, because of the zoonotic risk TB testing is recommended or becomes even mandatory in endangered species. The dilemma in rhinoceros and many other wildlife species; non-validated tests are highly inconsistent in their ability to identify TB infection. Current lack of TB diagnostics may result in TB positive rhinoceros living with the infection, transmitting it to those around them or in euthanasia of animals found unconfirmed at necropsy. This is an unacceptable diagnostic status considering that some species are critically endangered and therefore should not be euthanized in order to confirm suspicion of disease. To overcome this shortcoming we used bronchoscopy to detect mycobacteria in respiratory fluids of TB suspicious rhinoceros. Fluids from seven, TB suspicious white rhinoceros were harvested during 21 bronchoscopies. Our new approach: In addition to bacterial culture a dual quantitative PCR system tested for the general presence of DNA from NTM and more specifically for DNA from MTC. Both, bacterial culture and qPCR were negative for MTC in respiratory fluids of all rhinoceros (7/7). At the same time, respiratory fluids from six rhinoceros tested positive for the presence of NTM or other closely related bacteria (6/7). M. tuberculosis was found only once in an oesophageal aspirate. The high incidence of mycobacterial DNA in the respiratory tract suggests that white rhinoceros, as strict grazers, are immensely exposed to environmental bacteria of this genus. Presence of NTM in the respiratory or intestinal system could possibly cause false positive results in intradermal tests. A wider use of bronchoalveolar lavage is warranted to further elucidate immunologic response to NTM and exposure to, incidence and prevalence of MTC infections in rhinoceros."
