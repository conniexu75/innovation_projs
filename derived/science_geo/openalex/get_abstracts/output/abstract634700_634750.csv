https://openalex.org/W2949697738,"Currently, the most active electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2 to CO are gold-based nanomaterials, whereas non-precious metal catalysts have shown low to modest activity. Here, we report a catalyst of dispersed single-atom iron sites that produces CO at an overpotential as low as 80 millivolts. Partial current density reaches 94 milliamperes per square centimeter at an overpotential of 340 millivolts. Operando x-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the active sites to be discrete Fe3+ ions, coordinated to pyrrolic nitrogen (N) atoms of the N-doped carbon support, that maintain their +3 oxidation state during electrocatalysis, probably through electronic coupling to the conductive carbon support. Electrochemical data suggest that the Fe3+ sites derive their superior activity from faster CO2 adsorption and weaker CO absorption than that of conventional Fe2+ sites."

Currently available SLMs, as well as their performance, are limited by their large pixel sizes of the order of several micrometres. Further pixel size miniaturization has been stagnant due to the persistent challenge to reduce the inter-pixel crosstalk associated with the liquid crystal (LC) cell thickness, which has to be large enough to accumulate the required 2{\pi} phase difference. Here, we propose a concept of tunable dielectric metasurfaces modulated by a liquid crystal environment, which can provide abrupt phase change and uncouple the phase accumulation from the LC cell thickness, ultimately enabling the pixel size miniaturization. We present a proof-of-concept metasurface-based SLM device, configured to generate active beam steering with >35% efficiency and large beam deflection angle of 11{\deg}, with LC cell thickness of only 1.5 {\mu}m, much smaller than conventional devices. We achieve the pixel size of 1.14 {\mu}m corresponding to the image resolution of 877 lp/mm, which is 30 times larger comparing to the presently available commercial SLM devices. High resolution and viewing angle of the metasurface-based SLMs opens up a new path to the next generation of near-eye AR and 3D holographic display technologies."

Fernández-Ruiz et al. used multisite electrophysiological recordings combined with optogenetic activation of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in rats performing learning tasks. Learning and correct recall in spatial memory tasks were associated with extended sharp wave ripples. Artificially prolonging these ripples improved working memory performance, whereas aborting the late part of ripples decreased performance. Science , this issue p. 1082"

Nova et al. used infrared pulses to excite higher-frequency lattice modes that drive the crystal into a metastable ferroelectric phase, a phase that can persist for many hours. X. Li et al. used terahertz fields to drive the soft mode that moves the ions in the crystal into the positions they occupy in the new phase. The ferroelectric phase in this case was transient, lasting on the order of 10 picoseconds. Because these hidden phases can host exotic properties in otherwise conventional materials, the accessibility to and control of such hidden phases may broaden potential functionality and applications.

https://openalex.org/W2952947028,"ATP production under lockdown Cellular processes must respond to change, often by speeding up, slowing down, or stopping altogether. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthases use a transmembrane proton gradient to produce ATP, but this reaction can go in reverse and needs to be halted when conditions are unfavorable. Jinke Gu et al. purified a tetrameric ATP synthase complex from pig hearts that contained the endogenous inhibitory protein IF1. Targeted refinement yielded high-resolution views of the mammalian ATP synthase trapped in two different rotation states by IF1. The findings suggest that ATP synthase tetramers can be inhibited by at least three different mechanisms. Science , this issue p. 1068"

Derivation from the wild, bitter, and toxic almond required loss of the cyanogenic diglucoside amygdalin. Sánchez-Pérez et al. sequenced the almond genome and analyzed the genomic region responsible for this shift. The key change turned out to be a point mutation in a transcription factor that regulates production of P450 monooxygenases in the biosynthetic pathway for the toxic compound.

https://openalex.org/W2951849368,"Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that is effective in treating advanced liver cancer. Although its mechanism of action through several established cancer-related protein kinase targets is well-characterized, sorafenib induces variable responses among human tumors, and the cause for this variation is yet unknown. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we applied mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to Huh7.5 human liver cancer cells and found that sorafenib significantly affected the expression of the key lipogenic enzymes, especially stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), in these cells. Given that SCD1 catalyzes the most crucial and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids (FAs), we performed a lipidomic analysis, which showed a dramatically altered lipid profile in sorafenib-treated cells. Detection and analysis of free FAs showed that the levels of monounsaturated FAs, including oleate, were significantly decreased in those cells treated by sorafenib. Addition of oleate protected liver cancer cells from sorafenib-induced death and alleviated the abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology and function caused by the drug. Treatment with sorafenib suppressed ATP production, resulting in AMPK activation via phosphorylation. Further secondary effects included reduction of the levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in liver cancer cells. These effects were partly abolished in the presence of compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and ATP and adenosine, and SREBP1c overexpression also could be resistant to the effects of sorafenib, suggesting that the sorafenib-induced reduction in cell viability was mediated by the ATP-AMPK-mTOR-SREBP1 signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that sorafenib's anticancer activity in liver cancer cells is based on the inhibition of ATP production, SCD1 expression, and monounsaturated FA synthesis. In addition, the decreased monounsaturated FA synthesis further triggered the more serious reduction of ATP production in sorafenib-treated cells. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that sorafenib disrupts lipogenesis and triggers liver cancer cell death by targeting SCD1 through the ATP-AMPK-mTOR-SREBP1 pathway.-Liu, G., Kuang, S., Cao, R., Wang, J., Peng, Q., Sun, C. Sorafenib kills liver cancer cells by disrupting SCD1-mediated synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids via the ATP-AMPK-mTOR- SREBP1 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2953039196,"Although the role of the Hippo signaling pathway in development and tumorigenesis has been extensively studied in multiple organs, its role in ovarian follicle development remains largely unknown. Here, we report that Yes-Associated Protein 1 (YAP1), the major effector of Hippo signaling, is spatiotemporally expressed in ovarian granulosa cells and plays a critical role in the regulation of follicle development. We found that the active form of YAP1 (nuclear YAP1) was predominantly expressed in proliferative granulosa cells, whereas the inactive form of YAP1 (cytoplasmic YAP1) was mainly detected in luteal cells (terminally differentiated granulosa cells). Pharmacological inhibition of YAP1 activity disrupted mouse ovarian follicle development in vitro and in vivo. Foxl2 promoter-driven knockout of Yap1 in ovarian granulosa cells resulted in increased apoptosis of granulosa cells, decreased number of corpora lutea, reduced ovarian size, and subfertility in transgenic mice. However, Cyp19a1 promoter-driven knockout of Yap1 in differentiated granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles and luteal cells of corpora lutea had no effect on ovarian morphology and fertility. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that YAP1 interacted with epidermal growth factor receptor and TGF-β signaling pathways to regulate granulosa cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Results from this study identify YAP1 as a critical regulator of granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation. Balanced expression and activation of YAP1 is essential for follicle development and successful reproduction. YAP1 is a promising target for treatment of subfertility associated with abnormal granulosa cell function.-Lv, X., He, C., Huang, C., Wang, H., Hua, G., Wang, Z., Zhou, J., Chen, X., Ma, B., Timm, B. K., Maclin, V., Dong, J., Rueda, B. R., Davis, J. S., Wang, C. Timely expression and activation of YAP1 in granulosa cells is essential for ovarian follicle development."
https://openalex.org/W2952892773,"Hepatic steatosis is a hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is promoted by dysregulated de novo lipogenesis. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) is a crucial lipogenic enzyme that is up-regulated in individuals with NAFLD. A previous study has shown that acetylation of ACLY at Lys-540, Lys-546, and Lys-554 (ACLY-3K) increases ACLY protein stability by antagonizing its ubiquitylation, thereby promoting lipid synthesis and cell proliferation in lung cancer cells. But the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism in other cellular or tissue contexts or under other pathophysiological conditions awaits further investigation. Here, we show that ACLY-3K acetylation also promotes ACLY protein stability in AML12 cells, a mouse hepatocyte cell line, and found that the deacetylase sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) deacetylates ACLY-3K and destabilizes ACLY in these cells. Of note, the livers of mice and humans with NAFLD had increased ACLY protein and ACLY-3K acetylation levels and decreased SIRT2 protein levels. Mimicking ACLY-3K acetylation by replacing the three lysines with three glutamines (ACLY-3KQ variant) promoted lipid accumulation both in high glucose–treated AML12 cells and in the livers of high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet–fed mice. Moreover, overexpressing SIRT2 in AML12 cells inhibited lipid accumulation, which was more efficiently reversed by overexpressing the ACLY-3KQ variant than by overexpressing WT ACLY. Additionally, hepatic SIRT2 overexpression decreased ACLY-3K acetylation and its protein level and alleviated hepatic steatosis in HF/HS diet–fed mice. Our findings reveal a posttranscriptional mechanism underlying the up-regulation of hepatic ACLY in NAFLD and suggest that the SIRT2/ACLY axis is involved in NAFLD progression."
https://openalex.org/W2952982210,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) counteract protein tyrosine phosphorylation and cooperate with receptor-tyrosine kinases in the regulation of cell signaling. PTPs need to undergo oxidative inhibition for activation of cellular cascades of protein-tyrosine kinase phosphorylation following growth factor stimulation. It has remained enigmatic how such oxidation can occur in the presence of potent cellular reducing systems. Here, using in vitro biochemical assays with purified, recombinant protein, along with experiments in the adenocarcinoma cell line A431, we discovered that bicarbonate, which reacts with H2O2 to form the more reactive peroxymonocarbonate, potently facilitates H2O2-mediated PTP1B inactivation in the presence of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), and peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) together with NADPH. The cellular experiments revealed that intracellular bicarbonate proportionally dictates total protein phosphotyrosine levels obtained after stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and that bicarbonate levels directly correlate with the extent of PTP1B oxidation. In fact, EGF-induced cellular oxidation of PTP1B was completely dependent on the presence of bicarbonate. These results provide a plausible mechanism for PTP inactivation during cell signaling and explain long-standing observations that growth factor responses and protein phosphorylation cascades are intimately linked to the cellular acid–base balance."
https://openalex.org/W2952845819,"Antibodies are important for immunity and exist in several classes (IgM, IgD, IgA, IgG, IgE). They are composed of symmetric dimeric molecules with two antigen binding regions (Fab) and a constant part (Fc), usually depicted as Y-shaped molecules. Rheumatoid factors found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are autoantibodies binding to IgG and paradoxically appear to circulate in blood alongside with their antigen (IgG) without reacting with it. Here, it is shown that rheumatoid factors do not react with native IgG in solution, and that their epitopes only become accessible upon certain physico-chemical treatments (e.g. heat treatment at 57 °C), by physical adsorption on a hydrophobic surface or by antigen binding. Moreover, chemical cross-linking in combination with mass spectrometry showed that the native state of IgG is a compact (closed) form and that the Fab parts of IgG shield the Fc region and thereby control access of rheumatoid factors and presumably also some effector functions. It can be inferred that antibody binding to pathogen surfaces induces a conformational change, which exposes the Fc part with its effector sites and rheumatoid factor epitopes. This has strong implications for understanding antibody structure and physiology and necessitates a conceptual reformulation of IgG models."
https://openalex.org/W2951019778,"The sensors of the unfolded protein response react to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by transient activation of their enzymatic activities, which initiate various signaling cascades. In addition, the sensor IRE1α exhibits stress-induced clustering in a transient time frame similar to activation of its endoRNase activity. Previous work had suggested that the clustering response and RNase activity of IRE1α are functionally linked, but here we show that they are independent of each other and have different behaviors and modes of activation. Although both clustering and the RNase activity are responsive to luminal stress conditions and to depletion of the ER chaperone binding protein, RNase-inactive IRE1α still clusters and, conversely, full RNase activity can be accomplished without clustering. The clusters formed by RNase-inactive IRE1α are much larger and persist longer than those induced by ER stress. Clustering requires autophosphorylation, and an IRE1α mutant whose RNase domain is responsive to ligands that bind the kinase domain forms yet a third type of stress-independent cluster, with distinct physical properties and half-lives. These data suggest that IRE1α clustering can follow distinct pathways upon activation of the sensor.-Ricci, D., Marrocco, I., Blumenthal, D., Dibos, M., Eletto, D., Vargas, J., Boyle, S., Iwamoto, Y., Chomistek, S., Paton, J.

https://openalex.org/W2950736518,"Genomic regions subjected to selection frequently show signatures such as within-population reduced nucleotide diversity and outlier values of differentiation among differentially selected populations. In this study, we analyzed 50K SNP genotype data of 373 animals belonging to 23 sheep breeds of different geographic origins using the Rsb (extended haplotype homozygosity) and FST statistical approaches, to identify loci associated with the fat-tail phenotype. We also checked if these putative selection signatures overlapped with regions of high-homozygosity (ROH). The analyses identified novel signals and confirmed the presence of selection signature in genomic regions that harbor candidate genes known to affect fat deposition. Several genomic regions that frequently appeared in ROH were also identified within each breed, but only two ROH islands overlapped with the putative selection signatures. The results reported herein provide the most complete genome-wide study of selection signatures for fat-tail in African and Eurasian sheep breeds; they also contribute insights into the genetic basis for the fat tail phenotype in sheep, and confirm the great complexity of the mechanisms that underlie quantitative traits, such as the fat-tail."
https://openalex.org/W2952755989,"In addition to conventional cytology, liquid-based cytology (LBC) is also used for immunocytochemistry and gene analysis. However, an appropriate method to obtain high quality DNA for next-generation sequencing (NGS) using LBC specimens remains controversial. We determined the optimal conditions for fixation with an alcohol-based fixative for LBC and DNA extraction using cultured cancer cell lines and clinical specimens. The extracted DNA was processed for NGS after the DNA quality was confirmed based on the DNA concentration and degree of degradation. The optimal conditions for cultured cells to obtain high quality DNA were to fix the cells at a density of 6 × 103 or 2 × 104 cells/mL and to use the magnetic bead-based DNA extraction method. Even after storing the fixed cells for 90 days, DNA extracted using the above and other extraction kits, including membrane-based methods, did not undergo degradation. Furthermore, 5-year-old residual LBC samples demonstrated high DNA quality that was suitable for NGS. Furthermore, a cancer genome panel analysis was successfully performed with DNA extracted from cultured cells fixed at 6 × 103 cells/mL for 90 days, and with DNA from residual LBC samples even after 1 year of storage. Residual LBC samples may be a useful source of DNA for clinical NGS to promote genome-based cancer medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2949793129,"Planning for a re-emergent epidemic of smallpox requires surge capacity of space, resources and personnel within health systems. There are many uncertainties in such a scenario, including likelihood and size of an attack, speed of response and health system capacity. We used a model for smallpox transmission to determine requirements for hospital beds, contact tracing and health workers (HCWs) in Sydney, Australia, during a modelled epidemic of smallpox. Sensitivity analysis was done on attack size, speed of response and proportion of case isolation and contact tracing. We estimated 100638 clinical HCWs and 14595 public hospital beds in Sydney. Rapid response, case isolation and contact tracing are influential on epidemic size, with case isolation more influential than contact tracing. With 95% of cases isolated, outbreak control can be achieved within 100 days even with only 50% of contacts traced. However, if case isolation and contact tracing both fall to 50%, epidemic control is lost. With a smaller initial attack and a response commencing 20 days after the attack, health system impacts are modest. The requirement for hospital beds will vary from up to 4% to 100% of all available beds in best and worst case scenarios. If the response is delayed, or if the attack infects 10000 people, all available beds will be exceeded within 40 days, with corresponding surge requirements for clinical health care workers (HCWs). We estimated there are 330 public health workers in Sydney with up to 940,350 contacts to be traced. At least 3 million respirators will be needed for the first 100 days. To ensure adequate health system capacity, rapid response, high rates of case isolation, excellent contact tracing and vaccination, and protection of HCWs should be a priority. Surge capacity must be planned. Failures in any of these could cause health system failure, with inadequate beds, quarantine spaces, personnel, PPE and inability to manage other acute health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2950295828,"Treatment with cumulative dosages of zoledronic acid (ZA) in elderly patients is a risk factor for the development of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ), mainly related to surgical triggers such as tooth extraction. However, animal models for the investigation and understanding of MRONJ pathophysiology in senescent and postmenopausal stages remains to be developed and characterized. The aim of this study was to analyze MRONJ development in senescent female mice treated with cumulative dosages of ZA. For this purpose, twenty 129/Sv female mice, 64 weeks old, were treated with 0.9% saline solution as control group (n = 10), and with ZA at 250μg/Kg (n = 10), once a week, starting 4 weeks before the upper right incisor extraction and until the end of the experimental time points (7 days and 21 days). At 7 and 21 days post-surgery, specimens were harvested for microCT, histological, birefringence and immunohistochemical analysis. Clinically, an incomplete epithelialization was observed in ZA group at 7 days and a delayed bone matrix mineralization and collagen maturation at 7 and 21 days compared to the controls. Controls revealed sockets filled with mature bone at 21 days as observed by microCT and birefringence, while ZA group presented delayed bone deposition at 7 and 21 days, as well increased leukocyte infiltration and blood clot at 7 days, and increased bone sequestrum and empty osteocyte lacunae at 21 days (p<0.05). Also, ZA group presented decreased quantity of TGFb+ and Runx-2+ cells at 7 days, and decreased quantity of TRAP+ osteoclasts compared to the control at 21 days (p<0.05). Altogether, these data demonstrate the usefulness of this model to understanding the pathophysiology of MRONJ."
https://openalex.org/W2965282716,"Our objective was to analyze the relationship between transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measured on an unexposed area of skin and total serum bilirubin (TSB) in preterm infants before, during, and after phototherapy (PT). For this purpose paired TSB and TcB levels were measured daily during the first ten days after birth in preterm infants of less than 32 weeks’ gestation. TcB was measured with a Dräger Jaundice Meter JM-103 on the covered hipbone. Agreement between TSB and TcB levels was assessed before, during, and after PT. True negative and corresponding false negative percentages were calculated using different TcB cut-off levels. Data are presented as mean (±SD). We obtained 856 paired TcB and TSB levels in 109 preterm infants (66 boys, gestational age 29.4 ± 1.6 weeks and birth weight 1282 g ± 316 g). We found that the difference between TSB and TcB before PT was significantly lower, 44 (±36) μmol/L, than the difference during and after PT, 61 (±29) μmol/L and 63 (±25) μmol/L, respectively; P < 0.01. Blood sampling could be reduced by 42%, with 2% false negatives, when 50 μmol/L was added to the TcB level at 70% of the PT threshold. Our conclusion is that phototherapy enhances underestimation of TSB by TcB in preterms, even if measured on unexposed skin. The use of specific TcB cut-off levels substantially reduces the need for TSB measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2949649542,"Urban heat islands (UHIs) have a significant and negative impact on the urban ecological environment and on human health, and it is imperative to examine factors that lead to UHIs. Although numerous studies have been conducted in this field, little research has considered seasonal variations in UHIs in coastal cities. Moreover, parametric statistical analyses, such as regression and correlation analyses, have been typically applied to examine the influential factors. Such analyses are flawed because they cannot uncover the complicated relationships between UHIs and their factors. Taking Dalian, a coastal city in China, as an example, this paper reveals the dynamic mechanism of the UHI effect for different seasons using the cubist regression tree algorithm. Analyses suggest that the UHI effect only exists in spring and summer, and no obvious UHIs can be found in autumn and winter. The adjacency to the sea leads to moderate UHI effects in spring and summer and no UHI or urban cooling island (UCI) effects in autumn and winter. The distance to the coastline, however, does not play a role in the UHI effect. Furthermore, as one of the most important factors, the vegetation coverage plays a significant role in the UHI effect in spring and summer and significantly mediates the UHI in autumn and winter. Comparatively, the elevation (e.g., digital elevation models (DEMs)) is consistently negatively associated with the land surface temperature in all seasons, although a stronger relationship was found in spring and summer. In addition, the surface slope is also a significant factor in spring and winter, and the population density impacts the UHI distribution in summer as well."
https://openalex.org/W2951583233,"Objectives Beneficial effects of overweight and obesity on mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been described as “Body Mass Index (BMI) paradox”. However, the effects of BMI is still on debate. We analyzed the association between BMI and 1-year clinical outcomes after AMI. Methods Among 13,104 AMI patients registered in Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry-National Institute of Health (KAMIR-NIH) between November 2011 and December 2015, 10,568 patients who eligible for this study were classified into 3 groups according to BMI (Group 1; < 22 kg/m2, 22 ≤ Group 2 < 26 kg/m2, Group 3; ≥ 26 kg/m2). The primary end point was all cause death at 1 year. Results Over the median follow-up of 12 months, the event of primary end point occurred more frequently in the Group 1 patients than in the Group 3 patients (primary endpoint: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.537; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.177 to 2.007, p = 0.002). Especially, cardiac death played a major role in this effect (aHR, 1.548; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.128 to 2.124, p = 0.007). Conclusions Higher BMI appeared to be good prognostic factor on 1-year all cause death after AMI. This result suggests that higher BMI or obesity might confer a protective advantage over the life-quality after AMI."
https://openalex.org/W2951754226,"New nanomaterials are constantly developed with applications in everything from cosmetics to high tech electronics. Assessing their biological impact has been done by analysis of their adsorbed protein corona, in vitro cell assays, and larger scale ecotoxicological studies. This has proved to be a huge challenge due to the wide range of available nanomaterials and their unpredictable behaviour in different environments. Furthermore, the enormous number of experimental variables make comparisons difficult. Concentration is one of these variables and can vary greatly depending on the aim of the study. When analysing the protein corona, concentrations are often higher than in cell assays. Using a combination of complementary techniques, we have characterised 20 nm gold nanoparticles in a concentration level commonly used in cell studies. We compare their behaviour in a commonly used, protein rich medium and one protein poor medium over 24 hours. Under these conditions, the NPs were stable in protein rich environment but underwent gradual aggregation in protein poor medium. We characterise the biomolecular corona in both media. In protein poor medium, we can describe the often overlooked aggregation. The aggregates’ morphology is confirmed by cryo-TEM. Finally, in the protein poor medium, by infrared spectroscopy, we have identified the amino acid arginine in the biomolecular corona which drives the aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2952156241,"The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family is comprised of nine distinct receptors that are expressed exclusively on hematopoietic cells. Most of these transmembrane receptors are homotypic by nature and downstream signaling occurs when cells that express the same SLAM receptor interact. Previous studies have determined that anti-SLAMF6 antibodies can have a therapeutic effect in autoimmunity and cancer. However, little is known about the role of SLAMF6 in the adaptive immune responses and in order to utilize SLAMF6 interventional approaches, a better understanding of the biology of this receptor in T cell is warranted. Accordingly, the objective of our study was to investigate both functionally and structurally the role of SLAMF6 in T cell receptor (TCR) mediated responses. Biochemical and genetic experiments revealed that SLAMF6 was required for productive TCR downstream signaling. Interestingly, SLAMF6 ectodomain was required for its function, but not for its recruitment to the immunological synapse. Flow-cytometry analysis demonstrated that tyrosine 308 of the tail of SLAMF6 was crucial for its ability to enhance T cell function. Imaging studies revealed that SLAMF6 clustering, specifically with the TCR, resulted in dramatic increase in downstream signaling. Mechanistically, we showed that SLAMF6 enhanced T cell function by increasing T cell adhesiveness through activation of the small GTPase Rap1. Taken together SLAMF6 is an important regulator of T cell activation where both its ectodomain and its endodomain contribute differentially to T cell functions. Additional studies are underway to better evaluate the role of anti-SLAMF6 approaches in specific human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2950765736,"Ogura-type cytoplasmic male sterility (Ogura-CMS) has been widely used in the hybrid breeding industry for cruciferous vegetables. Turnip (Brassica rapa ssp. rapifera) is one of the most important local cruciferous vegetables in China, cultivated for its fleshy root as a flat disc. Here, morphological characteristics of an Ogura-CMS line ‘BY10-2A’ and its maintainer fertile (MF) line ‘BY10-2B’ of turnip were investigated. Ogura-CMS turnip showed a reduction in the size of the fleshy root, and had distinct defects in microspore development and tapetum degeneration during the transition from microspore mother cells to tetrads. Defective microspore production and premature tapetum degeneration during microgametogenesis resulted in short filaments and withered white anthers, leading to complete male sterility of the Ogura-CMS line. Additionally, the mechanism regulating Ogura-CMS in turnip was investigated using inflorescence transcriptome analyses of the Ogura-CMS and MF lines. The de novo assembly resulted in a total of 84,132 unigenes. Among them, 5,117 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 1,339 up- and 3,778 down-regulated genes in the Ogura-CMS line compared to the MF line. A number of functionally known members involved in anther development and microspore formation were addressed in our DEG pool, particularly genes regulating tapetum programmed cell death (PCD), and associated with pollen wall formation. Additionally, 185 novel genes were proposed to function in male organ development based on GO analyses, of which 26 DEGs were genotype-specifically expressed. Our research provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding anther development and the CMS mechanism in turnip."
https://openalex.org/W2952047753,"Minimal extrathyroidal extension (ETE) is defined as tumor cells extending to the sternothyroid muscle or perithyroidal soft tissue. However, there is controversy regarding whether the magnitude of ETE (minimal or gross) should be considered in assigning a precise TNM stage to patients with thyroid cancer in the seventh/eighth editions of the AJCC system. The present study evaluated Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data from 107,114 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (2004–2013) to determine whether the magnitude of ETE (thyroid confinement, minimal, or gross) influenced the ability to predict cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Patient mortality was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank tests. The cancer-specific mortality rates per 1,000 person-years were 1.407 for the thyroid confinement group (95% CI: 1.288–1.536), 5.133 for the minimal ETE group (95% CI: 4.301–6.124), and 29.735 for the gross ETE group (95% CI: 28.147–31.412). Relative to the thyroid confinement group, patients with minimal ETE and gross ETE had significantly poorer CSS and OS in the univariate and multivariate analyses (both P<0.001). After propensity-score matching according to age, sex, and race, we found that thyroid confinement was associated with better CSS and OS rates than minimal ETE (P<0.001) and gross ETE (P<0.001). These results from a population-based cohort provide a reference for precise personalized treatment and management of patients with minimal ETE. Furthermore, it may be prudent to revisit the magnitude of ETE as advocated by the AJCC and currently used for treatment recommendation by the American Thyroid Association."

One aim of this study was to study the prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes in women 55–59 years, with normal cytology when exiting the screening program. Secondly, HPV clearance as well as the value of HPV genotyping and/or liquid based cytology as triage tests for identifying histological dysplasia among women with persistent HPV was studied. Methods Women that exited the screening program with normal cytology, between the years 2012–2014, in Örebro County, Sweden, were invited to this study. A total of 2946 samples were analyzed with a broad-spectrum assay to detect both hrHPV and lrHPV in order to investigate the distribution of genotypes. In the consent group, women with a positive hrHPV test were offered a follow-up test and a cone biopsy for histological confirmation, and a follow up sample 6 months post cone. Results The overall prevalence of hrHPV was 7.4% and 59% of them remained hrHPV positive in a follow-up test after 12 months. A total of 99 women had a cone biopsy done, where 19% showed histological dysplasia. HPV 53 was the most common genotype, and among women with histology confirmed LSIL or HSIL, HPV 31 was most common. A positive hrHPV result showed a PPV of 25% for LSIL+ and 12.5%for HSIL+. Using detection of HPV 16/18 genotypes as a triage test for hrHPV positive tests, indicated FNR for histological LSIL+ and HSIL+ of 94% and 87.5% respectively, whilst triage based on cervical cytology had a FNR of 69% for LSIL+ and 37.5% for HSIL+. Conclusion The most common hrHPV genotypes among women 55–59 years of age were non HPV16/18 genotypes, and in this population, these genotypes represented most of the histological verified HSIL lesions. This result does not support the proposition of a HPV 16/18 triaging test after a positive hrHPV test as a marker of histological HSIL+ cervical lesions in women over 55 years of age. Similarly, cytological triage after a positive hrHPV showed no additional benefit in this population. Specific triaging tests should be validated to follow post-menopausal women with a positive hrHPV test."
https://openalex.org/W2953153142,"Due to the poor prognosis of advanced metastatic melanoma, it is crucial to find early biomarkers that help identify which melanomas will metastasize. By comparing the gene expression data from primary and cutaneous melanoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified GPC6 among a set of genes whose expression levels can distinguish between primary melanoma and regional cutaneous/subcutaneous metastases. Glypicans are thought to play a role in tumor growth by regulating the signaling pathways of Wnt, Hedgehogs, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). We showed that GPC6 expression was up-regulated in a melanoma cell line compared to normal melanocytes and in metastatic melanoma compared to primary melanoma. Furthermore, GPC6 expression was positively correlated with genes largely involved in cell adhesion and migration in both melanoma samples and in RNA-seq samples from other TCGA tumors. Our results suggest that GPC6 may play a role in tumor metastatic progression. In TCGA melanoma samples, we also showed that GPC6 expression was negatively correlated with miR-509-3p, which has previously been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in various cancer cell lines. We overexpressed miR-509-3p in A375 melanoma cells and showed that GPC6 expression was significantly suppressed. This result suggested that GPC6 was a putative target of miR-509-3p in melanoma. Together, our findings identified GPC6 as an early biomarker for melanoma metastatic progression, one that can be regulated by miR-509-3p."
https://openalex.org/W2949540034,"Background Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease including acute myocardial infarction. However, long-term effects of hypercholesterolemia in a rodent myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury model are unknown. Therefore, the effects of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia on cardiac function and remodeling were investigated up to eight weeks after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI-R) injury which was induced in either normocholesterolemic (NC-MI) or hypercholesterolemic (HC-MI) APOE*3-Leiden mice. Methods Left ventricular (LV) dimensions were serially assessed using parasternal long-axis echocardiography followed by LV pressure-volume measurements. Subsequently, infarct size and the inflammatory response were analyzed by histology and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Results Intrinsic LV function eight weeks after MI-R was significantly impaired in HC-MI compared to NC-MI mice as assessed by end-systolic pressure, dP/dtMAX, and -dP/dtMIN. Paradoxically, infarct size was significantly decreased in HC-MI compared to NC-MI mice, accompanied by an increased wall thickness. Hypercholesterolemia caused a pre-ischemic peripheral monocytosis, in particular of Ly-6Chi monocytes whereas accumulation of macrophages in the ischemic-reperfused myocardium of HC-MI mice was decreased. Conclusion Diet-induced hypercholesterolemia caused impaired LV function eight weeks after MI-R injury despite a reduced post-ischemic infarct size. This was preceded by a pre-ischemic peripheral monocytosis, while there was a suppressed accumulation of inflammatory cells in the ischemic-reperfused myocardium after eight weeks. This experimental model using hypercholesterolemic APOE*3-Leiden mice exposed to MI-R seems suitable to study novel cardioprotective therapies in a more clinically relevant animal model."

https://openalex.org/W2945532502,"The fast pace of urbanisation may benefit or be detrimental to the socio-economic status of urban areas. Understanding how the configuration of urban areas influences the socio-economic status of their inhabitants is of crucial importance for urban planning. In theory, urban scaling laws and polycentric development are two well-known concepts developed to increase our understanding of urbanisation and its socio-economic effects. In practice, however, they fall short to explain the socio-economic status of urban regions. The urban scaling concept is constructed from a theoretical perspective, but functional relationships between urban centres are not taken into account in scaling models. In contrast, the concept of polycentricity is developed from a practical perspective and incorporates the socio-economic effect of relationships between urban centres in the process of urban development. However, polycentricity lacks a theoretical foundation, which would explain the socio-economic status of urban regions. In this study, we assess whether combining both concepts improves the ability to explain personal incomes in metropolitan areas in Switzerland. We first delineated metropolitan areas by implementing a modularity maximisation algorithm on the settlement network. Nodes in this network are Swiss municipalities and links are inter-municipal commuter flows. We found a strong relationship between the hierarchical organisation of functional connections within metropolitan areas and the socio-economic status of these areas. Both concepts were complementary and combining them proved to enhance the ability to explain socio-economic status. The combined model is a theoretical progress, which complements the traditional approaches and increases our understanding of cities and urbanisation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2949460000,"Mussel farming has been recognised as a low cost option for mitigating damage caused by eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. However, uncertain nutrient removal owing to weather and environmental conditions at the mussel farm site has not been previously considered. The purpose of this study was to estimate whether mussel farming has cost advantages even in conditions of uncertainty. To this end, the replacement cost method was used for the valuation of ecosystem services and a numerical cost minimisation model was constructed based on the safety-first approach to account for uncertainty in nutrient removal. This study showed that the value of mussel farming depends on the cost at the farm, and the impact on the mean and variability of nutrient removal in relation to other abatement measures. The study also pointed out the need of data on the decision makers’ risk attitudes and measurement of uncertainty. The application to the Baltic Sea showed that the total value of mussel farming increased from 0.34 billion Euro/year to 0.41 or 1.21 billion Euro when accounting for uncertainty depending on assumption of probability distribution. The increase was unevenly distributed between the Baltic Sea countries, with it found to be lower for countries equipped with highly productive mussel farms and long coastlines."
https://openalex.org/W2950368671,"Ras family small GTPases undergo prenylation (such as farnesylation) for proper localization to the plasma membrane, where they can initiate oncogenic signaling pathways. Small GTP-binding protein GDP-dissociation stimulator (SmgGDS) proteins are chaperones that bind and traffic small GTPases, although their exact cellular function is unknown. Initially, SmgGDS proteins were classified as guanine nucleotide exchange factors, but recent findings suggest that SmgGDS proteins also regulate prenylation of small GTPases in vivo in a substrate-selective manner. SmgGDS-607 recognizes the polybasic region and the CAAX box of several small GTPases and inhibits prenylation by impeding their entry into the geranylgeranylation pathway. Here, using recombinant and purified enzymes for prenylation and protein-binding assays, we demonstrate that SmgGDS-607 differentially regulates farnesylation of several small GTPases. SmgGDS-607 inhibited farnesylation of some proteins, such as DiRas1, by sequestering the protein and limiting modification catalyzed by protein farnesyltransferase (FTase). We found that the competitive binding affinities of the small GTPase for SmgGDS-607 and FTase dictate the extent of this inhibition. Additionally, we discovered that SmgGDS-607 increases the rate of farnesylation of HRas by enhancing product release from FTase. Our work indicates that SmgGDS-607 binds to a broad range of small GTPases and does not require a PBR for recognition. Together, these results provide mechanistic insight into SmgGDS-607–mediated regulation of farnesylation of small GTPases and suggest that SmgGDS-607 has multiple modes of substrate recognition.

Protein prenylation consists of the addition of an isoprenoid lipid to the cysteine residue within the C-terminal consensus sequence known as the CAAX box, where C is the cysteine to be modified, A is generally an aliphatic residue, and the X residue is variable. The prenylation process includes three main steps: prenylation, proteolysis, and methylation. The first step, prenylation, is catalyzed by protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) 2The abbreviations used are: FTaseprotein farnesyltransferasePBRpolybasic regionGGTase-Igeranylgeranyltransferase type IFTIfarnesyltransferase inhibitorSmgGDSsmall GTP-binding protein GDP-dissociation stimulator proteinFPPfarnesyl diphosphateIPTGisopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranosideTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochlorideMMCOmolecular mass cutoffBLIbiolayer interferometryNi-NTAnickel–nitrilotriacetic acidBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycineWTwild-typeHEPPSON-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid). and protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I) to covalently attach a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl moiety, respectively, to the cysteine thiol (5Ashby M.N.

Following lipid attachment, a prenyl protein protease in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, RAS-converting CAAX endopeptidase 1 (Rce1), catalyzes cleavage of the last three residues (-AAX) of small GTPase CAAX proteins.

Depending on the small GTPase identity, after the third step, the protein may undergo additional modification steps before trafficking to the plasma membrane. Once anchored in the plasma membrane, small GTPases fulfill their biological role, operating as molecular switches shifting between a GDP-bound inactive and a GTP-bound active state, where they interact with one or more downstream effector proteins initiating cell signaling pathways. Hence, CAAX prenylation plays a crucial role in small GTPase function (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Protein prenylation: molecular mechanisms and functional consequences.Annu. Rev.

For over 30 years, Ras proteins (KRas4A, KRas4B, NRas, and HRas) have attracted attention because of their connection to human cancer. Oncogenic Ras mutations, of which the most prominent occur at Gly-12, Gly-13, and Gln-61, can reduce or eliminate the inherent GTPase activity, leading to constitutive GTP binding and therefore activation of signaling pathways (8Cox A.D.

Such Ras mutants are not inactivated by normal cellular mechanisms, and unchecked activity is associated with human tumor pathogenesis. KRas is the isoform that is mutated most often (85%) in cancers with a Ras missense mutation, followed by NRas (12%) and HRas (3%) (11Cox A.D. Der C.J.

One of many efforts to control aberrant GTPase signaling focuses on impeding Ras localization to the plasma membrane by targeting FTase prenylation through small-molecule inhibitors (8Cox A.D.

In the presence of FTIs, GGTase-I catalyzes geranylgeranylation of KRas and NRas, which allows for normal function in the cell (12Berndt N. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M.

Because SmgGDS-607 binds nonprenylated GTPases and inhibits prenylation, this protein is proposed to function as a gatekeeper by regulating small GTPase entry into the prenylation pathway. Although the role of SmgGDS-607 in inhibiting geranylgeranylation is well-established (20Jennings B.C. Lawton A.J. Rizk Z. Fierke C.A.

Additionally, more KRas4B pulls down with SmgGDS-607 when cells are treated with an FTI, compared with cells that are untreated (22Schuld N.J. Vervacke J.S. Lorimer E.L. Simon N.C. Hauser A.D.

To further characterize the role of SmgGDS-607 in regulating farnesylation, we assayed the effects of SmgGDS-607 on in vitro prenylation of three representative FTase substrate: KRas4B, HRas, and DiRas1. These three substrates capture the different types of C-terminal tails in the FTase substrates recognized by SmgGDS-607. Furthermore, we measured the binding affinities of Ras proteins for the prenyltransferases and SmgGDS-607. These data demonstrate that SmgGDS-607 does not significantly affect the rate of farnesylation of KRas4B while inhibiting farnesylation of DiRas1, a Ras-like protein homologous to KRas4B. These differential effects are explained by the relative binding affinities of the small GTPase for SmgGDS-607 and FTase. Surprisingly, SmgGDS-607 enhances the rate of farnesylation of HRas, an effect that has never been seen before with any other small GTPase, by increasing the rate of product dissociation from FTase. These results elucidate a novel cellular mechanism for regulation of protein farnesylation. This mechanism suggests that SmgGDS-607 enhances entry of certain small GTPases into the farnesylation pathway, implying that small molecules targeting the SmgGDS-607 and Ras interaction may have therapeutic value. SmgGDS-607 inhibits geranylgeranylation of RhoA catalyzed by GGTase-I by binding to and blocking the prenylation site (20Jennings B.C. Lawton A.J. Rizk Z. Fierke C.A. SmgGDS-607 regulation of RhoA GTPase prenylation is nucleotide-dependent.Biochemistry. 2018; 57 (29940100): 4289-429810.1021/acs.biochem.8b00567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SmgGDS-607 was previously demonstrated to pulldown with small GTPases ending in methionine, such as KRas4B, only in the presence of an FTI that leads to alternative geranylgeranylation (22Schuld N.J. Vervacke J.S. Lorimer E.L. Simon N.C. Hauser A.D. Barbieri J.T. Distefano M.D. Williams C.L.

However, SmgGDS-607 has not been demonstrated to regulate farnesylation of small GTPases. To test SmgGDS-607–mediated regulation, we used a radiolabel-incorporation assay to monitor levels of farnesylation of small GTPases, specifically KRas4B and DiRas1, in the presence of SmgGDS-607. Although DiRas1 and KRas4B belong to different branches of the Ras family, they share 36% sequence identity, end in methionine (Table 1), and are modified by FTase (25Ellis C.A. Vos M.D. Howell H.

Open table in a new tab Under in vitro conditions, the addition of increasing concentrations of SmgGDS-607 minimally inhibits the extent of farnesylation of KRas4B, with 32% inhibition at 20 μm SmgGDS-607 after 5 min of incubation. In contrast, the addition of SmgGDS-607 significantly decreases farnesyl incorporation in DiRas1, with more than 90% inhibition at 5 μm SmgGDS-607 (Fig. 1A) as compared with ∼10% inhibition for KRas4B under similar conditions. Together, these data demonstrate that SmgGDS-607 can directly block farnesylation of an FTase substrate that ends in methionine and does not require the presence of an FTI. To investigate whether the observed inhibition of farnesylation by SmgGDS-607 is due to SmgGDS-607 directly inhibiting FTase reactivity, we tested the effect of SmgGDS-607 on the farnesylation rate of a dansylated peptide substrate (dansyl-TKCVIM) that mimics the CAAX box of KRas4B and has high affinity for FTase (0.86 ± 0.08 nm) (27Hartman H.L.

The addition of 5 μm SmgGDS-607 did not significantly affect FTase activity (Fig. 1B). Both kinetic parameters, Km and kcat, were unchanged by the presence of SmgGDS-607 (Table 2). These data demonstrate that SmgGDS-607 does not directly inhibit FTase. Rather, the observed inhibition (Fig. 1A) occurs by competition for binding the FTase substrate.Table 2Kinetic parameters for farnesylation of KRas4B CAAX peptide catalyzed by FTase[SmgGDS-607]kcatKms−1μm—0.08 ± 0.013 ± 15 μm0.12 ± 0.044 ± 3 Open table in a new tab To determine a possible mechanism to explain the differential effects of SmgGDS-607 on blocking farnesylation of DiRas1 compared with KRas4B, we measured the affinities of SmgGDS-607 for several small GTPases using biolayer interferometry (BLI, OctetRed96) with biotinylated small GTPases and varying concentrations of SmgGDS-607 (26Abdiche Y.

In the KRas4B PBR, tandem repeats of lysine residues provide a highly positively charged region that could interact with the electronegative patch in SmgGDS-607, as compared with the more dispersed positive charges in the PBR of DiRas1 (Table 1). Based on this, we predicted that KRas4B would bind to SmgGDS-607 with high affinity. However, the affinity of KRas4B for SmgGDS-607 is 1.5 ± 0.4 μm, which is >300-fold weaker than the DiRas1 affinity at 4.7 ± 0.9 nm, suggesting a more complicated model of substrate recognition. Previous data indicated that SmgGDS-607 pulls down higher levels of KRas4B when the terminal amino acid is altered to leucine from methionine (KRas4B M188L) (22Schuld N.J. Vervacke J.S. Lorimer E.L.

To investigate this phenomenon, we repeated the binding assay using KRas4B M188L, demonstrating a 13-fold increased affinity for SmgGDS-607 (Table 3). We next measured the affinity of SmgGDS-607 for HRas, a small GTPase that does not contain a canonical PBR and ends with a different CAAX (-CVLS) sequence. The affinity of HRas for SmgGDS-607 is >9 μm, which is >6-fold weaker than KRas4B and >1,000-fold weaker than DiRas1, indicating that HRas has the weakest binding affinity out of all the substrates tested. The contrasting affinity of HRas compared with KRas4B indicates that the PBR might regulate the affinity of the interaction with SmgGDS-607. Furthermore, these data suggest that the PBR motif in KRas4B may not optimally interact with SmgGDS-607 because the affinity is weaker than DiRas. The enhanced binding affinity for the KRas4B M188L mutant supports the proposal that SmgGDS-607 recognizes the last residue in KRas4B and that the amino acid sequence of the CAAX box is an important determinant of binding affinity and substrate selectivity. Measurement of direct binding affinities between FTase and full-length small GTPases has proven a challenge previo"

However, which cognitive and socio-affective variables are specifically related to these variations in social adaptation in vulnerable contexts has not been fully understood nor directly addressed. Here we evaluated socio-affective variables (anxious attachment style, internal locus of control, self-esteem and stress) and cognitive variables (fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, working memory, numeracy, probabilistic reasoning and logical reasoning) to explain variations in social adaptation in a sample of 232 adults living in vulnerable contexts (M = 42.3, SD = 14.9, equal amount of men and women). Our results show that an important amount of variance in social adaptation can be explained by socio-affective variables, principally by self-esteem, while cognitive variables also contributed significantly. As far as we know, this is one of the first steps towards understanding the role of cognitive and socio-affective features on social adaptation. In the long run, this area of research could play an important role on the assignation of resources to ease people’s integration into society.

Additionally, we studied if these hormones could serve as objective biomarkers for psychological distress in patients with sarcoidosis.We measured hair steroid levels using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in glucocorticoid naïve sarcoidosis patients. Patients completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Fatigue Assessment Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Hair steroid levels from 293 participants of the population-based Lifelines cohort study served as controls.Thirty-two patients (14 males) were included. Hair cortisol, but not testosterone, concentrations were significantly higher in patients with sarcoidosis than in general population controls (mean 6.6 versus 2.7 pg/mg, p<0.001). No differences were found in hair cortisol and testosterone levels between fatigued and non-fatigued patients with sarcoidosis. Hair cortisol of sarcoidosis patients correlated significantly with anxiety (r = 0.47, p = 0.01), depression (r = 0.46, p = 0.01), and SF-36 mental domain (r = -0.38, p = 0.03), but not with fatigue.Patients with sarcoidosis have chronically higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol than the normal population, while testosterone levels in hair did not differ.

S. aureus takes up iron through heme uptake by the iron-responsive surface determinant (Isd) system and by the production of iron-scavenging siderophores. Staphyloferrin B (SB) is a siderophore produced by the 9-gene sbn gene cluster for SB biosynthesis and efflux. Recently, the ninth gene product, SbnI, was determined to be a free l-serine kinase that produces O-phospho-l-serine (OPS), a substrate for SB biosynthesis. Previous studies have also characterized SbnI as a DNA-binding regulatory protein that senses heme to control sbn gene expression for SB synthesis. Here, we present crystal structures at 1.9–2.1 Å resolution of a SbnI homolog from Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (SpSbnI) in both apo form and in complex with ADP, a product of the kinase reaction; the latter confirmed the active-site location. The structures revealed that SpSbnI forms a dimer through C-terminal domain swapping and a dimer of dimers through intermolecular disulfide formation. Heme binding had only a modest effect on SbnI enzymatic activity, suggesting that its two functions are independent and structurally distinct. We identified a heme-binding site and observed catalytic heme transfer between a heme-degrading protein of the Isd system, IsdI, and SbnI. These findings support the notion that SbnI has a bifunctional role contributing precursor OPS to SB synthesis and directly sensing heme to control expression of the sbn locus. We propose that heme transfer from IsdI to SbnI enables S. aureus to control iron source preference according to the sources available in the environment.

Identified genes that encoded spore inner membrane proteins were chosen for study of defined mutants, which exhibited delayed germination in several assays in response to varying germinants. Significantly slowed release of DPA indicated that mutants were affected in Stage I of germination. Several mutants exhibited phenotypic traits consistent with failure of a GerA germinant receptor-mediated response, while others appeared to have a more general loss of response to varied germinants. Use of a gerA-lacZ transcriptional fusion and quantitative western blotting of GerAC allowed mutants to be classified based upon normal or decreased gerA transcription and normal or reduced GerA accumulation.

An increase in thermodynamic stability has been linked to mutations associated with GCD that cause amorphous aggregates, whereas a decrease in thermodynamic stability has been linked to mutations associated with LCD that cause amyloid deposits. Mass spectrometry analyses of microdissected amyloid deposits from three different TGFBIp genotypes (A546D, A546D/P551Q, and V624M) of LCD showed elevated levels of peptides derived from the Tyr-571–Arg-588 amyloidogenic polypeptide region of FAS1-4.

Intriguingly, protein deposits from all analyzed cases of LCD show accumulation of the serine protease high-temperature requirement A1 (HtrA1, UniProt Q92743, and MEROPS S01.277), possibly implicating this protease in the development of amyloid deposition in LCD (12Karring H.

In this study, the role of HtrA1 in the pathophysiology of TGFBI-linked corneal dystrophy was investigated by examining the ability of HtrA1 to cleave WT TGFBIp and seven mutants as well as WT FAS1-4 and six mutants. The TGFBIp isoforms included the two major LCD and GCD phenotypes caused by mutations in either the FAS1-1 or the FAS1-4 domain of TGFBIp. Our data show that TGFBIp may be the victim of counterproductive proteolysis, as HtrA1 attempts to degrade misfolded protein and inadvertently causes amyloid formation. We furthermore propose a model on how corneal proteostasis and the dual aggregation propensity of TGFBIp can lead to either the amorphous aggregates seen in GCD or the amyloid deposits observed in LCD. We expressed and purified seven mutant TGFBIp isoforms in addition to the WT protein (Fig. 1A). The seven TGFBIp mutants included the mutations R124C, R124H, and R124L, which are situated in the FAS1-1 domain of TGFBIp and are frequently observed in vivo, and the biologically relevant mutations A546D, A546D/P551Q, A546T, and R555W, which are located in the FAS1-4 domain of TGFBIp. Except for the R124L and A546T isoforms, we have previously characterized TGFBIp protein deposits of the remaining five mutant TGFBIp isoforms in corneal tissues (12Karring H. Poulsen E.T. Runager K.

This information allows us to compare the in vitro data presented herein to previously published in vivo data. The purified recombinant TGFBIp protein migrated as a double band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) for all isoforms except for the R124H mutant. We used a single reaction monitoring MS assay (LC-SRM-MS) to delineate the nature of this double band. By monitoring a tryptic peptide at each terminal of TGFBIp, we identified the lower band as a C-terminally truncated TGFBIp isoform (Fig. 1C). The R124H mutant appears only as the C-terminally truncated protein. Because HtrA1 accumulates in LCD TGFBIp deposits in vivo, we tested its activity toward the eight TGFBIp isoforms using a titration series of HtrA1 (Fig. 1). The eight TGFBIp isoforms were ranked from least to most susceptible to proteolysis as follows: R124H<WT<R555W<A546D/P551Q<R124C<A546D<A546T<R124L (Fig. 1D). The results revealed that the GCD mutants R124H and R555W were similarly or even more resistant to proteolysis than WT TGFBIp. The remaining mutant isoforms, all representing LCD except the R124L mutant, which causes Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy (RBCD), were more susceptible to proteolysis. Of note, HtrA1 showed a preference for full-length TGFBIp over the C-terminal truncated isoform and appeared to cause a shift from the upper band to the lower band over time (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the R124H mutant appeared as only one band and thus seemed resistant to HtrA1 proteolysis. Whether the apparent proteolytic resistance is a consequence of the R124H mutation altering the structure or binding of HtrA1 to the C-terminal is required for the further proteolysis of TGFBIp is unknown. Together, these data support the idea that HtrA1 is involved in the natural turnover of TGFBIp in the healthy cornea as WT recombinant protein is processed and that introducing a mutation into TGFBIp affects its turnover rate. The normal metabolism of corneal TGFBIp occurs by N-terminal trimming and produces fragments containing the C-terminal FAS1-4 domain. Therefore, we tested the ability of HtrA1 to cleave the WT FAS1-4 domain and six FAS1-4 mutants (Fig. 2). The double bands seen for the A546D and A546D/P551Q FAS1-4 domains (Fig. 2A) are, as shown previously (26Nielsen N.S. Juhl D.W. Poulsen E.T. Lukassen M.V. Poulsen E.C. Risør M.W. Scavenius C. Enghild J.J. Mutation-induced deamidation of corneal dystrophy-related transforming growth factor beta-induced protein.Biochemistry. 2017; 56 (29140698): 6470-648010.1021/acs.biochem.7b00668Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), because of deamidations. The deamidations did not affect HtrA1 specificity and activity because both bands were degraded to the same extent. HtrA1 titration against the six mutant FAS1-4 domains separated the mutants into two distinct groups. One group was resistant to HtrA1 proteolysis and contained WT and the R555W and R555Q mutations associated with the nonamyloidogenic phenotypes GCD and Thiel-Behnke corneal dystrophy (TBCD) (Fig. 2B). The other group was susceptible to HtrA1 proteolysis and contained the A546T, A546D, A546D/P551Q, and V624M mutations, all representing the amyloidogenic phenotype LCD (Fig. 2C). In particular, the two A546D-containing mutants were markedly more susceptible to proteolysis than A546T and V624M, which showed similar sensitivity to proteolysis. The data suggest that the FAS1-4 domain is not a substrate for HtrA1 in healthy individuals. However, the destabilizing mutations associated with LCD change TGFBIp into a substrate for HtrA1. We analyzed the HtrA1 digest of FAS1-4 mutants associated with LCD (A546T, A546D, A546D/P551Q, and V624M) by MS to map the HtrA1 cleavage sites (P1 residue of both the N and C termini) across the various FAS1-4 mutants (Fig. 3). The mutants underwent extensive cleavage in two main clusters located in the peptide regions Phe-515–Ala-525 and Glu-615–Pro-635. In addition, all amyloidogenic mutants underwent additional peptide bond cleavage in the region between the two main proteolytic clusters. These additional cleavage sites lie near or within the amyloidogenic region of TGFBIp (residues Tyr-571–Arg-588) located in FAS1-4, and we suggest that HtrA1 contributes to the development of LCD by generating amyloidogenic peptides. We addressed the aggregation propensity of HtrA1-generated FAS1-4 peptides by incubating monomeric FAS1-4 mutants (A546T, A546D, A546D/P551Q, and V624M) with HtrA1 for 21 h. After an additional 4 days of sample incubation, the pellets were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. Both fractions were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, and the identified peptides were binned in 10–amino acid residue intervals across the FAS1-4 domain. A similar pattern was apparent for all amyloidogenic mutant FAS1-4 isoforms (Fig. 4A). The pellet fractions mainly consisted of peptides spanning the Gly-560–Leu-589 region of TGFBIp and, to a lesser extent, the Pro-500–Glu-529 region. The supernatant, on the other hand, showed the highest peptide counts outside the Gly-560–Leu-589 region (Fig. 4A). Hence, HtrA1 was able to generate TGFBIp peptides with the propensity to form insoluble aggregates consisting of peptides derived from the amyloidogenic region of FAS1-4 in TGFBIp. The number of peptides falling within the amyloidogenic region of TGFBIp constituted between 65 and 74% of all peptides identified in the pellet fraction (Fig. 4B). The highest represented peptide in the core region varied among genotypes; however, they all shared the sequence 570-KYHIGDEILV-579 (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the peptide region Lys-570–Val-579 appears to be essential for the progression of LCD if the disease is caused by mutations in the FAS1-4 domain. HtrA1-generated fibrils were verified to be amyloid structures based on thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, FTIR, and transmission EM (TEM) (Fig. 5). FAS1-4 mutants were digested for 21 h with HtrA1, followed by 4 days of incubation. Increased ThT fluorescence as a function of time was observed for all four LCD-linked FAS1-4 variants in the presence of HtrA1, whereas ThT fluorescence was considerably reduced for the FAS1-4 variant alone, where only the A546D and A546D/P551Q mutants showed a slight fluorescence signal (Fig. 5A). The samples were further analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy, which showed a shift for the undigested FAS1-4 mutants from 1651–1653 cm−1 to 1627–1630 cm−1, values characteristic of β-sheet and β-amyloid-sheet, respectively (27Zandomeneghi G. Krebs M.R. McCammon M.G. Fandrich M. FTIR reveals structural differences between native β-sheet proteins and amyloid fibrils.Protein Sci. 2004; 13 (15537750): 3314-332110.1110/ps.041024904Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), upon incubation with HtrA1 (Fig. 5B). The undigested A546D/P551Q mutant displayed both peaks, which could explain the slight ThT fluorescence signal observed for this mutant. Only the amyloid peak was observed for the digested A546D/P551Q mutant. Finally, the TEM micrographs showed elongated fibrils for FAS1-4 samples incubated with HtrA1, whereas nonfibrillar aggregates were observed for nonprotease-treated FAS1-4 mutants. The A546D and A546D/P551Q samples contained larger nonlinear aggregates than did A546T and V624M (Fig. 5C), which most likely accounted for the amyloid signatures observed in the ThT and FTIR experiments. To address whether HtrA1 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the stroma in healthy human corneas or accumulates only in amyloid deposits in patients' tissues, human corneal buttons were cut into 50 μm sections from the epithelium toward the endothelium. Approximately every second tissue section was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against HtrA1 (Fig. 6). The blots showed HtrA1 to be present throughout the corneal stroma, suggesting that HtrA1 is involved in normal corneal proteostasis and not induced only by LCD development. The in vivo processing of mutant TGFBIp was examined by visualizing the TGFBIp degradation patterns in patient tissue (A546D and V624M) and normal corneal tissue by 2D gel electrophoresis (2DE) and immunoblotting (Fig. 7). In the normal cornea, a characteristic degradation pattern of TGFBIp is observed as a consequence of N-terminal trimming; accordingly, all observed degradation products contain the FAS1-4 domain (2Karring H. Runager K. Valnickova Z. Thøgersen I.B. Møller-Pedersen T. Klintworth G.K. Enghild J.J. Differential expression and processing of transforming growth factor beta induced protein (TGFBIp) in the normal human cornea during postnatal development and aging.Exp. Eye Res. 2010; 90 (19788893): 57-6210.1016/j.exer.2009.09.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, A546D and V624M patient tissue had a reduced amount of degradation products, and the characteristic processing pattern was nearly undetectable. Notably, the antiserum recognizes only the FAS1-4 domain of TGFBIp; therefore, the observed TGFBIp degradation products, particularly in normal tissue, contained the FAS1-4 domain. As the FAS1-4 domain becomes a substrate for HtrA1 upon the introduction of a mutation associated with LCD (Fig. 2), the 2DE immunoblot data implied that TGFBIp degradation products spanning the FAS1-4 domain are consumed more rapidly by HtrA1, thus generating amyloidogenic core peptides situated in the FAS1-4 domain. Several extracellular proteins have been characterized as in vitro or in vivo substrates for HtrA1, such as fibronectin, fibromodulin, biglycan, aggrecan, and fibulin-5 (28Zurawa-Janicka D. Wenta T. Jarzab M. Skorko-Glonek J. Glaza P. Gieldon A. Ciarkowski J. Lipinska B. Structural insights into the activation mechanisms of human HtrA serine proteases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2017; 621 (28396256): 6-2310.1016/j.abb.2017.04.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and our in vitro data add TGFBIp to this list of substrates. We showed that HtrA1 was capable of cleaving WT TGFBIp to a minor extent, and, except for R124H, all remaining TGFBIp mutants were processed to the same or a higher degree than WT protein, with the highest preferences for mutant isoforms associated with the RBCD and LCD phenotypes (Fig. 1). Previous results from our group have shown extensive corneal TGFBIp processing in healthy tissue, of which the smallest degradation product was FAS1-4 (2Karring H. Runager K. Valnickova Z. Thøgersen I.B. Møller-Pedersen T. Klintworth G.K. Enghild J.J. Differential expression and processing of transforming growth factor beta induced protein (TGFBIp) in the normal human cornea during postnatal development and aging.Exp. Eye Res. 2010; 90 (19788893): 57-6210.1016/j.exer.2009.09.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As a model for the FAS1-4-containing degradation product and to assess its potential role as an HtrA1 substrate, we recombinantly expressed the FAS1-4 domain and subjected it to HtrA1-mediated degradation. Proteolysis of the WT and mutant FAS1-4 domains indeed showed that HtrA1 preferentially degraded FAS1-4 carrying a mutation associated with the LCD phenotype (Fig. 2). In contrast, WT FAS1-4 was a poor substrate for HtrA1 (Fig. 2), and the physiological involvement of HtrA1 in processing major TGFBIp degradation products containing the FAS1-4 domain is likely negligible. Collectively, our in vitro data support a role for HtrA1 in the turnover of disease-associated full-length TGFBIp. Mutations change FAS1-4 into suitable substrates for HtrA1 and thereby enable the aberrant processing of TGFBIp, observed in corneal tissue from LCD patients (Fig. 7). We have previously shown that the major fraction of corneal mouse TGFBIp originated from the corneal epithelium (6Poulsen E.T. Runager K. Nielsen N.S. Lukassen M.V. Thomsen K. Snider P. Simmons O.

Proteome Res. 2012; 11 (22698189): 4231-423910.1021/pr300358kCrossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We speculate that TGFBIp migrates from the epithelium toward the endothelium, where it encounters HtrA1 secreted from the endothelium. Our data show that HtrA1 is expressed throughout the stroma of normal corneas (Fig. 6). This information suggests the possibility that LCD-linked mutant TGFBIp is immediately exposed to HtrA1-mediated degradation once secreted by the epithelium. For disease-associated TGFBIp containing FAS1-4 mutations, this would lead to an increased turnover of the FAS1-4 species and the generation of amyloidogenic core peptides prone to aggregate formation. Interestingly, there appears to be a correlation between specific mutations leading to LCD, time of onset before deposit manifestations are observed, and how deeply amyloid deposits extend into the corneal stroma, from the epithelium toward the endothelium (29Lakshminarayanan R. Chaurasia S.S. Anandalakshmi V. Chai S.M. Murugan E. Vithana E.N. Beuerman R.W. Mehta J.S. Clinical and genetic aspects of the TGFBI-associated corneal dystrophies.Ocul. Surf. 2014; 12 (25284770): 234-25110.1016/j.jtos.2013.12.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This extension may directly correlate with the severity of the destabilizing mutation in the FAS1-4 domain of TGFBIp. We have previously shown that the synthetic Tyr-571–Arg-588 amyloidogenic core peptide can form fibrils (30Sørensen C.S. Runager K. Scavenius C. Jensen M.M. Nielsen N.S. Christiansen G. Petersen S.V. Karring H. Sanggaard K.W. Enghild J.J. Fibril core of transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFBIp) facilitates aggregation of corneal TGFBIp.Biochemistry. 2015; 54 (25910219): 2943-295610.1021/acs.biochem.5b00292Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), leaving the possibility that digested FAS1-4 liberates the amyloidogenic core region, allowing fibril formation. In our in vitro experiments, HtrA1 was capable of digesting monomeric LCD-linked mutant FAS1-4, leading to amyloid fibril formation by peptides containing the amyloidogenic region (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Consequently, HtrA1 may play an undesirable key role in the progression of amyloid deposits in LCD caused by a mutation in FAS1-4 and therefore may be a potential target for LCD treatment. We cannot conclude whether the amyloidogenic region reported for FAS1-1, Leu-110–Glu-131 (31Schmitt-Bernard C.F. Chavanieu A. Derancourt J. Arnaud B. Demaille J.G. Calas B. Argiles A.

HtrA1 accumulates in amyloid deposits caused by both FAS1-1 and FAS1-4 mutations; however, FAS1-1 deposits did not show the same pronounced accumulation of the Tyr-571–Arg-588 amyloidogenic core region observed in deposits of FAS1-4 mutations (12Karring H.

These results suggest that other amyloidogenic core regions in TGFBIp may constitute the amyloid deposits of FAS1-1–linked LCD. Altogether, our data support that HtrA1 unintentionally supplies building blocks to the amyloid fibril in its attempt to remove misfolded and mutated TGFBIp. We propose that the mutation-induced changes in the normal corneal TGFBIp turnover (Fig. 8A) govern the phenotypic outcome (Fig. 8). Mutations associated with GCD lead to an increase in structural and proteolytic stability and an increased resistance to degradation by the proteolytic machinery in the cornea. This resistance causes a build-up of mutant TGFBIp in the cornea, eventually reaching a critical concentration and driving the protein into insoluble aggregates (Fig. 8B). In contrast, mutations associated with LCD destabilize the structure and increase TGFBIp turnover. In the case of FAS1-4 mutations, this domain becomes a substrate of HtrA1 and hence introduces an alternative turnover pathway (Fig. 8C). Whether FAS1-1 and FAS1-4 mutations share the same mechanism of protein aggregation is unclear. If so, one would expect all mutations in FAS1-1 and FAS1-4 that cause the same phenotype to be situated in close spatial proximity within the protein structure, thereby affecting the same local milieu of the protein. However, this pattern is not observed in the TGFBIp crystal structure (8Garcia-Castellanos R. Nielsen N.S. Runager K. Thøgersen I.B. Lukassen M.V. Poulsen E.T. Goulas T. Enghild J.J. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Structural and functional implications of human transforming growth factor β-induced protein, TGFBIp, in corneal dystrophies.Structure (Lond.). 2017; 25 (28988748): 1740-1750.e174210.1016/j.str.2017.09.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The disease-causing mutational hot-spot Arg-124 faces away from the FAS1-4 domain, and the many FAS1-4 mutations face away from Arg-124. Therefore, it is likely that different mechanisms take place whether the mutation is situated in FAS1-1 or FAS1-4, but both result in the same phenotype. This interpretation is supported by our in vivo analyses of mutated FAS1-1 and FAS1-4 deposits in LCD patient tissues (12Karring H. Poulsen E.T. Runager K. Thøgersen I.B. Klintworth G.K. Højrup P.

Mutation in FAS1-4 caused the accumulation of a specific FAS1-4 polypeptide region, which was absent in the R124C FAS1-1–linked LCD deposits. However, HtrA1 was associated with both the FAS1-1– and FAS1-4–related deposits, suggesting common features and implying that a general treatment directed at HtrA1 may be possible. Interestingly, others have shown that a 22–amino acid residue region spanning residue Arg-124 in FAS1-1 is capable of forming amyloid material in vitro (31Schmitt-Bernard C.F. Chavanieu A. Derancourt J. Arnaud B. Demaille J.G. Calas B. Argiles A.

Commun. 2000; 273 (10873659): 649-65310.1006/bbrc.2000.2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and most likely represents the amyloidogenic core region in FAS1-1–linked LCD patients. This possibility is further supported by the observation of in vivo accumulation of N-terminal degradation products of corneal TGFBIp in R124C patient tissue (32Korvatska E. Henry H. Mashima Y. Yamada M. Bachmann C. Munier F.L. Schorderet D.F.

Of note, the suggested FAS1-1 amyloidogenic core region becomes susceptible to fibrillation upon the introduction of a mutation, whereas the amyloidogenic region in FAS1-4 does not need any mutation to form amyloid material. Therefore, a change in the extracellular environment and not a mutation may be sufficient to cause TGFBIp aggregation, as observed in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. Here, TGFBIp is up-regulated and shown to be a part of the protein aggregates observed in guttae formation in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy patients (33Jurkunas U.V. Bitar M. Rawe I.

Thus, targeting the proteolytic machinery involved in TGFBIp processing may provide a way to prevent or delay the disease progression of TGFBI-linked corneal dystrophy. The serine protease HtrA1 has previously been associated with in vivo TGFBIp deposits in LCD. In this study, we show that TGFBIp is a substrate of HtrA1 and that mutations in TGFBIp allow aberrant processing by HtrA1 that may inadvertently promote amyloidogenesis in LCD."
https://openalex.org/W2949496912,"Purpose HCM is the most common inherited cardiomyopathy. Historically, there has been poor correlation between genotype and phenotype. However, CMR has the potential to more accurately assess disease phenotype. We characterized phenotype with CMR in a cohort of patients with confirmed HCM and high prevalence of genetic testing. Methods Patients with a diagnosis of HCM, who had undergone contrast-enhanced CMR were identified. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and volumes were measured from steady-state free precession sequences. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was quantified using the full width, half maximum method. All patients were prospectively followed for the development of septal reduction therapy, arrhythmia or death. Results We included 273 patients, mean age 51.2 ± 15.5, 62.9% male. Of those patients 202 (74.0%) underwent genetic testing with 90 pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or rare variants and 13 variants of uncertain significance identified. Median follow-up was 1138 days. Mean LVMI was 82.7 ± 30.6 and 145 patients had late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Patients with beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) mutations had higher LV ejection fraction (68.8 vs 59.1, p<0.001) than those with cardiac myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) mutations. Patients with MYBPC3 mutations were more likely to have LVEF < 55% (29.7% vs 4.9%, p = 0.005) or receive a defibrillator than those with MYH7 mutations (54.1% vs 26.8%, p = 0.020). Conclusions We found that patients with MYBPC3 mutations were more likely to have impaired ventricular function and may be more prone to arrhythmic events. Larger studies using CMR phenotyping may be capable of identifying additional characteristics associated with less frequent genetic causes of HCM."

This study, therefore, sought to investigate the association between TMD and PD by using data for one million randomly sampled beneficiaries of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance program, including 6,185 PD patients who were matched through propensity score matching with 18,555 non-PD patients. Both the PD and non-PD cohorts were followed until death, any diagnosis of TMD, or December 31, 2013, whichever occurred first. Each diagnosis of TMD was made by a qualified physician according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), using the diagnosis codes 524.60, 524.62, 524.63, and 524.69 while excluding tooth abscess, wisdom tooth eruption, herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia, mastoiditis, otitis externa, otitis media, parotitis, sialadenitis, and trigeminal neuralgia. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to calculate the relative risk of TMD and found a 2.11-fold (95% CI: 1.35–3.30) increased risk of TMD overall in the PD group compared with the non-PD group. Stratified by follow-up period, there was a 4.25-fold (95% CI: 1.51–11.93) increased risk in the PD group in the first year after the initial PD diagnosis and a 3.88-fold (95% CI: 1.33–11.28) increased risk in the second year. Over the long-term (>5 years), PD was significantly associated with an increased risk of TMD. These findings suggest that it is important to closely monitor the temporomandibular joint health of PD patients."

However, the functions of other post-translational modifications in keratins related to liver diseases have not been fully elucidated. Here, using a site-specific mutation assay combined with nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we identified K8-Lys108 and K18-Lys187/426 as acetylation sites, and K8-Arg47 and K18-Arg55 as methylation sites. Keratin mutation (Arg-to-Lys/Ala) at the methylation sites, but not the acetylation sites, led to decreased stability of the keratin protein. We compared keratin acetylation/methylation in liver disease-associated keratin variants. The acetylation of K8 variants increased or decreased to various extents, whereas the methylation of K18-del65-72 and K18-I150V variants increased. Notably, the highly acetylated/methylated K18-I150V variant was less soluble and exhibited unusually prolonged protein stability, which suggests that additional acetylation of highly methylated keratins has a synergistic effect on prolonged stability. Therefore, the different levels of acetylation/methylation of the liver disease-associated variants regulate keratin protein stability. These findings extend our understanding of how disease-associated mutations in keratins modulate keratin acetylation and methylation, which may contribute to disease pathogenesis.-Jang, K.-H., Yoon, H.-N., Lee, J., Yi, H., Park, S.-Y., Lee, S.-Y., Lim, Y., Lee, H.-J., Cho, J.-W., Paik, Y.-K., Hancock, W.

Here, we investigated the effects of S100A9 on osteoclast differentiation from human CD14+ circulating precursors. Hereto, human CD14+ monocytes were isolated and differentiated toward osteoclasts with M-CSF and receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) in the presence or absence of S100A9. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining showed that exposure to S100A9 during monocyte-to-osteoclast differentiation strongly decreased the numbers of multinucleated osteoclasts. This was underlined by a decreased resorption of a hydroxyapatite-like coating. The thus differentiated cells showed a high mRNA and protein production of proinflammatory factors after 16 h of exposure. In contrast, at d 4, the cells showed a decreased production of the osteoclast-promoting protein TNF-α. Interestingly, S100A9 exposure during the first 16 h of culture only was sufficient to reduce osteoclastogenesis. Using fluorescently labeled RANKL, we showed that, within this time frame, S100A9 inhibited the M-CSF-mediated induction of RANK. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that this was associated with changes in various histone marks at the epigenetic level. This S100A9-induced reduction in RANK was in part recovered by blocking TNF-α but not IL-1. Together, our data show that S100A9 impedes monocyte-to-osteoclast differentiation, probably via a reduction in RANK expression.-Di Ceglie, I., Blom, A. B., Davar, R., Logie, C., Martens, J. H.

https://openalex.org/W2949950892,"Successful open source software (OSS) projects comprise freely observable, task-oriented social networks with hundreds or thousands of participants and large amounts of (textual and technical) discussion. The sheer volume of interactions and participants makes it challenging for participants to find relevant tasks, discussions and people. Tagging (e.g., @AmySmith) is a socio-technical practice that enables more focused discussion. By tagging important and relevant people, discussions can be advanced more effectively. However, for all but a few insiders, it can be difficult to identify important and/or relevant people. In this paper we study tagging in OSS projects from a socio-linguistics perspective. First we argue that textual content per se reveals a great deal about the status and identity of who is speaking and who is being addressed. Next, we suggest that this phenomenon can be usefully modeled using modern deep-learning methods. Finally, we illustrate the value of these approaches with tools that could assist people to find the important and relevant people for a discussion."

In this follow-up study, to provide insight into the evolutionary history of the genome of Ghanaian P[8]b strains RVA/Human-wt/GHA/GHDC949/2010/G9P[8] and RVA/Human-wt/GHA/GHM0094/2010/G9P[8] detected in an infant and a 7-month old child hospitalised for acute gastroenteritis, we sequenced the complete genome using both Sanger sequencing and Illumina MiSeq technology followed by phylogenetic analysis of the near-full length sequences. Both strains possessed the Wa-like/genotype 1 constellation G9P[8]b-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic inference showed that both strains were identical at the lineage level throughout the 11 genome segments. Their VP7 sequences belonged to the major sub-lineage of the G9-lineage III whereas their VP4 sequences belonged to P[8]b cluster I. The VP7 and VP4 genes of the study strains were closely related to a Senegalese G9P[8]b strain detected in 2009. In the remaining nine genome segments, both strains consistently clustered together with Wa-like RVA strains possessing either P[8]a or P[8]b mostly of African RVA origin. The introduction of a P[8]b subtype VP4 gene into the stable Wa-like strain backbone may result in strains that might propagate easily in the human population, with a potential to become an important public health concern, especially because it is not certain if the monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) used in Ghana will be efficacious against such strains. Our analysis of the full genomes of GHM0094 and GHDC949 adds to knowledge of the genetic make-up and evolutionary dynamics of P[8]b rotavirus strains."

Brefeldin A (BFA)-inhibited guanine nucleotide–exchange protein (BIG)1 and 2 accelerate the replacement of bound GDP with GTP to activate ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf)1, which regulates vesicular transport between the Golgi and plasma membrane. Although it has been reported that treating cells with BFA interferes with Arf1 activation to inhibit VEGF secretion, the role of BIG1 and BIG2 in VEGF trafficking and expression, EC migration and proliferation, and vascular development remains unknown. Here, we found that inactivation of Arf1 reduced VEGF secretion but did not affect the levels of VEGF protein. Interestingly, however, BIG1 and BIG2 knockdown significantly decreased the levels of VEGF mRNA and protein in glioblastoma U251 cells and HUVECs. Furthermore, depletion of BIG1 and BIG2 inhibited HUVEC angiogenesis by diminishing cell migration. Angioblast migration and intersegmental vessel sprouting were also impaired when the BIG2 homolog, Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factor (arfgef)2, was knocked down in zebrafish with endothelial expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Depletion of arfgef2 by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) also caused defects in vascular development of zebrafish embryos.

While the precise etiology remains controversial, IBD is believed to manifest as a result of various factors. We previously reported that intestinal-specific overexpression of the transcription factor Kaiso results in an intestinal inflammatory response; however, the cause of this inflammation is unknown. To elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) of the Kaiso-mediated intestinal inflammatory phenotype, we evaluated two independent transgenic mouse lines that express varying levels of Kaiso (KaisoTg). Histological analyses of KaisoTg mice revealed intestinal damage including thickening of the mucosa, intestinal “lesions” and crypt abscesses, which are reminiscent of IBD pathology. Additionally, higher Kaiso levels induced intestinal neutrophilia as early as 12 weeks, which worsened as the mice aged. Notably, the Kaiso-induced intestinal inflammation correlated with a leaky intestinal barrier and mis-regulation of E-cadherin expression and localization. Interestingly, Kaiso overexpression resulted in reduced proliferation but enhanced migration of intestinal epithelial cells prior to the onset of inflammation. Collectively, these data suggest that Kaiso plays a role in regulating intestinal epithelial cell integrity and function, dysregulation of which contributes to a chronic inflammatory phenotype as mice age."
https://openalex.org/W2949293335,"Objective Many studies focused on reasons behind the increasing incidence and the spread of human brucellosis in mainland China, yet most of them lacked comprehensive consideration with quantitative evidence. Hence, this study aimed to further investigate the epidemic mechanism and associated factors of human brucellosis so as to provide thoughts for future countermeasures in China and the rest of the world. Methods Data of human brucellosis incidence and some associated factors in economy, animal husbandry, transportation as well as health and hygiene were collected at provincial level from 2005–2016. Time series plots were first used to visualize the annual incidence and annual rate of change of human brucellosis for each province, then cluster analysis categorized all the 31 provinces of mainland China based on their incidence time series during the study period. In addition, according to the characteristics of data, the dynamic panel data model in combination with supervised principal component analysis was proposed to explore effects of associated factors on human brucellosis. Results 1. The incidence rate of human brucellosis in mainland China increased three-fold from 1.41 per 100,000 people in 2005 to 4.22 per 100,000 people in 2014, though it went down a little in 2015 and 2016. Incidence rates in the north have always been higher than those in the south, but the latter also experienced an upward trend especially between 2012 and 2016. 2. The 31 provinces of mainland China were categorized into three clusters, and each cluster had its own characteristics of incidence time series. 3. The impact of health and hygiene situations on the prevention and control work of human brucellosis was still very limited and trivial (regression coefficient = -0.02). Therefore, it was plausible to presume that improving the personal average number of medical institutes and the proportion of rural medical expenditure might be helpful in preventing and controlling human brucellosis. Conclusions The epidemic status of human brucellosis has changed in both spatial and temporal dimensions in recent years in mainland China. Apart from traditional control measures, more attention should be paid to the improvement of medical healthcare especially in rural areas in the hope of enhancing the control effect."

In this study, a full-length cDNA of 972bp encoding HvVIP1 was obtained from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) leaves. A corresponding 323 amino acid poly-peptide was shown to carry the conserved bZIP (Basic Leucine Zipper) domain within its 157th and 223rd amino acid residue. 13 non-synonymous SNPs were spotted within the HvVIP1 bZIP domain sequence when compared with AtVIP1. Moreover, minor differences in the bZIP domain locations and lengths were noted when comparing Arabidopsis thaliana and Hordeum vulgare VIP1 proteins through the 3D models, structural domain predictions and disorder prediction profiling. The expression of HvVIP1 was stable in barley tissues infected by pathogen (whether Agrobacterium tumefaciens or Fusarium culmorum), but was induced at specific time points. We found a strong correlation between the transcript accumulation of HvVIP1 and barley PR- genes HvPR1, HvPR4 and HvPR10, but not with HvPR3 and HvPR5, probably due to low induction of those particular genes. In addition, a gene encoding for a member of the barley MAPK family, HvMPK1, showed significantly higher expression after pathogenic infection of barley cells. Collectively, our results might suggest that early expression of PR genes upon infection in barley cells play a pivotal role in the Agrobacterium-resistance of this plant."

We have previously shown that increased sera levels of soluble P-selectin are associated with the severity of the cardiomyopathy distinctive of chronic Chagas disease. In this study, we explored the expression of biomarkers of platelet and endothelial activation, tissue remodeling, and mediators of the coagulation cascade in patients at different clinical stages of chronic Chagas heart disease. The frequencies of activated platelets, measured by the expression of CD41a and CD62P were decreased in patients with chronic Chagas disease compared with those in uninfected subjects, with an inverse association with disease severity. Platelet activation in response to adenosine diphosphate was also decreased in T. cruzi-infected subjects. A major proportion of T. cruzi infected subjects showed increased serum levels of fibrinogen. Patients with severe cardiac dysfunction showed increased levels of endothelin-1 and normal values of procollagen I. In conclusion, chronic infection with T. cruzi induced hemostatic alterations, even in those patients who do not yet present cardiac symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2949165682,"The objective of this study was to identify growth parameters that can affect mortality of cerebral palsy (CP).This was a birth cohort study based on the National Health Screening Program for Infants and Children database along with the National Health Insurance Service, which were linked using a personal identifier number. The birth cohort consisted of 2 191 956 subjects, representing 93.5% of live births from 2007-2011, with maximal 10-year follow-up (range, 5-10 years) until October 2016. Subjects with CP were identified. Growth parameters in terms of birth weight, underweight (weight-for-age below the 3rd percentile), rate of body weight gain were collected, along with all-cause mortality after the age of 1 year.Prevalence of CP was 2.0 per 1000 live births (95% CI, 1.94-2.06). All-cause mortality after the age of 1 year was 0.09 deaths/1000 person-years (95% CI, 0.08-0.09) in the general population (GP) and 2.85 deaths/1000 person-years (95% CI, 2.32-3.50) in subjects with CP during the follow-up. Therefore, the incidence rate ratio for all-cause mortality was 32.15 (95% CI, 25.72-39.76) in subjects with CP compared to GP. Presence of underweight was significantly associated with higher mortality in both subjects with CP and GP, where the adjusted hazard ratio of death was 2.60 (95% CI, 1.93-3.50) at the age of 18-24 months, 3.12 at 30-36 months, 4.37 at 42-48 months, 5.12 at 54-60 months, and 4.17 at 66-71 months. Birth weight did not affect mortality in both subjects with CP and GP after the age of 1 year (p > 0.05).While subjects with CP shows higher mortality, underweight is an important growth parameter that affects all-cause mortality of both subjects with CP and GP. This study urges increased awareness that subjects with CP who are underweight require special care."
