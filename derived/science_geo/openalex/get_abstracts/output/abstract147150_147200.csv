https://openalex.org/W2039959072,"Compounds known to disrupt exocytosis or endocytosis were introduced into CA1 pyramidal cells while monitoring excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Disrupting exocytosis or the interaction of GluR2 with NSF caused a gradual reduction in the AMPAR EPSC, while inhibition of endocytosis caused a gradual increase in the AMPAR EPSC. These manipulations had no effect on the NMDAR EPSC but prevented the subsequent induction of LTD. These results suggest that AMPARs, but not NMDARs, cycle into and out of the synaptic membrane at a rapid rate and that certain forms of synaptic plasticity may utilize this dynamic process."
https://openalex.org/W2047392037,"Alteration of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is frequently associated to tyrosine phosphorylation of p120- and β-catenins. We have examined the role of this modification in these proteins in the control of β-catenin/E-cadherin binding usingin vitro assays with recombinant proteins. Recombinant pp60c-src efficiently phosphorylated both catenins in vitro, with stoichiometries of 1.5 and 2.0 mol of phosphate/mol of protein for β-catenin and p120-catenin, respectively. pp60c-src phosphorylation had opposing effects on the affinities of β-catenin and p120 for the cytosolic domain of E-cadherin; it decreased (in the case of β-catenin) or increased (for p120) catenin/E-cadherin binding. However, a role for p120-catenin in the modulation of β-catenin/E-cadherin binding was not observed, since addition of phosphorylated p120-catenin did not modify the affinity of phosphorylated (or unphosphorylated) β-catenin for E-cadherin. The phosphorylated Tyr residues were identified as Tyr-86 and Tyr-654. Experiments using point mutants in these two residues indicated that, although Tyr-86 was a better substrate for pp60c-src, only modification of Tyr-654 was relevant for the interaction with E-cadherin. Transient transfections of different mutants demonstrated that Tyr-654 is phosphorylated in conditions in which adherens junctions are disrupted and evidenced that binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin in vivo is controlled by phosphorylation of β-catenin Tyr-654.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). The adhesive function of E-cadherin requires its attachment to the actin cytoskeleton, association mediated by a set of proteins collectively named catenins. In adherens junctions, the intracellular domain of E-cadherin binds directly to β-catenin that, in turn, associates with α-catenin, which is thought to link cadherin complexes to the actin cytoskeleton (2Hülsken J.

In addition to plakoglobin, that plays a role similar to that of β-catenin but in desmosomes, other proteins have also been shown to be associated to cadherin complexes. The presence of EGF1 receptor, phosphotyrosine phosphatases or tyrosine kinase substrates as p120, has suggested a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the modulation of these complexes. This hypothesis has been supported by data showing that maintenance of the adhesion complex is modulated by Src family tyrosine kinases, as pp60c-src itself; or receptors with tyrosine kinase activity of growth factors like EGF, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and colony stimulating factor-1 (6Downing J.R.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 883-889PubMed Google Scholar). β- and p120-catenins are considered to be the tyrosine phosphorylation-sensitive components of the adhesion complexes, since both proteins are phosphorylated in response to stimuli that disrupt adherens junctions and dissociate E-cadherin from the cytoskeleton (11Reynolds A.B. Daniel J. McCrea P.D. Wheelock M.M. Wu J. Zhang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8333-8342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tsukita S. Oishi K. Akiyama T. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the adhesive changes of cadherin complexes in response to catenin tyrosine phosphorylation. These hypotheses include 1) alterations in the affinity of p120- and β-catenin for the cytoplasmatic region of E-cadherin; 2) conformational changes in these components that result in the disruption of linkage within cadherin and the cytoskeleton; or 3) recruitment of unknown proteins, or perhaps p120, to the cadherin/catenin complexes that implicate the dissociation of their components (14Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Since a direct relationship of β-catenin phosphorylation to E-cadherin loss of function has not been established yet, it is also possible that, as proposed by some authors, E-cadherin dissociation from the cytoskeleton after cell transformation is not directly related to tyrosine phosphorylation of catenins. We were particularly interested to evaluate the different possibilities that led to the disassembly of adherens junctions upon tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. We have studied the ability of β-catenin and p120-catenin to bind E-cadherin in vitro, and the modulation of this binding by tyrosine phosphorylation. Full-length murine β-catenin (provided by Dr. R. Kemler, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany) was inserted in the BamHI restriction site of pGEX-6P3 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. After purification by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose columns, the fusion protein was cleaved with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 196 to end of murine p120-catenin was obtained from pcDNA3-Cas1 plasmid (provided by Dr. Albert Reynolds, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) by digestion withBglII and NotI, and cloned intoBamHI-NotI sites of pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expressed fusion GST-p120-catenin protein was purified and cleaved as above. A DNA fragment that corresponds to the cytosolic domain of murine E-cadherin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligos corresponding to the nucleotide sequences 2268–2282 and 2720–2706, and containing BamHI and EcoRI sites at their 5′-ends, respectively. The 0.5-kilobase amplification fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned in the same sites of pGEX-6P3 plasmid. The absence of mutations in this fragment was verified by sequencing. GST-cytoEcad fusion proteins were prepared and isolated as above. Purified proteins were aliquoted and stored in 50% (v/v) glycerol at −40 °C until use. β-Catenin mutants 1–106 and 1–575 were generated cutting pGEX-6P3-β-catenin with restriction enzymes SphI and EcoICRI, respectively, filling in and ligating. An entire C-terminal mutant (575–783) was obtained cloning the EcoICRI-BamHI fragment into the SmaI site of pGEX-6P3; 575–696 mutant was generated by cutting pGEX-6P3 (575–783) with BglII andNotI, filling in, and ligating. 696–783 mutant was constructed cutting pGEX-6P3-β-catenin withBglII-SmaI, filling in, and inserting the fragment in SmaI site of pGEX-6P2. Point mutants Tyr-86 → Glu, Tyr-86 → Phe, Tyr-654 → Glu, and Tyr-654 → Phe were obtained using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A polymerase chain reaction was performed using Pfu polymerase, pGEX-6P3-β-catenin as template, and oligonucleotide primers containing each mutation. Sense primers used for generation of Tyr-86 → Glu and Tyr-86 → Phe mutants were, respectively, 5′-GCTGATATTGACGGGCAGGAAGCAATGACTAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTGATATTGACGGGCAGTTTGCAATGACTAGG-3′; and for generation of Tyr-654 → Glu and Tyr-654 → Phe, 5′-GGCGTGGCAACAGAAGCAGCTGCTGCTGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGCGTGGCAACATTTGCAGCTGCTGCTGTCC-3′, respectively. Changes are indicated in bold. After amplification, the product was treated with DpnI, which digests the parental construct. Finally, the nicked plasmid was transformed and sequenced. A double mutant Tyr-86 → Phe/Tyr-654 → Phe was also obtained using this procedure with Tyr-86 → Phe-β-catenin. All β-catenin mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins, purified, and cleaved as indicated above. In vitro assays were performed in a final volume of 30 μl in the following conditions: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.25 mmVaO4Na3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol), 1 μg of either β-catenin or p120-catenin, and 0.5 units of recombinant pp60c-src protein kinase (from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Reactions were performed at 22 °C for 0.5–4 h. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in standard 10% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 25% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 12 h. Quantitation of β-catenin and p120 phosphorylation was determined excising the band with a razor blade and counting in a liquid scintillation radioactivity detector. In some cases, phosphorylation reactions were performed in the same conditions using GST fusion proteins as substrates and GST as control. The reactions were finished by diluting the samples in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 136 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl), and 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% suspension in PBS) were added and incubated with the samples for 30 min. The resin was pelleted down and washed three times with PBS, and the radioactivity present in the pellet was estimated as above. When indicated 50 μg of recombinant p120- or β-catenin were incubated with 9 units of pp60v-src in the conditions indicated above, but using 0.1 mm ATP. As a control, reactions were performed in the same conditions but in the absence of ATP. Different concentrations of p120- or β-catenin ranging from 0.12 to 12 pmol (which correspond to 11 ng to 1.1 μg for β-catenin and 9.4 ng to 0.94 μg for p120-catenin) were incubated with a constant amount, 1.2 pmol (60 ng), of GST-cytoEcad fusion protein or with the same pmol of GST (30 ng) as control. Incubations were performed in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, in a final volume of 200 μl for 45 min at room temperature. GST-cytoEcad/catenin complexes were isolated by incubation with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads. After 30 min of gentle agitation, beads were collected by spinning in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with binding buffer. Bound protein complexes were solubilized in electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and analyzed by Western blot with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against p120- or β-catenin (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Immunoblots were developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Pierce). Phosphorylated catenin samples that were subjected to cytoEcad binding were analyzed in parallel by Western blot with an anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P))-specific mAb (Transduction Laboratories), to check that catenin phosphorylation was completed. In order to quantitate the amount of β-catenin bound to E-cadherin, the autoradiograms were scanned in a densitometer and the results were compared with those obtained with p120 or β-catenin standards analyzed by Western blot in parallel. Data obtained from the binding of five or six different concentrations of catenin (each one performed in duplicate) were analyzed by Scatchard plot. The ratio of bound to free catenin was plotted versus the concentration of catenin bound to GST-cytoEcad; the association constant (K a) was determined from the slope of the regression line graph thus obtained. Determination of K a was repeated from four independent sets of measurements, and the mean ± standard deviation of these four association constants was calculated. Wild-type or mutant β-catenin cDNAs were inserted in the BamHI site of pcDNA3.1 His (C) plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This plasmid labels the NH2 end of expressing proteins with a polyhistidine tag, which facilitates their purification, and with an epitope recognized by an anti-XpressTM antibody. 50% confluent Caco-2 cells, grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), were transfected with these plasmids Using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according the instructions of the manufacturer. After transfection, cells were incubated for 30 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus fetal calf serum; when indicated, cells were incubated the last 6 h with 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VaO4). Cells extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm Na3VaO4. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C. 250 μg of extract were incubated in a final volume of 0.2 ml with 15 μl of a 50% (w/v) suspension of nickel-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed with RIPA buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with electrophoresis sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using antibodies against β-catenin (from Transduction Laboratories). In order to reprobe the membranes, blots were stripped as described (15Skoudy A. Llosas M.M. Garcia de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and re-analyzed with mAbs against Tyr(P) or E-cadherin (Transduction Laboratories). The absence of signal after stripping was always checked incubating with the correspondent secondary antibody and ECL reagent. Full-length recombinant β-catenin or a fragment of p120-catenin comprising all the arm repeats were produced as GST fusion proteins and purified as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The purity of these preparations is shown in Fig. 1 A. Both catenins were phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant pp60c-src (Fig. 1 B); only Tyr residues were modified (data not shown). β-catenin or p120 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B) was totally blocked by addition of herbimycin, a pp60c-src specific inhibitor (16Uehara Y. Fukazawa H. Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with a purified preparation of pp60v-src (data not shown). The stoichiometry of these phosphorylations was investigated. 1 unit of pp60c-src was able to incorporate up to 2.4 nmol of P/1.6 nmol of β-catenin or 2.7 nmol of P/1.3 nmol of p120-catenin, when incubated at 22 °C (Fig. 1 C). At 30 °C, the reactions were faster but proceeded to a lower extent, probably because pp60c-src was being inactivated (data not shown). These stoichiometries of phosphorylation, 1.5 and 2 nmol of P/nmol of β- or p120-catenin, respectively, indicated that, in both cases, more than one site was being modified. To determine the relevance of this modification, the abilities of Tyr-phosphorylated catenins to bind E-cadherin were analyzed and compared with those of the unmodified proteins. In order to perform this assay, the cytosolic domain of E-cadherin (cytoEcad) was prepared and purified as a GST fusion protein (Fig. 1 A). It has been previously described that a limited fragment of this E-cadherin-domain is sufficient to bind β-catenin in vivo as well asin vitro (17Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Different amounts of recombinant p120- and β-catenins, from 0.12 to 12 pmol, were incubated separately with 1.2 pmol of GST-cytoEcad. The complexes were bound to glutathione-Sepharose and the presence of the catenins associated to the beads was analyzed by Western blot with specific mAbs (Fig. 2). The results were compared with the signal obtained from known amounts of standards that were included in the Western blot analysis. Scatchard analysis were carried out and the association constant (K a) was determined from the slope of the regression line obtained. K a for E-cadherin/β-catenin or E-cadherin/p120-catenin were estimated to be 1.0 ± 0.2 × 108 and 3.6 ± 0.5 × 106m−1, respectively (Table I). The value of this constant for β-catenin/E-cadherin binding was similar to that obtained by Obama and Ozawa (18Obama H. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11017-11020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) for the association of this same catenin to α-catenin. p120-catenin presented a lower affinity, as has been suggested previously (14Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of β-catenin by pp60c-src significantly decreased the affinity by E-cadherin (Fig. 2 A); the association constant was 5-fold lower (Table I). On the other hand, phosphorylation of p120-catenin promoted the opposite effect; association of this catenin to E-cadherin was increased by a factor of 4 (Fig. 2 B and Table I).Table IAffinity constants for binding of cytoEcad to β-catenin or p120-cateninBinding of cytoEcad toK am −1 (× 10 7)β-Catenin10 ± 2.0β-Catenin (pp60c- src -phosphorylated)1.8 ± 0.4p120-catenin0.36 ± 0.05p120-catenin (pp60c- src -phosphorylated)1.2 ± 0.3β-Catenin + p120-catenin (4-fold molar excess)8.2 ± 0.5β-Catenin (phosphorylated) + p120-catenin (phosphorylated) (4-fold molar excess)1.4 ± 0.2β-Catenin (Y86F)10.2 ± 2.0β-Catenin (Y86F) (pp60c- src -phosphorylated)1.6 ± 0.3β-Catenin (Y654F)10.4 ± 2.0β-Catenin (Y654F) (pp60c- src -phosphorylated)10.2 ± 2.2β-Catenin (Y86E)8.6 ± 0.7β-Catenin (Y654E)0.77 ± 0.14 Open table in a new tab It has been reported previously that p120-catenin does not bind to the same region of the cytosolic domain of E-cadherin than β-catenin. However, a possibility to be considered consisted in that the association of p120-catenin could hamper β-catenin binding only when both proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated. Therefore, β-catenin binding assays were performed in the presence of p120-catenin. The addition of increasing amounts of this last protein (in a molar excess up to 4), either phosphorylated or not, did not modify the binding of control or Tyr-phosphorylated β-catenin to cytoEcad (Fig. 2 C). The association constants measured in these conditions were not substantially different from those calculated for β-catenin in the absence of p120 (Table I). Since β-catenin phosphorylation presented a functional relevance for E-cadherin activity, the identification of the modified Tyr residues was pursued. Phosphorylation of several β-catenin deletion mutants demonstrated the existence of Tyr residues capable to be phosphorylated in two different parts of the molecule (Fig. 3). A short N-terminal mutant, comprising amino acids 1–106, was efficiently phosphorylated, incorporating approximately 1 pmol of phosphate pmol of protein. No significant differences were detected between the amount of phosphate incorporated by this form and a longer N-terminal mutant (amino acids 1–575). This result suggests that amino acids placed between 106 and 575 were not phosphorylated by pp60c-src . The C-terminal tail of the molecule (575–783) was also substrate of this tyrosine kinase, although in a lower extent than the N terminus (approximately 0.5 pmol of phosphate/pmol of protein). Another shorter C-terminal fragment (575–693) was phosphorylated identically to the complete C-tail, indicating that the modified residue (or residues) was confined to this short sequence. In accordance, a fragment comprising residues 693–783 was not phosphorylated (Fig. 3). The Tyr residues present in the 1–106 and 575–693 fragments were analyzed and compared with sequences of well known substrates of Src protein kinases. None of the Tyr residues present in the 575–693 fragment fit well to the optimal phosphorylation sequence of this kinase, but among the three Tyr, Tyr-654 showed the best match. Tyr-670 was discarded because it contained three basic amino acids at position +1 to +3, a feature that makes phosphorylation by pp60c-src difficult (19Cooper J.A. Esch F.S. Taylor S.S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7835-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20McMurray J.S. Budde R.J. Ke S. Obeyesekere N.U. Wang W. Ramdas L. Lewis C.A. Arch. Biochem.

Res. 1997; 50: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In respect to Tyr-604, Tyr-654 presents an acidic residue on the N-terminal side (position −5), two Ala residues at position +1 and +2, and a Lys at +7, all characteristics repeatedly found in Src substrates. Three Tyr residues are also present in the 1–106 β-catenin fragment. Among these, Tyr-86 presents the best features: Arg at position +7, Ala at position +1 and, especially, two Asp residues upstream (−3 and −6). In addition, it contains a Gln at −1, another feature found in pp60c-src substrates (19Cooper J.A. Esch F.S. Taylor S.S. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7835-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20McMurray J.S. Budde R.J. Ke S. Obeyesekere N.U. Wang W. Ramdas L. Lewis C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). None, or only one, of these characteristics was observed in the sequences surrounding other Tyr residues. Therefore, the best candidates, Tyr-654 and Tyr-86, were mutagenized to Phe residues and mutant β-catenins were expressed and purified (Fig. 4 A). Phosphorylation experiments revealed that our predictions were correct; both Tyr-86 → Phe and Tyr-654 → Phe were significantly less phosphorylated by pp60c-src than the wild-type β-catenin (Fig. 4). The phosphorylation of the double mutant was undetectable (Fig. 4). As expected from the experiments performed with the deletion mutants, that suggested a higher stoichiometry of phosphorylation for Tyr-86 than for Tyr-654 (Fig. 3), the presence of the mutation Tyr-86 → Phe diminished more β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation than the mutation Tyr-654 → Phe (Fig. 4). The capacity of both β-catenin mutants to bind E-cadherin was also assayed and compared with that of wild-type β-catenin. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Tyr-86 → Phe and Tyr-654 → Phe β-catenin mutants associated to cytoEcad with a very similar affinity to the wild-type form: the association constants were not significantly different (Table I). pp60c-src phosphorylation decreased binding of Tyr-86 → Phe β-catenin mutant to cytoE-cad in a similar fashion to binding of wild-type β-catenin, but it did not alter binding of Tyr-654 → Phe mutant (Fig. 5 A and Table I). This result suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr-654 is relevant for the decrease in cytoEcad binding caused by pp60c-src . To verify this hypothesis, the two Tyr residues were mutagenized to Glu and mutant proteins expressed and purified (Fig. 5 B). This mutation introduces a negative charge in the position of Tyr and mimics the effect of phosphorylation of this residue. The results of the binding experiments indicate that, whereas Tyr-86 → Glu β-catenin associated to cytoE-cad in a manner identical to that for the wild-type form, Tyr-654 → Glu did it much worse (Fig. 5 C); theK a for this interaction was even lower than that calculated for β-catenin phosphorylated with pp60c-src (Table I). This fact is probably due to the incomplete phosphorylation of Tyr-654 in our in vitroassays. The functional relevance of Tyr-654 phosphorylation was also evidencedin vivo. Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type β-catenin or the two Tyr-654 mutants (Tyr-654 → Phe, Tyr-654 → Glu) labeled with a polyhistidine tag, to facilitate their purification. After 24 h, cells were incubated with the Tyr(P) phosphatase inhibitor Na3VaO4, a compound that increases β-catenin phosphorylation in Tyr residues, at the same time that dissociates adherens junctions (15Skoudy A. Llosas M.M. Garcia de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabanay I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B.

Transfected forms of β-catenin were purified by Ni2+-agarose chromatography, and their phosphorylation status was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6 A, phosphorylation of wild-type β-catenin was remarkably increased by incubation with Na3VaO4. On the other hand, the levels of Tyr(P) present in the two Tyr-654 mutants were not increased by this compound. Curiously, the basal Tyr(P) content of the three forms was very similar. This experiment suggests that Na3VaO4 induces phosphorylation of Tyr-654, but this residue is not phosphorylated in basal conditions. As previously mentioned, Na3VaO4 effects on tyrosine phosphorylation are accompanied by a lower number of E-cadherin/β-catenin cellular complexes. E-cadherin was retained by Ni2+-agarose only when β-catenin was bound to this resin (Fig. 6 A). After addition of Na3VaO4, the amount of E-cadherin that copurified with β-catenin was substantially reduced. Similar levels of E-cadherin were observed in the beads when wild-type β-catenin or Tyr-654 → Phe mutant were expressed (Fig. 6 A). However, the amount of E-cadherin that copurified with β-catenin Tyr-654 → Phe was not modified by Na3VaO4 as this form is not phosphorylated. The association of E-cadherin to β-catenin mutants Tyr-654 → Glu and Tyr-86 → Glu was also analyzed as these forms behave as constitutively phosphorylated. The amount of E-cadherin associated to Tyr-654 → Glu mutant was substantially lower than to the wild-type form (Fig. 6, A and B) and was not modified by addition of Na3VaO4. Unlike Tyr-654 → Glu, Tyr-86 → Glu interacted with E-cadherin identically than wild-type β-catenin (Fig. 6 B). All these results indicate that Tyr-654 phosphorylation is relevant for the modulation in vivo of the interaction β-catenin-E-cadherin. Several authors have determined that de-assembly of adhesion junctions was frequently associated to augmented tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins present in the complex (14Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22Volberg T. Zick Y. Dror R. Sabanay I. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Geiger B.

Clark G.J. Channing J.D. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, the most relevant changes have been detected in β-catenin; it has been assumed that increased tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was the cause of E-cadherin-loss-of-function. However, a conclusive relationship had not been established so far, and some authors have proposed alternative explanations (25Takeda H. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In this article we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin decreases its binding to E-cadherin in assays using purified proteins, evidencing a direct cause-effect relationship. We have identified the Tyr involved in regulation of this binding as Tyr-654 and have demonstrated that modification of this residue alters the modulation of E-cadherin/β-catenin bindingin vivo. In our in vitro assays, β-catenin phosphorylation was performed by pp60c-src tyrosine kinase. This protein kinase, or its viral homologue pp60v-src, has been reported to promote de-assembly of adherens junction, loss of function of E-cadherin, and phosphorylation of β-catenin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Our results suggest that pp60c-src might be the tyrosine kinase directly responsible for the phosphorylation and, thus, the inactivation of β-catenin. However, it cannot be discounted that another protein-tyrosine kinase, activated by pp60c-src, is the direct β-catenin kinase, or contributes to the complete tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein. At this respect, it should be remembered that the two Tyr residues modified are not phosphorylated with the same efficiency. It is possible that, in vivo, pp60c-src is catalyzing the direct phosphorylation of Tyr-86 but not of Tyr-654. In addition to pp60c-src, other plausible candidates to be responsible for Tyr-654 phosphorylation are the Fer kinase and the EGF receptor, two tyrosine kinases that are associated to β-catenin (26Rosato R. Veltmaat J.M. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5762-5770Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Shibamoto S. Hayakawa M. Takeuchi K. Hori T. Oku N. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Takeichi M. Ito F. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 1: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In this respect, both EGF receptor and its homologue the proto-oncogene c-erb-2 have been shown to associate to the last three armadillo repeats of β-catenin (10Shibata T. Ochiai A. Kanai Y. Akimoto S. Gotoh M. Yasui N. Machinami R. Hirohashi S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 883-889PubMed Google Scholar), precisely the region of this protein where Tyr-654 is located. Altered cell adhesion has been reported to be also associated to disruption of α-catenin/β-catenin binding (28Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of unknown β-catenin residues seems to be responsible of this effect. Dissociation of these proteins is probably required for β-catenin to be transported to the nucleus and work as a transcriptional cofactor (reviewed in 29Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have tested the ability of our mutants to bind recombinant α-catenin. No changes in thein vitro association of these two proteins were observed after phosphorylation of β-catenin by pp60c-src or when binding to α-catenin of Tyr-86 → Glu and Tyr-654 → Glu mutants were compared with the wild-type form. 2J. Piedra, A. Garcı́a de Herreros, and M. Duñach, unpublished observations. These results suggest that pp60c-src is not directly responsible for the modification of the Tyr residue that modulates α-catenin/β-catenin association and that neither Tyr-654 nor Tyr-86 are involved in this process. A more plausible candidate for this role is Tyr-143, the only Tyr residue present in the β-catenin domain necessary for α-catenin binding (30Barth A.I. Näthke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 690-693Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In any case, the physiological relevance of tyrosine phosphorylation in the control of β-catenin/α-catenin binding is likely to be dependent on the cell system, since in Caco-2 cells treatment with Na3VaO4 did not modify the amount of α-catenin/β-catenin binding. No differences were observed in the amount of α-catenin that copurified with transfected β-catenin in the experiment described in Fig. 6 after treatment with Na3VaO4 (data not shown). p120-catenin was initially characterized as a substrate of the activated pp60v-src kinase and only recently has been described its binding to E-cadherin (14Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Our group (15Skoudy A. Llosas M.M. Garcia de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and others (24Kinch M.S. Clark G.J. Channing J.D. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) have reported that this protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated in conditions of E-cadherin-loss-of-function and that this modification is accompanied by a greater binding of p120-catenin to E-cadherin. These results have suggested that p120-catenin could act as a negative effector of adherens junctions, decreasing E-cadherin/β-catenin binding. The data described in this paper indicated that this is not the case. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 associates better to E-cadherin than the unmodified catenin but does not compete with the binding of β-catenin. The exact role of p120-catenin phosphorylation, and its subsequent binding to E-cadherin, in the loss of the adhesive properties of this protein still has to be demonstrated. The description by Gumbiner and co-workers (31Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) that p120-catenin binds to E-cadherin in a cytoplasmic region necessary for E-cadherin clustering suggests that this protein might be involved in the regulation of this process. Tyr-654, the tyrosine residue that controls β-catenin/E-cadherin binding, maps in the twelfth and last armadillo repeat of β-catenin (32Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The structure of the armadillo repeats of β-catenin has been elucidated; they form a highly elongated domain composed entirely of α-helices with a long, positively charged groove. This structure is thought to accommodate the 30-amino acid sequence present in cytoEcad shown to be sufficient for binding to β-catenin (33Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). This E-cadherin sequence is quite acidic (pI of 3.3), like the sequences of other proteins known also to interact with β-catenin armadillo repeats. Therefore, it has been proposed that E-cadherin/β-catenin interaction is dominated by ion pairs over an extended region, more than a close steric complementarity on a more limited area. It is easy to speculate that the introduction of a phosphate group, and thus, a negative charge, in the armadillo domain might affect this interaction, either diminishing the number of ion pairs or partially closing the long groove. The fact that the modified residue is not in the central part of this structure may help to explain the armadillo domain is still able to associate to other proteins after phosphorylation, as adenomatous polyposis coli (30Barth A.I.

Since FTDP-17 tau gene mutations alter levels/functions of tau, we overexpressed the smallest human tau isoform in the CNS of transgenic (Tg) mice to model tauopathies. These mice acquired age-dependent CNS pathology similar to FTDP-17 and ALS/PDC, including insoluble, hyperphosphorylated tau and argyrophilic intraneuronal inclusions formed by tau-immunoreactive filaments. Inclusions were present in cortical and brainstem neurons but were most abundant in spinal cord neurons, where they were associated with axon degeneration, diminished microtubules (MTs), and reduced axonal transport in ventral roots, as well as spinal cord gliosis and motor weakness. These Tg mice recapitulate key features of tauopathies and provide models for elucidating mechanisms underlying diverse tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD)."

The lack of intrinsic enzymatic activity of p75NTR prompted a search for protein interactors expressed in the developing retina, which resulted in the identification of the GTPase RhoA. In transfected cells, p75NTR activated RhoA, and neurotrophin binding abolished RhoA activation. In cultured neurons, inactivation of Rho proteins mimicked the effect of neurotrophins by increasing the rate of neurite elongation. In vivo, axonal outgrowth was retarded in mice carrying a mutation in the p75NTR gene. These results indicate that p75NTR modulates in a ligand-dependent fashion the activity of intracellular proteins known to regulate actin assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2040353213,"Increases in postsynaptic [Ca2+]i can result from Ca2+ entry through ligand-gated channels or voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, or through release from intracellular stores. Most attention has focused on entry through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in causing [Ca2+]i increases since this pathway requires both presynaptic stimulation and postsynaptic depolarization, making it a central component in models of synaptic plasticity. Here, we report that repetitive synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), paired with backpropagating action potentials, causes large, wave-like increases in [Ca2+]i predominantly in restricted regions of the proximal apical dendrites and soma of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. [Ca2+]i changes of several micromolars can be reached by regenerative release caused by the synergistic effect of mGluR-generated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and spike-evoked Ca2+ entry acting on the IP3 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2042295311,"MAP kinase (ERK) translates cell surface signals into alterations in transcription. We have found that ERK also regulates hippocampal neuronal excitability during 5 Hz stimulation and thereby regulates forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) that do not require macromolecular synthesis. Moreover, ERK-mediated changes in excitability are selectively required for some forms of LTP but not others. ERK is required for the early phase of LTP elicited by brief 5 Hz stimulation, as well as for LTP elicited by more prolonged 5 Hz stimulation when paired with β1-adrenergic receptor activation. By contrast, ERK plays no role in LTP elicited by a single 1 s 100 Hz train. Consistent with these results, we find that ERK is activated by β-adrenergic receptors in CA1 pyramidal cell somas and dendrites."

The phytotoxin fusicoccin specifically induces association of virtually any 14-3-3 protein to plant plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. The 14-3-3 binding site in the Arabidopsis plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase AHA2 was localized to the three C-terminal residues of the enzyme (Tyr(946)-Thr-Val). Binding of 14-3-3 protein to this target was induced by phosphorylation of Thr(947) (K(D) = 88 nM) and was in practice irreversible in the presence of fusicoccin (K(D) = 7 nM). Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that AHA2 expressed in yeast was phosphorylated at Thr(947). We conclude that the extreme end of AHA2 contains an unusual high-affinity binding site for 14-3-3 protein."

Electrophysiological recordings in the hippocampal CA1 region revealed that shortterm and long-term synaptic plasticity were severely reduced in the synaptophysin/synaptogyrin double knockout mice. LTP was decreased independent of the induction protocol, suggesting that the defect in LTP was not caused by insufficient induction.

Adult mice immunized in this manner showed extensive regeneration of large numbers of axons of the corticospinal tracts after dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord.

The activity that cleaves APP (called γ-secretase) has properties of an aspartyl protease, and mutation of either of the two aspartate residues located in adjacent transmembrane domains of PS1 inhibits γ-secretase processing of APP. We show here that these aspartates are required for Notch processing, since mutation of these residues prevents PS1 from inducing the γ-secretase-like proteolysis of a Notch1 derivative. Thus PS1 might function in Notch cleavage as an aspartyl protease or di-aspartyl protease cofactor. However, the ER localization of PS1 is inconsistent with that hypothesis, since Notch cleavage occurs near the cell surface. Using pulse-chase and biotinylation assays, we provide evidence that PS1 binds Notch in the ER/Golgi and is then co-transported to the plasma membrane as a complex. PS1 aspartate mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type PS1 in their ability to bind Notch or traffic with it to the cell surface, and did not alter the secretion of Notch.

Since γ-secretase has properties of an aspartyl protease (24Wolfe M.S. Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L. Leatherwood D.D. Ostaszewski B. Rahmati T. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. Biochem. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that these aspartyl residues in PS1 form a novel intramembraneous protease active site (23Wolfe M.S.

However, Notch cleavage is initiated at the cell surface in response to extracellular ligand binding (1Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These observations are more consistent with PS1 having an indirect role in Notch and APP metabolism, as suggested by studies reporting that the Caenorhabditis elegans Notch homologue LIN-12 had altered subcellular distribution insel-12 (a PS homologue) mutant animals (25Levitan D. Greenwald I. Development. 1998; 125: 3599-3606PubMed Google Scholar), and that PS1-deficient neurons secrete APP at an abnormal rate (26Narusse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T.

To address this discrepancy, we analyzed the effects of mutation of the TM aspartates in PS1 on Notch processing. We report here that these aspartates are required for PS1 to induce ΔE cleavage in PS1-deficient cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that PS1 forms a complex with ΔE in the ER and that this complex is transported to the cell surface. The TM aspartates in PS1 appear to be specifically involved with ΔE proteolysis and do not affect Notch or PS1 subcellular distribution. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293), mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (23Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J.

Cultures were washed three times in PBS pH 8.5 (measured at 4 °C), then incubated in the same solution with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link NHS-SS-Biotin reagent (Pierce) for 30 min. Cells were washed once with PBS, 100 mm glycine, then incubated in glycine buffer for 15 min. In some experiments 0.5% BSA was added to the wash buffer. Cells were washed again with glycine buffer and lysed either in co-IP lysis buffer, 0.5% BSA or in IP buffer. Lysates were rocked for 1 h, and supernatants were either incubated overnight with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) or first subjected to IP. After IP the beads were washed twice with IP buffer and PBS, then dried by aspiration. Immunoprecipitated proteins were collected in 2% SDS at 55 °C for 5 min, diluted into IP buffer 5:1, and incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads overnight. Streptavidin beads were washed in IP buffer and PBS as above, resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and heated for 5 min. at 55 °C for PS1 or 100 °C for other proteins. Previous work suggested that presenilins have a similar function in both Notch and APP metabolism (17De Strooper B. Anneart W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H.

A. 1999; 96: 3263-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the TM aspartates in PS1 involved in the γ-secretase cleavage of APP (23Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar) also function in Notch processing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transiently transfected with mNotch1ΔEm/v (abbreviated ΔE), a truncation of mouse Notch1 that undergoes PS1-regulated TM proteolysis constitutively in the absence of ligand (1Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 29Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development. 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ΔE encodes the TM domain and part of the cytoplasmic tail of Notch1 and has six consecutive myc epitope tags at its C terminus to facilitate detection. Notch processing was detected by the appearance of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), the C-terminal product of γ-secretase-like cleavage. Transient overexpression of wild-type PS1 had no effect on NICD levels compared with cells expressing endogenous PS1 (Fig. 1 A). However when PS1 encoding an aspartate-to-alanine mutation at codon 257 (D257A PS1) was expressed, NICD levels were significantly reduced (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained when ΔE was transiently transfected into the stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines used to document the effect of this mutation on APP processing (23Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Analysis of PS1 expression in these cells by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot (IP-Western) revealed that overexpression of D257A PS1 had no effect on the accumulation of the N-terminal and C-terminal PS1 endoproteolytic cleavage fragments, which are derived from endogenous PS1 since D257A PS1 does not undergo endoproteolysis (23Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Thus, D257A PS1 suppresses ΔE processing without altering the levels of endogenous PS1 cleavage fragments. To determine if the D257A PS1 mutation abolishes PS1 activity, we performed rescue experiments in cells lacking PS1, where ΔE cleavage is greatly reduced (17De Strooper B. Anneart W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of wild-type, but not D257A PS1, in PS1 −/− fibroblasts rescued ΔE cleavage (Fig. 1, C andD). PS1 mutated at the other TM aspartate (D385A) also failed to rescue ΔE cleavage in PS1−/− cells (data not shown). Although the PS1 plasmid led to overexpression in other cell lines (e.g. Fig. 1 A), and the transfection procedure led to expression of the ΔE construct in these same cells (Fig. 1 B), exogenous wild-type PS1 protein did not accumulate to high levels in PS1−/− cells. PS1 −/− cells transfected with wild-type PS1 cleave Notch despite expressing nearly undetectable amounts of PS1 (Fig. 1 C, lower panel; at maximum exposure low levels of PS1 holoprotein and cleavage fragments were visible; data not shown). A very small amount of PS1 thus induced the cleavage of ΔE, and mutation of either TM aspartate abolished that ability, even when D257A PS1 accumulated at much higher levels. The absence of PS1 endoproteolysis in D275A or D385A PS1 does not account for loss of activity, because these mutations are also dominant negative in the context of a PS1 mutant that cannot undergo endoproteolysis and is active as a full-length holoprotein (Ref. 23Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar; data not shown). These results demonstrate that mutation of the TM aspartate residues of PS1 eliminate its ability to promote ΔE proteolysis, even though very low levels of wild-type PS1 are sufficient to restore ΔE cleavage to near wild-type levels. Most studies report that PS1 is restricted to the ER/Golgi (13Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; S399: A23-A31Crossref Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 14Selkoe D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 15Haass C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Hardy J. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1997; 20: 154-159Google Scholar), a finding inconsistent with PS1 having a direct role in ΔE cleavage, which occurs in a post-Golgi compartment, most likely at or near the cell surface (1Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our previous work showed that PS1 preferentially binds the immature, unprocessed form of Notch1 in transfected mammalian cells, a finding most consistent with PS1 acting on Notch prior to furin cleavage in the trans-Golgi network (22Ray W.J. Yao M. Nowotny P. Mumm J. Zhang W. Wu J.Y. Kopan R. Goate A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3263-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). ΔE processing involves two distinct steps: transport to the site of cleavage and proteolysis. Mutation of the TM aspartates could block either and result in reduced NICD levels. We therefore determined when during its maturation ΔE binds PS1 using a pulse-chase/co-immunoprecipitation assay. HEK 293 cells transfected with ΔE were metabolically labeled for 20 min, followed by chase with unlabeled medium. Lysates were split and subjected to either anti-myc IP (to recover total ΔE) or PS1 IP to purify the population of ΔE bound to PS1. The ICV construct (6Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) encodes a polypeptide identical to NICD and was used as a migration control. Our previous work demonstrated that Notch1 is specifically recovered by co-immunoprecipitation with PS1, and that Notch and PS1 do not associate after lysis (22Ray W.J. Yao M. Nowotny P. Mumm J. Zhang W. Wu J.Y. Kopan R. Goate A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3263-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, this method allows for a determination of whether ΔE associates with PS1 prior to or during its proteolytic processing. Very little NICD accumulated during the 20 min labeling period (time 0), indicating that most newly synthesized ΔE had not yet been trafficked beyond the ER/Golgi to the site of proteolysis (Fig. 2). At this time point, uncleaved ΔE was co-immunoprecipitated with PS1. We estimate that approximately 5% of total labeled ΔE was bound to PS1, since 20-fold more starting material had to be analyzed for the signal intensity from total cellular ΔE to be approximately equal to PS1-associated ΔE. This proportion of Notch molecules bound to PS1 is very similar to that observed with full-length Notch in transfected HEK 293 cells (22Ray W.J. Yao M. Nowotny P. Mumm J. Zhang W. Wu J.Y. Kopan R. Goate A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3263-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, a subset of ΔE polypeptides formed a complex with PS1 within 20 min of synthesis, most likely in the ER/Golgi where PS1 is predominantly expressed. Thirty minutes after the end of labeling, NICD began to accumulate, indicating that a small subset of ΔE molecules had been processed into NICD. At this and all subsequent time points, the uncleaved ΔE substrate, but not the NICD product, was recovered with PS1. Thus, a subpopulation of ΔE was associated with PS1 early after synthesis and at later time points when ΔE was undergoing proteolysis. The previous result suggests two possibilities; either the PS1-Notch complex forms in the ER/Golgi and is transported to the cell surface, where it becomes involved in Notch proteolysis, or the complex remains in the ER/Golgi while free Notch molecules are transported to the cell surface and cleaved. To determine if the PS1-Notch complex is present at the cell surface, a biotinylation/co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed (diagrammed in Fig. 3). HEK 293 cells were transfected with FLN6mt, a construct that encodes nearly full-length mouse Notch1 (residues 1–2192) with six myc epitopes at its C terminus. Full-length Notch (FLN) is constitutively cleaved by furin in the Golgi, and furin-cleaved Notch heterodimers are the predominant form detected at the cell surface (4Blaumueller C.M. Qi H. Zagouras P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 5Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. LeBail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G. Israel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). FLN6mt transfected HEK 293 cells expressed both FLN6mt precursor and its furin-generated C-terminal product (called TMIC-N) (Fig. 3,lane 1). The N-terminal product of furin cleavage is not detected because it lacks the myc epitope, and NICD is not produced because there is no ligand present. Extracellular proteins were then labeled with biotin on ice to limit intracellular transport to, and internalization from, the cell surface. After biotin treatment, the furin-processed TMIC fragment of FLN6mt and a trace amount of full-length precursor were recovered with streptavidin, consistent with published observations (4Blaumueller C.M. Qi H. Zagouras P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 5Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. LeBail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G. Israel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) (lane 3). No Notch was recovered when biotin had been omitted as a control (lane 2). In parallel, the PS1-Notch complex was recovered by PS1 immunoprecipitation to determine if any of the Notch bound to PS1 had been biotinylated. PS1 is predominantly bound to FLN, but also binds a subset of furin-generated TMIC (Fig. 3, lane 4; Ref. 22Ray W.J. Yao M. Nowotny P. Mumm J. Zhang W. Wu J.Y. Kopan R. Goate A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3263-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). When the Notch bound to PS1 was eluted and reprecipitated with streptavidin, furin-cleaved TMIC Notch was recovered from biotin-treated cells, but not from mock-treated cells. Starting with an equal amount of lysate, biotinylated Notch was recovered as efficiently from PS1-immunoprecipitated material as from total lysate, indicating that a substantial percentage of cell surface Notch is bound to PS1. This efficient recovery was observed with two other PS1 antibodies (data not shown) but not with preimmune serum (lanes 7 and 8). To control for nonspecific recovery of biotinylated proteins, we examined the cadherins, a family of cell surface proteins. The Western blot in the top panel of Fig. 3 was stripped and reprobed with anti-cadherin. Cadherins endogenously expressed in HEK 293 cells (middle panel, lane 1) were efficiently biotinylated (middle panel, lane 3) but were not immunoprecipitated with PS1 (middle panel,lane 4). Furthermore, biotinylated cadherin molecules were not detected in the pool of proteins enriched by PS1 immunoprecipitation (middle panel,lane 6), indicating that this purification step was not significantly contaminated with plasma membrane. Next, the filter was stripped and probed for β-catenin"

We show that the directed circumferential migration of basilar pontine neurons from their origin in the neuroepithelium of the dorsal hindbrain to the ventral midline involves the extension of long (>1 mm) leading processes, which marker analyses suggest are molecularly distinct from axons. In vivo analysis of knockout mice implicates the axonal chemoattractant netrin-1, functioning via its receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), in attracting the leading process to the ventral midline. Direct evidence for this chemoattractant mechanism is provided, using explant cultures and time-lapse analysis in vitro. Our results demonstrate the attraction of migrating neurons in the mammalian brain by an axon guidance molecule and the chemotactic responsiveness of their leading processes."
https://openalex.org/W2036476604,"Androgens are important growth regulators in prostate cancer. Their known mode of action in target cells requires binding to a cytoplasmic androgen receptor followed by a nuclear translocation event and modulation of the expression of specific genes. Here, we report another mode of action of this receptor. Treatment of androgen responsive prostate cancer cells with dihydrotestosterone leads to a rapid and reversible activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs (also called extracellular signal-regulated kinases or Erks). Transient transfection assays demonstrated that the androgen receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase results in enhanced activity of the transcription factor Elk-1. This action of the androgen receptor differs from its known transcriptional activity since it is rapid and insensitive to androgen antagonists such as hydroxyflutamide or casodex. Biochemical studies as well as analyses with dominant negative mutants showed the involvement of kinases such as MAPK/Erk kinase, phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C in the androgen receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase. These results demonstrate a novel regulatory action of the androgen receptor and prove that in addition to its known transcriptional effects, it also uses non-conventional means to modulate several cellular signalling processes."
https://openalex.org/W2079978401,"We report that the zebrafish mutation soulless, in which the development of locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic (NA) neurons failed to occur, disrupts the homeodomain protein Phox2a. Phox2a is not only necessary but also sufficient to induce Phox2b+ dopamine-beta-hydroxylase+ and tyrosine hydroxylase+ NA neurons in ectopic locations. Phox2a is first detected in LC progenitors in the dorsal anterior hindbrain, and its expression there is dependent on FGF8 from the mid/hindbrain boundary and on optimal concentrations of BMP signal from the epidermal ectoderm/future dorsal neural plate junction. These findings suggest that Phox2a coordinates the specification of LC in part through the induction of Phox2b and in response to cooperating signals that operate along the mediolateral and anteroposterior axes of the neural plate."
https://openalex.org/W2122630126,"Neurotrophins and tyrosine receptor kinase (Trk) receptors are expressed in skeletal muscle, but it is unclear what functional role Trk-mediated signaling plays during postnatal life. Full-length TrkB (trkB.FL) as well as truncated TrkB (trkB.t1) were found to be localized primarily to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor- (AChR-) rich membrane at neuromuscular junctions. In vivo, dominant-negative manipulation of TrkB signaling using adenovirus to overexpress trkB.t1 in mouse sternomastoid muscle fibers resulted in the disassembly of postsynaptic AChR clusters at neuromuscular junctions, similar to that observed in mutant trkB+/- mice. When TrkB-mediated signaling was disrupted in cultured myotubes in the absence of motor nerve terminals and Schwann cells, agrin-induced AChR clusters were also disassembled. These results demonstrate a novel role for neurotrophin signaling through TrkB receptors on muscle fibers in the ongoing maintenance of postsynaptic AChR regions."

Contactin, a cell adhesion/recognition molecule of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, regulates axon growth and fasciculation in vitro, but its role in vivo is unknown. To assess its function in the developing nervous system, we have ablated contactin gene expression in mice. Contactin-/- mutants displayed a severe ataxic phenotype consistent with defects in the cerebellum and survived only until postnatal day 18. Analysis of the contactin-/- mutant cerebellum revealed defects in granule cell axon guidance and in dendritic projections from granule and Golgi cells. These results demonstrate that contactin controls axonal and dendritic interactions of cerebellar interneurons and contributes to cerebellar microorganization."

Using a protein interaction cloning procedure, we identified a human gene designated as bis (mapped to chromosome 10q25) that encoded a novel Bcl-2-interacting protein. Bis protein showed no significant homology with Bcl-2 family proteins and had no prominent functional motif. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Bis interacted with Bcl-2 in vivo. DNA transfection experiments indicated that Bis itself exerted only weak anti-apoptotic activity, but was synergistic with Bcl-2 in preventing Bax-induced and Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that Bis is a novel modulator of cellular anti-apoptotic activity that functions through its interaction with Bcl-2."
https://openalex.org/W2048877266,"To evaluate the role in synaptic plasticity of ryanodine receptor type 3 (RyR3), which is normally enriched in hippocampal area CA1, we generated RyR3-deficient mice. Mutant mice exhibited facilitated CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by short tetanus (100 Hz, 100 ms) stimulation. Unlike LTP in wild-type mice, this LTP was not blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 but was partially dependent on L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Long-term depression (LTD) was not induced in RyR3-deficient mice. RyR3-deficient mice also exhibited improved spatial learning on a Morris water maze task. These results suggest that in wild-type mice, in contrast to the excitatory role of Ca2+ influx, RyR3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may inhibit hippocampal LTP and spatial learning."

We isolated two homeobox genes from mouse and chicken, mVax2 and cVax, whose expression during early eye development is restricted to the ventral retina. In chick, ectopic expression of either Vax leads to ventralization of the early retina, as assayed by expression of the transcription factors Pax2 and Tbx5, and the Eph family members EphB2, EphB3, ephrinB1, and ephrinB2, all of which are normally dorsally or ventrally restricted. Moreover, the projections of dorsal but not ventral ganglion cell axons onto the optic tectum showed profound targeting errors following cVax misexpression. mVax2/cVax thus specify positional identity along the D-V axis of the retina and influence retinotectal mapping."
https://openalex.org/W1972113189,"The increased or inappropriate expression of genes with oncogenic properties through specific chromosome translocations is an important event in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases. Recent studies have found deletions or translocations of chromosome 7q to be the most common cytogenetic abnormality observed in SLVL, a leukemic variant of SMZL, with the q21 – q22 region being most frequently affected. In three patients with translocations between chromosomes 2 and 7, the cloning of the breakpoints at 7q21 revealed that each was located within a small region of DNA 3.6 kb upstream of the transcription start site of cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). In each case the translocation event was consistent with aberrant VJ recombination between the immunoglobulin light chain region (Ig kappa) on chromosome 2p12 and DNA sequences at 7q21, resembling the heptamer recombination site. The t(7;21) breakpoint in an additional patient with splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), resided 66 kb telomeric to the t(2;7) breakpoints juxtaposing CDK6 to an uncharacterized transcript. In two of the SLVL patient samples, the CDK6 protein was found to be markedly over expressed. These results suggest that dysregulation of CDK6 gene expression contributes to the pathogenesis of SLVL and SMZL."

Here, we use repeated optical imaging in conjunction with single unit recordings to assess the plasticity of a single whisker's functional representation in the adult rat. We observed a large-scale expansion of a single whisker's functional representation following innocuous removal of all neighboring whiskers. Surprisingly, the same manipulation can also induce a large-scale contraction of the representation if the animal is removed from its home cage and given a brief opportunity to use its whiskers for active exploration of a different environment. Both the expansion and contraction reverse upon regrowth of the deprived whiskers. Thus, allowing the animal to use its deprived receptor organ in active exploration can determine the direction of plasticity in the adult cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2093249575,"Telomerase activity, the ability to add telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes, has been detected in most immortal cell lines including tumor cells, but is low or absent in most diploid, mortal cells such as those of somatic tissues. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), analogs of DNA or RNA which bind to complementary nucleic acids with very high affinity, were co-electroporated into immortal human cells along with a selectable plasmid. Introduction of PNAs inverse-complementary to telomerase RNA effectively inhibited telomerase activity in intact cells, shortened telomeres, reduced colony size, and arrested cell proliferation after a lag period of 5 – 30 cell generations, consistent with suppression of their `immortality'. Electroporation of selection plasmid alone had no effect, while PNAs of altered sequence were markedly less effective in each assay. This constitutes the first demonstration of cell growth arrest through telomerase inhibition, upon treatment of intact cells with an exogenous compound which can be efficiently delivered in vivo. The phenotype of telomerase-inhibited transformed cells differs from senescence of normal diploid fibroblasts, but rather resembles the crisis state of incompletely transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2150947418,"Waves of spontaneous activity sweep across the developing mammalian retina and influence the pattern of central connections made by ganglion cell axons. These waves are driven by synaptic input from amacrine cells. We show that cholinergic synaptic transmission during waves is not blocked by TTX, indicating that release from starburst amacrine cells is independent of sodium action potentials. The spatiotemporal properties of the waves are regulated by endogenous release of adenosine, which sets intracellular cAMP levels through activation of A2 receptors present on developing amacrine and ganglion cells. Increasing cAMP levels increase the size, speed, and frequency of the waves. Conversely, inhibiting adenylate cyclase or PKA prevents wave activity. Together, these results imply a novel mechanism in which levels of cAMP within an immature retinal circuit regulate the precise spatial and temporal patterns of spontaneous neural activity."
https://openalex.org/W2133012434,"The RET/PTC3 rearrangement is formed by fusion of the ELE1 and RET genes, and is highly prevalent in radiation-induced post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas. We characterized the breakpoints in the ELE1 and RET genes in 12 post-Chernobyl pediatric papillary carcinomas with known RET/PTC3 rearrangement. We found that the breakpoints within each intron were distributed in a relatively random fashion, except for clustering in the Alu regions of ELE1. None of the breakpoints occurred at the same base or within a similar sequence. There was also no evidence of preferential cleavage in AT-rich regions or other target DNA sites implicated in illegitimate recombination in mammalian cells. Modification of sequences at the cleavage sites was minimal, typically involving a 1 – 3 nucleotide deletion and/or duplication. Surprisingly, the alignment of ELE1 and RET introns in opposite orientation revealed that in each tumor the position of the break in one gene corresponded to the position of the break in the other gene. This tendency suggests that the two genes may lie next to each other but point in opposite directions in the nucleus. Such a structure would facilitate formation of RET/PTC3 rearrangements because a single radiation track could produce concerted breaks in both genes, leading to inversion due to reciprocal exchange via end-joining."
https://openalex.org/W9861249,"Postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95/SAP-90) is a membrane associated guanylate kinase (GK) PDZ protein that scaffolds glutamate receptors and associated signaling networks at excitatory synapses. Affinity chromatography identifies cypin as a major PSD-95-binding protein in brain extracts. Cypin is homologous to a family of hydrolytic bacterial enzymes and shares some similarity with collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP), a cytoplasmic mediator of semaphorin III signalling. Cypin is discretely expressed in neurons and is polarized to basal membranes in intestinal epithelial cells. Overexpression of cypin in hippocampal neurons specifically perturbs postsynaptic trafficking of PSD-95 and SAP-102, an effect not produced by overexpression of other PDZ ligands. In fact, PSD-95 can induce postsynaptic clustering of an otherwise diffusely localized K+ channel, Kv1.4. By regulating postsynaptic protein sorting, cypin may influence synaptic development and plasticity."

Many cells are resistant, however, to the cytotoxic effects of TNFα due to the concurrent activation of pro-survival pathways involving the transcription factor NFκB and TRAF2. Here we show that the TNFα-activated FADD/caspase pathway can also exert an unexpected pro-survival effect. Inhibition of this pathway in NIH3T3 fibroblasts or U937 leukemic cells by peptide caspase inhibitors or expression of dominant-negative FADD leads to rapid death following treatment with TNFα, whereas control cells are TNFα-resistant. FADD/caspase-inhibited cells die by a non-apoptotic mechanism caused by increased production of reactive oxygen species which precedes loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Cytotoxicity can be prevented by preincubation with antioxidants including reduced glutathione or by expression of a dominant-negative Rac GTP-binding protein. These results indicate that caspase activation in response to TNFα has anti-necrotic as well as pro-apoptotic effects and extend our understanding of the biological role of these proteases.

It has been known for some years that blocking protein synthesis sensitizes most cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis indicating that protein synthesis-dependent protective mechanisms normally antagonize protein-synthesis independent cytotoxicity (1Beutler B.

The molecular basis of the TNFα-induced pro-apoptotic pathway has been characterized recently and involves a group of adaptor proteins containing a conserved motif known as a death domain (DD) and a family of proteases known to play a central role in apoptosis (caspases) which themselves require proteolytic activation (5Wallach D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The nature of the anti-apoptotic pathway induced by TNFα has also been unravelled. TNFα activates the NFκB transcription factor by a pathway involving the death domain kinase RIP (as shown by defective activation of this pathway in ripnull mice) (12Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of inhibiting caspase activity in modifying TNFα-induced cellular responses, in particular cell death by apoptosis. Unexpectedly, we found that inhibition of caspase activity in a tumor-derived human pro-monocytic cell line sensitized to the cytotoxic effects of TNFα in the absence of protein synthesis inhibition. Similar effects were seen in murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts with cells dying by a non-apoptotic mechanism dependent on the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, TNFα-induced caspase activity has an anti-necrotic as well as a pro-apoptotic effect and inhibition of this pathway in certain cells sensitizes them to TNFα-induced cell death. The U937 cell line was maintained in RPMI plus 10% fetal calf serum and the NIH3T3 cell line in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. zVAD.fmk was from Bachem and all other peptide caspase inhibitors were from Enzyme Systems Products. Human recombinant TNFα was from Peprotech; reduced glutathione ethyl ester andN-acetylcysteine were from Sigma. The DN-FADD construct was a gift from V. Dixit and has been previously described (8Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Woodgett and the mutant H-Ras and Rac vectors were as described previously (22Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were plated at 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate and transfected the following day with 1.5 μg of the test plasmid DNA plus 0.5 μg of a GFP plasmid (pEGFP-N1, CLONTECH, to identify transfected cells) using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Typical transfection rates at 24 h ranged from 20 to 40%. After 24 h cells were treated with diluent control, TNFα (50 ng/ml) alone, zVAD.fmk (50 μm) alone, or zVAD.fmk for 30 min followed by TNFα. After 8 or 24 h, cells were detached, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (Epics, Coulter) for GFP positivity and the ability to exclude propidium iodide. The numbers of propidium iodide excluding, GFP positive cells in the TNFα or zVAD+ TNFα samples, were compared with those in diluent control treated cells and the results expressed as % survival. Control cells were transfected with plasmid vector plus GFP. U937 cells were incubated with TNFα (50 ng/ml) after incubation for 45 min with cycloheximide (5 μg/ml), zVAD.fmk (50 μm), or diluent control in RPMI/10% fetal calf serum at a cell density of 106 per ml. At indicated time points 5 × 106 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and processed for caspase-8 activity using the ApoAlert caspase-8 colorimetric assay kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturers instructions. Each assay point was run in duplicate using lysates from 2 × 106 cell equivalents. NIH3T3 cells were plated at 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate and treated with diluent control, TNFα (50 ng/ml) alone, zVAD.fmk (50 μm) alone, or zVAD.fmk for 30 min followed by TNFα. At the stated time points, dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123, Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 2 μm for 30 min. Cells were then washed and harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. ROS production was compared with that in control cells by setting an appropriate gate (Fig. 4) and considering cells with a greater fluorescence than this to be positive. In experiments investigating induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition and production of ROS simultaneously, cells were incubated for 30 min with 50 nm 3,3′-diethyloxacarbocyanine (DiOC6(3)) to assess mitochondrial membrane potential and 2 μmhydroethidine to measure ROS production. DNA fragmentation was quantified using the Cell Death Detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (23Khwaja A. Rodriguez Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). For propidium iodide staining to detect hypodiploid DNA cells were fixed overnight in 70% ethanol at −20 °C, washed, and incubated with RNase A for 10 min and then propidium iodide for 5 min before analysis by flow cytometry. For clonogenic survival assays, NIH3T3 were plated at 200 or 500 cells per 5-cm tissue culture plate in standard medium and fixed/stained with methanol/crystal violet 10–14 days later. Like many cell lines, U937 human leukemic cells are normally resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNFα but will undergo apoptosis if protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide with over 95% cell death within 6 h (data not shown). While investigating the role of caspase inhibitors in modifying TNFα-mediated apoptosis we found that preincubation of U937 cells with the broad spectrum peptide caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk (24Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4124) Google Scholar) sensitized cells to TNFα cytotoxicity in the absence of cycloheximide (Fig. 1). This effect was rapid with over 30% of cells unable to exclude propidium iodide or trypan blue after 6 h. Prolonged incubation showed that less than 5% of cells were alive at 48 h in optimal TNFα and zVAD.fmk concentrations. In order to quantify caspase activation in response to TNFα alone or in cells preincubated with either cycloheximide or zVAD.fmk, we measured cleavage of the preferred caspase-8 substrate IETD-pNA using cell extracts made at time points up to 6 h after TNFα addition. Fig. 1 shows that in cells preincubated with cycloheximide there is a marked increase in caspase-8 activity that peaks 2–3 h after TNFα addition. The addition of TNFα alone results in a small but consistent increase in caspase-8 activity which is between 8 and 16% of the response seen with cycloheximide plus TNFα. Although the magnitude of the increase with TNFα alone is relatively modest, the increase over baseline activity at time points between 120 and 360 min is highly statistically significant (p < 0.01 by paired t test compared with time 0) and is inhibited by preincubation with the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. In addition to the findings in U937 cells we detected a similar response to zVAD.fmk plus TNFα in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1). In the absence of cycloheximide these cells were resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNFα at concentrations up to 100 ng/ml. However, in the presence of 50 μm zVAD.fmk, the addition of as little as 0.1 ng/ml TNFα resulted in the death of 68 ± 5% of cells within 24 h. Testing of a panel of peptide caspase inhibitors showed that the broad spectrum zVAD.fmk and boc.D.fmk inhibitors were most effective at promoting TNFα cytotoxicity (Fig. 2). IETD.fmk, which has been shown to inhibit caspase-8 activity (25Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), was also effective. The inhibitor YVAD.fmk was ineffective in this assay but showed biological activity by inhibiting Jurkat cell apoptosis in response to an agonistic Fas antibody (viability after 24 h in control cells 95%, anti-Fas 19%, YVAD + anti-Fas 90%). Morphological examination showed that whereas U937 treated with cycloheximide plus TNFα showed typical features of apoptosis, zVAD + TNFα-treated cells underwent non-apoptotic death with loss of membrane integrity, prominent vacuolation, and absence of nuclear/cytoplasmic condensation (Fig. 2). In contrast to the findings in U937 and NIH3T3 cells, we found that zVAD.fmk, boc.D.fmk, and IETD.fmk were effective inhibitors of TNFα-induced apoptosis in the HeLa cell line as has been reported previously (Ref. 26Wajant H.

Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and data not shown). The FADD protein links the TNFR1 to caspase-8 by binding via its carboxyl-terminal DD to homologous sequences in the adaptor protein TRADD. FADD binds caspase-8 via its death effector domain and recruits it to the receptor complex (5Wallach D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 107-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We have utilized a mutant FADD construct lacking the death effector domain which exerts a dominant-negative effect (DN-FADD) (8Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) to investigate the effects of inhibiting FADD-mediated caspase recruitment to the TNFR1 complex in NIH3T3 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with a DN-FADD cDNA plus a GFP vector to positively identify transfected cells. Cell expression of GFP and cell viability (detected by uptake of propidium iodide) were quantified by flow cytometry. Transfection of dominant-negative FADD-sensitized NIH3T3 cells to TNFα with only 35 ± 7% of transfected cells surviving at 8 h after addition of TNFα (Fig. 3). In contrast, using the same assay technique, the transient expression of DN-FADD protected HeLa cells from both Fas and TNF-induced apoptosis as has been described previously (data not shown) (26Wajant H. Johannes F.J. Haas E. Siemienski K. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Weiss T. Grell M. Scheurich P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 113-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells treated with cycloheximide plus TNFα undergo apoptosis. After incubation with zVAD.fmk and TNFα, cells undergo a non-apoptotic form of death (Figs. 2 and 3). There is no evidence of DNA fragmentation or appearance of a hypodiploid DNA containing fraction (Fig. 3) and no early exposure of membrane phosphatidylserine as measured by annexin V staining (data not shown). The lack of features of typical apoptosis could be explained by the presence of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor preventing the full appearance of the apoptotic cell phenotype. However, cells transfected with DN-FADD and incubated with TNFα, in the absence of any peptide caspase inhibitor, also do not undergo apoptosis. There is no evidence of significant DNA fragmentation, no hypodiploid cells, and no early exposure of annexin V-binding sites (Fig. 3). In view of previous evidence implicating the production of ROS in some forms of TNFα-induced cytotoxicity (27Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) we investigated whether ROS may be involved in the form of non-apoptotic death seen here. Measurement of intracellular ROS using the fluorescent probe dihydrorhodamine-123 shows that there is normally a modest transient production of ROS in response to TNFα in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4). This returns to a basal level by 4 h. In the presence of zVAD.fmk, the response to TNFα is accentuated and prolonged and is detected in viable cells prior to the onset of death. Cells transfected with DN-FADD show a similar response when incubated with TNFα alone (Fig. 4). Production of ROS has also been shown to occur in some forms of apoptosis and may result from loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and uncoupling of the respiratory chain (28Marchetti P. Castedo M. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Hirsch T. Macho A. Haeffner A. Hirsch F. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 29Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). We investigated the temporal relationship between loss of transmembrane potential as measured by DiOC6(3) fluorescence and ROS production in NIH3T3 that had either been triggered to undergo apoptosis by cycloheximide + TNFα or treated with zVAD + TNFα. The results show that whereas in cycloheximide + TNFα-treated cells, DiOC6(3) low cells appear prior to the detectable production of ROS, the situation is reversed with zVAD + TNFα (Fig. 4). To assess whether the production of ROS plays a causal role in this form of cell death, NIH3T3 and U937 cells were preincubated with the antioxidants reduced glutathione and N-acetylcysteine prior to the addition of zVAD.fmk and TNFα. Fig. 5 shows that both of these agents could inhibit the cytotoxicity of TNFα under these conditions. Similar results were also seen with butylated hydroxyanisole (data not shown). Long-term (2 week) clonogenic assays confirmed that there was a genuine reduction in cytotoxicity (Fig. 5). Similarly, reduced glutathione protects cells expressing DN-FADD from the cytotoxic effects of TNFα (Fig. 5). These results indicate that TNFα activates a FADD/caspase-independent pathway leading to the production of ROS but that the subsequent down-regulation of ROS production is dependent on FADD/caspase activity. TNFα has been shown to activate multiple signaling pathways. The GTP-binding protein Rac is a critical component of the phagocytic cell NADPH oxidase system and has been implicated in the production of ROS in response to cytokines, growth factors, and oncogenes in many cell types (30Bokoch G.M.

Transient transfection of a dominant- negative N17Rac in NIH3T3 cells attenuated the cytotoxic response of zVAD.fmk plus TNFα (Fig. 6). Co-transfection of N17Rac with DN-FADD also inhibited the subsequent cytotoxicity seen with TNFα treatment (Fig. 6). Expression of a constitutively active V12Rac did not promote TNFα-induced cytotoxicity suggesting that although activated Rac is required for TNFα-induced death it is not sufficient on its own to give this response. In some situations, Rac may lie downstream of the Ras GTPase (22Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J.

Expression of a dominant-negative Ras in NIH3T3 cells did not affect zVAD.fmk plus TNFα-induced cytotoxicity. Expression of a dominant-negative SEK, which inhibits Jun kinase (JNK) activation in response to TNFα and which has been implicated in some forms of cell death (33Ichijo H. Nishida E.

We have shown that activation of a FADD/caspase pathway by TNFα leads to complex effects on components of the cell survival machinery. In the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide, stimulation with TNFα results in apoptotic cell death. However, most cells are resistant to the apoptotic effects of TNFα due to the dominant anti-apoptotic effect of NFkB which is activated in parallel. In U937 cells, incubation with TNFα results in a low level increase in caspase-8 activity (in the absence of cycloheximide) under conditions in which there is no detectable increase in apoptosis above background levels. This suggests that a limited increase in caspase-8 activity need not necessarily result in a full-blown activation of an execution caspase cascade and that the NFκB-dependent pathways involved in preventing TNFα-induced apoptosis can exert at least some of their effects downstream of caspase-8. Activation of the FADD/caspase pathway by TNFα not only mediates a pro-apoptotic pathway but also, by down-regulating the excessive production of ROS, exerts an anti-necrotic effect. The relative importance of this appears to vary between different cell types but it could serve in some situations to promote a controlled form of cell death. The TNFα-activated pathway leading to the production of ROS is independent of FADD/caspase and involves the Rac GTPase. The FADD/caspase pathway is involved in damping the production of ROS but the precise molecular mechanism for this has not been identified. The effect of ROS on cell proliferation and survival are known to be complex. The positive effects of certain mitogens and oncogenes on growth have been shown to involve the generation of ROS (32Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar) and TNFα-induced activation of the anti-apoptotic NFκB has been shown in some instances to be inhibited by antioxidants (35Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3416) Google Scholar). In other settings TNFα-induced cytotoxicity can be inhibited by increasing antioxidant levels, for example, by overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase (36Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 37Manna S.K. Zhang H.J. Yan T. Oberley L.W. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13245-13254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Other workers have shown that in some cell types, TNFα induces apoptosis by a mechanism involving the production of ROS that can be inhibited by peptide caspase inhibitors (38Sidoti-de Fraisse C. Rincheval V. Risler Y. Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1639-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 39Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Yeh E.T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2515-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). While this work was in progress, Vercammen and colleagues (40Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) reported that murine L929 fibrosarcoma cells, which undergo rapid necrosis due to excessive formation of ROS in response to TNFα, are greatly sensitized by preincubation with peptide caspase inhibitors or by expression of CrmA, a serpin-like caspase inhibitor of viral origin. These findings in conjunction to those reported here indicate a significant role for a caspase mediated activity in the regulation of metabolism of ROS. Caspases themselves can be modified by oxidation leading to a marked inhibition of their proteolytic activity (41Nobel C.S. Kimland M. Nicholson D.W. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, there is likely to be a complex inter-relationship between the production of ROS, caspase activity, and eventual outcome in terms of cell death or survival and the molecular mechanisms underlying this will require further characterization. FADD has been considered to be a prototypical example of a molecule with function restricted to a pro-apoptotic pathway. Recent studies have shown that although FADD is required for apoptosis induction via Fas/CD95 it also plays unexpected roles in embryonic development (42Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and in promoting T-cell survival and proliferation (43Newton K. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Smith K.G.C. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Whether the role for FADD in regulating the production of ROS described here is involved in mediating any of these effects remains to be determined. The ability of caspase inhibitors to sensitize tumor cells to TNFα may also have relevance for the treatment of malignant disease. It has been postulated that combining TNFα with molecular inhibitor(s) of the NFκB pathway may be used as an approach to overcome resistance in tumor cells (44Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, this approach is likely to be limited by toxicity to normal cells. It has been shown previously that pretreatment of mice with the peptide caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk can ameliorate the tissue damage normally seen with TNFα administration (45Kunstle G. Leist M. Uhlig S. Revesz L. Feifel R. MacKenzie A. Wendel A. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 55: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Further studies to evaluate the effects of the combination of caspase inhibitors and TNFα on normal tissues and transformed/tumor cells are in progress. Although targeting of the FADD/caspase pathway as described here would promote a non-apoptotic form of tumor cell death with potential toxicity, recent data indicate that this may promote the host anti-tumor immune response (46Melcher A. Todryk S. Hardwick N. Ford M. Jacobson M. Vile R.G. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to clarify the potential application of this approach to tumor therapy and to enable a re-evaluation of the role of TNFα in the treatment of malignant disease. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a FADD/caspase pathway can regulate the production of ROS in response to stimulation with TNFα and that this pathway serves to inhibit the process of cellular necrosis. This suggests a dual role for caspases: first as mediators of apoptosis, a highly controlled form of cell death, and second as inhibitors of necrosis, a form of cell death that is likely to be injurious to the organism.

https://openalex.org/W2072124004,"Increasing evidence has accumulated for an involvement of the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes at chromosome 10q in the carcinogenesis of brain tumours, melanomas, and carcinomas of the lung, the prostate, the pancreas, and the endometrium. The gene DMBT1 (Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumours 1) is located at chromosome 10q25.3-q26.1, within one of the putative intervals for tumour suppressor genes. DMBT1 is a member of the scavenger-receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily and displays homozygous deletions or lack of expression in glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, and in gastrointestinal and lung cancers. Based on these properties, DMBT1 has been proposed to be a candidate tumour suppressor gene. We have determined the genomic sequence of DMBT1 to allow analyses of mutations. The gene has at least 54 exons that span a genomic region of about 80 kb. We have identified a putative exon with coding potential for a transmembrane domain. Our data further suggest that alternative splicing gives rise to isoforms of DMBT1 with a differential utilization of SRCR domains and SRCR interspersed domains. The major part of the gene harbours locus specific repeats. These repeats may point to the DMBT1 locus as a region susceptible to chromosomal instability."
https://openalex.org/W2090956156,"Recent studies suggest that the SH2/SH3 adaptor Dock/Nck transduces tyrosine phosphorylation signals to the actin cytoskeleton in regulating growth cone motility. The signaling cascade linking the action of Dock/Nck to the reorganization of cytoskeleton is poorly understood. We now demonstrate that Dock interacts with the Ste20-like kinase Misshapen (Msn) in the Drosophila photoreceptor (R cell) growth cones. Loss of msn causes a failure of growth cones to stop at the target, a phenotype similar to loss of dock, whereas overexpression of msn induces pretarget growth cone termination. Physical and genetic interactions between Msn and Dock indicate a role for Msn in the Dock signaling pathway. We propose that Msn functions as a key controller of growth cone cytoskeleton in response to Dock-mediated signals."

We now provide further evidence for a functional interaction between Hsp70 and the J-domain of Hsp40 with denatured luciferase resulting in reactivation of heat-denatured luciferase within living mammalian cells. The stimulating effect of Hsp40 on the Hsp70-mediated refolding is lost when the proteins cannot interact as accomplished by their expression in different intracellular compartments. Likewise, the cooperation between Hsp40 and Hsp70 is lost by introduction of a point mutation in the conserved HPD motif of the Hsp40 J-domain or by deletion of the four C-terminal amino acids of Hsp70 (EEVD motif). Most strikingly, co-expression of a truncated protein restricted to the J-domain of Hsp40 had a dominant negative effect on Hsp70-facilitated luciferase reactivation. Taken together, these experiments indicate for the first time that the Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperones functionally interact with a heat-denatured protein within mammalian cells.

The present study is aimed at characterizing the Hsp70/Hsp40 cooperation within mammalian cells using reactivation of heat-inactivated firefly luciferase as an end point. Hsp40 shares three evolutionary conserved domains with DnaJ (reviewed in Ref. 15Cheetham M.E Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar).The N-terminal J-domain is separated from the C-terminal part by a glycine/phenylalanine-rich domain (the G/F-rich domain). The N-terminal J-domain that spans over the first 75 N-terminal amino acids is the most conserved between different species. It is also found in several proteins with no other homologies with the prokaryotic DnaJ or Hsp40. Three amino acids, HPD, at positions 32–34 in the J-domain of Hsp40, are highly conserved and essential for the interaction between J-domain-containing proteins and Hsp70 (24Qian Y.Q. Patel D.

Mutation of the histidine from this motif into glutamine (His → Glu), results into an inability of Hsp40 family members to interact and/or cooperate with Hsp70. This was shown for, e.g., the Escherichia coli DnaJ and DnaK (27Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A truncated protein restricted to the J-domain alone is defective in stimulating the Hsp70 ATPase activity (19Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 29Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol.

However, prokaryotic and eukaryotic mutants carrying only these two domains have reduced efficiencies compared with the wild type proteins. This suggests that parts of the C terminus are also involved in stimulating Hsp70 ATPase activity. Firefly luciferase is a versatile reporter enzyme commonly used as a model to investigate protein refolding in vitro and protein damage and recovery in vivo. In vitro, refolding of chemically or thermally denatured luciferase is enhanced in the presence of Hsp70 or Hsc70 and either Hsp40 (18Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, overexpression of the sole heat shock protein Hsp70 is sufficient to attenuate luciferase inactivation and to increase its reactivation (8Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, co-transfection of Hsp40 and Hsp70 results in an enhancement of the recovery of luciferase compared with recovery in the presence of Hsp70 alone (8Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As Hsp40 and Hsp70 have many functions in the cellular metabolism, one cannot exclude that indirect effects rather than direct interactions between the chaperones and the heat-denatured luciferase are involved in the in vivo renaturation. To get further insight into the cooperation between Hsp70 and Hsp40 at the molecular level in vivo, several mutants of the two chaperones were selected that are known to interfere with Hsp70/Hsp40 interaction or cooperation in vitro. The mutants were co-expressed in hamster O23 cells with luciferase, and their influence on reactivation of this reporter enzyme after heat-shock was investigated. In the current report, we provide further evidence that a functional interaction between a J-domain protein and Hsp70 is required for Hsp70 chaperone activity within living mammalian cells. The stimulating effect of Hsp40 on Hsp70-mediated refolding is lost when the proteins cannot interact as accomplished by their expression in different intracellular compartments or by expression of mutant versions of both proteins incapable of physical interaction. Most strikingly, co-expression of a truncated protein restricted to the J-domain of Hsp40 full-length Hsp70 proteins completely inhibited the reactivation process. The latter finding suggests that J-domain proteins can strongly influence the Hsp70 function in a living cell and that mutation of these proteins might have severe consequences.

The respective cDNAs were cloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5 (kindly donated by Dr. M. Stinsky, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Plasmid pCMV40 was used for the construction of Hsp40 mutants. Mutants were obtained via a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the appropriate primers and Tfl DNA polymerase (Promega). Plasmid pCMVnls40, encoding nuc-Hsp40, was constructed with the oligonucleotide 5′-TGA CGA TCT CGA GCT GGG TAA AGA CTA CTA CCA GAC GTT-3′ (Eurosequence, Groningen, The Netherlands). The sense primer destroyed the Hsp40 start codon and introduced a new XhoI site. This XhoI site was used to exchange luciferase for Hsp40 in the vector pCMVnlsLL/V, thereby fusing the Hsp40 cDNA in frame with the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal. pCMVnlsLL/V was obtained by cloning the nuclear localization sequence-luciferase HindIII-PvuI fragment from pRSVnlsLL/V into pCMVCAT (36Foecking M.K.

Plasmid pCMV40–1-75, encoding Hsp40-J, and pCMV40–1-124, encoding Hsp40-G, were constructed using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCC GCT ATC GTC GAC TTA ACT CCC CTT TAG GCC TTC-3′ and 5′-ATT GCC GCT ATC GTC GAC TTA GCC TTC CTC CCC GTT-3′ (Eurosequence), respectively. These primers were used in the antisense direction. They introduce a stop codon directly after amino acid 75 or 124 of Hsp40, respectively. A new SalI site was introduced to clone the fragment into the expression vector pCMV5. Plasmid pCMV40H32Q, encoding Hsp40-H32Q, was constructed using the oligonucleotide 5′-TCC TCG GCG CCG GGC TCC TTG TTC TTG TCC GGT TGG TAG CGC A-3′ (Life Technologies, Inc.) as an antisense primer. It introduces a point mutation C → A in the sense direction of the coding sequence of Hsp40, converting amino acid histidine (H) at position 32 into glutamine (Q). Plasmids pCMV40–1-75H32Q, encoding Hsp40-J-H32Q, and pCMV40–1-124H32Q, encoding Hsp40-G-H32Q, were constructed out of combinations of these oligonucleotides. Plasmid pCMV70 was used to construct pCMV70ΔEEVD. This plasmid encodes Hsp70 deleted from its four C-terminal amino acids, the EEVD motif. The oligonucleotide 5′-ATT GCC GCT ATC GTC GAC CTA ATC TAC CTC CTA AAT GGT GGG-3′ (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as an antisense primer to introduce a point mutation G → T in the sense direction of the coding sequence of Hsp70, mutagenizing the first glutamic acid (E) from the C-terminal EEVD sequence into a stop codon. A newSalI site was also introduced. The resulting fragment was cloned in the HindIII/SalI sites of the multiple cloning site of pCMV5. O23 hamster fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies Inc.). 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded into a 25-cm2culture dish. They were transfected after 24 h with 2 μg of either pRSVLL/V or pRSVnlsLL/V with or without (combinations of) 1 μg of pCMV40, pCMVnls40, pCMV40H32Q, pCMV40–1-75, pCMV40–1-75H32Q, pCMV40–1-124, pCMV40–1-124H32Q, pCMV70, or pCMV70ΔEEVD following the standard calcium phosphate method (37Kriegler M. Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual. Stockton Press, New York1990: 96-98Crossref Google Scholar). The plasmid quantity was kept equal to 10 μg/25-cm2 dish by the addition of plasmid pSP64 (Promega). One day after transfection, the cells were treated with trypsin and distributed equally into culture tubes (Nunc); 40 tubes (1 × 104 cells/tube) were seeded out of a 25-cm2 culture dish, and 20 mm MOPS was added to the medium to increase its buffering capacity. Heat shocks were given 2 days after transfection. For inactivation experiments, the tubes were preincubated in a water bath at 37 °C and transferred to a second water bath at 42 °C ± 0.1 °C. The transfer took less than 3 s and was taken as time 0. For recovery experiments, 30 min before heat shock 20 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to the medium to inhibit new protein synthesis. After 30 min at 44 °C (nuclear luciferase) or 45 °C (cytoplasmic luciferase), cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C. For both inactivation and recovery experiments, the activity before heat shock was taken as 100%. Immediately after heat shock, the cells were cooled to 4 °C and lysed. The lysis procedure was initiated by a brief wash with ice-cold PBS and subsequent cell lysis in buffer A (25 mmH3PO4/Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mmMgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The lysates were kept frozen at −20 °C before measurement of luciferase activity. Luciferase activities were measured in a Berthold Lumat 9501 for 10 s after the addition of substrates (1.25 mm ATP and 87 μg/ml luciferin (Sigma)) in buffer A. Luciferase insolubilization experiments were as described previously (8Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The fraction of soluble luciferase was determined via a densitometric analysis. O23 cells in a 25-cm2 dish were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid pCMV40, pCMVnls40, pCMV40H32Q, pCMV40–1-75, pCMV40–1-75H32Q, pCMV40–1-124, pCMV40–1-124H32Q, pCMV70, or pCMV70ΔEEVD or pSP64 as a control. In transient transfection assays, only 1–5% of the whole cell population is transfected. Therefore, to increase the sensitivity of the recombinant protein detection, the O23 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of plasmid pEGFP-N2, a vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). The plasmid quantity was set at 10 μg/25-cm2 dish by the addition of plasmid pSP64 (Promega). The green color enabled to sort out cells expressing the GFP that express the various (mutant) proteins. The selected cell lysates were investigated by Western blot for expression of the various proteins. The cells were trypsinized 2 days after transfection. GFP-expressing cells were sorted on a Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer. After sorting, SDS (1% (w/v)) and 2-mercaptoethanol were added to the cells, and they were sonicated and subsequently heated for 5 min at 90 °C. After electrophoresis through a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll). Wild type Hsp40 and Hsp40 mutants were detected with an anti-Hsp40 antiserum (1:5,000 dilution) (SPA-400, Stress-gen), and Hsp70 and Hsp70ΔEEVD were detected with a monoclonal antibody directed against the inducible Hsp70 (1:2,000 dilution) (SPA-810, Stress-gen). Luciferase was detected with an anti-luciferase antibody (1:1,000) (Cortex). This was followed by the binding of a 1:5,000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for Hsp40 and 1:2,000 for luciferase, and a peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 1:2,000 diluted for Hsp70. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce). One day after transfection, cells were plated on coverslips. One day after plating, the cells were processed. Immunofluorescence was performed at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, then washed sequentially (three 5-min washes) with PBS and incubated 15 min with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, then 10 min with 100 mm glycine in PBS. Afterward, the coverslips were soaked for 30 min in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS and the cells were incubated for 1 h with a 1:150 dilution of an anti-Hsp40 serum in 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS (Tween/PBS). The coverslips were washed in Tween/PBS and incubated for 1 h with a 1:200 dilution of a fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Nordic). After three washes in Tween/PBS, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Previously, we have shown that overexpression of Hsp70 is sufficient to attenuate luciferase inactivation and to increase its reactivation in mammalian cells. Co-expression of Hsp40 enhanced the Hsp70-facilitated luciferase recovery (8Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This Hsp70-facilitated luciferase reactivation, however, might have been an indirect effect as the Hsp70/Hsp40 machinery has multiple targets in cells. Preventing or repairing a damage at one place might prevent or accelerate another damage in a different place through a series of events connected in cascade. To address this, we developed a strategy that had been successful in showing the in vivo interaction between the steroid receptor and Hsp90 (38Kang K.I. Devin J. Cadepond F. Jibard N. Guiochon-Mantel A. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Luciferase can be targeted to either the cytoplasm or the nucleus without affecting its activity and thermal resistance in vitro (33Michels A.A. Nguyen V.-T. Konings A.W.T. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 39Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 108: 1657-1664Crossref Scopus (884) Google Scholar). wt-Hsp40 and Hsp70 expressed in O23 cells are localized both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm and cooperate in the reactivation of luciferase in both compartments (8Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). First, we directed Hsp40 and luciferase to the same intracellular compartment. A nuclear targeted Hsp40 (nuc-Hsp40) was engineered by fusing the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal to the N terminus of Hsp40. The resulting nuc-Hsp40 expressed in O23 cells migrated slightly slower than wt-Hsp40, consistent with a higher molecular mass attributed to the fused sequence (Fig. 1 A). Expression of either wt- or nuc-Hsp40 did not induce a general stress response, as evidenced by measurement of the level of the stress inducible Hsp110 (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence shows that the nuc-Hsp40 was exclusively present in the nucleus, whereas wt-Hsp40 was present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 1 B). Previous data (8Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showed that transiently transfected wt-Hsp70 also localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Next, recovery of luciferase activity after heat shock was investigated in O23 cells expressing Hsp70 with combinations of nuc- or cyt-luciferase and wt-Hsp40 or nuc-Hsp40. As described previously, the Hsp70-mediated reactivation of both luciferases was enhanced when a combination of the human Hsp70 and wt-Hsp40 was expressed (8Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Only the reactivation of nuc-luciferase was enhanced in the presence of a combination of Hsp70 and nuc-Hsp40 (Fig. 2, A and B). The reactivation of cyt-luciferase was only enhanced in presence of Hsp70 and wt-Hsp40. Thus, Hsp40 is most efficient in facilitating recovery of luciferase when both luciferase and Hsp40 are present in the same cellular compartment. To test further whether a direct association of Hsp40 and Hsp70 is required for the chaperoning activity on luciferase in a living cell, a Hsp40 mutant was constructed in which the conserved histidine was mutated into glutamine (H32Q mutant). In vitro data have shown that mutations in the HPD motif in the J-domain of Hsp40 proteins abolish the interaction with Hsp70 (reviewed in Ref. 40Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). This mutant Hsp40 was indeed not able to stimulate luciferase refolding in presence of Hsp70 (Fig. 4 A).Taken together these results strongly suggest that a direct functional interaction between Hsp40, Hsp70, and luciferase is involved in the Hsp70-assisted luciferase reactivation. Hsp70 can bind to denatured proteins and as such protect them from irreversible aggregation in vitro, but the literature is inconsistent on the requirements for J-domain proteins to perform this function (19Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 41Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31420-31426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Overexpression of just Hsp70 in mammalian cells retards the formation of nuclear protein aggregates (7Stege G.J.J. Li G.C. Li L. Kampinga H.H. Konings A.W.T. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1994; 10: 659-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, we found that expression of Hsp70 attenuated the heat-induced Triton X-100 insolubilization of luciferase (Table I). Co-expression of Hsp40 with Hsp70, however, did not lead to an additional increase in the Hsp70-mediated protection against protein insolubilization.Table IHeat-induced insolubilization of luciferaseTransfectionTriton T X-100 soluble luciferase (%)Control30 min at 45 °CS.E.No HSP1007.42.5Hsp70100452.2Hsp70 + Hsp40100465.0 Open table in a new tab From in vitrodata, it is known that Hsp40 enhances the ATPase activity of Hsp70 that is essential for Hsp70-facilitated protein folding (18Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 19Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The Hsp70 ATPase activity is stimulated with higher efficiency by the wild type protein than by a truncated protein restricted to the N-terminal J and G/F-rich domain of Hsp40. A truncated Hsp40 protein restricted to only the J-domain is inactive in stimulating the Hsp70 ATPase activity (19Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To evaluate the importance of Hsp70 ATPase stimulation in the in vivo refolding process, the corresponding truncated Hsp40 cDNAs were constructed; Hsp40-G contained both the J and the G/F-rich domain (124 N-terminal amino acids), and Hsp40-J was restricted to the J-domain (75 N-terminal amino acids) (Fig. 3 A). The expression of the recombinant proteins was assayed by Western blotting. The mutant Hsp40 proteins were successfully expressed in O23 cells and had the expected sizes (Fig. 3 B). Expression of abnormal proteins may trigger a stress response that would lead to the synthesis of the endogenous hamster heat shock proteins. However, this was not true as expression of the Hsp40 truncated and full-length proteins did not induce the synthesis of the strongly inducible Hsp110 (42Subjeck J.R. Sciandra J.J. Johnson R.J. Br. J. Radiol. 1982; 55: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In contrast to wt-Hsp40, co-expression of Hsp40-G did not enhance but rather inhibited the reactivation of luciferase in presence of wt-Hsp70 (Fig. 4 B). Strikingly, co-expression of Hsp40-J even completely abolished the Hsp70-facilitated recovery of heat-inactivated luciferase (Fig. 4 C). The ratio of wt-Hsp40 or Hsp40-J versusHsp70 was varied by transfecting the cells with different quantities of plasmids encoding the corresponding cDNAs. The stimulating effect of wt-Hsp40 on Hsp70 mediated recovery only became significant when the plasmids encoding the corresponding cDNAs were transfected at a ratio close to 1:1. The inhibiting effect of the J-domain already became s"
https://openalex.org/W2331676402,"p21Cip1/Waf1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (p21) is inducible by Raf and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK), but the level of regulation is unknown. We show here by conditional and transient Ras-expression models that Ras induces p21. Induction of p21 in conditionally Ras-expressing cells is posttranscriptional utilizing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Transient, high-level Ras-expression induces transcriptional activation of p21 mediated by a GC-rich region in p21 promoter -83-54 bp relative to the transcription initiation site containing binding sites for Sp1-family transcription factors. Mutation of either Sp1-binding site 2 or 4 in this region decreases the magnitude of induction of promoter activity by Ras, but only the simultaneous mutation of both sites abolishes fully the induction. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using an oligonucleotide corresponding to Sp1-binding site 2 indicate that both Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors bind to this region. The results demonstrate that the central cytosolic growth regulator Ras is a potent transcriptional and posttranscriptional inducer of the nuclear growth inhibitor p21."

The large subunit (LS)1 is encoded by a plastid gene and is translated and assembled into Rubisco holoenzyme within the stroma of the chloroplast. Mass spectral and amino acid sequence analysis of peptides prepared from Rubisco has demonstrated that the LS is processed to the mature form by removal of the N-terminal Met-1 and Ser-2 residues and acetylation of Pro-3 (1Mulligan R.M.

The polypeptide is post-translationally imported into chloroplasts and processed by a stromal processing peptidase that removes the targeting presequence. The resultant N-terminal methionine residue of the processed SS is subjected toN-methylation (5Grimm R. Grimm M. Eckerskorn C. Pohlmeyer K. Rohl T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) prior to assembly with the LS into the holoenzyme. Rubisco LSMT genes, cDNAs, and polypeptides have been characterized from pea and tobacco (6Klein R.R. Houtz R.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Ying Z.

The methylation of Lys-14 of the LS is catalyzed by AdoMet:Rubisco LS (lysine) N-methyltransferase (Rubisco LSMT, Protein Methylase III, EC 2.1.1.127) (6Klein R.R. Houtz R.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences for tobacco and pea Rubisco LSMT show significant identity and similarity, and both proteins contain several copies of an imperfect leucine-rich repeat (7Ying Z. Janney N. Houtz R.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Lys-14 methylation has been detected in many plant species (pea, tobacco, tomato, soybean, cucumber, petunia, pepper, and cowpea); however, in some species (spinach, wheat, and corn) methylation of lysine-14 does not occur (2Houtz R.L.

The observation that LS polypeptides from some species are methylated at Lys-14, whereas methylation is not detected in species such as spinach is a curious observation. Preliminary studies indicated that spinach contained LSMT-like DNA sequences. In this study we report a homologue of Rubisco LSMT from spinach that encodes an enzyme that methylates the SS of Rubisco (Rubisco SSMT). In addition, pea and tobacco Rubisco LSMT are demonstrated to catalyze α-methylation of the processed form of Rubisco SS. Thus, pea Rubisco LSMT is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes methylation of both the α-amino group of the SS and the ε-amino group of Lys-14 of the LS. This is the first reported eukaryoticα N-methyltransferase and of a bifunctional methyltransferase that methylates both α- and ε-amino groups. Spinach (Spinacea oleracea L. cv. Melody) plants were cultured in ProMixTM soil medium in a greenhouse at approximately 20 °C with a natural light photoperiod during the winter season (Lexington, Kentucky). rbcMT-S cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Total RNA was isolated from spinach leaves using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed by reverse-transcription of 5 μg of total spinach RNA with an oligo d(T)17 primer. The first-strand cDNA product was amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using degenerate oligonucleotide primers to conserved peptide sequences between pea (6Klein R.R. Houtz R.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and tobacco (7Ying Z. Janney N. Houtz R.L. Plant Mol.

The forward primer (SF-8, 5′-CGA TGG GCA TTT GGA ATT CTC AGA TCA AGG GC) included an EcoRI site and corresponded to the amino acid sequence WAFGILRSRA. The reverse primer (SR-2, 5′-GGC CAA GGC CAA GAT CTT TAA GCC TCC TTT C) included a BglII site and corresponded to peptide sequence ERRLKDLGLA. Conditions for PCR were 35 cycles of: 94 °C 1 min, 50 °C 1 min, and 72 °C 1.5 min and a final extension of 72 °C 10 min. The PCR product was digested withEcoRI and BglII, cloned into Bluescript II KS(+) vector (Stratagene), and designated pS25. RACE was performed to obtain 5′ cDNA sequences as described above except an rbcMT-S-specific primer (SR-3, 5′-ACT GTA ACC AGA AAG AGC AGA TGT ACA) primed cDNA synthesis in the mid-coding region and was followed by poly(dC) tailing as described previously (9Ying Z. King M.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The dC-tailed products were amplified using a nested primer (SR-5, 5′-G TTCTCT AGA GAA TAG ACC AGC TCC), which included aXbaI restriction site and a poly(dG/dI)-containing oligonucleotide. The PCR products were digested with SacI and XbaI, gel purified, and cloned into Bluescript II KS(+) vector for sequencing. Two different spinach cDNAs were identified: as a long form (pS40) with a 12-bp insertion and as a short form (pS38). For 3′ RACE, 5 μg of total RNA from spinach leaves was reverse-transcribed with an adapter-primer (AP-1, 5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACT (T)16). Amplification was performed by PCR as described above with oligonucleotide AP-1 and a spinach-specific primer, (SF-9, 5′-CAA TAC GAT TTG AAC AAG AGC AAT GC). The PCR product was cloned into pCR-Scrip Direct SK(+) vector (Stratagene) for sequencing and designated pS2. Two to five independent clones were chosen for sequencing from each of the above constructs. Both strands of each clone were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (10Sanger F. Nicklen S.

In addition, 18–27-mer oligonucleotides were synthesized from DNA sequence obtained and used as primers for additional sequencing. Both full-length S-38 and S-40 cDNAs (accession numbers AF071544and AF071545, respectively) were obtained by ligation of clones pS2 and pS25 into pS38 or pS40 based on restriction sites within the overlapped regions. N-terminally truncated forms of S-38 and S-40 were produced by deletion of the putative chloroplast transit peptide through PCR with primers designed to remove the first 43 amino acids and replace Cys-44 with a Met. Both full-length and N-terminally truncated forms of S-38 and S-40 were cloned into pET-23d for expression in pLysS cells. TherbcMT-S gene (accession number AF071543) was cloned by PCR. Spinach nuclear DNA was isolated using Floraclean (Bio101, Inc.). Approximately 100 ng of the nuclear DNA was amplified by PCR withTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using a forward primer (SF-1, 5′-AGA AGC TTC ACC ATG GCA ACT TTA TTC ACT CTC ATC) and a reverse primer (SR-1, 5′-AGT TTG CAT TTT GAT TGT AGT TTC CAC). The PCR product was cloned into pCR-Script SK(+) for sequencing. Clone pS40XR0.4 was transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol) to produce a radiolabeled antisense transcript. The radioactive probe (∼100,000 cpm) was precipitated with 5 μg of tRNA and 0, 2.5, 10, or 20 μg of total RNA isolated from mature spinach leaves. A heterologous RNA (10 μg of maize mitochondrial RNA) was included as a control. The RNAs were dissolved in 10 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), denatured, and allowed to hybridize at 45 °C overnight. The duplexes were digested by addition of 0.3 ml of RNase digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) with 200 units of RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 250 ng RNase A (Sigma). The duplexes were digested for 1 h at 30 °C, and the reaction terminated by addition of 100 μg of proteinase K and SDS to a final concentration of 0.6% and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. The protected fragments were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels with 8 m urea. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Full-length and N-terminally truncated forms of S-40 and S-38 were cloned and expressed with the pET-23d vector in pLysS host cells. Bacterial cells were cultured at 37 °C for 3.5 h in 5 ml of LB broth with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After induction with 0.5 mm IPTG, cultures were incubated for 2.5 h at 25 °C or 37 °C, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with deionized water and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and frozen at −80 °C. The activity of Rubisco LSMT was determined in the thawed cell lysates as described previously (11Wang P. Royer M. Houtz R.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 528-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rubisco SSMT activity was determined by incubation of pLysS cell lysates, or purified S-38 and S-40, with lysates from spinach chloroplasts (12Mills W.R. Joy K.W. Planta. 1980; 148: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 2.5–5 μCi of [3H-methyl]AdoMet (70–80 Ci/mmol), 10–20 μg of chloroplast lysate protein, and either 10 μg of protein from pLysS cell lysates or 1 μg of purified S-38 or S-40 protein. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample preparation buffer, and samples were electrophoresed on 15% acrylamide gels. After transfer of proteins to a PVDF membrane, radioactivity was visualized using a 3H PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics model 425, Sunnyvale, CA), and polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Alternatively, the PVDF-blotted proteins were subjected to Immunoblot analysis using antibodies prepared against pea Rubisco LSMT or S-38 protein. Full-length and N-truncated forms of S-38 and S-40 were purified from pLysS cell lysates. pLysS cells were cultured at 37 °C, and inclusion bodies were harvested after cell lysis and washed twice with buffer A before dissolving in 6 m urea. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 12,000 × g), and the remaining supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A for 4 h. The dialysate contained 1–2 mg/ml purified protein and was used directly in activity assays and to elicit antibodies (Charles River PharmServices, Southbridge, MA). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed to highly conserved sequences of pea and tobacco Rubisco LSMT and were used to amplify a 786-bp cDNA fragment from total spinach leaf RNA. DNA sequence analysis of the 786-bp fragment indicated that the spinach cDNA had extensive sequence identity with pea and tobacco LSMT. A complete cDNA sequence of the spinach cDNA was obtained by 5′ and 3′ RACE of spinach leaf RNA (13Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 28-38Google Scholar). Amplification of 5′ and 3′ coding sequences was performed by RACE. PCR amplification resulted in the identification of two 5′ products (836- and 848-bp fragments). The 848-bp product had a 12-bp insertion relative to the 836-bp fragment. The 5′ RACE products and the initial PCR product amplified with LSMT-specific primers had complete sequence identity in the regions that overlapped, except for the 12-bp insertion. Amplification of 3′ coding sequence was performed by RACE, and a single 761-bp PCR product was obtained. Complete cDNA sequences have been assembled from these overlapping clones of therbcMT-S and have been submitted to GenBankTM as accession numbers AF071544 and AF071545. The spinach rbcMT-S cDNAs encode polypeptides of 495 (S-40) and 491 amino acids (S-38) with predicted molecular masses of approximately 55 kDa, similar to the masses of pea (55.0 kDa) and tobacco (56.0 kDa) Rubisco LSMT (Fig. 1). In addition, the deduced amino acid sequence of the spinach cDNAs included five imperfect copies of a leucine-rich repeat (14Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), similar to pea and tobacco LSMT (7Ying Z. Janney N. Houtz R.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence from the spinach rbcMT-S cDNAs shows 60 and 62% identity with the amino acid sequences of pea and tobacco Rubisco LSMT, respectively (Fig. 1). A 3.1-kilobase genomic clone that included the entire coding region of the spinachrbcMT-S gene was obtained and sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AF071543). The spinachrbcMT-S gene included six exons and five introns and has similar genomic organization with the tobacco Rubisco LSMT gene (rbcMT-T). DNA gel blot analysis indicated that therbcMT-S is a single copy gene in spinach (data not shown). The 12-bp insertion in the rbcMT-S S-40 cDNA corresponds to the 3′ 12 nucleotides of intron III (Fig. 2). RNase protection studies were performed to analyze the relative expression of the S-38 and S-40 mRNA in spinach leaves. A 390-nucleotide subclone of the S-40 cDNA was prepared that spanned exons 3 and 4 (Fig. 3A). The S-40 mRNA (long form) would protect the entire 390-nucleotide region, whereas S-38 mRNA (short form) would protect 306- and 72-nucleotide fragments. A 460-nucleotide antisense probe was produced by transcription with T3 RNA polymerase (Fig. 3 B, lane 1) and hybridized to total spinach leaf RNA. Digestion with RNase A and T1 revealed that the S-40-specific fragment (390 nucleotides) and the S-38-specific fragments (306 and 72 nucleotides) were present in approximately equal abundance (lanes 3–5). Control reactions included omission of spinach leaf RNA (lane 2) or substitution of heterologous RNA (maize mitochondrial RNA; lane 6), and these reactions failed to protect any fragments. Both S-40 and S-38 mRNAs were not detectable in total RNA from spinach roots, stems, or flowers (data not shown). Thus, alternative 3′ splice site selection produces two transcripts for the rbcMT-S gene that are expressed at similar abundance in spinach leaves.FIG. 3Two forms of rbcMT-SmRNAs are produced as a result of alternative splice site selection. A, pS40XR0.4 was produced by cloning the 390 nucleotide EcoRI/XbaI fragment of the S-40 cDNA into pBluescript SK+. The clone spans exon III, the alternatively spliced region, and exon IV. A 460-nucleotide antisense probe was produced by transcription from the T3 promoter to theXhoI site. The long form of the mRNA protects a 390-nucleotide fragment of the probe, and the short form of the mRNA protects a 306- fragment and a 72-nucleotide fragment.B, RNase protection was performed to demonstrate the relative abundance of the long and short forms of rbcMT-S. The 460-nucleotide antisense probe (lane 1) was annealed to 0, 2.5, 10, or 20 μg of total RNA from mature spinach leaves (lanes 2–5, respectively) and digested with RNase A and RNase T1. The intensities of the 390- and 306-nucleotide fragments are similar, indicating that the long and short forms are approximately equivalent in abundance. Omission of spinach RNA (lane 2) or the substitution of a heterologous RNA (maize mitochondrial RNA;lane 6) resulted in complete sensitivity of the probe to RNase. The migration of a radiolabeled DNA size ladder (250-bp ladder, Life Technologies, Inc.) is shown on the right margin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Examination of the N-terminal sequence of S-38 and S-40 using ChloroP version 1.0 (15Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar) identified a putative chloroplast processing site from Ser-41 to Cys-44 (Ser-Ile-Arg↓Cys), with exact identity to the chloroplast processing site for spinach nitrate reductase (16Back E. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Privalle L. Rothstein S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 212: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The putative chloroplast targeting presequence was removed, and the N-terminally truncated forms of spinach S-38 and S-40 were cloned in the pET23d expression vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. Induction with IPTG resulted in the synthesis of large amounts of protein in inclusion bodies. The recombinant protein was collected from lysed bacterial cells and purified. Catalytic activity was obtained after denaturation in 6 m urea and renaturation by exhaustive dialysis. Antibodies to pea Rubisco LSMT were not immunoreactive with any polypeptides from spinach leaf extracts or bacterially expressed forms of S-38 and S-40. Therefore, polyclonal antibodies were prepared against the purified N-terminally truncated S-38 and used to detect spinach SSMT polypeptides. The SSMT antibody recognized a single polypeptide from spinach chloroplast lysates at a molecular mass expected for the processed form of S-38 (∼50.6 kDa; Fig. 4). It was not possible to distinguish between S-38 and S-40 protein forms on SDS-PAGE because the expected molecular mass shift is only 560 daltons. Duplicate protein blots were probed with antibody raised against Rubisco, which demonstrates that the single immunoreactive band observed with S-38 antibodies is not due to cross-reactivity to the LS of Rubisco (Fig. 4). The presence of chloroplast-localized translation products for S-38 and S-40 with homology to both pea and tobacco Rubisco LSMT suggested that these proteins may have a different but related type of methyltransferase activity. Pea Rubisco LSMT catalyzes incorporation of tritiated methyl groups from [3H-methyl]AdoMet into Rubisco holoenzyme isolated from unmethylated species such as spinach (11Wang P. Royer M. Houtz R.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 528-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Truncated S-38 and S-40 proteins exhibited no methyltransferase activity toward purified spinach Rubisco or toward purified Rubisco from other plant species. A recent report of α-methylation of the N terminus of the processed form of the SS of Rubisco (5Grimm R. Grimm M. Eckerskorn C. Pohlmeyer K. Rohl T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) lead us to examine the possibility that the S-38 and S-40 cDNAs coded for anα N-methyltransferase for the SS of spinach Rubisco. N-terminally truncated S-38 and S-40 recombinant proteins were assayed for methyltransferase activity with spinach chloroplast lysates as a proteinaceous substrate (Fig. 5). Tritium radiolabel incorporation from [3H-methyl]AdoMet into spinach chloroplast polypeptides was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretic transfer to PVDF membranes, and PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 5A). Incorporation of radiolabel was detected into a region corresponding to the SS of Rubisco (Fig. 5A) that was dependent on the addition of the chloroplast lysate. A small amount of label incorporation was observed in the region of the SS in the absence of IPTG but was dramatically increased with the addition of IPTG and is a consequence of leaky expression of the pET-23d construct. No radiolabel was observed in pLysS cell lysates or chloroplast lysates alone. Both S-38 and S-40 were capable of catalyzing methylation of the SS (Fig. 5A). Highly purified S-38 was obtained from inclusion bodies and refolded as a soluble protein and was shown to exclusively catalyze transfer of radiolabel into the region corresponding to the SS of Rubisco (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained with purified S-40 (data not shown). These results suggest that a small pool of free SSs exists in the stromal fraction from spinach chloroplasts that function as a substrate for methylation. A pool of free SSs has been previously demonstrated in chloroplasts from Chlamydomonas (17Schmidt G.W. Miskind M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and peas (18Hubbs A. Roy H. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 272-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Unequivocal demonstration that purified recombinant S-38 catalyzed SS methylation at the N-terminal Met of processed SS was documented by Edman degradation of the SS with simultaneous determination of radioactivity. During the first cycle of Edman degradative sequencing, 92% of the radiolabel incorporated into the small subunit region of the PVDF blot was released (Fig. 6). The amino acid residue in this cycle did not correspond to any of the standard amino acids but migrated as a unknown with a retention time just slightly greater than N-diphenylurea, similar to that reported for methylated Met in other work (5Grimm R. Grimm M. Eckerskorn C. Pohlmeyer K. Rohl T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The next 11 amino acid residues corresponded exactly to the known N-terminal residues of the SS of spinach Rubisco (19Martin W. Mustafa A.-Z. Henze K. Schnarrenberger C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given that a thorough chemical and physical structural analysis of the N-terminal residue of the SS of spinach Rubisco has already identified this residue asN-methyl-methionine, these results demonstrate that the S-38 and S-40 cDNAs for the rbcMT-S gene encode enzymes that can methylate the N-terminal Met residue of the small subunit of Rubisco. We propose that these enzymes be referred to as Rubisco small subunit α N-methyltransferase or Rubisco SSMT. The high degree of sequence identity between spinach SSMT and pea and tobacco Rubisco LSMT as well as the evidence for SS methylation in these species (Ref. 5Grimm R. Grimm M. Eckerskorn C. Pohlmeyer K. Rohl T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and this work) suggest that the previously characterized pea and tobacco Rubisco LSMT may also possess SSMT activity. Purified pea chloroplast Rubisco LSMT and pea and tobacco recombinant LSMT bacteria were tested forN-methyltransferase activity toward the SS of spinach Rubisco. Pea LSMT efficiently methylated both SS and LS of Rubisco from spinach chloroplast lysates when assayed with high specific activity [3H-methyl]AdoMet (Fig. 7). Control reactions included cell lysates from noninduced (without IPTG) conditions and spinach chloroplast lysates alone and did not show radiolabel incorporation into the SS of spinach Rubisco. Earlier methylation experiments (3Houtz R.L. Royer M. Salvucci M.E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were performed with purified Rubisco; however, assembled Rubisco is apparently a poor substrate for α-methyltransferase reactions. Tobacco Rubisco LSMT had not been previously demonstrated to catalyze LS methylation and in these assays only catalyzed radiolabel incorporation into the SS of spinach Rubisco. Thus, the pea, spinach, and tobacco enzymes catalyze α-amino group methylation of the SS, whereas the pea enzyme is bifunctional and also methylates Lys-14 in the LS. Rubisco is subjected to several forms of post-translational modifications, and these reactions include removal of two N-terminal amino acid residues and acetylation of Pro-3 of the LS (1Mulligan R.M. Houtz R.L. Tolbert N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1513-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Houtz R.L. Stults J.T. Mulligan R.M. Tolbert N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1989; 86: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); proteolytic cleavage of the SS by the stromal processing protease (20VanderVere P.S. Bennett T.M. Oblong J.E. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); and α-methylation of the Met-1 of the processed form of the SS (5Grimm R. Grimm M. Eckerskorn C. Pohlmeyer K. Rohl T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This paper demonstrates that the α-methylation reaction of the SS is catalyzed by enzymes in spinach and tobacco that are closely related to the previously characterized LS methyltransferase from pea. In addition, the pea enzyme has been shown to be bifunctional and possesses the capacity to methylate both the α- amino group of Met-1 of the SS and the ε-amino group of Lys-14 of the LS. The rbcMT-S gene is present as a single copy in the spinach genome, and two splice forms of the mRNA are detected by PCR and by RNase protection. The two forms apparently result from alternative 3′ splice site selection since: 1) DNA gel blot analysis indicated that the cDNA probe sequence is a single copy in the spinach genome; 2) sequence analysis of S-40 and S-38 cDNA clones revealed identical DNA sequence; and 3) RNase protection analysis detected both splice variants in similar abundance. S-40 transcripts include a 12-bp insertion that would result in an in-frame insertion of WVQQ into the polypeptide. The functions of the two forms of the spinach SSMT are currently unknown. Both long and short forms efficiently catalyzed SS methylation, but the previously characterized pea and tobacco methyltransferases lack the WVQQ insertion. It is possible that these proteins have different specificities and participate differently in various methylation reactions. Both 3′ splice sites of the spinach SSMT gene are typical 3′ splice sites. The downstream (S-40) splice site has a typical 3′ splice boundary (CAG*GC) and compares well with the dicot consensus (YAG*GU) (21Brown J.W. Plant J. 1996; 10: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Simpson G.G. Filipowicz W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition, an upstream polypyrimidine stretch (UAUUUAUUU) is present, although the stretch extends 23 nucleotides upstream of the splice site and is perhaps somewhat further upstream than typical in plants. Possible branch sites exist at the A residues, which are 21 and 37 nucleotides upstream of the splice site. The short form (S-38) splice boundary (AAG*UG) includes the highly conserved AG preceding the splice site, a polypyrimidine stretch that extends upstream 10 nucleotides, and a possible branch site at 24 nucleotides upstream of the splice site. A single immunoreactive polypeptide localized in the chloroplast was detected with polyclonal antibodies to S-38, but the small mass difference between the protein forms of S-38 and S-40 precludes determination of whether or not both of these proteins are presentin vivo. Recombinant S-38 and S-40 proteins have SS methyltransferase activity. It is possible that other chloroplast proteins may be substrates for either S-38 or S-40; however, these may not be detected by methylation studies utilizing chloroplast lysates, because detection under these conditions depends on hypo-methylation of these polypeptides. In the case of the SS of Rubisco, proteolytic processing by the stromal processing peptidase is a prerequisite for methylation of the N-terminal Met residue. The presence of unassembled SS and the requirement for proteolytic processing may be responsible for a small but easily detectable pool of methylatable SS in spinach chloroplast lysates. Methylation of the SS of Rubisco is apparently widespread becauseN-methyl-Met was detected as the N-terminal residue in the SS of Rubisco from pea, corn, and barley (5Grimm R. Grimm M. Eckerskorn C. Pohlmeyer K. Rohl T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have also detectedN-methyl-Met as the N-terminal residue in the SS of tobacco Rubisco (data not shown). In addition, an enzymatic assay demonstrated that chloroplast lysates catalyzed methylation of bacterially expressed SS using AdoMet as a methyl donor (5Grimm R. Grimm M. Eckerskorn C. Pohlmeyer K. Rohl T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The expression of a spinach homologue to Rubisco LSMT from pea and tobacco was initially anomalous, given that Lys-14 in the LS of spinach Rubisco is not methylated. Structural analyses of the methylation status of Lys-14 in the LS of spinach Rubisco have unequivocally established this residue as unmodified (1Mulligan R.M. Houtz R.L. Tolbert N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1513-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Houtz R.L. Poneleit L. Jones S.M. Royer M. Stults J.T. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1170-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and spinach Rubisco is an excellent in vitro substrate for pea Rubisco LSMT (3Houtz R.L. Royer M. Salvucci M.E. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,11Wang P. Royer M. Houtz R.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 528-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additional studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that the absence of methylation at Lys-14 in the LS of spinach Rubisco is consistent throughout the development of spinach plants and is not influenced by several environmental stresses. 2Z. Ying, R. M. Mulligan, N. Janney, and R. L. Houtz, unpublished data. In additional, the gene and coding sequences reported for spinach, pea, and tobacco Rubisco methyltransferases do not contain substantial sequence identity with any reported nucleotide or amino acid sequences, including those of other protein, DNA, or small metabolite methyltransferases. Thus, methylation of Rubisco SS in spinach is catalyzed by a homologue of a bifunctional methyltransferase in pea that methylates both LS and SS. The bifunctionality of pea Rubisco LSMT is the first report of both anα N- and an ε N-protein methylation activity in a single enzyme, and in addition this is the first report of a eukaryotic gene for aα N-methyltransferase. Methylation of E. coli ribosomal L11 protein involves bothα N- andε N-methylation (23Vanet A. Plumbridge J.A. Guérin M.-F. Alix J.-H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 947-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutations in theprmA gene encoding the ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase result in an under-methylated form of the L11 protein, which may be an indication of a similar prokaryotic bi-functional protein methyltransferase, although this has not been directly demonstrated. N-terminal methylation has been described for various amino acid residues in several proteins for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (24Stock A. Clarke S. Clarke C. Stock J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The functional significance of this post-translational modification is obscure and has been speculated to be involved in processes as diverse as protection against proteolytic degradation (25Stock A. Stock J. Zappia V. Galletti P. Porta R. Advances in Post-translational Modifications of Proteins and Aging. Plenum Press, New York1988: 201-212Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Keeling P.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2404-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Protection against proteolytic degradation is a possible function because the stroma of pea chloroplasts contains at least three aminopeptidases, one of which has specificity for Met residues (29Liu Z.-Q. Jagendorf A.T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 603-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing analogy is provided by functional comparison with the well described bacterial system of pilin processing, which involves a prokaryotic α N-methyltransferase. In bacteria, membrane associated pili are involved in processes such as conjugative transfer of DNA, adherence to host tissues, and extracellular protein secretion (30Strom M.S. Lory S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 565-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 31Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The type-IV pilins are synthesized as precursors with an N-terminal leader peptide and are processed by an endopeptidase. A second post-translational modification occurs by methylation of the newly formed N-terminal amino acid residue (33Lory S. Strom M.S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the leader peptidase responsible for prepilin (PilD) processing is a bifunctional enzyme that also catalyzes N-methylation of the N-terminal Phe of pilins (28Strom M.S. Nunn D.N. Lory S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2404-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These observations are interesting because recent studies (34Kohler R.H. Cao J. Zipfel W.R. Webb W.W. Hanson M.R. Science. 1997; 276: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) as well as earlier reports (35Wildman S.G. Hongladarom T. Honda S.I.

Interestingly, the proline content of this protein is high and concentrated in its N- and C-terminal regions. One putative SH3-binding motif and six 14–3-3 ζ-binding motifs were found in the amino acid sequence. This enzyme hydrolyzed phosphate at the D-5 position of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, consistent with the substrate specificity of type II 5-phosphatase, OCRL, synaptojanin and synaptojanin 2, already characterized 5-phosphatases. When the Myc-epitope-tagged enzyme was expressed in COS-7 cells and stained with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody, a signal was observed at ruffling membranes and in the cytoplasm. We prepared several deletion mutants and demonstrated that the 123 N-terminal amino acids (311–433) and a C-terminal proline-rich region containing 277 amino acids (725–1001) were essential for its localization to ruffling membranes. This enzyme might regulate the level of inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates at membrane ruffles.

Therefore, intracellular levels of these second messenger molecules are thought to be tightly controlled and promptly changed by the enzymes in response to extracellular stimuli. Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase is the enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes phosphate at the D-5 position of inositol or phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates and has been conserved from yeast to human.

All 5-phosphatases possess two highly conserved catalytic motifs and are classified into three groups based on their substrate specificity. 1) Type I 5-phosphatase; this enzyme hydrolyzes only water-soluble substrates such as Ins(1,4,5)P31 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (3Verjans B.

OCRL was identified as a causative gene of Low's oculocerebrorenal syndrome, an X chromosome-linked developmental disorder (2Attree O. Olivos I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). OCRL showed a strong preference for lipid substrate (16Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The cells derived from the Low's oculocerebrorenal syndrome patient were defective in OCRL activity and accumulated 2–3-fold more PtdIns(4,5)P2 than normal cells (20Zhang X. Hartz P.A. Philip E. Racusen L.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1574-1582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). There is evidence that phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates such as PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 play important roles in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (22Sakisaka T. Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 binds to actin-binding proteins such as vinculin, α-actinin, profilin, and gelsolin, and promotes actin filament formation (25Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol.

Of the seven distinct 5-phosphatases, only synaptojanin has been demonstrated to hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P2 bound to actin regulatory proteins such as vinculin, α -actinin, and profilin in vitro (22Sakisaka T. Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 modulate the function of various proteins such as protein kinase C (28Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that lipid phosphatase, like OCRL and synaptojanin, hydrolyzes those phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates and plays an important role in the actin depolymerization mechanism as well as other functions. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel 5-phosphatase. This enzyme dephosphorylates the D-5 position of inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates at ruffling membranes. A partial human cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number H14886) was obtained from Genome System, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). H14886 is a 468-base pair human cDNA fragment, and its deduced amino acid sequence contains a 5-phosphatase catalytic motif2-like sequence. The fragments were labeled by random hexamer priming and used to screen a λZAPII rat brain cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript SK(−) by an in vivo excision method and sequenced. Complete sequence data was obtained from both strands using a conventional dideoxy-termination method. Membranes containing mRNA (2 μg of poly(A) RNA was contained in each lane) were purchased from OriGene Technology, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using MagExtractor-RNA- and MagExtractor System (TOYOBO Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and approximately 10 μg of the RNA was blotted on a nylon membrane. The sequence of rat novel 5-phosphatase specific region, nucleotides 2362–3000, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and used as an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 0.7-kb cDNA probe. Hybridization was performed following the protocol of OriGene Technology, Inc., and the probe was hybridized at 42 °C. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 60 μg/ml kanamycin, and kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Rat novel 5-phosphatase cDNA, its deletion mutants and partial human SHIP 1 cDNA (nucleotides 1461–4079 of human SHIP 1 cDNA; GenBankTM accession number U57650) were subcloned into the eukaryotic pCMV6-Myc expression vector. Constitutively active Rac1, Rac1G12V construct, was ligated into the eukaryotic pEF-BOS-FLAG expression vector. All constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells by a conventional electroporation method, and cells were harvested or fixed after 48 h (22Sakisaka T. Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The expression and the size of expressed proteins were checked by immunoblotting. Recombinant novel 5-phosphatase expressing cells (1 × 106 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish (Falcon)) were washed once with PBS(−) and harvested with 200 μl of the reaction buffer for alkaline phosphatase (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After a brief sonication, the cell lysate was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Then 100 μl of the lysate with or without 30 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Biomedical Group, Shiga, Japan) was further incubated for 15 min at the same temperature. The mixture was analyzed by immunoblotting. Cells (7 × 106 cells/150-mm tissue culture dish (Falcon)) transfected with Myc-epitope-tagged novel 5-phosphatase construct or empty vector were cultured for 2 days and harvested with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and rotated with 25 μl of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then protein A beads (Pierce) (50 μl) were added, and the solution was rotated for 1 h. After that, the beads were washed with lysis buffer five times and finally suspended in buffer for inositol polyphosphates or PtdIns(4,5)P2phosphatase assay. Assay of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase activity was carried out as described by Connolly et al. (36Connolly T.M. Bross T.E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7868-7874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3, [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, and [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The separation of inositol polyphosphates by high performance liquid chromatography was done according to the method of Zhang and Buxton (37Zhang L. Buxton I.L.O. Bird I.M. Phospholipid Signaling Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 47-63Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min, and each fraction was collected for 30 s. Collected samples were diluted to 1/20 volume with distilled water and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. For the assay of Ins(1,3,4)P3 hydrolyzing activity, the D-5 position phosphate of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was hydrolyzed by recombinant SHIP 1 protein and used as a substrate. The SHIP 1 protein was prepared the same way as the novel 5-phosphatase. The PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase activity was determined (38Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spots on the thin layer chromatography plate were visualized by exposing the plate to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Scientific Co., Rochester, NY) for 6 days at −80 °C. Before the exposure, the intensity of the radioactivity was enhanced by EN3HANCE spray (NEN Life Science Products). Transfected cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in PBS(−) for 10 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS(−). Then they were incubated for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS(−) at room temperature and washed with PBS(−) five times. The cells were further incubated with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h. After five washes with PBS(−), the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) and rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) for 30 min. When active Rac was co-transfected, anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Scientific Co.) and anti-Myc polyclonal antibody were used as primary antibodies and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) was substituted with rhodamine-phalloidin. The cells were mounted in glycerin-PBS(−) and observed with a fluorescence microscope. The predicted amino acid sequence of human EST clone H14886 is very similar to OCRL and synaptojanin, and contains the 5-phosphatase catalytic motif2-like sequence (2Attree O. Olivos I.M. Okabe I.

Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Therefore, we regarded H14886 as a partial cDNA fragment of a novel 5-phosphatase. Using H14886 as a probe, we obtained several cDNA clones from a rat brain cDNA library and isolated a 3,322-base pair rat putative 5-phosphatase cDNA (Fig. 1). Our rat cDNA clone contained the polyadenylation signal AATTAAA (nucleotides 3304–3310) (Fig. 1). The same polyadenylation signal and poly(A) sequence are found in another 1496-base pair human EST clone, U45975. There was no in-frame upstream stop codon in our cDNA clone. However, we concluded that the ATG underlined in Fig. 1 is the initiation codon for rat putative 5-phosphatase mRNA because 1) the sequence around the first putative ATG codon agrees with Kozak's consensus rule (GCAGACATGG versus GCC(G/A)CCATGG) (39Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar), and 2) Northern blot analysis indicated that the rat putative 5-phosphatase mRNA is 3.4-kb long, which is nearly identical to the length of our cDNA clone (Fig. 4). Searches of the current GenBankTM data base with BLASTN algorithm revealed that part of synaptojanin and synaptojanin 2 are homologous to the 1900–2040-base pair region of the rat putative 5-phosphatase cDNA sequence (60 and 69%, respectively), which includes the 5-phosphatase catalytic motif2.FIG. 4Northern blot analysis of PIPP. Rat PIPP-specific 0.7-kb cDNA probe detected an approximately 3.4-kb band.

Usually, the average proline content of proteins in eukaryotes is 4–5% (40Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), but that of putative 5-phosphatase is 13.3% and concentrated in its N- and C-terminal regions (Fig. 1). The N-terminal proline-rich region contains 21.0% and the C-terminal region 18.4% proline. In contrast, type I 5-phosphatase contains 3.9% proline, SHIP 1, 8.0%; SHIP 2, 9.3%; type II 5-phosphatase, 4.5%; OCRL, 6.2%; synaptojanin, 7.0%; and synaptojanin 2, 4.5%. Therefore, we designated the putative 5-phosphatase as PIPP (proline-rich inositolpolyphosphate 5-phosphatase). The N-terminal proline-rich region contained one putative SH3-binding motif, PRSPSR (Fig. 1) (41Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O.

Recently, it was reported that type I 5-phosphatase was activated when it bound to platelet protein, pleckstrin, or 14–3-3 ζ (43Auethavekiat V. Abrams C.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15363-15370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Campbell et al. (44Campbell J.K. Gurung R. Romero S. Speed C.J. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Mitchell C.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15363-15370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showed that type I 5-phosphatase bound to the 14–3-3 ζ via its RSXSXP motif (RSESEE). We found six such motifs in the N- and C-terminal proline-rich regions of PIPP (Fig. 1). PIPP contains the largest number of 14–3-3 ζ-binding motifs of the known 5-phosphatases. Therefore, the enzymatic activity of PIPP may be elevated by binding to 14–3-3 ζ. Fig. 2 shows the catalytic motifs of PIPP that are conserved in other 5-phosphatases. Within the two motifs, the amino acids shown to be essential for 5-phosphatase activity are indicated by asterisks (45Communi D. Lecocq R. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11676-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 46Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and are present in PIPP. When recombinant PIPP protein was expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed by immunoblotting, two bands were detected (Fig. 3). Treatment of cell lysate with alkaline phosphatase reduced the upper band indicating that a part of the ectopically expressed PIPP is phosphorylated. The molecular mass of PIPP was estimated at about 107 kDa from its amino acid sequence but the dephosphorylated PIPP still seemed slightly larger in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). This may be due to the proline-rich sequence of PIPP (40Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that recombinant PIPP is highly phosphorylated in the cytoplasm. But Western blot analysis revealed that anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) did not stain phosphorylated PIPP (data not shown). Therefore, PIPP is probably phosphorylated at serine/threonine residues, which might regulate the activity. The results of Northern blot analysis are shown in Fig. 4. PIPP was expressed in brain, heart, kidney, stomach, small intestine, and lung. The size of the mRNA was estimated at 3.4 kb in those tissues. In spleen, thymus, skeletal muscle, testis, and skin, no signal was observed. All cultured cells examined expressed PIPP, but Jurkat and HL-60 cells showed an especially high PIPP mRNA content. Only liver showed the 2.4-kb band. This signal might indicate the existence of a splicing isoform of the PIPP or another undiscovered 5-phosphatase in liver. Myc-epitope-tagged PIPP was expressed in COS-7 cells and purified by immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. When Ins(1,4,5)P3 was incubated with recombinant PIPP and the mixture was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, two peaks were observed (Fig. 5 A). The retention time of these two peaks indicated that the former was inositol bisphosphate and the latter was substrate, Ins(1,4,5)P3 (37Zhang L. Buxton I.L.O. Bird I.M. Phospholipid Signaling Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 47-63Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). PIPP hydrolyzed Ins(1,4,5)P3 to inositol bisphosphate and also removed one phosphate from Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and produced inositol trisphosphate (Fig. 5 B). To determine which phosphate was hydrolyzed by PIPP, Ins(1,3,4)P3 was incubated with PIPP, but no hydrolysis was observed in this case (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that PIPP specifically hydrolyzes phosphate at the D-5 position in Ins(1,4,5)P3and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The catalytic motifs of PIPP are very similar to OCRL and synaptojanin. These 5-phosphatases hydrolyze inositol polyphosphates as well as PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (16Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We also checked the lipid phosphatase activity of PIPP. As shown in Fig. 6, when [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 was incubated with PIPP, [3H]phosphatidylinositol monophosphate was formed. When the phosphate at the D-5 position of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was labeled with 32P and incubated with PIPP, [32P]phosphatidylinositol monophosphate was not formed (data not shown), showing that PIPP has lipid phosphatase activity and can hydrolyze phosphate at the D-5 position of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Thus, according to the substrate specificity, PIPP is classified with type II 5-phosphatase, OCRL, synaptojanin, and synaptojanin 2 (21Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Myc-epitope-tagged PIPP was expressed in COS-7 cells, and its cellular localization was revealed by anti-Myc polyclonal antibody. As indicated in Fig. 7 A, some PIPP was clearly condensed at the cell periphery and some dispersed in the cytoplasm. The same cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 7 B). Some PIPP was localized in cortical areas with the actin filaments locating at ruffling membranes. However, alterations in the actin cytoskeleton were not observed, in contrast to reports on overexpression of OCRL and synaptojanin in cells (22Sakisaka T. Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 47Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Asano T. Oka Y. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7578-7581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We prepared several deletion mutants of PIPP to determine the region essential for its localization to ruffling membranes and co-expressed it with constitutively active Rac1 mutant in COS-7 cells (Fig. 8, panel I). Constitutively active Rac1 mutant co-localizes with actin filaments at ruffling membranes and accelerates membrane ruffling (48Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3040) Google Scholar, 49Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). Apparently, PIPP co-localized with the active Rac1 mutant (Fig. 8,panel II, A and B) confirming that PIPP localizes at ruffling membranes. Mut2 and Mut3 exhibited the same localization pattern as the full-length of PIPP (data not shown). Truncated PIPP without the N-terminal proline-rich region (Mut4) located to membrane ruffles at a much lower intensity than wild type or mutants with partial proline-rich regions (Mut2 and Mut3, Fig. 8,panel II, C and D). When the C-terminal proline-rich region containing 277 amino acids (725–1001) was deleted (Mut6), the localization of the enzyme to the ruffling membranes was abolished (Fig. 8, panel II, E and F). Mut5 did not contain either the N- or C-terminal proline-rich regions and did not localize to ruffling membranes (Fig. 8, panel II,G and H). These results indicate that the C-terminal proline-rich region from residues 725 to 1001 is essential for the localization of PIPP to ruffling membranes and a part of the N-terminal proline-rich region from residues 311 to 433 contributes to the localization. PIPP contains one putative SH3-binding motif and five 14–3-3 ζ-binding motifs in the proline-rich regions that are involved in its cellular distribution. The identification of PIPP-binding proteins should deepen the understanding of the function of PIPP. Mut1 did not contain the two catalytic motifs of 5-phosphatase localized to ruffling membranes (Fig. 8, panel II,I and J). Membrane ruffling, induced by constitutively active Rac1 mutant, was not affected by the co-expression of any deletion mutants of PIPP (Fig. 8, panel II, B, D, F, H, and J). These results indicate that PIPP does not participate in the re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton but may be involved in modulation of the function of inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate-binding proteins that are present at membrane ruffles. In summary, we have cloned a novel 5-phosphatase from a rat brain cDNA library. It is a proline-rich protein and hydrolyzed the D-5 position of phosphate in Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and PtdIns(4,5)P2. Therefore, we designated this novel 5-phosphatase as PIPP. PIPP is localized at membrane ruffles and may be involved in the modulation of the function of proteins that are present at membrane ruffles. Novel inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase localizes at membrane ruffles.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 275Issue 27PreviewThe GenBank™ accession number for PIPP is AB032551 .

https://openalex.org/W2018982129,"The present study addressed links between progestin and heregulin (HRG) signaling pathways in mammary tumors. An experimental model of hormonal carcinogenesis, in which the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induced mammary adenocarcinomas in female Balb/c mice, was used. MPA induced an in vivo up-regulation of HRG mRNA expression in progestin-dependent (HD) tumor lines. Mammary tumor progression to a progestin-independent (HI) phenotype was accompanied by a high constitutive expression of HRG. The HRG message arose from the tumor epithelial cells. Primary cultures of malignant epithelial cells from a HD tumor line were used to investigate HRG involvement on cell proliferation. HRG induced a potent proliferative effect on these cells and potentiated MPA mitogenic effects. Blocking endogenous HRG synthesis by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODNs) to HRG mRNA inhibited MPA-induced cell growth, indicating that HRG acts as a mediator of MPA-induced growth. High levels of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 expression and low ErbB-4 levels were found in HD cells. Treatment of these cells with either MPA or HRG resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of both ErbB-2 and ErbB-3. Furthermore, both HRG and MPA proliferative effects were abolished when cells were treated with ASODNs to ErbB-2 mRNA, providing evidence for a critical role of ErbB-2 in HRG-induced growth. Finally, blocking type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) expression with ASODN resulted in the complete inhibition of HRG proliferative effect, demonstrating that a functional IGF-IR is required for HRG mitogenic activity. These results provide the first evidence of interactions between progestins and HRB/ErbB signal transduction pathways in mammary cancer and the first demonstration that IGF-IR is required for HRG proliferative effects."
https://openalex.org/W2010931642,"The predominant intracellular localization of the eukaryotic subtilisin-like endoprotease furin is the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but a small fraction is also found on the cell surface. Furin on the cell surface is internalized and delivered to the TGN. The identification of three endocytosis motifs, a tyrosine (YKGL765) motif, a leucine-isoleucine (LI760) motif, and a phenylalanine (Phe790) signal, in the furin cytoplasmic domain suggested that endocytosis of furin occurs via an AP-2/clathrin-dependent pathway. Since little is known about proteins containing multiple sorting components in their cytoplasmic domain, the combination of diverse internalization signals in the furin tail raised the question of their individual role. Here we present data showing that the furin tail interacts with the medium (μ2) subunit of the AP-2 plasma membrane-specific adaptor complex in vitro and that this interaction primarily depends on recognition of the tyrosine-based sorting signal and to less extent on the leucine-isoleucine motif. We further provide evidence that the three endocytosis signals are of different functional importance for furin internalization and retrieval to the TGN in vivo, with the tyrosine-based motif being the major determinant, followed by the phenylalanine signal, whereas the leucine-isoleucine motif is only a minor component.

Localization and movement of such proteins is largely achieved through the recognition of short sequence motifs within the cytoplasmic domains by cellular targeting proteins. One of the most studied processes involving such signal recognition is clathrin-mediated sorting of transmembrane proteins at the plasma membrane and also in the TGN (for review, see Refs. 8Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar and 9Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Clathrin-coated vesicle formation is mediated by the cytosolic adaptor protein complexes AP-2 and AP-1, at the plasma membrane and the TGN, respectively. Both adaptor complexes interact directly with tyrosine- and dileucine-based sorting signals in the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins and also with clathrin which constitutes the outer layer of the coat. AP-2 complexes consist of four subunits as follows: two ∼100-kDa large subunits (α-adaptin and β2-adaptin), a 50-kDa medium chain (μ2), and a 17-kDa small chain (ς2). AP-1 complexes consist of four similar subunits (γ-adaptin, β1-adaptin, μ1, and ς1) (for review see Ref. 10Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-based motifs conforming to the consensus sequence YXXφ (where φ represents a bulky hydrophobic residue) have been shown to interact directly with the medium chain (μ) subunits of AP-1 and AP-2 (11–13, for review, see Ref. 14Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), whereas binding of dileucine-based signals to μ-chains is still under discussion.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) reported the interaction of leucine-based signals with the β1-subunit of AP-1. On the other hand, Rodionov and Bakke (27Rodionov D.G. Bakke O. J. Biol.

Furin is a membrane-associated, subtilisin-like eukaryotic endoprotease predominantly localized to the TGN that has been shown to reach the plasma membrane and to become internalized and targeted back to the TGN. The steady state distribution of furin implies that slower exit to the plasma membrane is coupled with rapid internalization and retrieval to the TGN. Furin proteolytically cleaves a large number of proproteins COOH-terminally at the consensus sequence RXK/RR. Among these substrates are endogenous secretory proteins and viral glycoproteins in the exocytotic pathway, as well as bacterial toxins at the cell surface and in endosomes, pointing to an important biological role for this protease in the activation of proproteins in multiple cellular compartments (see Ref. 16Molloy S.S.

The cytosolic domain of furin contains a tyrosine-based (YKGL765) sorting signal, a leucine-based (LI760) motif, and a monophenylalanine (Phe790) motif, which have been shown to be essential for the internalization of this protein from the cell surface (5Schäfer W.

The involvement in different sorting processes is an important characteristic of such targeting signals. Furthermore, the furin tail contains an acidic cluster CPSDSEEDEG783 which is required for TGN localization. Both serine residues (Ser776 and Ser778) within this cluster are phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) in vivo and in vitro (5Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berghöfer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.-L.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5869-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the furin tail is assumed to regulate transport of the protease in the TGN/endosomal pathway. The cytosolic connector protein PACS-1 (phosphofurin acidic cluster-sorting protein) was identified, which directs transport of phosphorylated furin molecules from endosomes back to the TGN and also from the early endosome to the plasma membrane (23Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas S. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). On the other hand, dephosphorylation of the furin tail by protein phosphatase 2A is assumed to be important for furin transport through the endosomal compartment (22Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1399-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrating the dynamin I-dependent internalization of furin at the plasma membrane (22Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1399-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the AP-1/clathrin-dependent sorting of furin in the TGN (21Teuchert M. Schäfer W. Berghöfer S. Hoflack B. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8199-8207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that endocytosis of furin at the plasma membrane also occurs via a clathrin-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the combination of the three internalization signals raised the question of redundancy. In this study we show that the cytoplasmic tail of furin interacts with the μ2-subunit of the AP-2 complex in vitro, and we give a detailed examination of the furin tail sorting signals required for μ2 binding. By using internalization kinetics, immunofluorescence analysis, and resialylation assays, we found that the three endocytosis signals are of different functional importance for furin internalization and retrieval to the TGN. For efficient sorting of furin, the motifs have to cooperate; they cannot substitute for each other. Finally, we report that CKII phosphorylation of the furin tail enhances the interaction with the μ2-subunit and determines fast internalization and retrieval of furin molecules from the plasma membrane to the TGN. The μ2-subunit of plasma membrane adaptor AP-2 (AP50) was cloned by PCR technique from human placenta λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH). The primers were derived from the human sequence (GenBankTM accession number U36188) as follows: forward primer, 5′-GACTGATCCCCGGGCATGATTGGAGGCTTATTC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTGTGGAGGCTCGAGGCTGGGGAGGTGGGCTAG-3′. The PCR product was ligated in the multiple cloning site of pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and was sequenced by the dideoxy chain method using the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer). For generation of the different furin tail mutants the pSG5:bfur construct, described by Schäfer et al. (5Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berghöfer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.-L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), was used. Substitutions in the cytoplasmic tail were introduced by a PCR-based approach using pSG5:bfur as a cDNA template and synthetic oligonucleotides that contained the desired mutations within their sequence. Recombinants of the plasmid pSG5 containing the CD46-furin chimeras (CDF) were produced by a recombinant PCR technique (24Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar), using the cDNA of membrane cofactor protein (CD46) isoform BC1 (25Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar) cloned in the pSG5 vector and the cDNA of bovine furin, wild type or tail mutants, as template. The cDNA coding for the cytoplasmic domains of wild type furin and furin tail mutants was ligated in-frame to the COOH terminus of GST using the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21, and protein purification was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. For stable expression, NRK cells were co-transfected with pSG5 constructs and the neomycin resistance-conferring plasmid, pIG-1, at a ratio of 10:1, by electroporation in a 4-mm cuvettes with a GenePulser (Bio-Rad). Geneticin-resistant cell clones were selected by addition of 1 mg of geneticin per ml of medium (Calbiochem). The selected cell clones were screened for expression of furin or CD46-furin chimeras by immunofluorescence. NRK cells stably expressing the furin tail mutants, CDF wt or CD46, were grown on coverslips for 24 h to 50% confluency; 1 h prior to immunolabeling cycloheximide was added to the medium to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. For surface immunolabeling of CD46, cells were incubated directly at 4 °C with CD46-specific monoclonal antibody J4/48 (Dianova) diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2(PBS-Ca2+/Mg2+). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS. For co-localization of furin and TGN38, NRK cells were fixed with acetone/methanol and then incubated with a furin-specific antiserum from rabbit directed against the cytoplasmic tail (diluted 1:500 in PBS) (21Teuchert M.

The primary antibodies were detected by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG from swine (Dako) and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody from goat (Jackson Dianova), both diluted 1:100 in PBS. For co-localization of CD46-furin chimera and TGN38, after fixation with acetone/methanol cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody J4/48 (diluted 1:100 in PBS) and immunoaffinity purified antibody from guinea pig specific for TGN38 (5Schäfer W.

The primary antibodies were detected by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from rabbit (Dako) preadsorbed to guinea pig IgG-agarose and rhodamine-conjugated anti-guinea pig antibody from rabbit (Sigma) preadsorbed to mouse IgG-agarose, both diluted 1:40 in PBS. Finally, the cells were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst) and 10% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and visualized by a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with UV optics. NRK cells stably expressing the CD46-furin chimeras were grown on coverslips in 24-multiwell dishes. CD46-specific monoclonal antibody J4/48 (Dianova), diluted 1:50 in DMEM containing 5% FCS and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, was then added. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow antibody uptake and then washed and processed for immunofluorescence as described above. NRK cells stably expressing the CD46-furin chimeras were grown on tissue culture dishes (6 cm in diameter) for 24–48 h to 90% confluency. The cells were chilled on ice, washed with cold PBS-Ca2+/Mg2, and biotinylated twice for 20 min in 2 ml of PBS-Ca2+/Mg2 containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Calbiochem). Free sulfo-NHS-Biotin was blocked by washing the cells with 0.1 m glycine in PBS-Ca2+/Mg2. To remove sialic acid residues from surface chimeric proteins, cells were treated with 1 ml of PBS-Ca2+/Mg2 containing 500 milliunits ofVibrio cholerae sialidase (Dade Behring) for 1 h and then washed with PBS-Ca2+/Mg2. Prewarmed DMEM containing 2% FCS was added, and cells were returned to 37 °C for 2.5 h to allow for endocytosis and recycling to the TGN to occur. Then cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) buffer, and CDF chimeras were immunoprecipitated with CD46-specific monoclonal antibody J4/48 (diluted 1:100). Following immunoprecipitation, samples were incubated with 200 milliunits of V. cholerae sialidase for 30 min at 37 °C to control resialylation. Finally, the immunoprecipitated material was boiled in sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane by standard procedure (26Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). After incubation with streptavidin/peroxidase (diluted 1:4000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), biotinylated CDF chimeras were detected using the SuperSignal system (Pierce). For resialylation kinetics, cells were processed as described, except for using the indicated times to allow for recycling to occur. Quantitation of the luminescence signal of the sialylated and desialylated CDF bands was done by using a FUJI BAS 1000 bioimaging analyzer (Raytest). Stably expressing NRK cells were grown on tissue culture dishes and biotinylated as described above. Following biotinylation, prewarmed DMEM containing 2% FCS was added, and cells were returned to 37 °C for different times to allow endocytosis to occur. To stop internalization, cells were chilled on ice, and surface proteins that had not been internalized were incubated for 1 h with 500 milliunits of V. cholerae sialidase. After some washes with cold PBS-Ca2+/Mg2, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and CDF chimeras were immunoprecipitated. The material was separated by SDS-PAGE; proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane, and biotinylated CDF chimeras were detected by streptavidin-peroxidase. Quantitation of the luminescence signal of the sialylated and desialylated CDF bands was done by using a BioImager (Raytest). The in vitro binding assay was performed as described (21Teuchert M.

Briefly, the μ2-chain wasin vitro translated in the presence of35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the pBluescript-μ2 DNA as template and a coupled in vitrotranscription translation kit (Promega). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) loaded with 30 μg of wild type or mutated GST-furin fusion protein were incubated with or without CKII (25 units/μl) (New England Biolabs) and 2 mm ATP in 30 μl of CKII buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 30 °C. Then in vitro translated μ2 was added, followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of binding buffer (0.05% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 200 mm NaCl). After three washes, the bound material was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the radiolabeled bands were detected by fluorography. Quantitation was done by using a BioImager (Raytest). Rapid internalization involves recruitment of plasma membrane proteins to clathrin-coated pits, a process that is mediated by interaction of endocytic signals found in the cytoplasmic tail of the proteins with AP-2 clathrin-associated adaptor complexes (10Hirst J.

The medium chain (μ2) of AP-2 was identified as a recognition molecule for tyrosine-based motifs and leucine-based sorting signals (11Ohno H. Steward J. Fournier M.-C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S.

Subsets of these signals are involved in additional sorting processes such as targeting to lysosomes, to specialized endosomal compartment, to the TGN, or to the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells (28Mellman I.

For furin tail sorting signals YKGL765, LI760, and Phe790, it has been shown that they are essential for internalization of furin from the plasma membrane (5Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berghöfer S.

Schäfer W. Berghöfer S. Hoflack B. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8199-8207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both serine residues within the acidic TGN localization signal CPSDSEEDEG783 by CKII enhances recruitment of AP-1 on Golgi membranes in vivo and is important for high affinity AP-1 and μ1 binding to the furin tail in vitro (21Teuchert M. Schäfer W. Berghöfer S. Hoflack B. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8199-8207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Dittie A.S. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4859-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined first whether endocytosis of furin also occurs via a clathrin-dependent pathway. Therefore we tested interaction of the furin cytoplasmic domain with the μ2 adaptor subunit and especially the role of the four furin tail sorting signals for μ2 binding. For our binding studies the cytoplasmic tail of wild type (wt) and mutated furin was expressed as a GST fusion protein (GST-F) (see Fig. 1). Since furin is phosphorylated by CKII both in vivo andin vitro on Ser776 and Ser778, GST-F fusion proteins were incubated either with or without CKII to obtain phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated versions of the furin tail. The medium chain μ2 of the clathrin-associated protein complex AP-2 was translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Fig. 2 shows that μ2 bound to GST-Fwt but not to GST. Binding to either phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated GST was less than 2% and thus could be considered as background binding. Used as negative control, in vitro translated influenza virus NS1 did not interact with GST-Fwt (data not shown). After phosphorylation by CKII μ2 binding to GST-Fwt increased. To ensure that increased μ2 binding to the furin tail is really due to phosphorylation, we dephosphorylated CKII-treated GST-Fwt with alkaline phosphatase. After phosphatase treatment the μ2 binding was reduced again showing that stronger interaction attributes to CKII phosphorylation (data not shown). This shows that the furin cytoplasmic tail interacts with the μ2 adaptor subunit and that CKII phosphorylated furin tail is favored in this interaction. Since we showed recently that only the number of negative charges in the acidic cluster is crucial for the affinity of AP-1 binding (21Teuchert M. Schäfer W. Berghöfer S. Hoflack B. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8199-8207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we investigated here whether the μ2-subunit of the AP-2 complex behaves in a similar way. The exchange of both serine residues (Ser776 and Ser778) to aspartic acid mimics the diphosphorylated state of furin (19Jones B.G. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Thulin C.D. Fry M.D. Walsh K.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5869-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 30Dittie A.S. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4859-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As expected, such a GST-furin mutant (mutant S776D/S778D) bound μ2 as efficiently as CKII-phosphorylated GST-Fwt. Mutant S776A/S778A, where both serine residues were substituted by alanine, behaved like non-phosphorylated wt (Fig. 2). To test whether introduction of negative charges in form of aspartic acid also increases the affinity for μ2 binding when they are placed at different positions in the furin tail, the following mutants were used. Mutant D798/799, a GST-furin fusion protein in which two aspartate residues were added to the carboxyl terminus of the furin tail, interacted less efficiently with μ2 than the mutant S776D/S778D. On the other hand, the R784D/G785D mutant, in which Arg784 and Gly785 were mutated to aspartic acid, bound the μ2-subunit nearly to the same extent as mutant S776D/S778D (Fig. 2). This implies that for efficient μ2 binding it makes no difference whether negative charges are introduced by phosphorylation of Ser776 and Ser778 within the acidic sequence or by additional acidic amino acids in this region. It seems that high affinity μ2 binding also depends on the number of negative charges in or near the acidic cluster. Next we focused on the requirement of the three furin tail endocytosis signals YKGL765, LI760, and Phe790 for interaction with the μ2 adaptor subunit. Again GST-F fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic tail of wt or mutated furin (see Fig. 1) were tested in our in vitro binding assay. As shown in Fig. 3, furin tail substituted in the tyrosine motif (mutant AKGA) bound μ2 2-fold less efficiently than wild type, whereas changing LI760 to alanine and asparagine (mutant LI/AN) resulted only in a slight decrease in μ2 binding compared with wt furin. Surprisingly, mutation of phenylalanine 790 did not abolish the interaction, although Phe790 had been identified as a furin internalization signal (20Stroh A. Schäfer W. Berghöfer S. Eickmann M. Teuchert M. Bürger I. Klenk H.-D. Garten W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similar results were found with the double mutants AKGA F/N and LI/AN F/N. They interacted with μ2 like the single mutants AKGA and LI/AN, also indicating that substitution of phenylalanine 790 does not influence the binding of the μ2-chain. After substitution of both the tyrosine-based motif and t"

Previous studies demonstrated that B-Myb was phosphorylated at the onset of S phase, suggesting that it could be due to cyclin-dependent kinases. We identified 10 B-Myb phosphorylation sites by automated peptide radiosequencing of tryptic phosphopeptides derived from in vivo 32P-labeled B-Myb. Each B-Myb phosphorylation site contained a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine followed by a proline, suggesting that this phosphorylation is due to a proline-directed kinase. Cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes each phosphorylated B-Myb in a cell-free system on the same sites as in intact cells. Furthermore, the ability of B-Myb to activate a reporter plasmid was enhanced by the cotransfection of cyclin A, whereas mutagenesis of the 10 identified phosphorylation sites from B-Myb blocked the effect of cyclin A coexpression. Additional analysis revealed that the effect of phosphorylation on B-Myb transactivation potential was enhanced by phosphorylation sites in its carboxyl-terminal half. One phosphorylation site (Ser581) appeared to negatively regulate DNA binding, as mutation of this site enhanced the ability of B-Myb to bind a Myb-binding sequence. These data suggest that B-Myb is a target for phosphorylation by cyclin-Cdk2 and that phosphorylation of B-Myb regulates its transcriptional activity.

Myb-binding site(s) conserved region high pressure liquid chromatography enhanced chemifluorescence The transcription factor B-Myb is a potent regulator of the cell cycle (1Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 109-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The B-myb gene was identified in a low stringency screen for genes related to the proto-oncogene c-myb (2Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In contrast to the restricted expression of c-Myb in hematopoietic cells, B-Myb is a nuclear protein with ubiquitous tissue distribution (2Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The 75% homology shared between the amino-terminal DNA-binding domains of B-Myb and c-Myb correlates with the ability of each protein to bind to a consensus MBS1 (3Howe K.M. Watson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3913-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). B-Myb and c-Myb also share weak homology in an acidic region that serves as a transactivation domain in c-Myb. In B-Myb, the acidic region retains the relative location and some of the acidic nature of the transactivation domain within c-Myb, but the transactivation potential of the acidic region in B-Myb has not been definitively established (4Nakagoshi H.

It is also possible that B-Myb exerts its effects on cells through protein-protein interaction with other molecules involved in cell cycle control (1Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 109-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potent effect of B-Myb on cell proliferation was illustrated by demonstration that the ectopic expression of B-Myb can rescue cells from p53-induced G1 growth arrest (15Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of endogenous B-Myb is inhibited by expression of an inducible p53 transgene (16Lin D. Shields M.T. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Passerini F. Mantovani A. Golay J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2708-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transfection of antisense B-myb inhibits progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle in BALB/c 3T3 cells (18Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The growth of BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts is enhanced when B-Myb is constitutively overexpressed (18Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The biological activity of B-Myb is thought to be regulated by phosphorylation. B-Myb is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner at the onset of S phase (19Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marais R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar). This timing of B-Myb phosphorylation in intact cells suggests that B-Myb might be a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinases. Cyclin A-Cdk2 and cyclin E-Cdk2 phosphorylate B-Myb in cell-free systems (8Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,11Sala A. Kundu M.

However, the complete role of specific phosphorylation sites in regulating the biological activity of B-Myb has yet to be determined. We performed phosphopeptide radiosequencing to directly identify 10 sites phosphorylated on B-Myb in intact cells. The pattern of phosphorylation on B-Myb in intact cells was mimicked by either cyclin A-Cdk2 or cyclin E-Cdk2 in a cell-free system. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the identified phosphorylation sites on B-Myb blocked the ability of cyclin A to enhance B-Myb transcriptional activity, whereas mutation of a phosphorylation site in the carboxyl-terminal tail enhanced the ability of B-Myb to bind a MBS. Identification of these sites is an essential step in determining the role of phosphorylation in regulating the biological function of B-Myb. COS-1, U2-OS cells, and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sf9 cells were maintained in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 27 °C. A rabbit was immunized with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 553–611 of human B-Myb together with Freund's adjuvant. After 16 weeks, the immune serum was harvested and tested for its ability to immunoprecipitate B-Myb. A FLAG epitope tag was added to the amino terminus of mouse B-Myb cDNA (a gift of R. J. Watson) (9Lam E.W.-F. Robinson C. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1885-1890PubMed Google Scholar) using a polymerase chain reaction strategy. The forward primer (5′-CGCGAATTCGCCACCATGGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTCTCGGCGGACGCGCTGC-3′) contains an EcoRI site and encodes the FLAG epitope; the reverse primer was 5′-GGTAGCATCTTGGCGATC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was cut with EcoRI andBstEII and ligated back into pCMV5-B-Myb. The pCMV-FLAG-B-Myb cDNA was cut with EcoRI andXbaI to remove FLAG-B-Myb from pCMV5. This fragment was ligated into the same sites of pcDNA3 to produce pcDNA3-FLAG-B-Myb. DNA mutagenesis was performed with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions. Primers were designed to encode changes from serine to alanine or threonine to valine and to make a silent mutation to create or delete a restriction endonuclease site and to facilitate the identification of mutated cDNAs. Template DNA was either pcDNA3-FLAG- B-Myb or one of the previously mutated B-Myb cDNAs. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The forward primers for mutagenesis were 5′-GGGAGAAGTGCGCGTTCCGGAGCCCCCAGAATCTCTCAAGCG-3′ (T267V, creates a BspEI site), 5′-CCAGGAGTTCTCCGCCCCGGAGACGTCCCTGCCCTACAAGTGGG-3′ (S283A, creates anAatII site), 5′-GCTGATCCCCATTGCTCCGTCGACTGAGTTTGGGGG-3′ (S396A, creates a SalI site), 5′-GAGTTTGGGGGCTCCGGAATTGGCGTACCTCCCTCAGTGC-3′ (T408V, creates aBspEI site), 5′-GCCTGTCAAAACCCTCCCCTTCTCACCTTCCCAATTTCTGAACTTCTGG-3′ (S455A, destroys an AlwNI site), 5′-CGTCACCACGCCCTTGCACAGGGATAAGGTACCCCTGCACC-3′ (T497V, creates anEcoNI site), 5′-CCATGGACAACGTTCCCCACGTGCCAGTCCCGTTCAAAAATGCCCTGG-3′ (3TV, creates aBsmI site), and 5′-GCCTGGGCTCCGGAGAGCCCCTATCAAGAAGG-3′ (S581A, creates a BspEI site). The reverse primers were the complements of the forward primers. All polymerase chain reaction primers and DNA sequencing were done by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Molecular Biology Core Laboratory. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (21Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J.Z. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were assayed 48 h after transfection. The cells were solubilized in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) conjugated to agarose and washed as described previously (22Volle D.J. Fulton J.A. Chaika O.V. McDermott K. Huang H. Steinke L.A. Lewis R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) before addition of sample buffer and electrophoresis. Metabolic labeling of B-Myb in cells with [35S]methionine was performed as described previously (23Tauer T.J. Volle D.J. Rhode S.L. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 331-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 293T cells transiently expressing B-Myb or mutated B-Myb proteins were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (carrier-free; ICN) at a final concentration of 2.5 mCi/ml for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described previously (22Volle D.J. Fulton J.A. Chaika O.V. McDermott K. Huang H. Steinke L.A. Lewis R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography or with storage phosphor technology (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). 293T cells transiently expressing B-Myb were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described above. Sf9 cells were co-infected with recombinant baculovirus containing cDNAs for either cyclin A and Cdk2 or cyclin E and Cdk2 (a gift of S. H. Lee). After 48 h, the infected Sf9 cells were lysed. Sf9 cell lysates were incubated with immunoprecipitated B-Myb in a kinase reaction. Alternatively, Sf9 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin E or anti-cyclin A antibodies together with anti-FLAG antibodies on protein G-agarose beads. Sf9 lysates were also immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin A or anti-cyclin E antibodies and incubated with 3 μg of histone H1 in a kinase reaction. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. The immune complexes were then mixed with 10 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μm ATP, and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl, 6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 37 °C. Electrophoresis sample buffer was added to stop the reaction, and the samples were heated at 110 °C and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 32P-Labeled B-Myb proteins were recovered from polyacrylamide gels by the method of Hunter and co-workers (24Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) and then digested with trypsin and separated on a peptide C18 column as described previously (22Volle D.J. Fulton J.A. Chaika O.V. McDermott K. Huang H. Steinke L.A. Lewis R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on thin-layer cellulose plates (Sigma) as described (23Tauer T.J. Volle D.J. Rhode S.L. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 331-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Five 10-cm dishes of 293T cells transiently expressing pcDNA3-FLAG-B-Myb were prepared for each experiment. Each dish was labeled with 5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h at 37 °C. 32P-Labeled B-Myb proteins were immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. Tryptic phosphopeptides generated from radiolabeled B-Myb were separated on a Vydac C18column and subjected to amino-terminal Edman degradation as described previously (22Volle D.J. Fulton J.A. Chaika O.V. McDermott K. Huang H. Steinke L.A. Lewis R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A portion of each sequencing fraction was collected and subjected to scintillation counting for radioactivity from phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. U2-OS cells (in 60-mm dishes) were cotransfected with 10 μg of 3xA-TK-luc (a gift of S. A. Ness) (25Ness S.A. Marknell Å. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), 6 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG-B-Myb or pcDNA3-B-Myb 10Mut, 10 μg of pRC-cyclin A, 4 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase, and, where necessary, a balancing amount of empty pcDNA3 vector. After 48 h, cells were assayed using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Luciferase activity was assayed in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed (26Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blotted using anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (1:3000) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:2000). Blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. DNA affinity purification using biotinylated oligonucleotides was performed as described previously (27Al-Shami A. Mahanna W. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1058-1063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Four biotinylated DNA probes were synthesized, MBS-1 (AGAATGTGTGTCAGTTAGGGTGTAGAG) and its complement (6Watson R.J. Robinson C. Lam E.W.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and mutant MBS-1 containing a scrambled MBS sequence (AGAATGTGTGGTCTGAGGAGTGTAGAG), and its complement and were hybridized. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were incubated with immobilized streptavidin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed as described by the manufacturer. 293T cells were transfected with wild-type or mutated B-Myb as described above and then lysed in KCl extraction buffer (27Al-Shami A. Mahanna W. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1058-1063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Insoluble matter was pelleted by centrifugation; the KCl concentration was diluted to 200 mm; and lysates were precleared with immobilized streptavidin for 1 h at 4 °C. B-Myb from 30 μl of each cleared lysate was detected by ECF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) Western analysis and quantified with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Equal amounts of B-Myb protein from each lysate were added to the immobilized DNA with 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA and 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed four times with DNA affinity wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100). B-Myb bound to the DNA was analyzed by ECF Western blotting and then quantified. Previous studies have shown that B-Myb is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner at the onset of S phase (19Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marais R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation may control the biological activity of B-Myb (8Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,11Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalili K. Peschle C.

Biol. 1997; 7: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to identify the specific amino acids phosphorylated on B-Myb in intact cells. B-Myb was transiently expressed in cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate. The radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-B-Myb or preimmune serum. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled B-Myb with immune or preimmune serum from cells transiently expressing B-Myb or transfected with the vector only demonstrated that the anti-B-Myb antibody specifically immunoprecipitated B-Myb (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Immunoprecipitation of B-Myb from 32P-labeled cells under the same conditions demonstrated that B-Myb was phosphorylated in intact cells (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 32P-labeled B-Myb protein revealed the presence of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine (Fig. 1 B). To identify specific B-Myb phosphorylation sites, B-Myb was expressed in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T. 32P-Labeled B-Myb was immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were visualized with a ZnCl2 stain. The gel piece was digested with trypsin, and the radiolabeled phosphopeptides were extracted and subjected to HPLC analysis. The major radiolabeled peaks were sequenced and identified by automated Edman degradation (Fig. 2). The presence of the radiolabeled phosphate group on the amino acid residue prevents detection of the amino acid in that cycle, although subsequent amino acids can be identified. A fraction of each sequencing cycle was also counted for radioactivity released by β-elimination to identify the cycle containing the specific amino acid phosphorylated within each peptide. The 32P released in each cycle was compared with the peptide sequence determined for each phosphopeptide to identify each phosphorylation site (Fig. 3). Phosphoamino acid analysis done on the HPLC fractions confirmed the prediction of phosphoserine or phosphothreonine in the phosphopeptide sequenced (Fig. 3, insets).FIG. 3Identification of B-Myb phosphorylation sites by radiosequencing. The HPLC phosphopeptide peaks identified in Fig. 2 were sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the amount of 32P released in each sequencing cycle was measured. The sequence of each identified peptide (see Fig. 2) is indicated at the bottom of each graph, and the peak of Cerenkov radiation is labeled as the predicted phosphoamino acid. Phosphoamino acid analysis of a portion of each sequenced phosphopeptide is shown in the insets. The locations of phosphoamino acid standards are indicated: S, phosphoserine;T, phosphothreonine; Y, phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ten phosphorylation sites carboxyl-terminal to the DNA-binding domain were identified by this method: threonines at positions 267, 408, 497, 519, 522, and 524 and serines at positions 283, 396, 455, and 581. Phosphopeptide analysis of B-Myb deletion mutants demonstrated that no phosphorylation sites exist in either the amino terminus or the DNA-binding domain. 2T. K. Johnson, R. E. Schweppe, and R. E. Lewis, unpublished data. Although they reside on a single tryptic peptide, phosphorylation of the threonines at positions 519, 522, and 524 was not determined from a single peptide, but was determined from three separate peptides (Fig. 3, peaks B–D). This observation may indicate that Thr519, Thr522, and Thr524 are alternative phosphorylation sites and that only one of the three sites is phosphorylated on any single B-Myb molecule. Thr519 was the most prominent of the three phosphorylation sites identified on this peptide (Fig. 2, peptide D), suggesting that this is the preferred site. Analysis of the sequence of each phosphorylation site revealed that in each case, B-Myb is phosphorylated on either serine or threonine followed directly by a proline residue, suggesting that B-Myb is phosphorylated by a proline-directed kinase. The fact that B-Myb is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner suggests that it may be phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases (1Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 109-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R.

Biol. 1997; 7: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), members of the family of proline-directed kinases. Previous work indicated that B-Myb is phosphorylated at the onset of the S phase of the cell cycle (19Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marais R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar), coincident with increased cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity. Phosphorylation of serine or threonine by Cdk2 requires an adjacent, carboxyl-terminal proline (29Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The identification of 10 phosphorylation sites with this minimum consensus sequence on B-Myb is consistent with the possibility that B-Myb is a normal cellular substrate of Cdk2. Biochemical identification of each phosphorylation site was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Isosteric substitution of alanine or valine was made for serine or threonine, respectively. Each site was mutated independently, except Thr519, Thr522, and Thr524, which were all altered in a single mutation termed 3TV. The combined mutation of Thr519, Thr522, and Thr524 was made due to their proximity to one another and because the sequencing data (Fig. 3) suggested that these amino acids may be alternative phosphorylation sites for each other. A B-Myb construct that removed all 10 of the phosphorylation sites identified was also created. The mutated B-Myb proteins were transiently expressed in32P-labeled 293T cells. The radiolabeled B-Myb proteins were isolated and digested with trypsin, and the tryptic phosphopeptides were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. The loss of specific phosphorylation sites was confirmed by comparing the HPLC profiles of the mutated B-Myb proteins to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4). Single phosphopeptide peaks are absent from the HPLC phosphopeptide profiles of B-Myb S283A (Fig. 4 A), B-Myb T267V (Fig. 4 A), and B-Myb S581A (Fig. 4 D). Ser396 and Thr408 reside in the same tryptic peptide. Elimination of either site resulted in a partial decrease and slight shift in the position of the corresponding phosphopeptide peak (Fig. 4 B). The B-Myb S455A protein did not have a phosphopeptide map discernibly different from that of intact 32P-labeled B-Myb (Fig. 4 C). The phosphopeptide containing Ser455 eluted at the end of the HPLC gradient, far later than would be predicted from the sequence composition. This observation suggests that, when it was sequenced, the Ser455 phosphopeptide was digested incompletely by trypsin. It is also possible that the Ser455 phosphopeptide interacted with other peptide fragments of B-Myb to delay its elution from the column. Either explanation suggests that elution of the phosphopeptide containing Ser455 from the HPLC gradient may vary and could prevent resolution of the site by mapping of the B-Myb S455A protein. The 3TV mutation removed three peaks that were present in intact B-Myb (Fig. 4 D). The small phosphopeptide remaining in the second peak is Thr497, which coeluted with the Thr524phosphopeptide of the 3TV mutant (Fig. 2, peak B). Valine substitution at position 497 resulted in a partial reduction of the appropriate phosphopeptide peak of B-Myb T497V in Fig. 4 C. Mutation of all 10 identified sites eliminated the corresponding peaks and led to a relative increase in phosphorylation of minor sites (Fig. 4 E). B-Myb has been suggested as a potential substrate for the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 (1Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 109-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lane S. Farlie P.

Two different approaches were used to assess the ability of Cdk2 to phosphorylate B-Myb in a cell-free system. In the first approach, B-Myb immunoprecipitated from 293T cells was mixed with lysate from Sf9 cells co-infected with baculovirus containing cDNAs for Cdk2 and cyclin A or cyclin E. Kinase assays indicated that B-Myb was phosphorylated preferentially in this approach by the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2). Histone H1 was also phosphorylated by each kinase complex to demonstrate that Cdk2 was active (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1 and 2). In the second approach, the B-Myb substrate and the cyclin-Cdk2 kinase complex were immunoprecipitated together by combining antibodies to the FLAG epitope on B-Myb and antibodies to cyclin A or cyclin E with protein G-agarose. The phosphorylation reaction was performed with the immobilized substrate and kinase. With this protoco"

Kinetic analysis of the changes in receptor phosphorylation demonstrated that serine phosphorylation increased during the internalization of acetyl-low density lipoproteins (LDL) by macrophages. The increase was maximal at about 2.5 min after the initiation of ligand uptake. Oxidized LDL also stimulated serine phosphorylation, but the relative increase was smaller and the time to maximum was shorter. Receptor mutants expressed in Chinese hamster ovary and COS cells showed that elimination of the potential phosphorylation site at Ser21 increased acetyl-LDL metabolism, whereas inactivation of the site at Ser49reduced acetyl-LDL uptake. The increase in uptake by the Ser21 mutant was due to an increase in surface receptor expression. In contrast, elimination of the site at Ser49did not affect receptor expression but slowed receptor internalization. To identify potential internalization signal sequences, β-turn structure in the cytosolic domain was targeted for mutagenesis. Disruption of one region near Asp25 inhibited receptor activity. The studies support a model whereby receptor internalization requires the presence of an internalization signal motif but that the rate of receptor internalization is governed by the pattern of receptor phosphorylation induced by the ligand.

The appearance of fatty streaks in all models of lipid-induced atherosclerosis predicts that they are part of the early events and are important to explore the mechanism by which they are formed. The major cellular events that precede fatty streak formation are fairly consistent between different atherosclerosis models; however, it is clear from the various transgenic and knockout mouse models that the transition to the fatty streak can be initiated by a number of metabolic alterations. This supports the view that it is unlikely that a single pathogenic event accounting for fatty streak lesion formation under all circumstances will be identified, and the net accumulation of cholesterol in the artery wall, in any particular model, will be determined by the balance between the processes that promote cholesterol deposition and those that oppose it. One component of the formulation is likely to be the modified low density lipoprotein (LDL)1-scavenger receptor pathway (reviewed in Refs. 1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C.

The hypothesis proposes that LDL that has entered the subendothelial space is oxidized by artery wall cells, producing a modified lipoprotein exhibiting biological properties that promote atherosclerotic lesion development. One of these is avid metabolism by monocyte-derived macrophages leading to the excessive accumulation of lipid and foam cell formation (3Henriksen T. Mahoney E.M. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

After binding to surface receptors, the receptor-ligand complexes concentrate in coated pits and are rapidly internalized into endosomes. The ligand dissociates from the receptor and is transported within endosomes to lysosomes where it is metabolized while the receptor recycles back to the cell surface. The process is highly efficient and can lead to foam cell formation in vitro. The receptor does not appear to cycle continuously through the metabolic pathway since, in the absence of suitable ligands, receptors are not present in coated pits. This suggests that the process depends upon a stimulus and thus it is regulated. In support of this, pharmacological studies have shown that receptor transport can be modulated. Alterations of calcium flux, protein phosphorylation, or protein glycosylation have been reported to affect scavenger receptor transport (22Fong L.G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 574-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bernini F. Scurati N. Bonfadin G. Fumagalli E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

The basis for their actions or the precise step(s) affected has not yet been established. The most direct evidence that receptor transport is tightly controlled is based on the observation of Doi and colleagues (17Doi T. Kurasawa M. Higashino K. Imanishi T. Mori T. Naito M. Takahashi K. Kawabe Y. Wada Y. Matsumoto A. Kodama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They showed that the substitution of His260 in the α-helical coiled-coil domain of the receptor with a leucine prevents the acid pH-induced dissociation of ligands from the scavenger receptor. When cells expressing this mutant receptor were incubated with ligand, the binding and internalization of ligand proceeded normally; however, after their internalization, the receptors did not recycle back to the cell surface. Recent studies have begun to map regions of the receptor important for ligand binding (26Andersson L. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19592-19601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on the processes likely to control scavenger receptor internalization. There are two of potential importance; the expression of an internalization signal motif and receptor phosphorylation (reviewed in Refs. 27Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar and 28Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The signal motifs are thought to define a three-dimensional conformation and chemistry. These conformations are thought to provide the appropriate signal for the association of the cytoplasmic domain of receptors with components of clathrin-coated pits (28Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 29Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), thereby providing an efficient mechanism for the selective concentration of receptors at sites of internalization. An internalization signal sequence has not been identified for the scavenger receptor; however, the targeting of scavenger receptor-ligand complexes to coated pits strongly suggests that one may be present. Changes in receptor phosphorylation can also modulate receptor internalization. This has been documented for several receptors that are internalized at coated pits including the asialoglycoprotein receptor (31Fallon R.J. Danaher R.L. Saylor R.L. Saxena A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11011-11017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor receptor (32Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The scavenger receptor contains three conserved phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domain of the human, mouse, bovine, and rabbit receptors (34Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) located at Ser21, Thr30, and Ser49. We have shown previously that the mouse macrophage scavenger receptor is phosphorylated in situ (22Fong L.G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 574-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the relation of this to receptor transport has not yet been established. This report investigates the role of receptor phosphorylation and potential internalization motifs in the control of receptor function during modified LDL uptake. The results show that the function of the mouse scavenger receptor is dependent on both receptor phosphorylation and one or more internalization signal motifs. The presence of phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domain that affect receptor function both in a positive and negative fashion predict that the level of receptor activity will depend on which sites are phosphorylated during the metabolic cycle. However, the dependence on phosphorylation is not absolute. It is proposed that receptor phosphorylation acts as a modulator of receptor activity by governing the accessibility of one or more internalization signal sequences in the receptor cytoplasmic domain with specific components of clathrin-coated pit structures. Carrier-free Na125I and [14C]chloramphenicol were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Endotoxin tested Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal calf serum (FCS) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. FCS was heat-inactivated before use (56 °C for 30 min). Nu-Serum (NS) was obtained from Becton Dickenson (Bedford, MA). Butyryl-CoA, chloramphenicol, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), DEAE-dextran (M r 500,000), chloroquine, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were purchased from Sigma. COS-7 and CHO K-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Genemed Biotechnologies (South San Francisco, CA) or Genosys (Woodlands, TX). Human LDL (d 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was isolated from EDTA-treated plasma by density gradient ultracentrifugation (38Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6449) Google Scholar). LDL was radiolabeled with Na125I using IODO-GEN (Pierce) to specific activities of 200–400 cpm/ng. The acetylation and oxidation of LDL were performed as described previously (18Fong L.G. Fong T.A.T. Cooper A.D. J, Biol, Chem. 1990; 265: 11751-11760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fong L.G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 574-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The class A type I mouse scavenger receptor cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Larry Stanton at Scios Nova (Mountain View, CA). This was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) using the restriction enzyme sites BamHI andNotI. The mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuickchangeTM method that is based on the incorporation of a mutation using Pfu DNA polymerase and complementary mutagenic oligonucleotide primers. The native receptor mutant construct (50 ng) was incubated with 125 ng of each mutagenic oligonucleotide primer (32–38 bases in length) and Pfu DNA polymerase (2.5 units). The temperature cycling parameters followed the recommendations suggested by the manufacturer. The reaction mixture was incubated withDpnI (20 units) to digest the parental DNA template and then used to transform Top10F′ cells (Invitrogen). DNA from selected bacterial colonies was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.1989: 1.25-1.28Google Scholar) and analyzed by manual dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Promega Fmol DNA Sequencing System). DNAs containing the correct mutations were identified, and large plasmid preparations were isolated by ion exchange chromatography (Qiagen; Valencia, CA). For a selected number of receptor constructs, the scavenger receptor cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-Tag4 (Stratagene). This produces a fusion protein that contains an extra 10 amino acids (LEDYKDDDDK) located at the carboxyl terminus of the receptor protein. The stop codon in the scavenger receptor cDNA was eliminated and substituted with an XhoI site by polymerase chain reaction using the native scavenger receptor cDNA in pcDNA3.1 as the template and the primers 5′-CAAGCGCACGTGGAACAGGAAGTAAAACAG-3′ and 5′-GATCTCGAGTGAAGTACAAGTGACCCCAGC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was subcloned into each of the pcDNA 3.1 receptor mutant constructs using the unique restriction enzyme sites Bbr andXhoI. Sequencing confirmed that the epitope DNA sequence was in frame with the receptor cDNA sequence. The entire receptor cDNA was then subcloned into pCMV-Tag4 using the restriction enzyme sites BamHI and XhoI. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using DEAE-dextran (40Aruffo A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 16.13.1-16.13.7Google Scholar). COS cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/10-cm tissue culture dish and incubated overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The following day the cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 10% NS and incubated with the different plasmid DNAs. Prior to their addition to the cells, the DNA preparations were pretreated. The scavenger receptor DNA preparations (7.5 μg) were diluted in Tris-EDTA buffer (20 μl) and added to 15-ml culture tubes. To this was added 6 ml of a freshly prepared stock solution containing 400 μg/ml DEAE-dextran, 0.1 mm chloroquine, and 1.25 μg/ml of the reporter gene construct pcDNA/CAT in DMEM, 10% NS. These were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then added to the washed cells. After 3.5 h at 37 °C, the cells were incubated with PBS containing 10% Me2SO at room temperature for 2 min. The cells were washed with DMEM, 10% FCS and incubated in the same medium. The next day the cells were dislodged by trypsin treatment, resuspended in 6.5 ml of DMEM, 10% FCS, and added to 4 wells of a 24-well plate (1 ml/well) and 1 well of a 6-well plate (2 ml/well). The metabolism of modified LDL and CAT activities was measured 48 h later. CHO cells were transfected using calcium phosphate (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). CHO cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/10 cm tissue culture dish and cultured overnight in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The following day the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium (10 ml/dish), and the cells were incubated for 2 h. The calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate was prepared by incubating plasmid DNA (7.5 μg each of the receptor DNA construct and pcDNA3.1/CAT) with 125 mm CaCl2 and DNA precipitation buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.05), 0.75 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 6 mm glucose) in a total volume of 1 ml according to the manufacturer's recommendations. This was added to the cells and incubated together for 4–5 h. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with 3 ml of 15% glycerol in DNA precipitation buffer at room temperature for 2 min. Phosphate-buffered saline (10 ml/dish) was added and incubated at room temperature for 4 min. The cells were rinsed once with PBS and incubated overnight with fresh tissue culture medium. The next day the cells were plated and analyzed as described above for transfected COS cells. Adherent cells in 24-well plates were rinsed 3 times with DMEM, 10% FCS and incubated with 125I-labeled modified LDL. To measure lipoprotein degradation, the cells were incubated with modified LDL (5 μg/ml) in the same medium (0.5 ml) at 37 °C. The amount of degradation products was determined by measuring the amount of trichloroacetic acid- and silver nitrate (AgNO3)-soluble radioactivity generated in the incubation medium, and the amount of cell associated lipoprotein was determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity associated with an aliquot of a cell lysate (18Fong L.G. Fong T.A.T. Cooper A.D. J, Biol, Chem. 1990; 265: 11751-11760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fong L.G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 574-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of specific lipoprotein metabolism (total uptake minus nonspecific uptake) was calculated using fucoidan (100 μg/ml) to determine the amount of nonspecific lipoprotein metabolism. The results are expressed as the amount of degradation or cell-associated products in nanograms per mg cell protein. To measure lipoprotein binding, the cells were incubated with modified LDL (10 μg/ml) in DMEM, 10% FCS buffered with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 2 h. Non-bound lipoprotein was removed by washing the cells three times with ice-cold PBS, and the amount bound was determined by measuring the amount of cell-associated radioactivity. The amount of specific binding was calculated and expressed as described above. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies, the cells were cotransfected with pcDNA/CAT and the results normalized based on the amount of CAT activity (41Kingston R.E. Sheen J. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1990: 9.6.1-9.6.8Google Scholar). Cells in 6-well culture dishes were washed with PBS and lysed with 200 μl of 0.25m Tris (pH 7.8) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The cell lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and stored at −80 °C. The sample was centrifuged for 1 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using BCA. An aliquot containing 6 μg of protein for COS cells and 1.5 μg for CHO cells was diluted to a volume of 10 μl with lysis buffer and incubated with an equal volume of substrate mix at 37 °C for 1 h. The substrate mix contained 0.5 mg/ml butyryl-CoA, 0.2 m Tris (pH 8.0), and 4 μCi/ml [14C]chloramphenicol (14.8 mCi/mmol). The reaction mixture was centrifuged briefly in a microcentrifuge and then extracted with 200 μl of xylenes. The xylene layer was transferred to another tube and back-extracted twice with 100 μl of water. The amount of radiolabeled butyrylated chloramphenicol in 80–140 μl of the xylene fraction was then measured by scintillation counting. At these conditions, the conversion of chloramphenicol to butyryl chloramphenicol was between 15 and 40%. Resident mouse peritoneal macrophages in 6-well tissue culture dishes were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described previously (22Fong L.G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 574-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed three times with DMEM, 10% FCS buffered with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and incubated with unlabeled lipoprotein (50 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 2 h. Non-bound lipoprotein was removed by washing with ice-cold medium and then incubated at 37 °C from 0.5 to 5 min. The cells were immediately placed on ice and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells that were not incubated at 37 °C but kept on ice were also included to measure protein phosphorylation at time 0. The cells were solubilized, and equivalent amounts of cell lysate protein were incubated with a polyclonal anti-scavenger receptor antibody to precipitate the receptor protein (22Fong L.G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 574-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore) by electroblotting. The location of the receptor was identified by autoradiography, and the piece of membrane containing the immobilized receptor was isolated. The membrane pieces were hydrolyzed in 200 μl of 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h, and the hydrolysate was dried using a speed vacuum. The residue was resuspended in 7 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (H2O/glacial acetic acid/formic acid; 1076/93.6/30 (v/v)) containing 1 mg/ml each of phosphoserine, phosphotyrosine, and phosphothreonine. An aliquot (5 μl) of the suspension was spotted onto thin layer cellulose plates (100 μm; C.B.S. Scientific), and the constituent amino acids were separated using the Hunter Thin Layer Peptide Mapping Electrophoresis System (C.B.S. Scientific) (42Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Cell Biology, A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Danish Centre for Human Genome Research, Aarhus, Denmark1994: 422-448Google Scholar). Electrophoresis in the first dimension was done at 1.5 kV in pH 1.9 buffer for 20 min and the second dimension at 1.3 kV in pH 3.5 buffer (H2O/glacial acetic acid/pyridine; 1134/60/6 (v/v)) for 16 min. The dried plate was stained with 0.25% ninhydrin to locate the phosphoamino acid standards. The radiolabeled residues were detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Storm 860), and the amount of radiolabel for each phosphoamino acid was determined using a fixed area and quantified using Image QuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics). Background values from three separate areas were averaged and subtracted from the values measured for each phosphoamino acid. The results were expressed relative to time 0 that was given an arbitrary value of 1. A maximum of four samples can be analyzed on one plate. Thus to compare samples on an equal basis, the number of samples for each experiment was limited to four, and they were analyzed on the same plate. Protein was measured by the method of Lowry (43Lowry O.H. osebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the Pierce BCA protein assay method (Pierce) using albumin as a standard. Statistical analysis was done using non-paired Student's t test. The cytoplasmic domain of the scavenger receptor A contains three phosphorylation sites that are conserved among all four species for which protein sequence is available. They are located at Ser21, Thr30, and Ser49. The mouse receptor contains a fourth site at Ser36 that is unique to the mouse protein. To examine if receptor phosphorylation and receptor activity might be linked, the level of receptor phosphorylation during the internalization of acetyl-LDL, a high affinity ligand of the scavenger receptor A, by mouse macrophages was measured. To facilitate the detection of changes in phosphorylation, the internalization of surface receptors was synchronized. This would maximize the number of surface receptors that are at the same stage of the internalization process. Cells were incubated with acetyl-LDL at 4 °C to allow surface binding and then washed to remove non-bound lipoprotein. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C to stimulate receptor-ligand internalization, and the level of receptor phosphorylation was monitored by phosphoamino acid analysis. To measure the level of phosphorylation at base line, one set of cells was kept on ice and processed in the same manner. At base line (time 0), there was a low level of receptor phosphorylation on serine residues (Fig. 1). This was present even when cells were preincubated in the absence of lipoprotein (not shown). During the internalization of acetyl-LDL, there was an increase in the phosphorylation of serine residues but no detectable phosphorylation of threonine or tyrosine. The absence of tyrosi"

https://openalex.org/W2319414422,"Retinoic Acid (RA) treatment induces disease remission of Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia (APL) patients by triggering terminal differentiation of neoplastic cells. RA-sensitivity in APL is mediated by its oncogenic protein, which results from the recombination of the PML and the RA receptor alpha (RAR alpha) genes (PML/RAR alpha fusion protein). Ectopic expression of PML/RAR alpha into haemopoietic cell lines results in increased response to RA-induced differentiation. By structure-function analysis of PML/RAR alpha-mediated RA-differentiation, we demonstrated that fusion of PML and RAR alpha sequences and integrity of the PML dimerization domain and of the RAR alpha DNA binding region are required for the effect of PML/RAR alpha on RA-differentiation. Indeed, direct fusion of the PML dimerization domain to the N- or C-terminal extremities of RAR alpha retained full biological activity. All the biologically active PML/RAR alpha mutants formed high molecular weight complexes in vivo. Functional analysis of mutations within the PML dimerization domain revealed that the capacity to form PML/RAR alpha homodimers, but not PML/RAR alpha-PML heterodimers, correlated with the RA-response. These results suggest that targeting of RAR alpha sequences by the PML dimerization domain and formation of nuclear PML/RAR alpha homodimeric complexes are crucial for the ability of PML/RAR alpha to mediate RA-response."
https://openalex.org/W2015772752,"Metallothionein-I (MT-I) gene is silenced by methylation of CpG islands in mouse lymphosarcoma P1798 cells but not in the thymus, the cell type from which the tumor was derived. Bisulfite genomic sequencing revealed that all 21 CpG dinucleotides present within -216 bp to +1 bp with respect to transcription start site are methylated in the tumor cell line, but none is methylated in the thymus. The lymphosarcoma cells induced MT-I in response to heavy metals only after demethylation with 5-azacytidine (5-AsaC). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay using specific oligonucleotide probes showed that the key transcription factors regulating MT-I gene (e.g., MTF-1, Sp 1 and MLTF/USF) are active in P1798 cells. In vivo footprinting of the proximal promoter region showed that none of the metal regulatory elements (MREs) or MLTF/USF are occupied in response to heavy metals. Demethylation of the lymphosarcoma cells with 5-AzaC resulted in constitutive footprinting at MLTF/ARE, and zinc-inducible footprinting at MRE-c, MRE-d and MRE-e sites. Demethylation of just 10-20% of the CpG islands was sufficient to render the gene inducible by cadmium or zinc. The MT-I induction persisted in the cancer cells for several generations even after withdrawal of 5-AzaC from the culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W2318609165,"Cell cycle modulation of cyclin A expression is due to the periodic relief of a transcriptional repression mediated by a bipartite negative DNA regulatory region. The 5' element (Cell Cycle Responsive Element: CCRE; cell Cycle Dependent Element: CDE) is clearly occupied in a cyclic manner in vivo, whereas the 3' element, whose sequence is shared by B-myb, cdc25C and cdc2 genes (cell Cycle gene Homology Region: CHR), is involved in more subtle interactions. Mutation of either element results in complete deregulation of cyclin A promoter activity. Whereas some reports claim that E2F/DP can bind to the CCRE/CDE, the nature of the protein(s) interacting with the CHR is unknown. In the present work we have characterized an activity present in quiescent cells and absent in cells blocked in S phase, which binds specifically to cyclin A CHR, but not to B-myb, or to cdc25C, or to cdc2 CHRs. A 90 kD protein, named CHF (cyclin A CHR binding factor), has been identified through preparative electrophoresis and UV crosslinking experiments. In order to address in more functional terms the binding of CHF to cyclin A CHR, we developed in vitro and in vivo oligonucleotide competition assays. Both in vitro transcription and in vivo microinjection experiments demonstrate that a functional difference exists between the composite CCRE/CDE-CHR repressor regions of cell cycle regulated genes such as cyclin A and cdc25C."
https://openalex.org/W2027473400,"Induction of the transactivation function of p53 after cellular irradiation was studied under conditions in which upstream signaling events modulating p53 activation were uncoupled from those regulating stabilization. This investigation prompted the discovery of a novel radiation-responsive kinase pathway targeting Ser20 that results in the masking of the DO-1 epitope in undamaged cells. Unmasking of the DO-1 epitope via dephosphorylation occurs in response to low doses of non-ionizing radiation. Our data show that phosphorylation at Ser20 reduces binding of the mdm2 protein, suggesting that a function of the Ser20-kinase pathway may be to produce a stable pool of inactive p53 in undamaged cells which can be readily activated after cellular injury. Phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies were used to determine whether the Ser20 signaling pathway is coupled to the Ser15 and Ser392 radiation-responsive kinase pathways. These results demonstrated that: (1) dephosphorylation at Ser20 is co-ordinated with an increased steady-state phosphorylation at Ser392 after irradiation, without p53 protein stabilization, and (2) stabilization of p53 protein can occur without Ser15 phosphorylation at higher doses of radiation. These data show that the Ser20 and Ser392 phosphorylation sites are both targeted by an integrated network of signaling pathways which is acutely sensitive to radiation injury."
https://openalex.org/W2324860089,"We previously showed that Gi2 proteins interfere with the transduction of CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) proliferation signals (Corre and Hermouet, 1995). To identify CSF-1R pathways controlled by Gi2, we transfected v-fms, the oncogenic equivalent of CSF-1R, in NIH3T3 cells in which Gi2 proteins were inactivated by stably expressing a dominant negative mutant form of the alpha subunit of Gi2 (alpha i2-G204A). Expression of alpha i2-G204A resulted in decreased Src-kinase activity, delayed activation of p42 ERK-MAPK, decreased cyclin D1 expression and reduced proliferation in response to serum. In alpha i2-G204A cells transfected with v-fms, Src-kinase activity remained deficient but p42 MAPK activity and cyclin D1 expression were similar to those of vector/v-fms cells, suggesting that v-fms bypasses Src to activate the ERK-MAPK cascade. However, DNA synthesis and focus formation were inhibited by up to 80% in alpha i2-G204A/v-fms cells compared to vector/v-fms cells. We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, also activated by CSF-1R/v-fms, was inhibited in alpha i2-G204A/v-fms cells; in addition, expression of an 85 kDa, C-terminal truncated form of STAT3 (STAT3 delta) was constitutively increased. Both the inhibition of v-fms-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and the increased expression of STAT3 delta were reproduced by transfecting a dominant negative mutant of Src. Last, we show that expression of STAT3 delta 55C, a mutant form of STAT3 lacking the last 55 C-terminal amino acids, is sufficient to inhibit DNA synthesis and v-fms-induced transformation in NIH3T3 cells. In summary, adequate regulation by Gi2 proteins of the activity of both Src-kinase and STAT3 is required for optimal cell proliferation in response to CSF-1R/v-fms."

Given the conserved nature of the cell death pathway, this genetic screen can be used for rapid identification of novel inhibitors of apoptosis from diverse sources. The prototype baculovirus, Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) expresses p35, a potent anti cell-death gene that promotes the propagation of the virus by blocking host cell apoptosis. Infection of insect Sf-21 cells with AcMNPV lacking p35induces apoptosis. We have used this pro-apoptotic property of thep35 null virus to screen for genes encoding inhibitors of apoptosis that rescue cells infected with the p35 defective virus.

Additionally, apoptosis serves as an important host defense mechanism against invading pathogens, wherein infected cells undergo programmed cell death thereby preventing propagation and spread of the pathogen (4Shen Y.

To anatagonize host defense mechanisms, pathogens have in turn evolved ways to attenuate the host apoptotic pathway (4Shen Y. Shenk T.E. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Baculoviruses, a family of arthropod-specific double-stranded DNA viruses, were one of the first viruses shown to elicit and modify the host apoptotic response (6Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K.

AcMNPV infects Sf-21 cells, a cell line derived from the fall army wormSpodopetra frugiperda, which results in the production of budded virus (BV) early during infection and occluded virus (OV) starting 24 h postinfection (6Clem R.J.

Propagation of AcMNPV in Sf-21 cells proceeds normally because of the expression of P35, a virally encoded pan-caspase inhibitor (8Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P.

Infection of Sf-21 cells with ap35 null mutant of AcMNPV results in widespread apoptosis leading to reduced BV and no OV production (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell.

Induction of apoptosis by p35 mutants of AcMNPV in Sf-21 cells can be blocked by viral IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis) (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell.

The IAPs are a family of cell death inhibitors found in both vertebrates and invertebrates and are known to block cell death induced by various stimuli (14Miller L.K.

The first members of the IAP family, Op-iap and Cp-iap, were isolated from the genome of two baculoviruses CpGV and OpNPV by their ability to substitute forp35 in AcMNPV (12Birnbaum M.J. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved nature of the apoptotic machinery across the animal kingdom allows for the use of AcMNPV as a powerful genetic tool in identification of genes that block apoptosis. We describe the use of ap35 null mutant of AcMNPV to screen expression cDNA libraries for anti-apoptotic genes. Using this system we identified TnIAP1, a novel IAP, from TN368-derived cDNA libraries. In contrast to Sf-21 cells, TN368 cells, derived from the cabbage looperTrichoplusia ni, support the normal growth of p35null mutant of AcMNPV, leading to the production of both the BV and OV (6Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1388-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 11Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3730-3738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of TN368 cells to support the propagation ofp35 null AcMNPV implied the presence of an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis that effectively substitutes for p35function. Identification of such an endogenous inhibitor using TN368 expression cDNA libraries and p35 null AcMNPV permitted a stringent test of the general applicability of the system. Fall army worm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: noctuideae)-derived IPLB-Sf-21 (Sf-21) cells were maintained in TC-100 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (17O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 18Vaughn J.L. Goodwin R.H. Tompkins G.J. McCawley P. In Vitro. 1977; 13: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). TN368 cells, derived from the cabbage looper T. ni, were also maintained in TC-100 medium. vP35del, a p35 null mutant of AcMNPV was cultured and titered in TN368 cells (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and the viral DNA was prepared as described (17O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was made in a modified pHSP70PLVI+CAT (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) plasmid using mRNA derived from TN368 cells. pHSP70PLVI+CAT, a previously described plasmid (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), was modified to create 5′ XhoI and 3′ NotI sites flanking the gene for CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) such that it could be replaced with cDNAs of interest. Expression cDNAs in this vector are under the control of the Drosophila70-kDa heat-shock protein (hsp70) promoter. The expression cassette is flanked by AcMNPV sequences that mediate homologous recombination allowing for the integration of the expression cassette into the viral genome, thereby creating a recombinant virus expressing the cDNA of interest. All plasmids used in this study were constructed in pHSP70PLVI+CAT back-bone by replacing CAT with an appropriate insert within the BglII (5′) and NotI (3′) sites. The various Tn-IAP1 constructs used in this study contained an in-frame HA.11 epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) at the N terminus. PhsTn-IAP1-FLVI+ contains (residues 1–379) the complete open reading frame encoding Tn-IAP1, phsTn-IAP1-FL-17VI+ encodes for Tn-IAP1 lacking the first 17 residues, phsTn-IAP1-BIRsVI+ codes for the baculovirus IAP repeats (BIRs) (residues 18–299) of Tn-IAP1, phsTn-IAP1-RING encodes the Tn-IAP1 RING (residues 300–379), phsTn-IAP1-BIR1RING-VI+ contains an in-frame deletion that removes the region coding for BIR2 (residues 197–288), and phsTn-IAP1-BIR2RING-VI+ codes for the BIR2 and RING of Tn-IAP1 (residues 200–379). All polymerase chain reaction fragments were generated using proofreading Pfu polymerase or turboPfu (Stratagene). Plasmids expressing nontaggedp35 or cat, Flag-tagged hid,grim, or reaper (rpr) and HA.11 (HA)-tagged Op-iap, D-iap1, and D-iap1-BIR have been described previously (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell.

Sf-21 cells (1 × 106cells per 60-mm tissue culture dish) were co-transfected with 1 μg of vP35del viral DNA and 2–4 μg of appropriate plasmid (either the cDNA library or the various IAP constructs) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were observed for cyptopathic effects and occluded virus production for 7–10 days post-transfection. Conditioned medium 7–10 days post-transfection was collected and used to infect naive cells (1 × 106 cells per 60-mm tissue culture dish) to confirm rescue. Progeny viruses obtained from co-transfecting the cDNAs library were plaque-purified in Sf-21 cells. Total DNA was prepared from Sf-21 cells infected with plaque-purified virus and was used to polymerase chain reaction amplify the cDNA insert present within the viral genome. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pT-Adv (CLONTECH) for sequence analysis. The viability assays were performed as described previously (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, Sf-21 cells were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells per 35-mm dish and were transfected with appropriate recombinant plasmids using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). At 12–16 h post-transfection, cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 30 min to induce the expression of cDNAs placed under hsp70 promoter control. For actinomycin D (ActD) treatment, the medium was replaced with fresh media containing 500 ng/ml of ActD. Viable cells excluding trypan blue were then counted at 10 h after treatment with ActD. For assays involving GRIM and HID, viable cells were counted 8 h after heat shock. Briefly, Sf-21 cells (1 × 106) cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids. Cell lysates were prepared and used for precipitation by anti-GD antibody-coupled resin as described previously (19Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1986; 233: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotted, and the co-precipitating HA.11-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis as described previously (19Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 21Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1986; 233: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We have developed a genetic screen to identify novel anti-cell death genes present in expression cDNA libraries. Upon infecting Sf-21 insect cells, vP35del virus induces wide spread apoptosis leading to greatly reduced BV production and no OV production (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ability of the cabbage looper-derived cell line TN368 to support normal propagation of vP35del virus suggested that this cell line potentially expressed an inhibitor of apoptosis. When supplied in trans, any gene that can block vP35del-induced cell death will lead to the production of OV and restore the levels of BV produced. To screen for potential anti-cell death genes present in TN368 cells, we constructed an expression cDNA library in a transfer plasmid containing a Sf-21-permissible hsp70 promoter (“Experimental Procedures”). This vector allowed for homologous recombination-mediated integration of the expression cassette into the vP35del genome and allowed production of a library of recombinant viruses (Fig. 1 A). Apoptosis-susceptible Sf-21 cells were co-transfected with the TN368-derived cDNA library and vP35del viral DNA and scored for production of OV. At 8 days post-transfection, production of OV was observed in plates transfected with TN368 cDNAs, whereas cells transfected with control plasmid encoding CAT showed no signs of productive infection (Fig. 1 B, data not shown). The rescued viruses from productive infections were plaque-purified and characterized by sequence analysis. Of 25 rescued viruses, 6 contained a 2.6-kilobase cDNA encoding a gene with high homology to known IAPs and as such was designated Tn-iap1 (Fig. 2 A). Four other plaques analyzed contained a truncated cDNA encoding TnIAP1 that lacked the N-terminal 17 amino acids. The 2.6-kilobase cDNA isolated for its anti-cell death activity contained an open reading frame of 1.14 kilobases that encoded an IAP homolog very similar to the viral IAPs, Op-IAP and Cp-IAP (Fig. 2 B). Tn-IAP1 was most similar to CpIAP with 61% identity but had a longer N terminus compared with known viral IAPs (Fig. 2 B). The IAP family of genes are characterized by the presence of BIR motifs at the N-terminal end of the protein and a RING finger at the C-terminal end (14Miller L.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Whereas the number of BIR motifs present in the various IAPs varies between one and three, the anti-apoptotic baculovirus IAPs typically contain two BIRs. Tn-IAP1, although cellular in origin, like the baculovirus virus IAPs contains two N-terminal BIRs and a C-terminal RING finger. Multiple sequence alignments of the Tn-IAP1 and baculovirus IAPs showed Tn-IAP1 to be more similar to the anti-apoptotic viral IAPs (Op-IAP and Cp-IAP) than to other viral IAPs (Ac-IAP and Op-IAP1) whose function remains to be elucidated (Fig. 2 B). To confirm the anti-apoptotic activity of the open reading frame encoding Tn-IAP1, we tested it for its ability to block vP35del-induced apoptosis. Plasmid expressing Tn-iap1 open reading frame or an N-terminal 17-amino acid deletion variant of Tn-IAP1, under hsp70 promoter control, when co-expressed with vP35del viral DNA was able to complement thep35 defect in the virus and supported the production of OV at 3–4 days postinfection (Fig. 3 A). However, plasmids expressing the two BIRs or the RING or a combination of either one of the BIRs with the RING finger when co-transfected with the vP35del viral DNA did not lead to the production of OV (Fig. 3 A). These results indicate that both the BIRs and the RING finger are necessary for Tn-iap1 to block virus-induced apoptosis and promote normal replication of p35 null AcMNPV. Actinomycin D is a potent chemical inducer of apoptosis in Sf-21 cells (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). It has been shown that transient expression of Op-IAP or Cp-IAP or P35 can block ActD-induced apoptosis of Sf-21 cells. We determined whether Tn-IAP1 could similarly block ActD-induced apoptosis. Full-length Tn-IAP1 or the N-terminal deletion (FL-17) protected roughly 40% of the cells from undergoing apoptosis induced by ActD (Fig. 3 B). However, the expression of the BIRs or the RING or a combination of BIR1-RING or BIR2-RING did not block apoptosis induced by ActD (Fig. 3 B). These results show the requirement of both BIRs and RING for the activity of Tn-IAP1 against ActD-induced cell death. The requirement of both BIRs and RING for the anti-apoptotic activity of Tn-IAP1 is consistent with similar findings reported for the baculovirus IAPs, Op-IAP and Cp-IAP (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Tn-IAP1, likeDrosophila D-IAP1 and D-IAP2 and baculovirus Op-IAP and Cp-IAP, can block HID- and GRIM-induced apoptosis. To test this, Sf-21 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing HID or GRIM and the different versions of Tn-IAP1 or control CAT. Because Tn-IAP1 FL-17 was found to be as effective as FL in blocking apoptosis and because it was detected at higher levels on Western blots, we used Tn-IAP1–17 and its derivatives for further studies. Tn-IAP1 FL-17 when co-expressed with HID or GRIM was effective in reducing the induction of cell death by 4-fold compared with the CAT control (Fig. 3, C andD). We also found Tn-IAP1 FL-17 to be effective at blocking RPR-induced apoptosis in Sf-21 cells (data not shown). We further tested if the BIRs or RING domains would be sufficient for inhibiting HID- or GRIM-induced apoptosis. In contrast to their ability to block virus or ActD-induced apoptosis, constructs expressing both the BIRs or the BIR2 and RING efficiently reduced HID- and GRIM-induced apoptosis by 3–4-fold (Fig. 3, C and D). However, neither the RING finger domain nor the BIR2-deleted form of Tn-IAP1, BIR1RING, was able to block HID- or GRIM- induced apoptosis (Fig. 3, Cand D). The ability of BIRs or the BIR2RING to block the HID- and GRIM- and not virus- or ActD-induced apoptosis could be in part related to the potency of these different inducers of cell death. Expression of the BIR domains of Drosophila D-IAP1 also inhibited HID-induced apoptosis and served as a positive control (Fig. 3 C). These results show that Tn-IAP1 inhibits HID- and GRIM-induced apoptosis in Sf-21 cells. Although the ability of BIR2 alone in blocking HID- and GRIM-induced cell death remains to be determined, the deletion of BIR2 from Tn-IAP1 abrogates its anti-cell death activity. Baculovirus and Drosophila IAPs are known to physically interact with and inhibit RPR-, HID-, and GRIM-induced cell-death (19Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,21Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Harvey A.J. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10183-10188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33915-33921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To test if Tn-IAP1 might similarly interact with theseDrosophila pro-cell death proteins, we co-expressed GD-tagged GRIM with HA-epitope-tagged Tn-IAP1 constructs and determined if the two molecules physically associated. D-IAP1 served as a positive control (Fig. 4 A). The Tn-IAP1 construct Tn-IAP1–17, containing both the BIRs and RING, co-precipitated with GRIM (Fig. 4 A), HID, and RPR (data not shown). Additionally, various domains of Tn-IAP1 were tested for their interaction with GRIM. The BIRs of Tn-IAP1 and BIR2RING co-precipitated with GRIM, whereas neither the RING finger nor the construct lacking BIR2 (BIR1RING) bound to GRIM (Fig. 4, A and D). Therefore the binding profile of Tn-IAP1 and its domains correlates with their ability to block HID- and GRIM-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3,C and D). This study indicates further that the BIR2 of Tn-IAP1 is essential for its anti-apoptotic activity against GRIM and HID. In summary, we have demonstrated use of the apoptosis-inducing mutant of AcMNPV, vP35del, as a trap for cloning novel anti-cell death genes from an expression cDNA library derived from cultured insect cells. The screen used is simple and yet very powerful because of the nature of selection used. Combined with the selection is the visual production of OV that allows for independent confirmation of a productive infection. Also, because of homologous recombination and insertion of the foreign genes into the viral genome, those viruses that carry anti-cell death cDNA effectively amplify the gene from the initial pool of cDNAs. The deletion within the p35 gene adds to the stringency of the assay by preventing the production of revertant viruses and the expression of late viral genes that are required for the production of OV. The use of this genetic screen led to the identification of a novel member of the IAP family of anti-apoptotic genes. Tn-IAP1, though cellular in origin, functions like its viral counterparts and blocks apoptosis induced by virus and other cell death inducers including HID, GRIM, and RPR. The high degree of similarity between Tn-IAP1 and the viral Cp-IAP and Op-IAP suggests a cellular origin for these viral IAPs and highlights the importance of acquired host genes in evolution of baculoviruses.

First, AA is liberated from its phospholipid storage sites by the action of one or more phospholipase A2s (PLA2), and then it is used by cyclooxygenases (COX) to produce different types of prostaglandins such as PGE2(1Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar).Activation of macrophages with LPS results in a delayed generation of AA metabolites, which is accompanied by the continuous supply of fatty acid over long periods spanning several hours (2Shinohara H.

Cytosolic PLA2 activation by LPS enables the cells to synthesize and secrete another PLA2, the Group V secretory PLA2 (sPLA2).

Macrophages contain two different types of P2 receptors; P2Y and P2X7, formerly known as P2Z (5Nuttle L.C. el-Moatassim C. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 93-101PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the former are classical G-protein-coupled receptors that activate the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C pathway (6Dubyak G.R. el-Moatassim C. Am. J.

These previous reports along with the fact that LPS activation of macrophages preferentially up-regulates the P2X7 receptor (4Humphreys B.D. Dubyak G.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have led us to investigate the putative involvement of this receptor on lipid mediator production by LPS-challenged macrophages. Our results suggest a novel pathway for the regulation of AA mobilization that involves ATP as an autocrine mediator of the response.DISCUSSIONA striking hallmark of the immunoinflammatory response is the generation of oxygenated metabolites of AA such as the prostaglandins. LPS, a major constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria potently induces macrophages to synthesize and release prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators, which in vivo may lead to septic shock and death (26Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Signaling mechanisms triggered by LPS on macrophages are initiated by the interaction of the molecule with membrane CD14, in a process that involves participation of the accessory protein LBP (26Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Because CD14 does not transverse the membrane, it is not clear how the intracellular signal is initiated.Importantly, recent results have suggested that P2 purinergic receptors may be involved in some macrophage responses to LPS. Administration of 2-methylthio-ATP, a nonselective antagonist of P2 receptors, was shown to prevent death in mice treated with a lethal dose of LPS and to decrease serum levels of tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines (27Proctor R.A. Denlinger L.C. Leventhal P.S. Daugherty S.K. van de Loo J. Tanke T. Firestein G.S. Bertics P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6017-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In this study we show that P388D1 macrophages appear to express functional P2 purinergic receptors because ATP and other P2 receptor agonists are able to trigger AA release and metabolism in these cells in a manner that is blocked by the P2X7purinergic antagonists o-ATP and PPADS. Moreover these two receptor blockers have profound inhibitory effects on long term AA release and metabolism stimulated by LPS. Our data clearly suggest that P2X7 purinergic receptor antagonists can block the LPS-induced expression of Group V sPLA2 and COX-2, which leads to inhibited AA metabolism.Given the central role of both Group V sPLA2 and COX-2 in macrophage AA release and metabolism (2Shinohara H.

Importantly, the inhibition of macrophage responses to LPS by P2X7 receptor antagonists appears to be selective, because responses triggered by PAF are not affected. Collectively the current results establish that one of the striking biochemical hallmarks of macrophage activation by LPS,i.e. the generation of AA-derived mediators, is triggered by a non-LPS receptor, i.e. the purinergic receptor P2X7. These findings raise the interesting possibility that purinergic receptor antagonists could be envisioned as drugs for the treatment of pathological conditions triggered by LPS.

Thus it can be expected that in pathophysiological settings the macrophages are continuously exposed to ATP concentrations high enough to allow them to orchestrate complex cell responses, such as the induction and expression of Group V sPLA2 and COX-2.In summary, the results of this study have revealed an unexpected pathway for macrophage activation of the AA cascade by LPS.

In this study we show that P388D1 macrophages appear to express functional P2 purinergic receptors because ATP and other P2 receptor agonists are able to trigger AA release and metabolism in these cells in a manner that is blocked by the P2X7purinergic antagonists o-ATP and PPADS. Moreover these two receptor blockers have profound inhibitory effects on long term AA release and metabolism stimulated by LPS. Our data clearly suggest that P2X7 purinergic receptor antagonists can block the LPS-induced expression of Group V sPLA2 and COX-2, which leads to inhibited AA metabolism. Given the central role of both Group V sPLA2 and COX-2 in macrophage AA release and metabolism (2Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Balsinde J. Shinohara H. Lefkowitz L.J. Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25967-25970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), our results indicate that LPS-induced generation of AA-derived lipid messengers is not an immediate consequence of LPS binding to its membrane receptors (i.e. CD14) but to engagement of functional P2X7purinergic receptors on the surface of the cells. Importantly, the inhibition of macrophage responses to LPS by P2X7 receptor antagonists appears to be selective, because responses triggered by PAF are not affected. Collectively the current results establish that one of the striking biochemical hallmarks of macrophage activation by LPS,i.e. the generation of AA-derived mediators, is triggered by a non-LPS receptor, i.e. the purinergic receptor P2X7. These findings raise the interesting possibility that purinergic receptor antagonists could be envisioned as drugs for the treatment of pathological conditions triggered by LPS. In support of these observations, recent papers by Ferrari et al. (14Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Hanau S. Di Virgilio F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and Hu et al. (13Hu Y. Fisette P.L. Denlinger L.C. Guadarrama A.G. Sommer J.A. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27170-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have also suggested the involvement of P2X7 receptors in other macrophage responses to LPS such as interleukin-1β secretion and the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase. Thus it appears from these observations that an important part of the actions of LPS on macrophages may be mediated by the P2X7 receptor. Although the possibility of a direct interaction of LPS with the P2X7 receptor cannot be excluded at this time, there is no evidence at present to support such a contention. Instead, the results reported here raise the intriguing hypothesis that this receptor may serve to propagate the LPS signal by responding in an autocrine manner to the ATP that the cell itself produces in response to LPS. It is well known that macrophages secrete ATP in response to LPS (13Hu Y. Fisette P.L. Denlinger L.C. Guadarrama A.G. Sommer J.A. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. J. Biol.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and we herein demonstrate that engagement of P2X7 receptors by ATP and its derivatives, BzATP and ATPγS, triggers an AA release response that is inhibited by P2X7 receptor antagonists. In line with the observations by Ferrari et al. (14Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Hanau S. Di Virgilio F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) our results support a model whereby the ATP released by LPS to the extracellular medium may interact with the P2X7 in an autocrine manner and trigger AA release from the macrophages. At sites of inflammation, the local concentration of ATP is likely to be significant because of the presence in those foci of injured cells that can discard their cytoplasmic ATP content, usually in the 5–10 mm range (7Di Virgilio F. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus it can be expected that in pathophysiological settings the macrophages are continuously exposed to ATP concentrations high enough to allow them to orchestrate complex cell responses, such as the induction and expression of Group V sPLA2 and COX-2. In summary, the results of this study have revealed an unexpected pathway for macrophage activation of the AA cascade by LPS. Our data suggest that the P2X7 receptor participates in the LPS-initiated signaling mechanism leading to induction of Group V sPLA2 and COX-2 gene expression, and hence to the generation of AA-derived lipid mediators. Given the high levels of extracellular ATP at sites of inflammation, the current findings are likely to be of pathophysiological significance. The involvement of the P2X7 receptor in the LPS-induced AA cascade suggests alternative targets for pharmacological intervention in a number of diseases that involve an exacerbated production of AA-derived mediators, such as septic shock and chronic inflammatory states."

To test if the midline contains an activity that induces SERT, cuts were made that separated serotonergic cell bodies from the midline. SERT activity is completely lost when the midline is separated but is then rescued by bath-applied FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2), which can activate the heartless FGF receptor. heartless is expressed specifically in serotonergic neurons. A candidate FGF-like molecule was identified that is expressed in a subset of midline glia. SERT-expressing severed growth cones continue to migrate to their correct targets, which indicates that by the time SERT is activated, the serotonergic growth cones are committed to target-directed growth."

Studies utilizing both microinjection of antisense oligonucleotides and inactivation of c-mos by homologous recombination have demonstrated that Mos is required for normal oocyte meiosis, including progression from meiosis I to meiosis II and maintenance of metaphase II arrest (9Colledge W.H.

Although a role for Mos in male germ cells remains to be demonstrated, its specific expression in spermatocytes suggests that Mos may also function in spermatogenesis. Transcription of c-mos is initiated from different promoters in murine spermatocytes and oocytes, located approximately 280 and 53 base pairs upstream of the c-mos translation initiation codon, respectively (5Propst F. Rosenberg M.P. Iyer A. Kaul K. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Pal S.K. Zinkel S.S. Kiessling A.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5190-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additional sequences involved in tissue-specific regulation of c-mos have been identified within a negative regulatory region, located approximately 100 to 200 nucleotides upstream of the mouse c-mos spermatocyte promoter, that suppresses c-mos transcription in somatic cells (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Deletion of these sequences allows expression of reporter constructs driven by the c-mos promoter in transfected NIH 3T3 cells and other somatic cell types (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Further analysis by site-directed mutagenesis identified three sequence elements (designated B1, B2, and B3) within this region that functioned to repress c-mos transcription and that were conserved in the mouse, rat, and human c-mos genes (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The c-mosnegative regulatory region was further found to suppress transcription from a heterologous promoter and to function in cells of human and rat, as well as mouse, origin (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that c-mos transcription in somatic cells was suppressed by repressors that recognized conserved sequences within the c-mos negative regulatory region. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and UV cross-linking, we identified a candidate repressor protein that bound to one of the c-mos negative regulatory elements (B2) (18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutations of the B2 element both abolished protein binding and allowed transcription from the c-mos promoter in transfected somatic cells. The candidate repressor was present in nuclear extracts of several mouse cell lines and somatic tissues, as well as in HeLa cells, consistent with the general repression of c-mos in somatic cells and with the activity of the mouse c-mos negative regulatory sequence in cells of human as well as mouse origin. In contrast, nuclear extracts of testicular germ cells, in which c-mos is transcribed, formed a distinct protein complex with the c-mos negative regulatory sequence. The protein identified by binding to the c-mos B2 element thus appeared to be a strong candidate for a somatic cell repressor of c-mostranscription. In the present study, we have used the yeast one-hybrid system (19Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 20Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) to isolate molecular clones encoding this candidate repressor of c-mos transcription. Our results identify this c-mos regulatory protein as COUP-TF, an orphan member of the nuclear receptor family that has previously been shown to function as a transcriptional repressor of a variety of target genes (21Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2849) Google Scholar, 22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A yeast one-hybrid system (CLONTECH) was used to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library to identify proteins that bound to the c-mosnegative regulatory sequence. A c-mos/HIS3reporter construct was generated by inserting three tandem repeats of the c-mos 15-base pair box 2 (B2) negative regulatory element (CCAAGTTCACTGTAC) (18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in the SacI andSacII sites of the pHISi integration vector. In this vector, the HIS3 gene is expressed from a minimal promoter that allows a low level of HIS3 expression. The yeast strain YM4271 (his3,leu2) was transformed with the c-mos/HIS3 construct and transformants were selected for growth on medium lacking histidine (His− medium). A transformant that grew on His− medium but failed to grow on His− medium supplemented with 30 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT),1 added to suppress growth resulting from low level HIS3 expression from the minimal promoter, was then isolated and used as the c-mos/HIS3 reporter strain for library screening. A hybrid library in which HeLa cell cDNAs were fused to the GAL4 activation domain (CLONTECH) was then screened by transformation of the reporter strain carrying the c-mos/HIS3 construct. The library vector also contained a LEU2 selectable marker, allowing selection of all transformants on Leu− medium and of transformants expressing hybrid proteins that activated transcription of the c-mos/HIS3 reporter construct on Leu−/His−/3-AT medium. Native COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII were overexpressed using recombinant vaccinia viruses in HeLa cells (23Carter M.E. Gulick T. Moore D.D. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4360-4372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each was also overexpressed with amino-terminal polyhistidyl fusions in BL21 (DE3) bacteria using a derivative of the pET11 vector. His6-tagged proteins were purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography. Nuclear extracts were prepared from NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells as described previously (18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Purified COUP-TFs or nuclear extracts were mixed with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Radiolabeled DNA was then added and incubation was continued at room temperature for another 30 min. Samples were then electrophoresed in 5% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In competition experiments, the indicated amount of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added at the same time as the radiolabeled DNA. For supershift experiments, polyclonal antibody against COUP-TF (24Wang L.-H. Tsai S.Y. Cook R.G. Beattie W.G. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1989; 340: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) (a generous gift of Ming-Jer Tsai, Baylor College of Medicine) was mixed with nuclear extracts in the presence of poly(dI-dC) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to addition of radiolabeled DNA. Plasmids containing mouse c-mosupstream sequences linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene were previously described (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The c-mos/-746 plasmid contains a 731-base pair c-mos fragment (−16 to −746 with respect to the mouse c-mos ATG) that includes the negative regulatory sequence. The negative regulatory sequence has been deleted from the c-mos/−392 plasmid, which contains sequences from −16 to −392 with respect to the mouse c-mosATG. The c-mos/−380/DR1 plasmid was constructed from c-mos/−746 by removing the sequences upstream of theBclI site at −380 (including the negative regulatory sequence) and adding a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a single copy of the consensus COUP-TF binding sequence DR1 (CAGGTCACAGGTCAGA). NIH 3T3 cells (5 × 105 per 60-mm plate) were transfected with 5 μg of CAT plasmid DNA (CsCl gradient purified) and 15 μg of calf thymus DNA as carrier using calcium phosphate (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.8) by 3 cycles of freezing and thawing. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Extracts (50 or 100 μg of protein) were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 0.25 m Tris/HCl (pH 7.8) with acetyl-coenzyme A and [14C]chloramphenicol as substrates. The conversion of chloramphenicol to acetylated forms was assayed by thin-layer chromatography and quantified using a PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. We previously identified a 15-base pair sequence (termed box 2 or B2) as the binding site of a candidate repressor of c-mos transcription (18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To identify the candidate repressor, we used the yeast one-hybrid system (19Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 20Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) to isolate cDNA clones encoding DNA-binding proteins that specifically recognized this sequence. The reporter construct used in this screen consisted of three concatamerized copies of the 15-base pair c-mos B2 negative regulatory element inserted upstream of the HIS3 gene expressed from a low activity minimal promoter. The yeast strain YM4271 (his3,leu2) was transformed with the reporter plasmid and transformants that expressed low levels of HIS3 were selected for the ability to grow in the absence of histidine but not in the presence of 30 mm3-AT, which suppresses growth resulting from transcription from the weak HIS3 promoter. A hybrid expression library consisting of HeLa cell cDNAs fused to the GAL4 activation domain was then screened to identify proteins that bound the c-mos B2 sequence and activated HIS3 transcription from the reporter construct. The cDNA library vector also carried a LEU2selectable marker, allowing selection of all transformants on Leu− medium and double selection of transformants in whichHIS3 expression was activated on Leu−/His−/3-AT medium. From an initial screen of approximately 6 millionLEU + transformants, we isolated 200 colonies that survived the double Leu−/His−/3-AT selection. Plasmids recovered from these initial transformants were then tested by retransformation of the reporter strain, and seven were found to reproducibly induce HIS3 expression in this secondary screen. Nucleotide sequencing identified one of these 7 positive plasmids as COUP-TFI and three as COUP-TFII (22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), indicating that the COUP-TFs can bind to the c-mos B2 negative regulatory element. The specificity of this interaction is illustrated in Fig. 1. Transformation with plasmids expressing either COUP-TFI or COUP-TFII fusion proteins allowed growth of yeast carrying the c-mos/HIS3 reporter construct on Leu−/His−/3-AT selective medium, but not of yeast carrying a similar p53/HIS3 reporter construct in which four copies of the binding site for p53 were inserted upstream of HIS3. Conversely, an expression plasmid for a p53/GAL4 fusion protein activated transcription from the p53/HIS3 reporter construct but not from the c-mos/HIS3 reporter. The transcription factors COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII thus appeared to specifically recognize the 15-base pair c-mos B2 negative regulatory element, activatingHIS3 transcription when expressed as GAL4 fusions in the yeast one-hybrid system. The COUP-TFs bind as homodimers to paired nuclear receptor hexamer-binding sites (A/G)G(G/T)TCA (22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 25Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 26Nakshatri H. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 890-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The highest affinity and most common motif among identified COUP-TF regulatory site targets is a direct repeat of the hexamer AGGTCA with single base pair spacing (DR1). However, the COUP-TFs exhibit relatively promiscuous binding and function on paired hexamers arranged as direct, inverted, or everted repeats with different spacing (25Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), in contrast to other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily whose functional specificity is largely determined by hexamer spacing and orientation (21Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2849) Google Scholar). Within the c-mos B2 negative regulatory element, we identified a candidate nuclear receptor hexamer-binding site AGTTCA. This is separated by 1-base pair from a second inverted hexamer AGTACA, which deviates from consensus by a single residue at the permissive fourth position (Fig. 2). Based on the yeast one-hybrid results, this sequence appeared likely to represent a COUP-TF-binding site within the c-mos negative regulatory element. Consistent with this, mutations of the c-mos negative regulatory element that had previously been shown to abrogate binding of the candidate repressor detected in somatic cell extracts and to allow expression of c-mos promoter constructs in transfection assays in NIH 3T3 cells (mutants 7180, 7777, and 7777A) (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) destroyed one or both of these COUP-TF half-sites (Fig. 2). To further characterize COUP-TF binding to the c-mosregulatory sequence, we compared purified COUP-TFs with proteins present in nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells in electrophoretic mobility shift assays using both the c-mosnegative regulatory element and the previously defined COUP-TF-binding sites DR1 and NRRE-1 (Fig. 2) as probes. The purified COUP-TFs formed complexes of similar electrophoretic mobility with both the DR1 and NRRE-1 COUP-TF-binding sites and with the c-mos negative regulatory element B2 probe (Fig. 3). In addition, nuclear extracts of both NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells formed complexes of similar electrophoretic mobility with the c-mosB2, DR1, and NRRE-1 probes. As expected, neither purified COUP-TFI nor NIH 3T3 nuclear extract exhibited significant binding to a probe consisting of only a single nuclear receptor half-site. The specificity of COUP-TF binding to the c-mos negative regulatory element was further tested by competition experiments (Fig. 4). Both purified COUP-TFII and nuclear extract from NIH 3T3 cells formed similar complexes with B2 probe of the c-mos negative regulatory element. In both cases, binding was competed by an excess of unlabeled probe corresponding either to the c-mos B2 sequence or to the DR1 COUP-TF-binding site. In contrast, binding was not affected by an unrelated competitor corresponding to the binding site of a distinct transcription factor, LSF (27Huang H.-C. Sundseth R. Hansen U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that DR1 was a more effective competitor than the c-mos B2 sequence for both purified COUP-TFII and NIH 3T3 nuclear extract. This is consistent with the higher affinities of COUP-TFs for the consensus DR1 elements as opposed to inverted sequences, such as that present in the c-mos B2 sequence (22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 25Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The results above not only indicate that COUP-TFs bind to the c-mos B2 negative regulatory element, but also that COUP-TF complexes with the c-mos probe comigrate with complexes formed with proteins detected in nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells. This is consistent not only with COUP-TFs being able to bind to the c-mos negative regulatory element, but also with the hypothesis that COUP-TFs correspond to the candidate repressor previously identified in these somatic cell extracts. To further test this hypothesis, we used antibody against COUP-TFs in supershift experiments (Fig. 5). Addition of COUP-TF antibody (which recognizes both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII) supershifted the complex formed between nuclear extract of NIH 3T3 cells and probes corresponding to either the 15-base pair B2 element of the c-mos negative regulatory sequence or to the entire 111-base pair c-mos negative regulatory sequence (411 probe) originally defined by deletion analysis (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As expected, no protein binding was detected to a 111-base pair c-mos probe containing the 7180 mutation, which destroys the COUP-TF-binding site (see Fig. 2). Antibody against COUP-TF thus recognizes the c-mos negative regulatory element-binding protein detected in somatic cell nuclear extracts, identifying this candidate repressor of c-mos transcription as COUP-TF. Previous studies defined three functional elements (designated B1, B2, and B3) within the 111-base pair c-mos negative regulatory region (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutations affecting the previously defined B2 element destroy one or both of the consensus nuclear receptor-binding sites (see Fig. 2) and allow expression of c-mos promoter/CAT constructs in transfection assays in NIH 3T3 cells (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that the COUP-TF-binding site is one of the functional elements within the c-mos negative regulatory sequence. To further determine whether a consensus COUP-TF-binding site can functionally replace the B2 negative regulatory element, we investigated the activity of c-mos promoter constructs in which a consensus DR1 COUP-TF-binding site was substituted for the normal c-mos negative regulatory sequences (Fig. 6). In these experiments, the entire c-mos negative regulatory region (including B1, B2, and B3 sequences) was deleted in the c-mos/−392 construct, and replaced with a consensus DR1 COUP-TF-binding site in the c-mos/−380/DR1 plasmid. Addition of a COUP-TF-binding site to this truncated promoter in the c-mos/−380/DR1 construct resulted in a 2–3-fold reduction in CAT expression, to a level about twice that obtained with the full-length c-mos/−746 promoter. The complete negative regulatory sequence contained within the c-mos/−746 construct includes the B1 and B3 elements in addition to B2, and the partial repression obtained with the c-mos/−380/DR1 construct is similar to that seen with other constructs containing only the B2 element (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It thus appears that a consensus COUP-TF-binding site can functionally substitute for the c-mos B2 negative regulatory element, further indicating that COUP-TF can repress c-mos transcription in transfected somatic cells. The specific expression of the c-mos proto-oncogene in male and female germ cells provides a novel example of tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. Because aberrant expression of c-mos in somatic cells results in either oncogenic transformation or cell death (15Sagata N. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 28Papkoff J. Verma I.M. Hunter T. Cell. 1982; 29: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Oskarsson M. McClements W.L. Blair D.G. Maizel J.V. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1980; 207: 1222-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the normal transcriptional silencing of c-mos is a critical aspect of its control. Previous studies delineated 3 negative regulatory elements (designated B1, B2, and B3) within a 111-base pair region upstream of the c-mos spermatocyte promoter (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and identified a candidate repressor that bound to the B2 element, suppressing c-mostranscription in somatic cells (18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified this somatic cell repressor of c-mostranscription as the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF. Mice and humans encode two closely related members of the COUP-TF family, designated COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII (22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We initially isolated clones of both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII, which have indistinguishable DNA-binding specificities (22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), in a yeast one-hybrid screen for proteins that bound to the c-mos B2 negative regulatory element. A COUP-TF-binding site was then identified within this element. Notably, the complexes formed between purified COUP-TFs and the c-mos B2 probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays comigrated with those formed using whole nuclear extracts of NIH 3T3 or HeLa cells, suggesting that COUP-TF was the candidate repressor previously detected in extracts of these somatic cells (18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The identity of the candidate repressor previously detected in NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells as COUP-TF was then established by demonstrating that antibody against COUP-TFs supershifted the complex formed between the c-mos B2 probe and NIH 3T3 or HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Consistent with the role of COUP-TF as a transcriptional repressor, mutations of the B2 element that destroyed the COUP-TF-binding site allowed expression from the c-mos promoter in transfected somatic cells (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Xu W. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5369-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Conversely, substitution of a consensus COUP-TF-binding site in place of the c-mos negative regulatory element suppressed expression from the c-mospromoter. It thus appears that COUP-TF can bind to one of the negative regulatory elements of the c-mos promoter and contribute to repression of c-mos transcription in somatic cells. Additional proteins that bind to the B1 and B3 elements of the c-mos negative regulatory region (17Zinkel S.S. Pal S.K. Szeberenyi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as well as theCux/CDP homeodomain protein, which binds to an enhancer in the rat c-mos locus (30Higgy N.A. Tarnasky H.A. Valarche I. Nepveu A. Van der Hoorn F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), may also contribute to repression of c-mos in somatic cells. The identification of COUP-TFs as somatic cell repressors of c-mos is consistent with several known properties of these proteins. COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII are closely related proteins that bind DNA as homodimers and repress transcription of a variety of target genes (21Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2849) Google Scholar, 22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 31Shibata H. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, the COUP-TFs can form heterodimers with the common nuclear receptor partner protein retinoid X receptor, thereby indirectly modulating the activities of other members of the nuclear receptor family, such as retinoic acid receptors and thyroid hormone receptors (22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII are expressed in a wide variety of mouse cells and tissues (22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 32Pereira F.A. Qiu Y. Tsai M.-J. Tsai S.Y. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Jonk L.J.C. de Jonge M.E.J. Pals C.E.G.M. Wissink S. Vervaart J.M.A. Schoorlemmer J. Kruijer W. Mech. Devel. 1994; 47: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), consistent with the general repression of c-mos in somatic cells. Inactivation of the genes encoding COUP-TFI or COUP-TFII leads to perinatal or early embryonic death, respectively, indicating that the two COUP-TFs have essential nonredundant roles in early development (22Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 34Qiu Y. Pereira F.A. DeMayo F.J. Lydon J.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the physiologically critical target genes regulated by COUP-TFs have not been identified. Given the lethal consequences of unregulated c-mos expression, repression of c-mosmay be one of these critical functions of COUP-TFs. Although COUP-TFs were the only nuclear receptors detected in our yeast one-hybrid screen of HeLa cell cDNAs, the identification of a COUP-TF-binding site in the c-mos promoter raises the possibility that other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily may also recognize this element. In this regard, it is noteworthy that another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF), is specifically expressed in the germ cells of male and female adult mice (35Bauer U.-M. Schneider-Hirsch S. Reinhardt S. Benavente R. Maelicke A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 208: 208-214Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Chen F. Cooney A.J. Wang Y. Law S.W. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1434-1444PubMed Google Scholar, 37Katz D. Niederberger C. Slaughter G.R. Cooney A.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4364-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GCNF has therefore been suggested to function in germ cell development by regulating the expression of germ cell-specific genes, and the mouse protamine genes have been identified as candidate GCNF targets (38Hummelke G.C. Meistrich M.L. Cooney A.J. Mol. Repro. Dev. 1998; 50: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). GCNF shares a DNA-binding domain P box structure with COUP-TF, dictating binding to similar hexamer sequences. Although the recognized GCNF targets have DR0 type motifs, it is possible that this factor also binds the c-mos B2 element. If this is the case, GCNF may play a positive role in activating c-mos expression in germ cells, while COUP-TF represses c-mos in somatic cells. We are grateful to Ming-Jer Tsai for antibody against COUP-TFs."
