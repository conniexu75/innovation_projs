https://openalex.org/W1916572066,"While CRISPR/Cas9 technology has proven to be a valuable system to generate gene-targeted modified animals in several species, this tool has been scarcely reported in farm animals. Myostatin is encoded by MSTN gene involved in the inhibition of muscle differentiation and growth. We determined the efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit MSTN in sheep and generate knock-out (KO) animals with the aim to promote muscle development and body growth. We generated CRISPR/Cas9 mRNAs specific for ovine MSTN and microinjected them into the cytoplasm of ovine zygotes. When embryo development of CRISPR/Cas9 microinjected zygotes (n = 216) was compared with buffer injected embryos (n = 183) and non microinjected embryos (n = 173), cleavage rate was lower for both microinjected groups (P<0.05) and neither was affected by CRISPR/Cas9 content in the injected medium. Embryo development to blastocyst was not affected by microinjection and was similar among the experimental groups. From 20 embryos analyzed by Sanger sequencing, ten were mutant (heterozygous or mosaic; 50% efficiency). To obtain live MSTN KO lambs, 53 blastocysts produced after zygote CRISPR/Cas9 microinjection were transferred to 29 recipient females resulting in 65.5% (19/29) of pregnant ewes and 41.5% (22/53) of newborns. From 22 born lambs analyzed by T7EI and Sanger sequencing, ten showed indel mutations at MSTN gene. Eight showed mutations in both alleles and five of them were homozygous for indels generating out-of frame mutations that resulted in premature stop codons. Western blot analysis of homozygous KO founders confirmed the absence of myostatin, showing heavier body weight than wild type counterparts. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 system was a very efficient tool to generate gene KO sheep. This technology is quick and easy to perform and less expensive than previous techniques, and can be applied to obtain genetically modified animal models of interest for biomedicine and livestock."

The current study investigated the potential of curcumin to reduce breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) population for sensitizing breast cancer cells to mitomycin C (MMC) both in vitro and in vivo. Curcumin improved the sensitivity of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and doxorubicin in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, as shown by the more than 2-fold decrease in the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of these chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, curcumin sensitized the BCSCs of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 to MMC by 5- and 15-fold, respectively. The BCSCs could not grow to the fifth generation in the presence of curcumin and MMC. MMC or curcumin alone only marginally reduced the BCSC population in the mammospheres; however, together, they reduced the BCSC population in CD44+CD24-/low cells by more than 75% (29.34% to 6.86%). Curcumin sensitized BCSCs through a reduction in the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG2 and ABCC1. We demonstrated that fumitremorgin C, a selective ABCG2 inhibitor, reduced BCSC survival to a similar degree as curcumin did. Curcumin sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs by reducing the BCSC population mainly through a reduction in the expression of ABCG2."
https://openalex.org/W1929186871,"Brown adipocytes function to dissipate energy as heat through adaptive thermogenesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the brown fat thermogenic program may provide insights for the development of therapeutic approaches in the treatment of obesity. Most studies investigating the mechanisms underlying brown fat development focus on genetic mechanisms; little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms in this process. We have discovered that ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat on chromosome X (UTX), a histone demethylase for di- or tri-methylated histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3), plays a potential role in regulating brown adipocyte thermogenic program. We found that UTX is up-regulated during brown adipocyte differentiation and by cold exposure in both brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice, suggesting a potential role in thermogenesis. Inactivation of UTX down-regulates brown fat specific gene expression, while overexpression of UTX does the opposite. Notably, activation of β adrenergic signaling recruits UTX to the UCP1 and PGC1α promoters, leading to decreased H3K27me3, a histone transcriptional repressive mark. UTX demethylates H3K27me3 and subsequently interacts with the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) protein CBP, resulting in increased H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), a histone transcriptional active mark. UTX positively regulate brown adipocyte thermogenic program through coordinated control of demethylating H3K27me3 and acetylating H3K27, switching the transcriptional repressive state to the transcriptional active state at the promoters of UCP1 and PGC1α. We conclude that UTX may play a potential role in regulation of brown adipocyte gene expression and may mediate β adrenergic activation of brown fat function."
https://openalex.org/W1536696269,"Cell membrane repair is an important aspect of physiology, and disruption of this process can result in pathophysiology in a number of different tissues, including wound healing, chronic ulcer and scarring. We have previously identified a novel tripartite motif family protein, MG53, as an essential component of the cell membrane repair machinery. Here we report the functional role of MG53 in the modulation of wound healing and scarring. Although MG53 is absent from keratinocytes and fibroblasts, remarkable defects in skin architecture and collagen overproduction are observed in mg53−/− mice, and these animals display delayed wound healing and abnormal scarring. Recombinant human MG53 (rhMG53) protein, encapsulated in a hydrogel formulation, facilitates wound healing and prevents scarring in rodent models of dermal injuries. An in vitro study shows that rhMG53 protects against acute injury to keratinocytes and facilitates the migration of fibroblasts in response to scratch wounding. During fibrotic remodeling, rhMG53 interferes with TGF-β-dependent activation of myofibroblast differentiation. The resulting down-regulation of α smooth muscle actin and extracellular matrix proteins contributes to reduced scarring. Overall, these studies establish a trifunctional role for MG53 as a facilitator of rapid injury repair, a mediator of cell migration, and a modulator of myofibroblast differentiation during wound healing. Targeting the functional interaction between MG53 and TGF-β signaling may present a potentially effective means for promoting scarless wound healing.

https://openalex.org/W2121675683,"Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become a concept commonly used in the related research. Using the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire for Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), this study evaluated the Quality of Life (QOL) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Zhejiang province, China, and assessed the influences of demographic, laboratory and disease-related variables on QOL. This cross-sectional study was conducted among PLWHA aged ≥ 18 years in Taizhou municipality, Zhejiang province, China, between August 1 and October 31, 2014. A multiple linear regression model was used to analyze the influential factors. Of 403 subjects, 72.48% were male, 72.46% had received a high- school or above education, 94.79% were of Han ethnicity, and 65.51% were non farmers. The total score of QOL was 15.99±1.99. The scores of QOL in physiological, psychological, social relation, and environmental domains were 14.99 ±2.25, 14.25 ±2.12, 13.22 ±2.37, and 13.31 ±1.99 respectively. Except the total score of QOL and the score of environmental domain (p<0.05), the scores in other domains had no significant difference with the results of the national norm level. The multiple linear regression model identified the physical domain related factors to be age (β = -0.045), CD4 count (β = 0.002), and ART adherence(β = 1.231). And it also showed that psychological domain related factors included CD4 count (β = 0.002) and WHO clinical stage (β = -0.437); social domain related factors included WHO clinical stage (β = -0.704) and ART adherence (β = 1.177); while environmental domain related factors included WHO clinical stage (β = -0.538), educational status(β = 0.549) and ART adherence(β = 1.078).Those who are young, with higher level of education, higher CD4 count and good access and adherence of ART, are likely to have better QOL among PLWHA in Zhejiang province. This suggests that in addition to ART, many other factors should be taken into consideration to improve the QOL of PLWHA. The relatively lower scores the subjects received in social relation and environmental domains also suggest that social relation and environmental interventions need to be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W1873700786,"A family of enzymes collectively referred to as carotenoid cleavage oxygenases is responsible for oxidative conversion of carotenoids into apocarotenoids, including retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives). A member of this family, the β-carotene 9,10-dioxygenase (BCO2), converts xanthophylls to rosafluene and ionones. Animals deficient in BCO2 highlight the critical role of the enzyme in carotenoid clearance as accumulation of these compounds occur in tissues. Inactivation of the enzyme by a four-amino acid-long insertion has recently been proposed to underlie xanthophyll concentration in the macula of the primate retina. Here, we focused on comparing the properties of primate and murine BCO2s. We demonstrate that the enzymes display a conserved structural fold and subcellular localization. Low temperature expression and detergent choice significantly affected binding and turnover rates of the recombinant enzymes with various xanthophyll substrates, including the unique macula pigment meso-zeaxanthin. Mice with genetically disrupted carotenoid cleavage oxygenases displayed adipose tissue rather than eye-specific accumulation of supplemented carotenoids. Studies in a human hepatic cell line revealed that BCO2 is expressed as an oxidative stress-induced gene. Our studies provide evidence that the enzymatic function of BCO2 is conserved in primates and link regulation of BCO2 gene expression with oxidative stress that can be caused by excessive carotenoid supplementation.

Carotenoids, a class of isoprenoid lipids, affect a rich variety of physiological functions in nature and are crucial for human health (1Moise A.R. Al-Babili S. Wurtzel E.T. Mechanistic aspects of carotenoid biosynthesis.Chem. Rev. 2014; 114: 164-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For instance, the carotenoids zeaxanthin, lutein, and meso-zeaxanthin accumulate in high concentrations in the primate retina (2Bone R.A. Landrum J.T. Fernandez L. Tarsis S.L. Analysis of the macular pigment by HPLC: retinal distribution and age study.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Certain carotenoids also are the major dietary source for retinoids, which encompass all derivatives of vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) (3Sommer A. Vyas K.S. A global clinical view on vitamin A and carotenoids.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2012; 96: 1204S-1206SCrossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These carotenoid derivatives exert vital physiological functions as visual chromophore (11-cis-retinal) (4Palczewski K. G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 743-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) and vitamin A hormone (all-trans-retinoic acid) (5Chambon P.

There is interest to enhance macular pigment levels because of emerging evidence that these compounds are beneficial to eye health (6Krinsky N.I. Johnson E.J. Carotenoid actions and their relation to health and disease.Mol. Aspects Med. 2005; 26: 459-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). In general, a relatively linear increment of xanthophyll plasma levels is achieved during supplementation and that eventually reaches a plateau. Additionally, the density and concentration of macular carotenoids vary more than 10-fold among individuals (7Bhosale P. Zhao da Y. Bernstein P.S. HPLC measurement of ocular carotenoid levels in human donor eyes in the lutein supplementation era.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2007; 48: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, plasma and tissue levels of xanthophylls may decline in certain disease states that are associated with oxidative stress such as cardiovascular disease and certain forms of cancer (6Krinsky N.I. Johnson E.J. Carotenoid actions and their relation to health and disease.Mol. Aspects Med. 2005; 26: 459-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) that controls plasma and tissue levels of these compounds remains to be defined. Genetic studies in animals suggest that the β-carotene 9,10-dioxygenase (BCO2) plays a critical role in controlling carotenoid tissue levels and preventing excess accumulation of these compounds. Eriksson et al. (8Eriksson J. Larson G. Gunnarsson U. Bed'hom B. Tixier-Boichard M. Strömstedt L. Wright D. Jungerius A. Vereijken A. Randi E. Jensen P. Andersson L. Identification of the yellow skin gene reveals a hybrid origin of the domestic chicken.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4e1000010Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) associated the yellow skin (carotenoids) in domesticated chickens with regulatory mutations that inhibit expression of the BCO2 enzyme in skin. In sheep, the yellow fat phenotype is caused by mutations in the BCO2 gene, and a null mutation in the bovine BCO2 gene causes a change in the β-carotene content in the cow's milk (9Våge D.I. Boman I.A. A nonsense mutation in the β-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2) gene is tightly associated with accumulation of carotenoids in adipose tissue in sheep (Ovis aries).BMC Genet. 2010; 11: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Berry S.D.

Snell R.G. Mutation in bovine β-carotene oxygenase 2 affects milk color.Genetics. 2009; 182: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, genetic disruption of BCO2 function in mice results in increased plasma and blood accumulation of these dietary pigments. Prolonged carotenoid supplementation of Bco2 knock-out mice caused oxidative stress in tissues and the induction of stress-associated signaling pathways. In wild-type animals, a 7-fold increase in Bco2 mRNA expression averted this scenario (11Amengual J. Lobo G.P. Golczak M. Li H.N. Klimova T. Hoppel C.L. Wyss A. Palczewski K. von Lintig J. A mitochondrial enzyme degrades carotenoids and protects against oxidative stress.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 948-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For humans, conflicting results are reported in the literature on whether the function of BCO2 was conserved during evolution (12Li B. Vachali P.P. Gorusupudi A. Shen Z. Sharifzadeh H. Besch B.M. Nelson K. Horvath M.M. Frederick J.M. Baehr W. Bernstein P.S. Inactivity of human β,β-carotene-9′,10′-dioxygenase (BCO2) underlies retinal accumulation of the human macular carotenoid pigment.Proc.

Evidence for compartmentalization of mammalian carotenoid metabolism.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 4457-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A major drawback of a rigorous biochemical analysis of this enzyme is the lack of methodology allowing for expression of recombinant BCO2s in active forms. Additionally, little is known about the regulation of BCO2 gene expression, although the protein is differentially expressed in various human tissues (14Lindqvist A. He Y.G. Andersson S. Cell type-specific expression of β-carotene 9′,10′-monooxygenase in human tissues.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hence, we have established novel methods and tools to enzymatically characterize BCO2s from different mammalian species. Additionally, we utilized human cell lines and mouse models, respectively, to study the transcriptional regulation and function of this protein in carotenoid homeostasis of blood and tissues. The picture that emerges verifies the critical role that BCO2s play in this process and indicates that oxidative stress in chronic disease induces BCO2 and carotenoid breakdown in tissues and blood. All protein models were prepared through the fully automated protein structure homology-modeling server SWISS-MODEL using retinal pigment epithelium protein of 65 kDa (RPE65) (Protein Data Bank code 4F2Z) as their template (15Biasini M.

Total RNA was isolated from ∼50 mg of fixed tissue using the RNAeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and stored at −80 °C. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR for Long Templates system. This cDNA library was used to amplify truncated macaque BCO2 with the following primers: 5′-GCC ATC TTT GGG CAG TGT CGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTA GAT GGG TAT GAA GGT ACC ATG G-3′ (reverse). This set of primers included the addition of a stop codon. To amplify full-length macaque BCO2 (MaBCO2) cDNA encoding the NP_001271880 variant of MaBCO2 with an N-terminal extension, the following PCR was carried out using the forward primer 5′-AAG GAG GAA TAA ACC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAT GGG TAT GAA GGT ACC ATG GAA TCC-3′. The amplified macaque BCO2 cDNAs were then cloned in-frame into pBAD TOPO TA (Invitrogen) for bacterial expression and pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (Invitrogen) for eukaryote expression. All PCRs were carried out with the Expanded High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). All plasmid constructs were verified by sequence analysis (Genomics Core Sequencing Facility, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transiently transfected with corresponding vectors carrying the various amplified BCO2 cDNA isoforms of murine, human, and macaque. All transfections and immunofluorescence were performed as described previously (13Palczewski G. Amengual J. Hoppel C.L. von Lintig J. Evidence for compartmentalization of mammalian carotenoid metabolism.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 4457-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and 10 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For immunofluorescence, HepG2 cells were grown on polylysine-treated glass coverslips to 50–70% confluence and then transfected with purified plasmid DNA using X-tremeGENE HP (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent. 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in a solution of 10% formalin phosphate in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4; PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Afterward, cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Roche Applied Science) in PBS (PBS-T) and blocked with 10% bovine albumin and 5% goat serum (Sigma Life Science) in PBS-T (blocking buffer). Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing a mouse anti-V5 serum (to detect BCO2; Invitrogen) and rabbit anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV serum (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA) diluted 1:200. Then cells were washed and incubated at room temperature with anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 and Alexa Flour 488 (Life Technologies), respectively, diluted 1:400 in blocking buffer. DAPI was used to stain nuclei. Confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Jena, Germany) by using a multiline argon laser (excitation, 488 and 594 nm) or a 405 diode laser (excitation, 405 nm) with a 63× C-Apochromat (numerical aperture, 1.2; oil objective). Protein expression was performed as described (18Kiefer C. Hessel S. Lampert J.M. Vogt K. Lederer M.O. Breithaupt D.E. von Lintig J.

BL21(DE3) competent Escherichia coli (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) were transformed with the expression vectors for full-length and truncated macaque BCO2 as described above. These bacterial cells were also transformed with the expression vectors for murine BCO2 as reported previously (1Moise A.R. Al-Babili S. Wurtzel E.T. Mechanistic aspects of carotenoid biosynthesis.Chem. Rev. 2014; 114: 164-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown at room temperature with constant shaking at 200 rpm until an A600 of 0.4 was reached. Protein expression was induced with l-arabinose at a final concentration of 0.02%. At the point of induction, FeSO4 and ascorbic acid were added to a final concentration of 5 μm and 10 mm, respectively, and the temperature was decreased to 10 °C. Protein expression was allowed to proceed for 2 days, cells were then collected by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 15 min, and cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until needed or immediately submitted for in vitro enzyme assays. Cell pellets obtained from the procedure as described above were thawed on ice. Cells pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP/HCl) (Hampton Research) and one cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) at 4 ml/g. Lysis was performed by three passages on a cold French press while collecting lysates on iced tubes. The cell lysate was then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, transferred to 50-ml tubes, and kept on ice. Then it was loaded onto a 10-ml column containing 1.5 ml of Talon Co2+-resin suspension (Clontech) pre-equilibrated with 5 column volumes of ice cold buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, and 1 mm TCEP. After flow-through collection, the Talon column was first washed with 5 column volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, and 1 mm TCEP and then with 5 column volumes of buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 1 mm TCEP, and 1 mm imidazole. Finally, BCO2 was eluted in ice-cold buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 1 mm TCEP, and either 5 or 50 mm imidazole. Eluted BCO2 fractions were pooled and concentrated in a 30,000-molecular weight cutoff Amicon® Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Millipore) before being loaded onto a SuperdexTM 200 10/300 GL size exclusion column (GE Healthcare). Enzyme fractions were eluted from the column in 0.5-ml fractions at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, and 1 mm TCEP. Fractions containing purified enzyme were then pooled, concentrated to desired concentrations in a 30,000-molecular weight cutoff Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter and stored on ice until further use. Western blotting of this purified enzyme at varying concentrations was run concurrently with Talon Co2+- purified murine and primate BCO2s for quantification. Quantification of expressed BCO2 protein was performed using ImageJ and the known concentrations of the purified standards as well as with Bradford (53Bradford M.M.

Lysing reagent was prepared by combining 50 ml of B-PER Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Life Technologies) with one protease inhibitor cOmplete ULTRA Mini EDTA-free tablet and final concentrations of 2 mm ascorbic acid solution (Sigma Life Science), 1 mm TCEP (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), and 20 units of recombinant, RNase-free DNase I. To lyse cells and solubilize recombinant proteins, 4 ml of lysing reagent/g of bacterial pellet was used. Cell pellets were gently vortexed with lysing reagent and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. The cell lysate was then cooled on ice and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min for the purpose of Western blotting analysis. For enzymatic activity assays, whole cell lysates were used, and assays were carried out as previously described (19Lindqvist A. Andersson S.

This mixture (substrate) was then dried in an Eppendorf Vacufuge plus. To the substrate, 100 μl of cell lysate was added, vortexed vigorously for 20 s, and placed on an Eppendorf thermal shaker for 15 min at 300 rpm. Control assays were performed with uninduced E. coli cell pellet lysates. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of water and 400 μl of acetone. Lipids were extracted by adding 400 μl of diethyl ether and 100 μl of petroleum ether, vortexed (3 × 10-s period), and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min. Finally, the resulting organic phase was collected. The extraction was performed twice, and the collected organic phase was dried by Vacufuge. Dried supernatant was redissolved in mobile phase (90:10 hexane:ethyl acetate) and subjected to either HPLC or LC-MS analysis. HPLC analysis was carried out with an Agilent 1260 Infinity Quaternary HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a pump (G1312C) with an integrated degasser (G1322A), a thermostat column compartment (G1316A), an autosampler (G1329B), a diode array detector (G1315D), and online analysis software (Chemstation). The analyses were carried out at 25 °C using a normal phase Zorbax SIL (5 μm; 4.6 × 150 mm) column (Agilent Technologies) protected with a guard column with the same stationary phase. Carotenoid and apocarotenoid separation was achieved using an isocratic composition of 70:30 (v/v) hexane:ethyl acetate. For β-carotene and xanthophyll separation from animal tissues, a step gradient of 1% ethyl acetate in hexane over 5 min followed by 10 min with 10% ethyl acetate in hexane and then 18 min with 30% ethyl acetate in hexane was used. The flow rate for all systems was 1.4 ml/min. Detection of carotenoids and apocarotenoids was performed at 420-nm wavelength. For LC-MS analyses, the eluate was directed into an LXQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) through an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source working in the positive mode. To ensure optimal sensitivity, the instrument was tuned with zeaxanthin as well as apocarotenoids. Identification of BCO2 cleavage products was based on retention time, mass, and spectral characteristics compared with those of a known standard, 10′-β-apocarotenal (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany), and previously published reports (21Amengual J.

Animal procedures and experiments were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Animal Care Committee and conformed to recommendations of both the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Animal experiments were carried out using β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase (Bco1) knock-out, Bco2−/−, and Bco1−/−/Bco2−/− double knock-out (DKO) mice with a C56/BL6; 129Sv mixed genetic background. Feeding experiments were performed as described previously (23Widjaja-Adhi M.A. Lobo G.P. Golczak M. Von Lintig J.

In all experiments, mice were maintained at 24 °C in a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and had free access to food and water. During the breeding and weaning periods (up to 5 weeks of age), mice were maintained on breeder chow containing ∼29,000 IU vitamin A/kg of diet (Prolab RMH 3000, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO). After 5 weeks of age, mice were fed with an experimental diet containing a mixture of β-carotene and zeaxanthin (25 and 75 mg/kg of diet for each carotenoid, respectively) for 10 weeks. The diet contained no other source of vitamin A except for β-carotene. After 10 weeks of dietary intervention, mice were fasted overnight and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture containing 15 mg of ketamine, 3 mg of xylazine, 0.5 mg of acepromazine, and sterile water or saline at a dose of 0.2 ml/25 g of mouse body weight. Blood was drawn directly from the heart by cardiac puncture under deep anesthesia. Mice were then perfused with 20 ml of PBS, pH 7.3 and killed by cervical dislocation for further tissue collection. Carotenoids were extracted from tissues of mice (n = 5 per genotype and diet) under a dim red safety light (600 nm) and quantified by HPLC as described previously (23Widjaja-Adhi M.A. Lobo G.P.

The organic phase was removed, and the extraction was repeated with an additional 500 μl of hexanes. After centrifugation, organic layers were collected, pooled, dried in a Vacufuge at 30 °C, and redissolved in HPLC mobile phase solvent. For saponification, gonadal white adipose tissues were homogenized in 200 μl of 30% KOH in water and then incubated with 100 μl of 12% pyrogallol (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol and 1 ml of ethanol for 1 h at 60 °C. After saponification, 2 ml of ethanol and 2 ml of H2O were added, and samples were extracted twice with 3 ml of diethyl ether:hexane (2:1; stabilized with 1% ethanol). The organic layers were collected, pooled, and evaporated in a Vacufuge until nearly dry. The second extraction solution was then added to the nearly dry solution. The extraction solution was composed of 200 μl of water, 200 μl of methanol, 400 μl of acetone, 250 μl of diethyl ether, and 400 μl of hexane. The organic phase was then removed, and the extraction was repeated with 500 μl of hexanes. After centrifugation, organic layers were collected, pooled, dried in a Vacufuge at 30 °C, and redissolved in corresponding HPLC mobile phase solvent. HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and 10 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were grown in polylysine-treated dishes until 50–70% confluence. To measure relative BCO2 levels, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated in 5 mm hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 5 min. Then cells were washed in DMEM to remove excess hydrogen peroxide. Cells were then maintained in DMEM and 1 μm zeaxanthin, 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide in DMEM, or 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide in DMEM for 4 h. Media were then aspirated, and RNA was collected using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). RNA was transcribed to cDNA using a High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Life Technologies). This cDNA was then used for quantitative real time PCR using TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies) and GAPDH (control) and BCO2 probes (Life Technologies) as described previously (13Palczewski G.

Measurements in relative levels of BCO2 mRNA levels were normalized to levels of GAPDH and were taken as biological duplicates and technical quadruplets. Besides BCO2, the human genome encodes two other carotenoid cleavage oxygenase (CCO) family members, RPE65 and BCO1, both of which are critical for human retinoid metabolism (24Lobo G.P. Amengual J.

https://openalex.org/W1171988806,"Healthy walking is characterized by pronounced arm swing and axial rotation. Aging effects on gait speed, stride length and stride time variability have been previously reported, however, less is known about aging effects on arm swing and axial rotation and their relationship to age-associated gait changes during usual walking and during more challenging conditions like dual tasking. Sixty healthy adults between the ages of 30-77 were included in this study designed to address this gap. Lightweight body fixed sensors were placed on each wrist and lower back. Participants walked under 3 walking conditions each of 1 minute: 1) comfortable speed, 2) walking while serially subtracting 3's (Dual Task), 3) walking at fast speed. Aging effects on arm swing amplitude, range, symmetry, jerk and axial rotation amplitude and jerk were compared between decades of age (30-40; 41-50; 51-60; 61-77 years). As expected, older adults walked slower (p = 0.03) and with increased stride variability (p = 0.02). Arm swing amplitude decreased with age under all conditions (p = 0.04). In the oldest group, arm swing decreased during dual task and increased during the fast walking condition (p<0.0001). Similarly, arm swing asymmetry increased during the dual task in the older groups (p<0.004), but not in the younger groups (p = 0.67). Significant differences between groups and within conditions were observed in arm swing jerk (p<0.02), axial rotation amplitude (p<0.02) and axial jerk (p<0.001). Gait speed, arm swing amplitude of the dominant arm, arm swing asymmetry and axial rotation jerk were all independent predictors of age in a multivariate model. These findings suggest that the effects of gait speed and dual tasking on arm swing and axial rotation during walking are altered among healthy older adults. Follow-up work is needed to examine if these effects contribute to reduced stability in aging."
https://openalex.org/W1891956616,"Single-cell sequencing, which is used to detect clinically important tumor subpopulations, is necessary for understanding tumor heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed transcriptomic data obtained from 34 single cells from human lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). To focus on the intrinsic transcriptomic signatures of these tumors, we filtered out genes that displayed extensive expression changes following xenografting and cell culture. Then, we performed clustering analysis using co-regulated gene modules rather than individual genes to minimize read drop-out errors associated with single-cell sequencing. This combined approach revealed two distinct intra-tumoral subgroups that were primarily distinguished by the gene module G64. The G64 module was predominantly composed of cell-cycle genes. E2F1 was found to be the transcription factor that most likely mediates the expression of the G64 module in single LADC cells. Interestingly, the G64 module also indicated inter-tumoral heterogeneity based on its association with patient survival and other clinical variables such as smoking status and tumor stage. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of single-cell RNA sequencing and the strength of our analytical pipeline for the identification of tumor subpopulations."

Familiar faces have a more robust representation than do unfamiliar faces, and are detected faster in the absence of awareness and with reduced attentional resources. Faces of family and close friends become familiar over a protracted period involving learning the unique visual appearance, including a view-invariant representation, as well as person knowledge. We investigated the effect of personal familiarity on the earliest stages of face processing by using a saccadic-choice task to measure how fast familiar face detection can happen. Subjects made correct and reliable saccades to familiar faces when unfamiliar faces were distractors at 180 ms--very rapid saccades that are 30 to 70 ms earlier than the earliest evoked potential modulated by familiarity. By contrast, accuracy of saccades to unfamiliar faces with familiar faces as distractors did not exceed chance. Saccades to faces with object distractors were even faster (110 to 120 ms) and equivalent for familiar and unfamiliar faces, indicating that familiarity does not affect ultra-rapid saccades. We propose that detectors of diagnostic facial features for familiar faces develop in visual cortices through learning and allow rapid detection that precedes explicit recognition of identity."
https://openalex.org/W2098577408,"The formation of wood results from cambial activity and its anatomical properties reflect the variability of environmental conditions during the growing season. Recently, it was found that wood density variations in conifers growing under cold-limited environment result from the adjustment of cell wall thickness (CWT) to temperature. Additionally, it is known that intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) are formed in response to precipitation after the summer drought. Although IADFs are frequent in Mediterranean conifers no study has yet been conducted to determine if these structures result from the adjustment of lumen diameter (LD) or CWT to soil water availability. Our main objective is to investigate the intra-ring variation of wood anatomical features (LD and CWT) in Pinus pinaster Ait. growing under a water-limited environment. We compared the tracheidograms of LD and CWT for the years 2010-2013 in P. pinaster growing in the west coast of Portugal. Our results suggest a close association between LD and soil moisture content along the growing season, reinforcing the role of water availability in determining tracheid size. Compared with CWT, LD showed a higher intra- and inter-annual variability suggesting its strong adjustment value to variations in water availability. The formation of a latewood IADF appears to be predisposed by higher rates of cell production in spring and triggered by early autumn precipitation. Our findings reinforce the crucial role of water availability on cambial activity and wood formation in Mediterranean conifers, and emphasize the high plasticity of wood anatomical features under Mediterranean climate."
https://openalex.org/W1618397346,"Optical projection tomography (OPT) provides a non-invasive 3-D imaging modality that can be applied to longitudinal studies of live disease models, including in zebrafish. Current limitations include the requirement of a minimum number of angular projections for reconstruction of reasonable OPT images using filtered back projection (FBP), which is typically several hundred, leading to acquisition times of several minutes. It is highly desirable to decrease the number of required angular projections to decrease both the total acquisition time and the light dose to the sample. This is particularly important to enable longitudinal studies, which involve measurements of the same fish at different time points. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of an iterative algorithm to reconstruct sparsely sampled OPT data sets can provide useful 3-D images with 50 or fewer projections, thereby significantly decreasing the minimum acquisition time and light dose while maintaining image quality. A transgenic zebrafish embryo with fluorescent labelling of the vasculature was imaged to acquire densely sampled (800 projections) and under-sampled data sets of transmitted and fluorescence projection images. The under-sampled OPT data sets were reconstructed using an iterative total variation-based image reconstruction algorithm and compared against FBP reconstructions of the densely sampled data sets. To illustrate the potential for quantitative analysis following rapid OPT data acquisition, a Hessian-based method was applied to automatically segment the reconstructed images to select the vasculature network. Results showed that 3-D images of the zebrafish embryo and its vasculature of sufficient visual quality for quantitative analysis can be reconstructed using the iterative algorithm from only 32 projections—achieving up to 28 times improvement in imaging speed and leading to total acquisition times of a few seconds."
https://openalex.org/W1750118221,"The susceptibility of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to convert to an alternative misfolded conformation (PrPSc), which is the key event in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, is indicative of a conformationally flexible native (N) state. In the present study, hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) in conjunction with mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used for the structural and energetic characterization of the N state of the full-length mouse prion protein, moPrP(23–231), under conditions that favor misfolding. The kinetics of HDX of 34 backbone amide hydrogens in the N state were determined at pH 4. In contrast to the results of previous HDX studies on the human and Syrian hamster prion proteins at a higher pH, various segments of moPrP were found to undergo different extents of subglobal unfolding events at pH 4, a pH at which the protein is known to be primed to misfold to a β-rich conformation. No residual structure around the disulfide bond was observed for the unfolded state at pH 4. The N state of the prion protein was observed to be at equilibrium with at least two partially unfolded forms (PUFs). These PUFs, which are accessed by stochastic fluctuations of the N state, have altered surface area exposure relative to the N state. One of these PUFs resembles a conformation previously implicated to be an initial intermediate in the conversion of monomeric protein into misfolded oligomer at pH 4."

https://openalex.org/W2206442434,"Following the resolution of a severe inflammatory injury in rodents, administration of mu-opioid receptor inverse agonists leads to reinstatement of pain hypersensitivity. The mechanisms underlying this form of latent pain sensitization (LS) likely contribute to the development of chronic pain, but LS has not yet been demonstrated in humans. Using a C57BL/6 mouse model of cutaneous mild heat injury (MHI) we demonstrated a dose-dependent reinstatement of pain sensitization, assessed as primary (P < 0.001) and secondary hyperalgesia (P < 0.001) by naloxone (0.3–10 mg/kg), 168 hrs after the induction of MHI. Forward-translating the dose data to a human MHI model (n = 12) we could show that LS does indeed occur after naloxone 2 mg/kg, 168 hrs after a MHI. Our previous unsuccessful efforts to demonstrate unmasking of LS in humans are thus likely explained by an insufficient naloxone dose (0.021 mg/kg). However, while LS was consistently demonstrated in 21/24 mice, LS was only seen in 4/12 subjects. This difference is likely due to selection bias since the C57BL/6 mouse strain exhibits markedly enhanced pain sensitivity in assays of acute thermal nociception. Future exploratory studies in humans should prioritize inclusion of “high-sensitizers” prone to develop LS and use post-surgical models to elucidate markers of vulnerability to chronic postsurgical pain.EudraCT 2012-005663-27."
https://openalex.org/W2114151493,"Long-lived adult stem cells could accumulate non-repaired DNA damage or mutations that increase the risk of tumor formation. To date, studies on mutations in stem cells have concentrated on clonal (homoplasmic) mutations and have not focused on rarely occurring stochastic mutations that may accumulate during stem cell dormancy. A major challenge in investigating these rare mutations is that conventional next generation sequencing (NGS) methods have high error rates. We have established a new method termed Duplex Sequencing (DS), which detects mutations with unprecedented accuracy. We present a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial DNA mutations in human breast normal stem cells and non-stem cells using DS. The vast majority of mutations occur at low frequency and are not detectable by NGS. The most prevalent point mutation types are the C>T/G>A and A>G/T>C transitions. The mutations exhibit a strand bias with higher prevalence of G>A, T>C, and A>C mutations on the light strand of the mitochondrial genome. The overall rare mutation frequency is significantly lower in stem cells than in the corresponding non-stem cells. We have identified common and unique non-homoplasmic mutations between non-stem and stem cells that include new mutations which have not been reported previously. Four mutations found within the MT-ND5 gene (m.12684G>A, m.12705C>T, m.13095T>C, m.13105A>G) are present in all groups of stem and non-stem cells. Two mutations (m.8567T>C, m.10547C>G) are found only in non-stem cells. This first genome-wide analysis of mitochondrial DNA mutations may aid in characterizing human breast normal epithelial cells and serve as a reference for cancer stem cell mutation profiles."
https://openalex.org/W1935978792,"Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress might be considered the key mechanisms of aging. Insulin resistance (IR) is a phenomenon related to inflammatory and oxidative stress. We tested the hypothesis that IR may be associated with cellular senescence, as measured by leukocyte telomere length (LTL), and arterial stiffness (core feature of arterial aging), as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (c-f PWV).The study group included 303 subjects, mean age 51.8 ±13.3 years, free of known cardiovascular diseases and regular drug consumption. For each patient, blood pressure was measured, blood samples were available for biochemical parameters, and LTL was analyzed by real time q PCR. C-f PWV was measured with the help of SphygmoCor. SAS 9.1 was used for statistical analysis.Through multiple linear regression analysis, c-f PWV is independently and positively associated with age (p = 0.0001) and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p = 0.0001) and independently negatively associated with LTL (p = 0.0378). HOMA-IR seems to have a stronger influence than SBP on arterial stiffness. In all subjects, age, HOMA-IR, LTL, and SBP predicted 32% of the variance in c-f PWV. LTL was inversely associated with HOMA-IR (p = 0.0001) and age (p = 0.0001). In all subjects, HOMA-IR, age, sex, and SBP predicted 16% of the variance in LTL.These data suggest that IR is associated with cell senescence and arterial aging and could, therefore, become the main target in preventing accelerated arterial aging, besides blood pressure control.

Hsp31 also modulates the aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn), a target of the chaperone activity of human DJ-1, an Hsp31 homolog. We demonstrate that Hsp31 is able to suppress the in vitro fibrillization or aggregation of αSyn, citrate synthase and insulin. Chaperone activity was also observed in vivo because constitutive overexpression of Hsp31 reduced the incidence of αSyn cytoplasmic foci, and yeast cells were rescued from αSyn-generated proteotoxicity upon Hsp31 overexpression. Moreover, we showed that Hsp31 protein levels are increased by H2O2, in the diauxic phase of normal growth conditions, and in cells under αSyn-mediated proteotoxic stress. We show that Hsp31 chaperone activity and not the methylglyoxalase activity or the autophagy pathway drives the protective effects. We also demonstrate reduced aggregation of the Sup35 prion domain, PrD-Sup35, as visualized by fluorescent protein fusions.

https://openalex.org/W1911061258,"It was previously shown that tubulin dimer interaction with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) blocks traffic through the channel and reduces oxidative metabolism and that this requires the unstructured anionic C-terminal tail peptides found on both α- and β-tubulin subunits. It was unclear whether the α- and β-tubulin tails contribute equally to VDAC blockade and what effects might be due to sequence variations in these tail peptides or to tubulin post-translational modifications, which mostly occur on the tails. The nature of the contribution of the tubulin body beyond acting as an anchor for the tails had not been clarified either. Here we present peptide-protein chimeras to address these questions. These constructs allow us to easily combine a tail peptide with different proteins or combine different tail peptides with a particular protein. The results show that a single tail grafted to an inert protein is sufficient to produce channel closure similar to that observed with tubulin. We show that the β-tail is more than an order of magnitude more potent than the α-tail and that the lower α-tail activity is largely due to the presence of a terminal tyrosine. Detyrosination activates the α-tail, and activation is reversed by the removal of the glutamic acid penultimate to the tyrosine. Nitration of tyrosine reverses the tyrosine inhibition of binding and even induces prolonged VDAC closures. Our results demonstrate that small changes in sequence or post-translational modification of the unstructured tails of tubulin result in substantial changes in VDAC closure. It was previously shown that tubulin dimer interaction with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) blocks traffic through the channel and reduces oxidative metabolism and that this requires the unstructured anionic C-terminal tail peptides found on both α- and β-tubulin subunits. It was unclear whether the α- and β-tubulin tails contribute equally to VDAC blockade and what effects might be due to sequence variations in these tail peptides or to tubulin post-translational modifications, which mostly occur on the tails. The nature of the contribution of the tubulin body beyond acting as an anchor for the tails had not been clarified either. Here we present peptide-protein chimeras to address these questions. These constructs allow us to easily combine a tail peptide with different proteins or combine different tail peptides with a particular protein. The results show that a single tail grafted to an inert protein is sufficient to produce channel closure similar to that observed with tubulin. We show that the β-tail is more than an order of magnitude more potent than the α-tail and that the lower α-tail activity is largely due to the presence of a terminal tyrosine. Detyrosination activates the α-tail, and activation is reversed by the removal of the glutamic acid penultimate to the tyrosine. Nitration of tyrosine reverses the tyrosine inhibition of binding and even induces prolonged VDAC closures. Our results demonstrate that small changes in sequence or post-translational modification of the unstructured tails of tubulin result in substantial changes in VDAC closure. Tubulin is the subunit of microtubules, but it is also a freely diffusing cytoplasmic protein that can find binding partners distinct from those for microtubules. One of these is the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC, 3The abbreviations used are: VDACvoltage-dependent anion channelDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideS-4FBN-succinimidyl-4-formylbenzamideS-HyNicsuccinimidyl-6-hydrazino-nicotinamideCTTC-terminal tail(s). which mediates small molecule traffic into and out of the mitochondria (1Colombini M. VDAC: the channel at the interface between mitochondria and the cytosol.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 256–257: 107-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously shown that tubulin binding to VDAC blocks channel traffic and reduces oxidative metabolism (2Rostovtseva T.K. Sheldon K.L. Hassanzadeh E. Monge C. Saks V. Bezrukov S.M. Sackett D.L.

However, those studies left unclear whether the tails contribute equally to VDAC blockade, as well as the role, if any, of tubulin post-translational modifications, which mostly occur on the tails. Earlier studies showed that anionic polymers could cause VDAC closure, but gave no indication of sequence sensitivity (4Tan W. Loke Y.H. Stein C.A. Miller P. Colombini M.

Here we use single molecule binding studies to show that channel closure is due to the tails themselves, because grafting them to albumin produces closure very similar to that induced by tubulin. We show that the β-tail is ∼30-fold more potent than the α-tail and that this difference is largely due to the presence or absence of a terminal tyrosine. Detyrosination activates the α-tail, and activation is reversed by subsequent removal of the next residue. We also show that nitration of tyrosine reverses the tyrosine inhibition of binding and even induces prolonged VDAC closures. Our results demonstrate that small changes in sequence or post-translational modification of the disordered tails of tubulin result in substantial changes in VDAC closure. We expect that this pattern will be found again when comparing the numerous isotypes of α- and β-tubulin, as well as other post-translational modifications. Our study also provides a sensitive system to study the biology of disordered protein sequences. Bovine tubulin was obtained from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). Lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Crosslinking reagents were from Solulink (San Diego, CA). Wild-type α-hemolysin was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All peptides were synthesized by Peptide 2.0 (Chantilly, VA), with purity >95% confirmed by HPLC and masses confirmed by mass spectrometry. The default α- and β-peptide sequences were: α (TUBA1A, NP_001257328.1) and β (TUBB, Class I, NP_821133.1). VDAC from Neurospora crassa mitochondrial outer membranes was isolated and purified as described in Ref. 2Rostovtseva T.K. Sheldon K.L. Hassanzadeh E. Monge C. Saks V. Bezrukov S.M. Sackett D.L. Tubulin binding blocks mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and regulates respiration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18746-18751Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar with minor modifications. The wall-less N. crassa mutant (FGSC number fz;sg;os-1) was obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center, Kansas City, MO. Cells were lysed in buffered detergent (2.5% Triton X-100, 15% DMSO, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) passed ∼10× through a Monoject 200 needle and then ∼10× through a Monoject 250 needle. Cell lysate was run over a dry hydroxyapatite:Celite column (2:1), and eluted with ∼2 ml of buffered detergent. Four ∼500-μl samples were collected and stored at −20 °C. VDAC from rat liver was isolated using published methods (6Sheldon K.L. Maldonado E.N. Lemasters J.J. Rostovtseva T.K. Bezrukov S.M. Phosphorylation of voltage-dependent anion channel by serine/threonine kinases govern its interaction with tubulin.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6e25539Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Frozen rat liver fractions (from Dr. Marco Colombini, University of Maryland, College Park, MD) were allowed to thaw, and then centrifuged (10,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and membranes were incubated in buffered detergent (see above) for 10 min on ice, vortexing for 20 s every 2 min. Samples were centrifuged (14,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was run using the same protocol as for N. crassa (see above). Peptides corresponding to the sequences of tubulin C-terminal tail (CTT) were grafted to BSA (and other proteins) using a “click chemistry”-based protocol using the reaction between hydrazines and carbonyls. The ratio of peptides to protein was kept low (0.5 or less usually) so that most proteins had only one peptide, if they had any (most had none). Peptides were tagged on the N-terminal amine using succinimidyl-6-hydrazino-nicotinamide (HyNic, Solulink). This was added from a DMSO stock to a final concentration of ∼7 mm in a solution of the peptide (2 mm) in PBS-borate buffer, pH 8.3–8.5. Reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature. Tagged peptide was separated from free HyNic using gel filtration on columns of Bio-Gel P2 (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in conjugation buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.) BSA (or other proteins) was tagged with N-succinimidyl-4-formylbenzamide (S-4FB, Solulink). BSA at 0.15 mm in PBS-borate buffer, pH 8.3–8.5, was mixed with a sample of DMSO stock of S-4FB to yield a final concentration of 0.33 mm, and the reaction were allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature. Unreacted S-4FB was removed by gel filtration using Zeba 7-kDa spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equilibrated in conjugation buffer. Conjugation of 4FB-BSA (S-4FB conjugated with BSA) and peptide-S-HyNic was accomplished by combining the tagged protein and peptide at a stoichiometry of 2 peptides to BSA (∼0.2 mm peptide-HyNic and 0.1 mm 4FB-BSA). Reaction proceeded overnight at 4 °C. Unconjugated peptide was removed by gel filtration using a Zeba 40-kDa spin column (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equilibrated in PBS. The concentration of BSA and the concentration of the peptide conjugate were obtained from a UV-visible absorbance spectrum. Absorbance at 350 nm gave the peptide conjugate absorbance from the chromophore produced in the conjugation reaction, and the corrected absorbance at 280 yielded the BSA concentration. Lipid bilayer membranes were formed by the lipid monolayer opposition technique from diphytanoyl-phosphatidylcholine, on a circular aperture in a Teflon partition (E. I. DuPont de Nemours) dividing two (cis and trans) compartments of the experimental chamber as described previously (2Rostovtseva T.K. Sheldon K.L. Hassanzadeh E. Monge C. Saks V. Bezrukov S.M. Sackett D.L. Tubulin binding blocks mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and regulates respiration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Phosphorylation of voltage-dependent anion channel by serine/threonine kinases govern its interaction with tubulin.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6e25539Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). VDAC insertion was achieved by adding protein in a 2.5% Triton X-100 solution to the aqueous phase of 1 m KCl buffered with 5 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 in the cis compartment while stirring. α-Hemolysin was added to the cis side solution of the chamber from a diluted water stock solution of ∼300 nm containing 8 m urea. Applied transmembrane voltage is defined as positive if potential is higher on the cis side of the chamber. Ion current measurements were performed using Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Eugene, OR). The output signal was filtered by the amplifier 10-kHz filter and in-line low-pass eight-pole Butterworth filter (Model 9002; Frequency Devices, Ottawa, IL) at 15 kHz and directly saved into the computer memory with a sampling frequency of 50 kHz. Event on-rate and lifetime analysis was performed using ClampFit 10.2 (Molecular Devices) and by ORIGIN 8.2 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). BSA constructs were added to the membrane-bathing solutions after channel reconstitution. Statistical analysis of the blockage events was started 15 min after BSA addition to ensure steady state. Lifetimes (τon) were calculated by fitting a single exponential to logarithmically binned histograms of at least 100 open (unblocked state) events. On-rates were calculated as the inverse of the τon multiplied by the concentration of chimera added to the bath. Standard deviations are depicted as the average of at least three independent experiments for a given applied potential. Like many intrinsically disordered protein tails (7Uversky V.N. The most important thing is the tail: multitudinous functionalities of intrinsically disordered protein termini.FEBS Lett. 2013; 587: 1891-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the tubulin CTT are sites of interaction with other proteins and sequence differences between isotypes. The CTT are also a major focus of post-translational modifications that comprise the “tubulin code” (8Verhey K.J. Gaertig J. The tubulin code.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2152-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the microtubule, these tails form a charged brush surrounding the microtubule (9Sackett D.L.

Rice L.M. Vale R.D. Regulation of microtubule motors by tubulin isotypes and post-translational modifications.Nat Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The previous study (2Rostovtseva T.K. Sheldon K.L. Hassanzadeh E. Monge C. Saks V. Bezrukov S.M. Sackett D.L. Tubulin binding blocks mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and regulates respiration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18746-18751Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) of tubulin-VDAC binding demonstrated that the CTT also have important functions in the dimer, because proteolytic removal of the tails (producing a tubulin globular body without tails) eliminated VDAC blockade. The free tails alone were also unable to cause VDAC closure, indicating that a body is required to anchor the tail, although perhaps this body could be a protein other than tubulin. To address this, and to examine the tails individually rather than in pairs as in dimeric tubulin, we chose to pursue an approach in which we chemically link a CTT peptide to a non-interacting protein. After trying several other proteins, we chose BSA for this purpose because it is similar in size and charge to the globular body of α- and β-tubulins and does not measurably interact with VDAC. This allowed us to make small libraries of constructs using a click chemistry procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” and to create constructs with non-genetically codable modifications. The sequences of the CTT peptides are presented in Fig. 1. The sequences correspond to gene-coded human α- and β-CTT (see under “Experimental Procedures” for sequence accession numbers), as well as α-CTT following the removal of the terminal Tyr, the removal of the terminal Tyr and the preceding Glu, and the non-natural sequence of β-CTT terminating in Tyr rather than Ala. Activity of these BSA-peptide constructs was measured by analyzing the effects of constructs on the ion current through single VDAC channels in the electrophysiological setup described previously (Ref. 2Rostovtseva T.K. Sheldon K.L. Hassanzadeh E. Monge C. Saks V. Bezrukov S.M. Sackett D.L. Tubulin binding blocks mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and regulates respiration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18746-18751Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, and also see under “Experimental Procedures”). The constructs were added to the aqueous potassium chloride solutions bathing planar lipid bilayers with reconstituted VDAC molecules. The representative results of the currents through single VDAC channels are shown in Fig. 2, and analysis of the on-rates is given in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the addition of 150 nm BSA-β construct caused intermittent current interruptions similar to those previously found for tubulin-VDAC interactions (2Rostovtseva T.K. Sheldon K.L. Hassanzadeh E. Monge C. Saks V. Bezrukov S.M. Sackett D.L. Tubulin binding blocks mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and regulates respiration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18746-18751Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar): rapidly reversible (msec) events that reduce channel conductance by ∼60%. This single closure level is distinct from the multiple closure levels induced by voltage alone, is characteristic of tubulin binding, and is sufficient to cause channel blockage for molecules the size of ATP and ADP (14Gurnev P.A. Rostovtseva T.K. Bezrukov S.M. Tubulin-blocked state of VDAC studied by polymer and ATP partitioning.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Single amino acid terminal alterations govern peptide interaction with VDAC. Shown are the on-rate constants (kon) of tubulin binding, and each of the BSA-peptide constructs, with VDAC obtained from the kinetic analysis of the experiments, examples of which are shown in Fig. 2, a–e. Values are the average kon ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments shown for an applied potential of 25 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Surprisingly, the addition of BSA-α to the same concentration had virtually no effect on conductance of the channel. This is remarkable because the two peptides are very similar in properties (60–70% Glu or Asp residues in the C-terminal 14 residues) and identical in 6 residues. We confirmed that simple charge was not the critical characteristic, consistent with previous observations with oligonucleotides (4Tan W. Loke Y.H. Stein C.A. Miller P. Colombini M. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides block the VDAC channel.Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1184-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), because VDAC closure was not induced by either of two poly-Glu constructs, BSA-E10 (same number of charges as BSA-β) or BSA-E15 (more charges, nearly the same length as BSA-β) (data not shown). To test whether the failure of BSA-α to affect the channel conductance was due to its slightly shorter length as compared with the BSA-β construct (Fig. 1), we made a construct using an α-peptide extended by N-terminal addition of the residues ATA so that the construct has the same length and N-terminal sequence as the BSA-β construct. This had no effect on its interaction with VDAC (Fig. 4). We also examined the question of channel generality. The N. crassa VDAC that we used has advantages for these experiments, because there is only one form (unlike mammalian VDACs, which have several isotypes) and because we wanted continuity with previous publications (2Rostovtseva T.K. Sheldon K.L. Hassanzadeh E. Monge C. Saks V. Bezrukov S.M. Sackett D.L. Tubulin binding blocks mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and regulates respiration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18746-18751Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that the difference in activity between BSA-β and BSA-α might be restricted to this VDAC, we repeated experiments with VDAC isolated from rat liver and found similar differences between the BSA-β and BSA-α constructs. The results presented in Fig. 5a show on-rates of BSA constructs binding as a function of transmembrane voltage for this VDAC. Besides dramatically higher channel affinity found for the β-tail construct, one can see that elevated voltages also increase the frequency of VDAC blockage by the α-tailed BSAs. In addition, we tested BSA constructs with a completely different β-barrel channel-forming protein, α-hemolysin (15Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Structure of staphylococcal α-hemolysin, a heptameric transmembrane pore.Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar), known for its ability to interact with an array of biopolymers, including unstructured proteins (16Movileanu L. Schmittschmitt J.P. Scholtz J.M. Bayley H. Interactions of peptides with a protein pore.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1030-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 17Gurnev P.A. Yap T.L. Pfefferkorn C.M. Rostovtseva T.K. Berezhkovskii A.M. Lee J. C Parsegian V.A.

J. 2014; 106: 556-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We found that the BSA-β and BSA-α constructs interact with α-hemolysin in a similar voltage-dependent manner; however, the voltage required to induce the channel-BSA interaction is significantly larger (Fig. 5b). Most importantly, the results obtained with α-hemolysin demonstrate that BSA-β and BSA-α constructs do not exhibit any measurable specificity in blocking this channel (Fig. 5b, bottom panel). The corresponding on-rates virtually coincide in the whole range of the studied voltages. In other words, α-hemolysin does not seemingly discriminate between the two constructs, thus supporting our conjecture regarding the sequence specificity in interaction of tubulin tails with mitochondrial VDACs. We then looked at differences in the peptides to understand the difference in activity between BSA-β and BSA-α. We found that removing the terminal Tyr from BSA-α (BSA-α(−Y)) restored activity to this construct, whereas replacing the terminal Ala with Tyr on BSA-β (BSA-β(−A+Y)) quenched activity (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Surprisingly, removing from BSA-α the penultimate Glu as well as the terminal Tyr (BSA-α(−EY)) resulted in lost activity. Replacing the terminal Tyr with nitrotyrosine yielded a construct that was not only able to cause closure, but actually caused quite extended closures (Fig. 6). These results show that VDAC blocking by tubulin dimer is by the unstructured tail, and not by the tubulin body, because grafting β-CTT to BSA (and to other proteins; data not shown) induced the same blocking events as tubulin. These results also show that grafting of the tails to a body is required because we previously showed that the free tail peptides alone do not cause closure (2Rostovtseva T.K. Sheldon K.L. Hassanzadeh E. Monge C. Saks V. Bezrukov S.M. Sackett D.L. Tubulin binding blocks mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel and regulates respiration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18746-18751Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), but, importantly, that grafting need not be to the tubulin body itself. The difference in affinity between constructs with BSA and tubulin (on-rates, Fig. 3) is likely due to a lipid-dependent affinity of tubulin body for the membrane (18Rostovtseva T.K. Gurnev P.A. Meng-Yang Chen M.-Y. Bezrukov S.M. Membrane lipid composition regulates tubulin interaction with mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 29589-29598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as has been often reported (reviewed in Ref. 19Wolff J. Plasma membrane tubulin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 1415-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The significantly reduced activity of BSA-α as compared with BSA-β in blocking VDAC was surprising, hinting that small differences in peptide sequence or chemical structure may be significant, and suggesting that the activity we reported with tubulin dimer was due almost solely to β-tubulin CTT-VDAC interaction. To search for differences between the peptides that explain the more than an order of magnitude difference in activity, we started with a construct that corresponds to the product of a major tubulin post-translational modification: the removal of the terminal Tyr residue of the α-CTT. This evolutionarily ancient post-translational modification of tubulin is usually related to microtubule stability and binding of other proteins to the microtubule (13Sirajuddin M. Rice L.M. Vale R.D. Regulation of microtubule motors by tubulin isotypes and post-translational modifications.Nat Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), although also implicated in rapid shifts during cellular signaling (20Rothwell S.W. Nath J. Wright D.G. Rapid and reversible tubulin tyrosination in human neutrophils stimulated by the chemotactic peptide, fMet-Leu-Phe.J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Robinson J.M. Vandré D.D. Stimulus-dependent alterations in macrophage microtubules: increased tubulin polymerization and detyrosination.J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 645-655PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, removing the terminal Tyr from the α-CTT peptide to form the construct BSA-α(−Y) activated the construct-VDAC binding to a potency close to that of the BSA-β construct (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Furthermore, replacement of the terminal Alawith a Tyr on β-CTT peptide (BSA-β(−A+Y)) reduced construct-VDAC binding activity by an amount similar to the difference between BSA-α and BSA-α(−Y) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). These results show that the presence or absence of a tyrosine residue at the end of the tail peptide is the controlling element in determining whether these tail peptides are potent VDAC blockers or not, apparently overriding other differences between the peptides preceding the C terminus. Replacing the terminal Tyr with a terminal Phe (BSA-α(−Y+F)) produced a construct as inactive as the α-CTT construct, BSA-α (Fig. 4), suggesting that a bulky aromatic group at the C terminus is the inactivating moiety. In the absence of a terminal Tyr, other small changes in sequence can determine activity. One such change is the removal of the Glu residue preceding the Tyr, producing α-CTT(−EY), the known variant “Δ2-tubulin” (22Paturle-Lafanechère L. Manier M. Trigault N. Pirollet F. Mazarguil H. Job D. Accumulation of delta 2-tubulin, a major tubulin variant that cannot be tyrosinated in neuronal tissues and in stable microtubule assemblies.J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1529-1543PubMed Google Scholar). Although the C-terminating residue is Glu in both BSA-α(−Y) and BSA-α(−EY), the tail with two residues deleted is as inactive as the full-length tail (Fig. 2). We then tested the effect of incorporation of nitrotyrosine (NO2-Tyr) at the terminus of full-length α-CTT. The removal and replacement of Tyr from the end of the α-CTT is a normal post-translational modification cycle, but this can be altered when NO2-Tyr is introduced due to constitutive synthesis, oxidative stress, or other means (see review in Ref. 23Murray J. Oquendo C.E. Willis J.H. Marusich M.F. Capaldi R.A. Monitoring oxidative and nitrative modification of cellular proteins: a paradigm for identifying key disease related markers of oxidative stress.Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60: 1497-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the incorporation of NO2-Tyr into α-tubulin may be harmful in vivo and that the observed accumulation of Δ2-tubulin in patient tumors provided resistance to chemotherapy agents by rendering this tubulin incapable of retyrosination-driven incorporation of NO2-Tyr produced in response to chemotherapy (24Eiserich J.P.

Suppression of tubulin tyrosine ligase during tumor growth.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 171-181PubMed Google Scholar). However, the nature of the putative harmful effect(s) of NO2-Tyr incorporation was not revealed (26Bisig C.G. Purro S.A. Contín M.A. Barra H.S. Arce C.A. Incorporation of 3-nitrotyrosine into the C-terminus of α-tubulin is reversible and not detrimental to dividing cells.Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We tested a BSA-α-NO2 construct and found that it differed remarkably from BSA-α (Fig. 6); it is able to cause channel closure to the same 60% closed state as BSA-β or intact tubulin, and more remarkably, it causes closures that are very long (more than 10 min), essentially irreversible on the time scale of the experiment. We conclude from these studies that the interaction between the tubulin dimer and VDAC is determined by the disordered tail peptides and that small changes in sequence or post-translational modification of these tails result in substantial changes in VDAC closure. We expect this pattern to be repeated when the numerous isotypes of α- and β-tubulin are compared. Because different tissues express differing tubulin isotypes and differing post-translational modifications, this suggests that VDAC closure, and therefore mitochondrial regulation, may change in different tissues. These results also demonstrate that disordered protein tails, even if highly charged, are not just charged strings, but embody nuanced specificity for interaction. K. L.

Sixty-nine participants were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups, of which sixty-four completed the study: a soccer training group (SOC; n = 20, 34±4 (means±SD) years, 78.1±8.3 kg, 179±4 cm); a running group (RUN; n = 21, 32±4 years, 78.0±5.5 kg, 179±7 cm); or a passive control group (CON; n = 23, 30±3 years, 76.6±12.0 kg, 178±8 cm). The training intervention lasted 12 weeks and consisted of three 60-min sessions per week. All participants were tested for each of the following physical fitness components: maximal aerobic power, minute ventilation, maximal heart rate, squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJ), sit-and-reach flexibility, and body composition. Over the 12 weeks, VO2max relative to body weight increased more (p<0.05) in SOC (24.2%, ES = 1.20) and RUN (21.5%, ES = 1.17) than in CON (-5.0%, ES = -0.24), partly due to large changes in body mass (-5.9, -5.7 and +2.6 kg, p<0.05 for SOC, RUN and CON, respectively). Over the 12 weeks, SJ and CMJ performance increased more (p<0.05) in SOC (14.8 and 12.1%, ES = 1.08 and 0.81) than in RUN (3.3 and 3.0%, ES = 0.23 and 0.19) and CON (0.3 and 0.2%), while flexibility also increased more (p<0.05) in SOC (94%, ES = 0.97) than in RUN and CON (0-2%). In conclusion, untrained men displayed marked improvements in maximal aerobic power after 12 weeks of soccer training and moderate-intensity running, partly due to large decreases in body mass. Additionally soccer training induced pronounced positive effects on jump performance and flexibility, making soccer an effective broad-spectrum fitness training intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1810253779,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential nutrients for animals and necessary for the normal functioning of the nervous system. A lack of PUFAs can result from the consumption of a deficient diet or genetic factors, which impact PUFA uptake and metabolism. Both can cause synaptic dysfunction, which is associated with numerous disorders. However, there is a knowledge gap linking these neuronal dysfunctions and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Because of its genetic manipulability and its easy, fast, and cheap breeding, Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an excellent model organism for genetic screens, helping to identify the genetic bases of such events. As a first step towards the understanding of PUFA implications in Drosophila synaptic physiology we designed a breeding medium containing only very low amounts of PUFAs. We then used the fly's visual system, a well-established model for studying signal transmission and neurological disorders, to measure the effects of a PUFA deficiency on synaptic function. Using both visual performance and eye electrophysiology, we found that PUFA deficiency strongly affected synaptic transmission in the fly's visual system. These defects were rescued by diets containing omega-3 or omega-6 PUFAs alone or in combination. In summary, manipulating PUFA contents in the fly's diet was powerful to investigate the role of these nutrients on the fly´s visual synaptic function. This study aims at showing how the first visual synapse of Drosophila can serve as a simple model to study the effects of PUFAs on synapse function. A similar approach could be further used to screen for genetic factors underlying the molecular mechanisms of synaptic dysfunctions associated with altered PUFA levels."

Its high motility in the viscous gastric mucosa facilitates colonization of the human stomach and depends on the helical cell shape and the flagella. In H. pylori, Csd6 is one of the cell shape-determining proteins that play key roles in alteration of cross-linking or by trimming of peptidoglycan muropeptides. Csd6 is also involved in deglycosylation of the flagellar protein FlaA. To better understand its function, biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterizations were carried out. We show that Csd6 has a three-domain architecture and exists as a dimer in solution. The N-terminal domain plays a key role in dimerization. The middle catalytic domain resembles those of l,d-transpeptidases, but its pocket-shaped active site is uniquely defined by the four loops I to IV, among which loops I and III show the most distinct variations from the known l,d-transpeptidases. Mass analyses confirm that Csd6 functions only as an l,d-carboxypeptidase and not as an l,d-transpeptidase. The d-Ala-complexed structure suggests possible binding modes of both the substrate and product to the catalytic domain. The C-terminal nuclear transport factor 2-like domain possesses a deep pocket for possible binding of pseudaminic acid, and in silico docking supports its role in deglycosylation of flagellin. On the basis of these findings, it is proposed that H. pylori Csd6 and its homologs constitute a new family of l,d-carboxypeptidase.

Helicobacter pylori is a spiral-shaped Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the upper gastrointestinal tract in approximately half of the world's human population. Its infection of the gastric mucosa is associated with various gastric diseases, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma (1Roesler B.M.

Virulence factors of Helicobacter pylori: a review.Clin. Med. Insights Gastroenterol. 2014; 7: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and was classified as a group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization. In recent years, H. pylori infection has also been implicated with some extra-digestive diseases (3Roubaud Baudron C. Franceschi F. Salles N. Gasbarrini A. Extragastric diseases and Helicobacter pylori.Helicobacter. 2013; 18: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Typical treatment regimens for eradicating H. pylori consist of a proton pump inhibitor (for example, omeprazole) and the antibiotics such as clarithromycin and amoxicillin (or metronidazole). However, increasing drug resistance in H. pylori requires the discovery of new antibiotics (4Malfertheiner P. Selgrad M. Bornschein J. Helicobacter pylori: clinical management.Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2012; 28: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Colonization and infection by H. pylori also rely on the ability of the bacterium to move toward the part of gastric mucosa with more neutral pH. Besides the helical morphology, powerful flagella of H. pylori are responsible for its high motility through the viscous gastric mucous layer (5Ottemann K.M. Lowenthal A.C.

In many bacteria, including H. pylori, the peptidoglycan layer is remodeled by a number of cell-wall hydrolases as well as synthetases for the peptidoglycan maturation, regulation of cell-wall growth, cell division, peptidoglycan turnover and recycling, cell lysis, and the release of peptidoglycan fragments for host-pathogen interactions (18Vollmer W.

Consistent with the absence of 3→3 cross-linked muropeptides in the H. pylori peptidoglycan sacculus, Csd6 was shown to exhibit the l,d-CPase activity only with no “transpeptidase” cross-linking activity against the muropeptides (23Sycuro L.K.

However, it still remains unanswered why Csd6 has no “transpeptidase” cross-linking activity, despite the presence of a putative “l,d-TPase” domain and conservation of the catalytic Cys/His residues. In many bacterial pathogens, flagella are best known for conferring motility and virulence, as well as serving as an export apparatus for virulence factors (34Young G.M. Schmiel D.H. Miller V.L.

Surface-induced swarmer cell differentiation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus.Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Flagellar filaments of H. pylori are composed of two copolymerized flagellins (FlaA and FlaB) (36Kostrzynska M. Betts J.D. Austin J.W. Trust T.J. Identification, characterization, and spatial localization of two flagellin species in Helicobacter pylori flagella.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 937-946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are heavily O-glycosylated with pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac; Pse), a sialic acid resembling sugar (37Schirm M. Soo E.C. Aubry A.J.

Flagellar glycosylation–a new component of the motility repertoire?.Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1249-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The regulation of such post-translational modification is critical for the assembly of functional flagella (37Schirm M. Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Austin J. Thibault P. Logan S.M.

The neuA/flmD gene cluster of Helicobacter pylori is involved in flagellar biosynthesis and flagellin glycosylation.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 210: 165-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a previous work highlighted the unique role of H. pylori G27 Csd6 that involves deglycosylation of FlaA; the Δcsd6 mutant exhibited altered motility to facilitate host-cell interaction and superior colonization (40Asakura H. Churin Y. Bauer B. Boettcher J.P. Bartfeld S. Hashii N. Kawasaki N. Mollenkopf H.J. Jungblut P.R. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F. Helicobacter pylori HP0518 affects flagellin glycosylation to alter bacterial motility.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 1130-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It suggests that Csd6 binds Pse molecules or deglycosylates O-glycosylated FlaA proteins. To better understand the molecular function of H. pylori Csd6, its biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterizations have been performed in this study. Mass analyses using the synthetic muramyl peptides indicate that Csd6 functions only as the l,d-carboxypeptidase (l,d-CPase) and not as the l,d-transpeptidase (l,d-TPase). Analytical ultracentrifugation and single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses indicate that Csd6 exists as a dimer in solution. A Csd6 monomer has a three-domain architecture consisting of the N-terminal domain (NTD; Val-13–Asn-56), the middle l,d-CPase domain (Lys-67–Glu-202), and the C-terminal nuclear transport factor 2-like domain (NTF2-like domain; Thr-209–Lys-330). The NTD shows very remote structural similarity to other known protein structures and plays a key role in dimerization. The middle catalytic domain has an overall fold of the l,d-TPase domain, validating the bioinformatics prediction. However, here this catalytic domain is referred to as the “l,d-CPase” domain, because we as well as others show that Csd6 functions only as an l,d-CPase. The Csd6 l,d-CPase domain resembles those of well characterized l,d-TPases, but its pocket-shaped active site is uniquely defined by the four loops I–IV, among which loops I and III show the most distinct variations in sequence length and conformation from known l,d-TPases. The d-Ala-complexed structure suggests possible binding modes of both the substrate and product to the l,d-CPase domain. The NTF2-like domain possesses a deep pocket for possible binding of a hydrophobic ligand such as Pse, and an in silico docking study supports its role in the control of the glycosylation level of flagellin. This work provides further insights into the strategy of H. pylori for regulating its helical cell shape and motility, which are crucial for its virulence. The reported structural information would serve as the foundation in a search for new drug targets to fight infections by H. pylori. The PCR-amplified csd6 gene from H. pylori 26695 strain, encompassing residues Val-13–Lys-330 of the gene product (HP0518), was cloned into the expression vector pET-28b("

DAP3 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that involves in apoptosis, but its biological function has not been well characterized. Here, we demonstrate that DAP3 specifically localizes in the mitochondrial matrix. Knockdown of DAP3 in mitochondria leads to defects in mitochondrial-encoded protein synthesis and abnormal mitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, depletion of DAP3 dramatically decreases the phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser-637 on mitochondria, enhancing the retention time of Drp1 puncta on mitochondria during the fission process. Furthermore, autophagy is inhibited in the DAP3-depleted cells, which sensitizes cells to different types of death stimuli.

Mitochondria are highly important organelles in the life and death of eukaryotic cells. They provide energy in the form of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, which is critical for cellular metabolism and biosynthesis. Mitochondrial dynamics refers to the opposing fusion and fission processes that enable cells to respond and adapt to their ever changing physiological conditions (1Westermann B.

In contrast, mitochondrial fission is highly controlled by another large dynamin-related GTPase Drp1, in which the mode of action has been intensively studied (9Hoppins S. Lackner L. Nunnari J.

Autophagy is a highly conserved process for self-degradation of cellular components including long-lived proteins, damaged organelles and pathogens (21He C. Klionsky D.J. Regulation mechanisms and signaling pathways of autophagy.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 67-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar). When autophagy occurs, double membrane vesicles termed phagophore are initiated, and they expand to engulf cytosolic content to form the so-called autophagosomes (22Feng Y. He D. Yao Z. Klionsky D.J. The machinery of macroautophagy.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 24-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). The autophagosomal outer membrane docks and fuses with the lysosomal membrane and the cargo is subsequently degraded by the lysosomal hydrolases (21He C. Klionsky D.J. Regulation mechanisms and signaling pathways of autophagy.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 67-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar). Not only can the organelles be removed by selective autophagy, but they can also contribute to the process of autophagy. For example, mitochondria can supply a membrane source (23Hailey D.W. Rambold A.S. Satpute-Krishnan P. Mitra K. Sougrat R. Kim P.K. Lippincott-Schwartz J.

However, at the molecular level, the underlying mechanism of the cross-talk between mitochondria and autophagy remains to be further elucidated. DAP3 is a pro-apoptosis protein that involves in various types of stimuli-induced apoptosis, such as interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (28Kissil J.L. Deiss L.P. Bayewitch M. Raveh T. Khaspekov G. Kimchi A. Isolation of DAP3, a novel mediator of interferon-γ-induced cell death.J. Biol.

A GTP-binding adapter protein couples TRAIL receptors to apoptosis-inducing proteins.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, due to its subcellular localization, its precise role in cell death has been challenged (30Berger T. Kretzler M. Interaction of DAP3 and FADD only after cellular disruption.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 31Cavdar Koc E. Ranasinghe A. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Koc H. Moseley A. Spremulli L.L. A new face on apoptosis: death-associated protein 3 and PDCD9 are mitochondrial ribosomal proteins.FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Loss of DAP3 in mice leads to lethal embryonic mutations at E9.5, suggesting that it is essential to embryonic development (32Kim H.R. Chae H.J. Thomas M. Miyazaki T. Monosov A. Monosov E. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Mammalian dap3 is an essential gene required for mitochondrial homeostasis in vivo and contributing to the extrinsic pathway for apoptosis.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More importantly, the mitochondria in embryos lacking DAP3 contain swollen cristae and shrunken morphologies, indicating that DAP3 may play a role in regulating mitochondrial function (32Kim H.R. Chae H.J. Thomas M. Miyazaki T. Monosov A. Monosov E. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Mammalian dap3 is an essential gene required for mitochondrial homeostasis in vivo and contributing to the extrinsic pathway for apoptosis.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of DAP3 leads to an obvious increase in the rate of mitochondrial fission (33Mukamel Z. Kimchi A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 36732-36738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the role of DAP3 in regulating mitochondrial fission or fusion has not yet been well studied. Here, we show that DAP3 is critical for maintaining mitochondrial fusion and fission homeostasis via regulating the phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser-637 and is required for mitochondrial-encoded protein synthesis. In addition, autophagy is shown to be inhibited by DAP3 depletion, which subsequently sensitizes cells to intrinsic death stimuli. Our results reveal that DAP3 plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial function, providing new insights into a role of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein function in cell death.

The homogenized cells were centrifuged with a speed of 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then transferred into a new tube followed by another 20-min centrifugation at 4 °C, 10,000 × g, to pellet the mitochondria. The supernatant fraction was the cytosolic fraction. For the mitochondrial membrane analysis, the mitochondria of HeLa cells were pelleted using the method described previously. The mitochondrial samples were then resuspended in freshly prepared 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing every 10 min. After the incubation, the membranes were centrifuged down to a pellet at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as inter-mitochondrial membrane space and matrix proteins. For the proteinase K digestion assay, the isolated mitochondria were resuspended in a mitochondria-isolation buffer and incubated with different proteinase K concentrations on ice for 30 min. PMSF was added to stop the digestion and the samples were precipitated by TCA. The pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol) with phosphatases inhibitors including 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitors and 2 mm EDTA for 30 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For immunofluorescence, cells were seeded on sterilized glass coverslips in 12-well plates for 24 h before transfection with the indicated plasmids or siRNAs. After transfection, the cells were cultured for the indicated time and fixed by freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Paraformaldehyde was removed after fixation, followed by a 2 times wash with PBS and the coverslips were then incubated with 3% BSA + 0.1–0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature for blocking and permeabilization. After the incubation, the coverslips underwent a 3 times wash by PBS, followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After the primary antibody incubation, the coverslips were washed again and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 min at room temperature. After incubation, the coverslips were washed twice by PBS and the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 was applied to stain DNA (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells stained by the various dyes were mounted onto glass slides using FluorSaveTM reagent (Calbiochem) and preserved at 4 °C for further analysis. For live cell imaging, HeLa cells were seeded in a 35-mm glass-bottom dish with different treatments and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a chamber equipped with a microscope. Time-lapse imaging was conducted using an Ultraview Vox spinning disc confocal system (PerkinElmer). VolocityTM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to control all of the parameters used for image acquisition. For FRAP analysis, HeLa cells stably expressing mito-RFP were treated by different siRNAs until the indicated time. The cells were monitored on the live-cell imaging system as described above, and a laser line of 561 nm was used to bleach a 2 × 2-μm2 area placed on the mitochondrial network fiber. Twenty s of recovery time for each bleaching was used to make sure the recovery had reached the plateau. Thirty FRAP curves for each siRNA transfection experiment were analyzed by measuring the intensities of mito-RFP fluorescence in the photobleached area. Mobile fraction and turnover half-life (t½) for mito-RFP were calculated by fitting a normalized recovery curve into a constrained exponential formula (34Ye F. Tan L. Yang Q. Xia Y. Deng L.W.

The pulse labeling of mitochondrial translation products in the control and siRNA-treated HeLa cells was performed as a reported protocol with modifications (35Dieterich D.C. Lee J.J. Link A.J.

Specifically, cells at 80% confluence were incubated with 30 μm AHA in DMEM and lack methionine and cysteine containing 100 μg/ml of cytosolic translation inhibitor emetine for 3 h. After AHA labeling, the cells were lysed and a “click” reaction was performed by incubating the cell lysates with fluorescent dye-conjugated TAMRA for 2 h at room temperature. The proteins were precipitated by ice-cold acetone and air-dried before being subjected to NuPAGE® Novex® 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel (Invitrogen) separation. The gel was visualized using a Typhoon 9410 laser scanner (GE HealthCare) and the images were analyzed by ImageQuantTM software (GE HealthCare). Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (36Xia Y. Ongusaha P. Lee S.W. Liou Y.C. Loss of Wip1 sensitizes cells to stress- and DNA damage-induced apoptosis.J. Biol.

For immunoprecipitation, a total of 5 μl of FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) were equilibrated in 1 ml of mammalian cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 supplemented with protease inhibitors, including 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μm leupeptin). The equilibrated FLAG M2 beads were added into the cleared cytosol fraction and resolved in a mitochondrial fraction harvested from two 10-cm cell culture dishes and incubated for 3–5 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the immunocomplexes were washed 3–4 times in mammalian cell lysis buffer and the bead-conjugated proteins were denatured by incubation with 2× SDS loading buffer for 15 min at 95 °C. Protein samples were then separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by Western blotting. ATP production was measured using an ATP determination kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, HeLa cells transfected with control- or DAP3-siRNAs were washed with PBS and harvested using ice-cold ATP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, PH7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm EDTA) for 5 min. The lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford Protein Assay reagent (Bio-Rad). The ATP levels were determined using 0.5 μg of proteins for each reaction and every sample was measured in triplicate. To inhibit ATP synthase activity, 10 μg/ml of oligomycin was used to treat HeLa cells for 3 h. To inhibit calcineurin activity or stimulate PKA activity, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 200 nm FK506 (InvivoGen; dissolved in DMSO) or 20 μm forskolin (Enzo; dissolved in DMSO) for 2 h, respectively. To investigate the autophagy process, EBSS (minimum essential medium) was used to treat HeLa cells for 2 h. To induce intrinsic and extrinsic cell death, 20 ng/ml of TNF-α (Sigma; dissolved in DMSO) plus 3 μg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma; dissolved in DMSO), 20 μm CCCP (Sigma; dissolved in DMSO), and 100 nm staurosporine (Sigma; dissolved in DMSO) were applied for 24 h, respectively. HeLa cells transfected with DAP3 siRNAs for 48 h were trypsinized and washed twice by PBS. JC-1 dye (Invitrogen) for measuring mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was diluted in medium at 1 μg/ml to resuspend and stain the cells. The resuspended cells were put in a cell culture incubator for 15 min for the staining, after which the JC-1 medium was replaced by fresh medium. The labeled samples were then analyzed using Dako flow cytometry (Dako) and the results were analyzed using SummitTM 4.3. Ten thousand events were recorded for each experiment. HeLa cells transfected with DAP3 siRNAs for 48 h were treated with 20 ng/ml of TNF-α + 3 μg/ml of cycloheximide, 20 μm CCCP, 100 nm staurosporine or EBSS as indicated for 24 h. Immediately after the treatment, the cells were harvested to a 15-ml Falcon tube (including floating cells). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at (200 × g, 5 min) and the supernatant was discarded. The propidium iodide (10 μg/ml, Sigma) for staining dead cells was diluted in medium at 10 ng/ml to resuspend and stain the cells. Five min later, the labeled samples were analyzed using Dako flow cytometry (Dako) and the results were analyzed using summit 4.3. Ten thousand events were recorded for each experiment. Previous studies suggest that DAP3 has a function in promoting cell death (28Kissil J.L. Deiss L.P. Bayewitch M. Raveh T. Khaspekov G. Kimchi A.

A report indicated that DAP3 is located in mitochondria (29Miyazaki T. Reed J.C. A GTP-binding adapter protein couples TRAIL receptors to apoptosis-inducing proteins.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the other argued that there is also a cytosolic pool of DAP3 (30Berger T. Kretzler M. Interaction of DAP3 and FADD only after cellular disruption.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To address this, we conducted immunostaining for endogenous DAP3 and Western blots to examine its subcellular location. Our result showed that endogenous DAP3 co-localized well with mitochondria when treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fig. 1, A and B, upper panel). In contrast, the DAP3 signal was significantly decreased on mitochondria if treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 1, A and B, lower panel), suggesting that DAP3 was probably located inside of the mitochondria. Consistently, endogenous levels of DAP3 in different cell lines (HeLa, HEK-293T, and mous"
https://openalex.org/W1846474778,"Interleukin-31 (IL-31) is a T helper type 2 cell-derived cytokine tightly associated with inflammatory skin disorders. IL-31-induced signaling is mediated by a receptor complex composed of oncostatin M receptor β and the cytokine-specific receptor subunit IL-31Rα, of which there are several isoforms. The latter can be classified as long or short isoforms with respect to their intracellular domain. At present, the signaling capabilities of the different isoforms remain inchoately understood, and potential mechanisms involved in negative regulation of IL-31Rα signaling have so far not been studied in detail. Here, we show that both the long and short isoforms of IL-31Rα are capable of inducing STAT signaling. However, the presence of a functional JAK-binding box within IL-31Rα is an essential prerequisite for functional IL-31-mediated STAT3 signaling. Moreover, both the long and short isoforms require oncostatin M receptor β for their activity. We also show that IL-31 induces expression of four suppressor of cytokine signaling family members and provide evidence that SOCS3 acts as a potent feedback inhibitor of IL-31-induced signaling. Taken together, this study identifies crucial requirements for IL-31 signaling and shows its counter-regulation by SOCS3."
https://openalex.org/W1890645185,"Natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes deploy perforin and granzymes to kill infected host cells. Perforin, secreted by immune cells, binds target membranes to form pores that deliver pro-apoptotic granzymes into the target cell. A crucial first step in this process is interaction of its C2 domain with target cell membranes, which is a calcium-dependent event. Some aspects of this process are understood, but many molecular details remain unclear. To address this, we investigated the mechanism of Ca(2+) and lipid binding to the C2 domain by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. Calcium titrations, together with dodecylphosphocholine micelle experiments, confirmed that multiple Ca(2+) ions bind within the calcium-binding regions, activating perforin with respect to membrane binding. We have also determined the affinities of several of these binding sites and have shown that this interaction causes a significant structural rearrangement in CBR1. Thus, it is proposed that Ca(2+) binding at the weakest affinity site triggers changes in the C2 domain that facilitate its interaction with lipid membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2100484298,"Diarrheal illness contributes to malnutrition, stunted growth, impaired cognitive development, and high morbidity rates in children worldwide. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major contributor to this diarrheal disease burden. ETEC cause disease in the small intestine by means of colonization factors and by production of a heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and/or a small non-immunogenic heat-stable enterotoxin (ST). Overall, the majority of ETEC produce both ST and LT. LT induces secretion via an enzymatically active A-subunit (LT-A) and a pentameric, cell-binding B-subunit (LT-B). The importance of anti-LT antibodies has been demonstrated in multiple clinical and epidemiological studies, and a number of potential ETEC vaccine candidates have included LT-B as an important immunogen. However, there is limited information about the potential contribution of LT-A to development of protective immunity. In the current study, we evaluate the immune response against the A-subunit of LT as well as the A-subunit's potential as a protective antigen when administered alone or in combination with the B-subunit of LT. We evaluated human sera from individuals challenged with a prototypic wild-type ETEC strain as well as sera from individuals living in an ETEC endemic area for the presence of anti-LT, anti-LT-A and anti-LT-B antibodies. In both cases, a significant number of individuals intentionally or endemically infected with ETEC developed antibodies against both LT subunits. In addition, animals immunized with the recombinant proteins developed robust antibody responses that were able to neutralize the enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects of native LT by blocking binding and entry into cells (anti-LT-B) or the intracellular enzymatic activity of the toxin (anti-LT-A). Moreover, antibodies to both LT subunits acted synergistically to neutralize the holotoxin when combined. Taken together, these data support the inclusion of both LT-A and LT-B in prospective vaccines against ETEC."
https://openalex.org/W2278141380,"ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, which repositions and restructures nucleosomes, is essential to all DNA-templated processes. The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex is an evolutionarily conserved complex involved in diverse cellular processes, including transcription, DNA repair, and replication. The functional diversity of the INO80 complex can, in part, be attributed to specialized activities of distinct subunits that compose the complex. Furthermore, structural analyses have identified biochemically discrete subunit modules that assemble along the Ino80 ATPase scaffold. Of particular interest is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp5-Ies6 module located proximal to the Ino80 ATPase and the Rvb1-Rvb2 helicase module needed for INO80-mediated in vitro activity. In this study we demonstrate that the previously uncharacterized Ies2 subunit is required for Arp5-Ies6 association with the catalytic components of the INO80 complex. In addition, Arp5-Ies6 module assembly with the INO80 complex is dependent on distinct conserved domains within Arp5, Ies6, and Ino80, including the spacer region within the Ino80 ATPase domain. Arp5-Ies6 interacts with chromatin via assembly with the INO80 complex, as IES2 and INO80 deletion results in loss of Arp5-Ies6 chromatin association. Interestingly, ectopic addition of the wild-type Arp5-Ies6 module stimulates INO80-mediated ATP hydrolysis and nucleosome sliding in vitro. However, the addition of mutant Arp5 lacking unique insertion domains facilitates ATP hydrolysis in the absence of nucleosome sliding. Collectively, these results define the requirements of Arp5-Ies6 assembly, which are needed to couple ATP hydrolysis to productive nucleosome movement."

https://openalex.org/W1940024491,"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is associated with gadolinium contrast exposure in patients with reduced kidney function and carries high morbidity and mortality. We have previously demonstrated that gadolinium contrast agents induce in vivo systemic iron mobilization and in vitro differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells into ferroportin (iron exporter)-expressing fibrocytic cells. In the present study we examined the role of iron in a mouse model of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Chronic kidney disease was induced in 8-week-old male Balb/C mice with a two-step 5/6 nephrectomy surgery. Five groups of mice were studied: control (n = 5), sham surgery control (n = 5), chronic kidney disease control (n = 4), chronic kidney disease injected with 0.5 mmol/kg body weight of Omniscan 3 days per week, for a total of 10 injections (n = 8), and chronic kidney disease with Omniscan plus deferiprone, 125 mg/kg, in drinking water (n = 9). Deferiprone was continued for 16 weeks until the end of the experiment. Mice with chronic kidney disease injected with Omniscan developed skin changes characteristic of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis including hair loss, reddening, ulceration, and skin tightening by 10 to 16 weeks. Histopathological sections demonstrated dermal fibrosis with increased skin thickness (0.25±0.06 mm, sham; 0.34±+0.3 mm, Omniscan-injected). Additionally, we observed an increase in tissue infiltration of ferroportin-expressing, fibrocyte-like cells accompanied by tissue iron accumulation in the skin of the Omniscan-treated mice. The deferiprone-treated group had significantly decreased skin thickness (p<0.05) and significantly decreased dermal fibrosis compared to the Omniscan-only group. In addition, iron chelation prevented tissue infiltration of ferroportin-expressing, fibrocyte-like cells. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that exposure to Omniscan resulted in the release of catalytic iron and this was prevented by the iron chelator deferiprone. Deferiprone inhibited the differentiation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells into ferroportin-expressing cells by immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis. Our studies support an important role of iron in the pathophysiology of gadolinium chelate toxicity and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis."

https://openalex.org/W2143949506,"Across the tropics, there is a growing financial investment in activities that aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, such as REDD+. However, most tropical countries lack on-the-ground capacity to conduct reliable and replicable assessments of forest carbon stocks, undermining their ability to secure long-term carbon finance for forest conservation programs. Clear guidance on how to reduce the monetary and time costs of field assessments of forest carbon can help tropical countries to overcome this capacity gap. Here we provide such guidance for cost-effective one-off field assessments of forest carbon stocks. We sampled a total of eight components from four different carbon pools (i.e. aboveground, dead wood, litter and soil) in 224 study plots distributed across two regions of eastern Amazon. For each component we estimated survey costs, contribution to total forest carbon stocks and sensitivity to disturbance. Sampling costs varied thirty-one-fold between the most expensive component, soil, and the least, leaf litter. Large live stems (≥10 cm DBH), which represented only 15% of the overall sampling costs, was by far the most important component to be assessed, as it stores the largest amount of carbon and is highly sensitive to disturbance. If large stems are not taxonomically identified, costs can be reduced by a further 51%, while incurring an error in aboveground carbon estimates of only 5% in primary forests, but 31% in secondary forests. For rapid assessments, necessary to help prioritize locations for carbon- conservation activities, sampling of stems ≥20cm DBH without taxonomic identification can predict with confidence (R2 = 0.85) whether an area is relatively carbon-rich or carbon-poor-an approach that is 74% cheaper than sampling and identifying all the stems ≥10cm DBH. We use these results to evaluate the reliability of forest carbon stock estimates provided by the IPCC and FAO when applied to human-modified forests, and to highlight areas where cost savings in carbon stock assessments could be most easily made."

The rescoring method developed is a result of extensive computational study in which different scoring functions and molecular descriptors were combined to develop consensus and rescoring methods. 127 mPGES-1 inhibitors were collected from literature and were segregated into training and external test sets. Docking of the 27 training set compounds was carried out using default settings in AutoDock Vina, AutoDock, DOCK6 and GOLD programs. The programs showed low to moderate correlation with the experimental activities. In order to introduce the contributions of desolvation penalty and conformation energy of the inhibitors various molecular descriptors were calculated. Later, rescoring method was developed as empirical sum of normalised values of docking scores, LogP and Nrotb. The results clearly indicated that LogP and Nrotb recuperate the predictions of these docking programs. Further the efficiency of the rescoring method was validated using 100 test set compounds. The accurate prediction of binding affinities for analogues of the same compounds is a major challenge for many of the existing docking programs; in the present study the high correlation obtained for experimental and predicted pIC50 values for the test set compounds validates the efficiency of the scoring method."
https://openalex.org/W1951659831,"Patients' unawareness of their cancer diagnosis (PUAW) and their tendency for non-disclosure (TTND) to relatives leads to a lack of cancer visibility among familial networks. Lack of familial cancer visibility could affect the accuracy of family cancer history (FCH) reports. In this study, we investigated familial cancer visibility and its potential determinants.A sample of patients with a confirmed cancer diagnosis was interviewed. Participants were asked about their number of relatives, number of their relatives who are aware about the cancer diagnosis, and the number of relatives from whom they intended to conceal their diagnosis. PUAW was also assessed. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the bootstrap technique. Multivariate analyses were conducted using mixed Poisson and logistic regression analyses.A total of 415 participants with a mean age of 53±15 years and a male to female ratio of 0.53 were enrolled in this study. The rates of PUAW, TTND, and familial cancer visibility in the total sample were 0.20 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 0.24), 0.16 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.19), and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.89), respectively. PUAW (adjusted rate ratio (RR) = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.38), TTND (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.93), and the patients' gender (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.95) were the most important determinants of familial cancer visibility.Familial cancer visibility may be a point of concern among the Iranian population. Self-reported cancer histories and FCHs may have low sensitivities (not exceeding 80% and 86%, respectively) in this population. However, these estimates may vary across different societies, because of societal and cultural contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2246244254,"The extracellular regions of epithelial Na+ channel subunits are highly ordered structures composed of domains formed by α helices and β strands. Deletion of the peripheral knuckle domain of the α subunit in the αβγ trimer results in channel activation, reflecting an increase in channel open probability due to a loss of the inhibitory effect of external Na+ (Na+ self-inhibition). In contrast, deletion of either the β or γ subunit knuckle domain within the αβγ trimer dramatically reduces epithelial Na+ channel function and surface expression, and impairs subunit maturation. We systematically mutated individual α subunit knuckle domain residues and assessed functional properties of these mutants. Cysteine substitutions at 14 of 28 residues significantly suppressed Na+ self-inhibition. The side chains of a cluster of these residues are non-polar and are predicted to be directed toward the palm domain, whereas a group of polar residues are predicted to orient their side chains toward the space between the knuckle and finger domains. Among the mutants causing the greatest suppression of Na+ self-inhibition were αP521C, αI529C, and αS534C. The introduction of Cys residues at homologous sites within either the β or γ subunit knuckle domain resulted in little or no change in Na+ self-inhibition. Our results suggest that multiple residues in the α subunit knuckle domain contribute to the mechanism of Na+ self-inhibition by interacting with palm and finger domain residues via two separate and chemically distinct motifs."
https://openalex.org/W1796557947,"Raf kinases are important components of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk pathway and also cross-talk with other signaling pathways. Araf kinase has been demonstrated to inhibit TGF-β/Smad2 signaling by directly phosphorylating and accelerating degradation of activated Smad2. In this study, we show that the araf gene expresses in zebrafish embryos to produce a shorter transcript variant, araf-tv2, in addition to the full-length variant araf-tv1. araf-tv2 is predicted to encode a C-terminally truncated peptide without the kinase activity domain. Araf-tv2 can physically associate with Araf-tv1 but does not antagonize the inhibitory effect of Araf-tv1 on TGF-β/Smad2 signaling. Instead, Araf-tv2 interacts strongly with Kras and Nras, ultimately blocking MAPK activation by these Ras proteins. In zebrafish embryos, overexpression of araf-tv2 is sufficient to inhibit Fgf/Ras-promoted Erk activation, mesodermal induction, dorsal development, and neuroectodermal posteriorization. Therefore, different isoforms of Araf may participate in similar developmental processes but by regulating different signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1864530271,"Cell cycle is an integral part of cell proliferation, and consists mainly of four phases, G1, S, G2 and M. The p21 protein, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, plays a key role in regulating cell cyclevia G1 phase control. Cells capable of epimorphic regeneration have G2/M accumulation as their distinctive feature, whilst the majority of somatic cells rest at G1 phase. To investigate the role played byp21 in antler regeneration, we studied the cell cycle distribution of antler stem cells (ASCs), via down-regulation of p21 in vitro using RNAi. The results showed that ASCs had high levels of p21 mRNA expression and rested at G1 phase, which was comparable to the control somatic cells. Down-regulation of p21 did not result in ASC cell cycle re-distribution toward G2/M accumulation, but DNA damage and apoptosis of the ASCs significantly increased and the process of cell aging was slowed. These findings suggest that the ASCs may have evolved to use an alternative, p21-independent cell cycle regulation mechanism. Also a unique p21-dependent inhibitory effect may control DNA damage as a protective mechanism to ensure the fast proliferating ASCs do not become dysplastic/cancerous. Understanding of the mechanism underlying the role played by p21 in the ASCs could give insight into a mammalian system where epimorphic regeneration is initiated whilst the genome stability is effectively maintained."
https://openalex.org/W2125061676,"Background Thailand is one of several countries with a continuing generalized HIV epidemic. We evaluated the risk factors for HIV prevalence among 17–29 year old men conscripted by a random process into the Royal Thai Army (RTA) in 8 cohorts from 2005–2009. Methods A series of case-cohort studies were conducted among the male RTA conscripts who had been tested for HIV seroprevalence after they were inducted. Men who were HIV positive were compared with a systematic random sample (1 in 30–40) of men from the total population of new conscripts. Each subject completed a detailed risk factor questionnaire. Results A total of 240,039 young Thai men were conscripted into the RTA and were screened for HIV seroprevalence between November 2005 and May 2009. Of 1,208 (0.5%) HIV positive cases, 584 (48.3%) men were enrolled into the study. There were 7,396 men who were enrolled as a comparison group. Among conscripts who had an education lower than a college-level, the independent risk factors for HIV infection were age in years (AOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.28–1.48), a history of sex with another man (AOR 3.73, 95% CI 2.70–5.13), HCV infection (AOR 3.89, 95% CI 2.56–5.90), and a history of sex with a female sex worker (FSW) (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10–1.66). Among conscripts who had a college degree, the independent risk factor for HIV infection was a history of sex with another man (AOR 23.04, 95% CI 10.23–51.90). Numbers of sexual partners increased and the age at first sex, as well as the use of condoms for sex with a FSW decreased in successive cohorts. Conclusion The HIV seroprevalence among cohorts of 17–29 years old men has remained at about 0.5% overall during 2005–2009. The most significant behavior associated with HIV prevalence was a history of sex with another man. Our data indicate continuing acquisition of HIV among young men in Thailand in recent years, especially among men with a history of same sex behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1931389836,"Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) can cause severe respiratory tract diseases in infants and young children, but no licensed vaccines or antiviral agents are currently available for treatment. Fusing the viral and target cell membranes is a prerequisite for its entry into host cells and is directly mediated by the fusion (F) protein. Although several domains of F are known to have important effects on regulating the membrane fusion activity, the roles of the DI-DII linker (residues 369-374) of the HPIV3 F protein in the fusogenicity still remains ill-defined. To facilitate our understanding of the role of this domain might play in F-induced cell-cell fusion, nine single mutations were engineered into this domain by site-directed mutagenesis. A vaccinia virus-T7 RNA polymerase transient expression system was employed to express the wild-type or mutated F proteins. These mutants were analyzed for membrane fusion activity, cell surface expression, and interaction between F and HN protein. Each of the mutated F proteins in this domain has a cell surface expression level similar to that of wild-type F. All of them resulted in a significant reduction in fusogenic activity in all steps of membrane fusion. Furthermore, all these fusion-deficient mutants reduced the amount of the HN-F complexes at the cell surface. Together, the results of our work suggest that this region has an important effect on the fusogenic activity of F."

This study aims at exploring the role of media in informing health policies in Lebanon, identifying the factors influencing health reporting and investigating the role of evidence in health journalism and the quality of health reporting. It also identifies strategies to enhance the use of evidence in health journalism and improve the quality of health reporting.Media analysis was conducted to assess the way media reports on health-related issues and the quality of reporting using a quality assessment tool. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with 27 journalists, researchers and policymakers to explore their perception on the role of media in health policymaking and the factors influencing health reporting. In addition, a validation workshop was conducted.Out of 1,279 health-related news articles identified, 318 articles used certain type of evidence to report health issues 39.8% of which relied on experts' opinions as their source of evidence while only 5.9% referenced peer-reviewed research studies. The quality of health reporting was judged to be low based on a quality assessment tool consisting of a set of ten criteria. Journalists raised concerns about issues impeding them from referring to evidence. Journalists also reported difficulties with the investigative health journalism. Policymakers and researchers viewed media as an important tool for evidence-informed health policies, however, serious concerns were voiced in terms of the current practice and capacities.Our study provides a structured reflection on the role of media and the factors that influence health reporting including context-specific strategies that would enhance the quality and promote the use of evidence in health reporting. In the light of the political changes in many Middle Eastern countries, findings from this study can contribute to redefining the role of media in strengthening health systems."
https://openalex.org/W1947450036,"Studies on the association between antibiotic treatment and outcomes in outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of fluoroquinolones and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors for pneumonia in COPD outpatients.We conducted a retrospective cohort study and identified 4,851 episodes of pneumonia among COPD outpatients treated with fluoroquinolones or β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database during 2002-2011. Using the propensity score analysis, 1,296 pairs of episodes were matched for the demographic and clinical characteristics. The primary outcome was pneumonia/empyema-related hospitalization or emergency department (ED) visits, and the secondary outcomes were treatment failure, all-cause mortality and medical costs within 30 days.Compared with episodes treated with β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, episodes treated with fluoroquinolones had similar clinical outcomes. The rates of pneumonia/empyema-related hospitalization or ED visits were 3.9% and 3.5% in the fluoroquinolone and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor groups, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.66). The percentage of treatment failure and all-cause mortality were 28.2% versus 31.3% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73-1.02) and 0.5% versus 0.4% (aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.45-4.41) in the fluoroquinolone and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor groups, respectively. The medical expenditures, including total medical costs (528 versus 455 US dollars) and pneumonia-related costs (202 vs. 155 USD) were also balanced between the two treatment groups (both P >0.05).For pneumonia in COPD outpatients, fluoroquinolones were associated with similar clinical outcomes and medical expenditures compared with β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2155317502,"The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a member of the RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which promote ubiquitin transfer from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to a substrate. In budding yeast, the APC/C collaborates with two E2s, Ubc4 and Ubc1, to promote the initiation and elongation, respectively, of polyubiquitin chains on the substrate. Ubc4 and Ubc1 are thought to compete for the same site on the APC/C, but it is not clear how their affinities are balanced. Here, we demonstrate that a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain enhances the affinity of Ubc1 for the APC/C. Deletion of the UBA domain reduced apparent APC/C affinity for Ubc1 and decreased polyubiquitin chain length. Surprisingly, the positive effect of the UBA domain was not due to an interaction with the acceptor ubiquitin attached to the APC/C substrate or the donor ubiquitin attached to Ubc1 itself. Instead, our evidence suggests that the UBA domain binds to a site on the APC/C core, thereby increasing Ubc1 affinity and enhancing its ability to compete with Ubc4. The UBA domain is required for normal Ubc1 function and E2 competition in vivo. Thus, the UBA domain of Ubc1 ensures efficient polyubiquitination of substrate by balancing Ubc1 affinity with that of Ubc4.

https://openalex.org/W1719040009,"High density genotyping panels have been used in a wide range of applications. From population genetics to genome-wide association studies, this technology still offers the lowest cost and the most consistent solution for generating SNP data. However, in spite of the application, part of the generated data is always discarded from final datasets based on quality control criteria used to remove unreliable markers. Some discarded data consists of markers that failed to generate genotypes, labeled as missing genotypes. A subset of missing genotypes that occur in the whole population under study may be caused by technical issues but can also be explained by the presence of genomic variations that are in the vicinity of the assayed SNP and that prevent genotyping probes from annealing. The latter case may contain relevant information because these missing genotypes might be used to identify population-specific genomic variants. In order to assess which case is more prevalent, we used Illumina HD Bovine chip genotypes from 1,709 Nelore (Bos indicus) samples. We found 3,200 missing genotypes among the whole population. NGS re-sequencing data from 8 sires were used to verify the presence of genomic variations within their flanking regions in 81.56% of these missing genotypes. Furthermore, we discovered 3,300 novel SNPs/Indels, 31% of which are located in genes that may affect traits of importance for the genetic improvement of cattle production."
https://openalex.org/W2146440225,"To compare the use of a generic molecular assay to 'standard' investigations used to assist the diagnosis of late onset bacterial sepsis in very low birth weight infants (VLBW, <1500 g).VLBW infants, greater than 48 hours of age, who were clinically suspected to have sepsis were investigated using standard tests (full blood count, C-reactive protein (at presentation) and blood culture), in addition, blood was taken for a universal molecular assay (16S rRNA reverse transcriptase PCR) for comparison. Clinical data were recorded during the suspected infection episode. A validated sepsis score (NEO-KISS) was used to retrospectively determine the presence of sepsis (independent of blood culture). The performance of each of the tests were compared by sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likihood ratios (+/-LR) and postive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV).Sixty-five babies with suspected clinical sepsis were prospectively included. The performance indicators are presented with 95% confidence limits. For the detection of bacteria, blood culture had sensitivity of 0.57 (0.34-0.78), specificity of 0.45 (0.30-0.61); +LR of 1.05 (0.66-1.66) and-LR of 0.94 (0.52-1.7); PPV of 33.3 (18.56-50.97) and NPV of 68.97 (49.17-87.72). Serum CRP had sensitivity of 0.92 (0.64-1) and specificity of 0.36 (0.17-0.59); +LR of 1.45 (1-2.1) and-LR of 0.21 (0.03-1.5); PPV of 44.46 (26.6-66.6) and NPV of 88.9 (51.8-99.7). The universal molecular assay had sensitivity of 0.76 (0.53-0.92), specificity of 0.95 (0.85-0.99); +LR of 16.8 (4.2-66.3) and-LR of 0.25 (0.1-0.5); PPV of 88.9 (65.3-98.6) and NPV of 89.4 (76.9-96.5).In VLBW infants this universal molecular assay performed better in the diagnosis of late onset sepsis (LOS) than blood culture and CRP. Further development is required to explore and improve the performance of the assay in real-time diagnosis."
