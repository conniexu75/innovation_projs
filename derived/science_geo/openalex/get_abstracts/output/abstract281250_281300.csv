https://openalex.org/W2001577980,"Abrupt changes in the amplitude of the magnetic fluctuations, in the field strength, and in the plasma properties, were observed with Mariner V near Venus. They provide clear evidence for the presence of a bow shock around the planet, similar to, but much smaller than, that observed at Earth. The observations appear consistent with an interaction of the solar wind with the ionosphere of Venus. No planetary field could be detected, but a steady radial field and very low plasma density were found 10,000 to 20,000 kilometers behind Venus and 8,000 to 12,000 kilometers from the Sun-Venus line. These observations may be interpreted as relating to an expansion wave tending to fill the cavity produced by Venus in the solar wind. The upper limit to the magnetic dipole moment of Venus is estimated to be within a factor of 2 of 10(-3) items that of Earth."
https://openalex.org/W1991187198,"Measurements of the frequency, phase, and amplitude of the S-band radio signal of Mariner V as it passed behind Venus were used to obtain the effects of refraction in its atmosphere and ionosphere. Profiles of refractivity, temperature, pressure, and density in the neutral atmosphere, as well as electron density in the daytime ionosphere, are presented. A constant scale height was observed above the tropopause, and the temperature increased with an approximately linear lapse rate below the tropopause to the level at which signal was lost, presumably because heavy defocusing attenuation occurred as critical refraction was approached. An ionosphere having at least two maxima was observed at only 85 kilometers above the tropopause."
https://openalex.org/W2006145603,"Pseudomyrmex nigropilosa is a parasite ofthe ant-acacia mutualism in Central America in that it harvests the resources of swollen-thorn acacias but does not protect the acacias. In the process, it also lowers the rate of occupation by the obligate acacia-ants, species of ants that do protect swollen-thorn acacias. Tenancy ofan acacia by P. nigropilosa must be temporary, since the unoccupied plant is shortly killed by herbivores or competing plants, or is taken over by obligate acacia-ants. As expected of a species of short-lived ant, a P. nigropilosa colony produces reproductives earlier in the life of the colony and maintains fewer grams of workers per gram of brood than does a colony of the long-lived obligate acacia-ants."
https://openalex.org/W1978581731,A Lyman-alpha airglow of atomic hydrogen measured in the outer atmosphere of Venus showed that atomic hydrogen is present. The variation as a function of height indicates that the temperature of the upper atmosphere of Venus is lower than that of Earth. An ultraviolet airglow of atomic oxygen was not found. An ultraviolet nightglow was observed on the dark limb.
https://openalex.org/W3027810884,"Venus has daytime and nighttime ionospheres at the positions probed by radio occulation. The main layers are thin by terrestrial standards, with the nighttime peak concentration of electrons being about two orders of magnitude below that of the daytime peak. Above the nighttime peak were several scale-height regimes extending to a radius of at least 7500, and probably to 9700, kilometers from the center of Venus. Helium and hydrogen at plasma temperatures of 600 degrees to 1100 degrees K seem indicated in the regimes from 6300 to 7500 kilometers, with cooler molecular ions in lower regions. Above the daytime peak a sharp plasmapause was discovered, marking a sudden transition from appreciable ionization concentrations near Venus to the tenuous conditions of the solar wind. This may be indicative of a kind of interaction of the magnetized solar wind with a planetary body that differs from the two different kinds of interaction characterized by Earth and by Moon. For Venus and probably for Mars, the magnetic field of the solar wind may pile up in front of the conducting ionosphere, form an induced magnetosphere that ends at the plasmapause, above which any ionosphere that tends to form is swept away by the shocked solar wind that flows between the stand-off bow-shock and the magnetopause. The neutral atmosphere was also probed and a surface reflection may have been detected, but the data have not yet been studied in detail. Results are consistent with a super-refractive atmosphere, as expected from Soviet measurements near the surface. Thus, two unusual features of Venus can be described in terms of a light trap in the lower atmosphere, and a magnetic trap in the conducting ionosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2063235678,"Activities of beryllium-10 and aluminum-26 dissolved in 200-year-old Greenland ice were found to be 18.4 (+ 8.4, - 4.8) x 10(-6) and 3.2 +/- 0.9 x 10(-7) disintegration per minute per liter, respectively. From these values and the precipitation rate (30 milliliters of water per square centimeter per year), the production rates of these isotopes are calculated to be 3.6 (+ 1.6, - 0.9) x 10(-2) and 1.7 +/- 0.5 x 10(-4) atom per second * square centimeter. These rates agree with the rates calculated for the production of these isotopes by cosmic rays in the atmosphere. Probably all the Al(26) in the ice is accounted for by such atmospheric production; however, an upper limit for the influx of cosmic dust bearing aluminum-26 is calculated at 3.2 x 10(5) tons per year for Earth. Only upper limits could be found for Al(26) and Be(10) in the undissolved particulate matter in the ice; their addition to the activities in the dissolved material leaves our conclusions unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W2030929048,"Two dedicated light flash observing sessions were conducted by one of the crewmen during the Skylab 4 mission. Analyses of his observations reveal a strong correlation between flash frequency and primary cosmic-ray flux, and an even stronger correlation between flash frequency and the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region of the inner belt trapped radiation. Calculations indicate that an all-proton inner belt probably cannot produce the observed SAA flash rate, and they suggest that there may exist a previously unobserved inner belt flux of multiply charged nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W2027520089,"On the basis of the absence of energetic electrons (E(e) 45 kiloelectron volts) and protons (E(p) 320 kiloelectron volts) associated with Venus to within a radial distance of 10,150 kilometers from the center of the planet and using a physical similitude argument and the observational and theoretical knowledge of the magnetosphere of Earth, we conclude that the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment of Venus is almost certainly less than 0.01 and probably less than 0.001 of that of Earth. Corresponding upper limits on the magnetic field at the equatorial surface of Venus are about 350 and 35 x 10(-5) gauss, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2082769058,"The recent report by Likens and Bormann points out the ecological problems that are associated with acid rain. It cannot be disputed that the tall smokestacks introduced in recent years disperse the emitted SO/sub 2/ over a broader area. Whether there has been an increase in acidity in the rainwater of rural areas in the northeastern US has not been documented in the data of Likens and Bormann. The authors, however, do show 70% decrease in SO/sub 4//sup 2 -/ since 1950 in rainwater at Ithaca, New York. This change is probably correctly attributed to the shift in use from coal to natural gas. The statement is made that the drop in the sulfur concentration is difficult to reconcile with the proposed recent increase in acidity. The contention is then made that high particulate loadings from the combustion of coal in the past could have caused neutralization of the acid sulfate. Likens and Bormann further conclude that the installation of particle-removing devices in tall smokestacks eliminates these alkaline substances, consequently permitting appreciable quantities of SO/sub 2/ to be converted to acid. This argument cannot be correct. Modern electrostatic precipitators remove approx. 99% of the ash. This increase in particulate removalmore » is hardly enough to be significant for the enormous difference in neutralization proposed by the authors. Certainly, the introduction of tall smokestacks and particulate-removal devices have reduced the local soot problem. Whether these procedures have altered (positively or negatively) the regional acid problem is an unanswered question.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2057198767,Equipment on Mariner V has yielded values for the masses of Moon and Venus more accurate than any previously reported. Range and Doppler radio tracking data necessary for precise space navigation of the spacecraft from Earth to Venus can also be used to obtain data on the orbits of Earth and Venus.
https://openalex.org/W2083138017,"The existing observational data for the binary pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 are sufficient to give a rather well-defined model for the system. On the basis of evolutionary considerations, the pulsar must be a neutron star near the upper mass limit of 1.2 solar masses (M⊙). The orbital inclination is probably high, i ≳ 70°, and the mass of the unseen companion probably lies close to the upper limit of the range 0.25 M⊙ to 1.0 M⊙. The secondary cannot be a main sequence star and is probably a degenerate helium dwarf. At the 5.6-kiloparsec distance indicated by the dispersion measure, the magnetic dipole model gives an age of ∼4 × 104 years, a rate of change of the pulsar period of P ∼2 nanoseconds per day, and a surface magnetic field strength ∼ ⅓ that of the Crab pulsar. The pulsar is fainter than an apparent magnitude V∼+ 26.5 and is at least ∼80 times fainter than the Crab pulsar in the x-ray band. The companion star should be fainter than V ∼+ 30, and a radio supernova remnant may be detectable near the position of the pulsar at a flux level of ≲10 janskys. Important tests of this model will be provided by more accurate measurement of P and by a careful search for a faint supernova remnant."
