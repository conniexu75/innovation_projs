https://openalex.org/W2044594834,"We conducted a large-scale screen for Drosophila mutants that have structural abnormalities of the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We recovered mutations in wishful thinking (wit), a gene that positively regulates synaptic growth. wit encodes a BMP type II receptor. In wit mutant larvae, the size of the NMJs is greatly reduced relative to the size of the muscles. wit NMJs have reduced evoked excitatory junctional potentials, decreased levels of the synaptic cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II, and synaptic membrane detachment at active zones. Wit is expressed by a subset of neurons, including motoneurons. The NMJ phenotype is specifically rescued by transgenic expression of Wit only in motoneurons. Thus, Wit appears to function as a presynaptic receptor that regulates synaptic size at the Drosophila NMJ."
https://openalex.org/W1999030266,"The degree to which perceptual awareness of threat stimuli and bodily states of arousal modulates neural activity associated with fear conditioning is unknown. We used functional magnetic neuroimaging (fMRI) to study healthy subjects and patients with peripheral autonomic denervation to examine how the expression of conditioning-related activity is modulated by stimulus awareness and autonomic arousal. In controls, enhanced amygdala activity was evident during conditioning to both “seen” (unmasked) and “unseen” (backward masked) stimuli, whereas insula activity was modulated by perceptual awareness of a threat stimulus. Absent peripheral autonomic arousal, in patients with autonomic denervation, was associated with decreased conditioning-related activity in insula and amygdala. The findings indicate that the expression of conditioning-related neural activity is modulated by both awareness and representations of bodily states of autonomic arousal."
https://openalex.org/W1996353639,"We show that information flow through the adult cerebellar cortex, from the mossy fiber input to the Purkinje cell output, is controlled by furosemide-sensitive, diazepam- and neurosteroid-insensitive GABA(A) receptors on granule cells, which are activated both tonically and by GABA spillover from synaptic release sites. Tonic activation of these receptors contributes a 3-fold larger mean inhibitory conductance than GABA released synaptically by high-frequency stimulation. Tonic and spillover inhibition reduce the fraction of granule cells activated by mossy fiber input, generating an increase of coding sparseness, which is predicted to improve the information storage capacity of the cerebellum."

How myosin Va recognizes its cargo (i.e. melanosomes), however, has re- mained undetermined over the past decade. In this study, we discovered Slac2-a/melanophilin to be the “missing link” between myosin Va and GTP-Rab27A present in the melanosome. Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis showed that the N-terminal Slp (synaptotagmin-like protein) homology domain of Slac2-a specifically binds Rab27A/B isoforms and that the C-terminal half directly binds the globular tail of myosin Va. The tripartite protein complex (Rab27A· Slac2-a·myosin Va) in melanoma cells was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation. The discovery that myosin Va indirectly recognizes its cargo through Slac2-a, a novel Rab27A/B effector, should shed light on molecular recognition of its specific cargo by class V myosin.

The SHD1 and SHD2 of Slp3-a and Slp4 are separated by a sequence containing two zinc-finger motifs, whereas Slp1 and Slp2-a lack such zinc-finger motifs, and their SHD1 and SHD2 are linked together (5.Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The SHD has also been found in other proteins, including Slac2-a (Slp homologue lackingC2 domains-a) and Slac2-b/KIAA0624 (11.Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Suyama M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggesting a general role of the SHD in cellular signaling. Two very recent important discoveries have been made concerning the functional relationship between the SHD and Rab27A, one of the small GTP-binding proteins believed to be essential for membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells (12.Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). The first was our discovery that the SHD of the Slp family and Slac2-a directly interact with the GTP-bound form of Rab27A both in vitro and in intact cells (13.Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since mutations in the rab27A gene cause hemophagocytic syndrome (Griscelli syndrome), an uncontrolled T lymphocyte and macrophage activation syndrome in humans (14.Menasche G. Pastural E.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the Slp family and Slac2 are involved in such membrane trafficking (13.Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The second very recent important discovery is the identification of Slac2-a as melanophilin and that a mutation in the mlph gene causes defects in melanosome transport in leaden mice (20.Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10238-10243Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Interestingly ashen mice, which carry a mutation in the rab27A gene, and dilute mice, which carry a mutation in the myosin Va gene, which encodes one of the actin-based motor proteins (21.Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S. Mercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 22.Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), have shown similar defects in pigment granule transport (i.e. clumping of melanosomes in the perinuclear region), and as a result ashen, leaden, and dilute mice all exhibit a similarly lighter coat color (14.Menasche G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat.

In addition, genetic analysis has shown that these three proteins function in the same or overlapping transport pathways (20.Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10238-10243Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), but the functional relationships between these three molecules, Rab27A, Slac2-a/melanophilin, and myosin Va, in melanosome transport remained to be clarified (25.Marks M.S. Seabra M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In this study, we report on two domain structures of Slac2-a, the N-terminal SHD, which specifically interacts with the Rab27A and Rab27B isoforms, and the C-terminal domain, which directly interacts with the globular tail of myosin Va, and we discuss the role of the tripartite protein complex in melanosome transport based on our findings. cDNA encoding a full open reading frame of mouse Rab27B, Rab34, and myosin Va was amplified from Marathon-Ready adult brain cDNA (CLONTECH) by reverse transcriptase PCR as described previously (26.Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The purified PCR products were directly inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Both strands were completely sequenced using a Hitachi SQ-5500 DNA sequencer. We identified one deletion as a result of alternative splicing (deletion of amino acids 1387–1411) and several amino acid differences (R695A, D904E, and V905L) compared with the reported myosin Va sequences (24.Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and they were unlikely to be PCR-induced errors because we found the same differences in at least two independent clones. Addition of the FLAG tag (or T7 tag) to the N terminus of Rab34 (pEF-FLAG-Rab34) or to the N terminus of myosin Va (pEF-T7- or -FLAG-myosin Va) and construction of the expression vector were performed as described previously (26.Fukuda M.

Fukuda, manuscript in preparation. COS-7 cells (5 × 105 cells (the day before transfection)/10-cm dish) were transfected with 4 μg of plasmids as described previously (30.Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ogata Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40319-40325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, cells were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer with 10 strokes at 900–1000 rpm. After solubilization with 1% Triton X-100, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Expressed GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (wet volume, 20 μl; Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After extensively washing the beads with 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100, thrombin (1 unit, Sigma) digestion was performed on the same column at 25 °C for 1 h. The eluate containing FLAG-myosin Va-GT protein (or Rab27A) was then incubated with benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (wet volume, 20 μl; Amersham Biosciences) to remove the thrombin. Protein concentrations were estimated by 10% SDS-PAGE or determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a reference. The purified FLAG-myosin Va-GT protein and Rab27A were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (wet volume, 20 μl) either coupled with T7-GST-Slac2-a or T7-GST alone in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with 1 ml of the binding buffer without recombinant proteins, proteins trapped with the beads were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with horseradish (HRP)-conjugated anti-FLAG tag antibody (Sigma) and anti-Rab27 mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) as described previously (26.Fukuda M.

Cells (10-cm dish) were homogenized in a buffer containing 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors, and proteins were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h. After removal of insoluble material by centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with either anti-Slac2-a IgG (10 μg/ml) or normal rabbit IgG for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads five times with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to 10 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Slac2-a (1:250 dilution), anti-myosin Va (1:100 dilution), or anti-Rab27 monoclonal antibody (1:250 dilution) as described previously (26.Fukuda M.

However, it remained undetermined whether the full-length Slac2-a protein specifically recognizes the Rab27A molecule and whether Rab27A interacts with the SHD alone or also with the large Slac2-a C-terminal domain with unknown function. To address these issues, we first investigated the specific interaction of full-length Slac2-a with various Rab proteins (Rab1, Rab2, Rab3A, Rab4A, Rab5A, Rab6A, Rab7, Rab8, Rab9, Rab10, Rab11A, Rab17, Rab18, Rab20, Rab22, Rab23, Rab25, Rab27A, Rab27B, Rab28, Rab34, or Rab37) in intact cells by co-expression assay (30.Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ogata Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40319-40325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35.Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27670-27676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, T7-tagged Slac2-a and each of the FLAG-tagged Rabs were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, and T7-Slac2-a protein was immunoprecipitated with the anti-T7 antibody-conjugated agarose (26.Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30.Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ogata Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40319-40325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As expected, T7-Slac2-a protein specifically co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-Rab 27A and -Rab27B isoforms but not with other Rabs (Fig. 1, B, lane 18, and D, lane 1). The faint signal observed in Fig. 1B, lane 20, was probably attributable to nonspecific interaction of Rab34 with the agarose beads. Next we investigated the possible involvement of the C terminus of Slac2-a in Rab27A/B binding in the same co-transfection assay. The SHD domain alone efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with both the Rab27A and Rab27B isoforms (Fig. 1, C and D, lane 2), but the C-terminal domain lacking the SHD (Δ146) did not (Fig. 1, C and D, lane 3). In addition, the Slac2-a mutant carrying the SLEWY-to-ALEAA substitutions in SHD2 (referred to as Slac2-a(A4), see Fig. 1A) dramatically reduced the Rab27A/B binding activity (Fig. 1, C and D, lane 4). Consistent with this, crystallographic analysis has shown the corresponding sequence (SGAWFF) in rabphilin-3 directly interacts with Rab3A (36.Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that the SHD of Slac2-a specifically binds Ra27A/B isoforms but that the large C-terminal domain is not involved in the recognition of Rab27A/B molecules and might have different functions. The results of a genetic analysis comparing dilute, ashen, and leaden mice have indicated that myosin Va, Rab27A, and Slac2-a function in the same or overlapping transport pathways in melanosome transport (20.Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10238-10243Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, myosin Va in extracts from melanocytes has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with Rab27A (19.Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Rapak A. Gomes A.Q. Hopkins C.R. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, when FLAG-Rab27A and T7-myosin Va were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, no Rab27A-myosin Va complex was detected in the cell lysates (Fig. 2A, lane 8), indicating that an additional protein must link Rab27A and myosin Va. Since the SHD of Slac2-a specifically binds Rab27A (Fig. 1), we hypothesized that Slac2-a is the missing link between Rab27A and myosin Va in melanosome transport. To test this hypothesis, three proteins (FLAG-Rab27A, T7-Slac2-a, and T7-myosin Va) were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, and their associations were analyzed by immunoprecipitation as described above (26.Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35.Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27670-27676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As expected, in the presence of full-length T7-Slac2-a, T7-myosin Va co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Rab27A (Fig. 2A, lane 5), whereas in the absence of T7-Slac2-a, T7-myosin Va was undetectable in the anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitants (Fig. 2A, lane 8). Interestingly the SHD alone (Slac2-a-SHD) or the C-terminal half alone (Slac2-a-Δ146) failed to mediate co-immunoprecipitation of T7-myosin Va with FLAG-Rab27A (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that different domains of Slac2-a may be involved in Rab27A binding and myosin Va binding. Similar results were obtained when FLAG-Rab27B was used instead of FLAG-Rab27A (data not shown). We next sought to identify the myosin Va-binding site in Slac2-a by dual tag (T7 and FLAG) co-expression assay. When T7-Slac2-a deletion mutants and FLAG-myosin Va were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, T7-Slac2-a-Δ146, but not T7-Slac2-a-SHD, co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-myosin Va (Fig. 2B), indicating the two domain structures of Slac2-a: the N-terminal SHD involved in the GTP-bound form of Rab27A binding and the C-terminal domain involved in myosin Va binding. Since the globular tail of myosin Va was thought to be essential for cargo recognition (21.Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S. Mercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), we investigated the interaction between Slac2-a and the myosin Va globular tail by using the same dual tag (T7 and FLAG) co-expression assay, and as shown in Fig. 3B, Slac2-a-Δ146 interacted with the globular tail of myosin Va in intact cells. We used purified recombinant proteins (GST-Slac2-a (or -Δ146), Rab27A, and FLAG-myosin Va-GT) for an in vitro binding assay to further confirm the direct interaction between the C terminus of Slac2-a and the globular tail of myosin Va as well as the in vitro formation of a tripartite protein complex from purified components. As expected, FLAG-myosin Va-GT bound GST-Slac2-a-Δ146 but not GST alone (Fig. 3C, lane 2, arrow), and full-length Slac2-a bound both FLAG-myosin Va-GT and Rab27A (Fig. 3D, arrows). Lastly, immunoprecipitation analysis was performed to investigate whether the tripartite protein complex (Rab27A·Slac2-a·myosin Va) is formed at physiological conditions. As shown in Fig. 3F, both myosin Va and Rab27A were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Slac2-a-specific antibody (Fig. 3E), but not control IgG, from melanoma cell lysates. Thus, the tripartite protein complex (Rab27A·Slac2-a·myosin Va) demonstrated by in vitro binding experiments should be physiologically relevant. The results of a recent biochemical analysis have suggested that the tail domain of myosin Va (or Vb) recognizes its cargo by directly binding to the proteins present in the cargo (e.g. Rab11, Rab25, and synaptobrevin·synaptophysin complex) (37.Prekeris R. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 38.Cheney R.E. Rodriguez O.C.

Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, since myosin Va did not directly recognize Rab27A in the melanosomes, an additional linker protein was proposed to assist melanosome recognition in melanosome transport (25.Marks M.S. Seabra M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In the present study, we discovered that Slac2-a is a missing link between Rab27A and myosin Va in melanosome transport and demonstrated how myosin Va recognizes its specific cargo (i.e. melanosomes) by its globular tail domain. The possible role of the tripartite protein complex (Slac2-a, Rab27A, and myosin Va) in melanosome capture in actin-rich cell periphery is summarized in Fig. 4. The SHD of Slac2-a specifically binds the GTP-Rab27A in the melanosomes, and the C terminus of Slac2-a binds the globular tail of myosin Va, which binds actin filament via the head domain. Since Slac2-a is expressed in various tissues, including the brain (20.Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10238-10243Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the Slac2-a·Rab27·myosin Va complex may be involved in other types of membrane trafficking. For instance, Slac2-a·Rab27B·myosin Va may be involved in endoplasmic reticulum transport to dendrites in neurons because the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum does not migrate to the postsynaptic spines in dilute mice (40.Takagishi Y.

Further work is necessary to define the universality and/or specialty of the tripartite protein complex, Slac2-a, Rab27A/B, and myosin Va, in membrane trafficking."

https://openalex.org/W2056020456,"Proper synaptic development is critical for establishing all aspects of neural function including learning, memory, and locomotion. Here, we describe the phenotypic consequences of mutations in the wishful thinking (wit) gene, the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate BMP type II receptor. Mutations in wit result in pharate lethality that can be rescued by expression of a wit transgene in motor neurons but not in muscles. Mutant larvae exhibit small synapses, severe defects in evoked junctional potentials, a lower frequency of spontaneous vesicle release, and an alteration in the ultrastructure of synaptic active zones. These results reveal a novel role for BMP signaling in regulating Drosophila neuromuscular junction synapse assembly and activity and may indicate that similar pathways could govern vertebrate synapse development."
https://openalex.org/W2049779229,"A role for ""persistent,"" subthreshold, TTX-sensitive sodium current in driving the pacemaking of many central neurons has been proposed, but this has been impossible to test pharmacologically. Using isolated tuberomammillary neurons, we assessed the role of subthreshold sodium current in pacemaking by performing voltage-clamp experiments using a cell's own pacemaking cycle as voltage command. TTX-sensitive sodium current flows throughout the pacemaking cycle, even at voltages as negative as -70 mV, and this current is sufficient to drive spontaneous firing. When sodium channels underlying transient current were driven into slow inactivation by rapid stimulation, persistent current decreased in parallel, suggesting that persistent sodium current originates from subthreshold gating of the same sodium channels that underlie the phasic sodium current. This behavior of sodium channels may endow all neurons with an intrinsic propensity for rhythmic, spontaneous firing."

The underlying concept, namely telomere maintenance by telomerase, has been demonstrated for 85–90% of human cancer specimens from a large range of different cancer types (6Shay J.W. Bacchetti S.

In contrast, inhibition of telomerase results in telomere-shortening, subsequent growth arrest, and senescence in a wide range of tumor cell lines. This has been demonstrated by expressing a dominant-negative form of telomerase in immortal tumor cell lines (7Zhang X. Mar V. Zhou W. Harrington L. Robinson M.O.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6958-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These data underscore that telomerase may represent a valuable target for novel antitumor therapies. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that acts as a reverse transcriptase (RT)1 by using a small region of its RNA subunit, hTR, as a template for the synthesis of telomeric DNA (9Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 10Harrington L. Zhou W. McPhail T. Oulton R. Yeung D.S. Mar V. Bass M.B. Robinson M.O.

Reverse transcription itself is catalyzed by the telomerase protein subunit, hTERT. Since catalytically active telomerase has been assembled from recombinant hTERT protein andin vitro transcribed hTR (12Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 13Weinrich S.L. Ma R. Pruzan L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W.

In vivo, however, human telomerase exists as a high molecular weight complex with an estimated molecular mass of 1000 KDa (14Ford L.P. Suh J.M. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9084-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Dy V.M. Tesmer M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E.

This large size may be due to the multimeric nature of human telomerase and the association of the telomerase core components, hTERT and hTR, with several telomerase-associated proteins. These diverse proteins may play an important role in telomerase biogenesis, regulation and stability, or may modulate the interaction with telomeres in vivo; however, they are not considered to exert a direct function in catalysis (12Beattie T.L.

In vitro telomerase is able to elongate a short single-stranded DNA in a processive manner by adding multiple TTAGGG repeats to the 3′-end of a suitable DNA primer. Since the enzyme appears to pause after synthesis of each set of six nucleotides representing a single telomeric repeat, a typical pattern of product bands spaced at six-nucleotide intervals is observed. Once the 5′ boundary of the template is copied the DNA substrate is thought to either translocate during processive synthesis, or it may dissociate from the enzyme. Thus, to allow addition of multiple telomeric repeats, translocation and re-initiation must take place after each cycle of template copying. The mechanisms involved are not elucidated yet, but a critical factor could be the dimeric nature of human telomerase with two hTERT and two hTR molecules present per functional telomerase complex (19Wenz C. Enenkel B. Amacker M. Kelleher C. Damm K. Lingner J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3526-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6151-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because of the structural and mechanistic similarity between hTERT and reverse transcriptases, it has been hypothesized that known reverse transcriptase inhibitors may potently inhibit human telomerase. HIV1-RT has been successfully inhibited by nucleoside analogs, which bind to the dNTP binding site (21Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) and by non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTI), which bind to a hydrophobic pocket near the catalytic center resulting in a distortion of the active site (22Gu Z.

However, all NNRTI and nucleoside analog inhibitors of HIV1-RT tested were found to be inactive or to exhibit only weak inhibitory activity toward human telomerase (25Fletcher T.M. Salazar M.

The following steps were carried at 4 °C. 2 mg of HeLa nuclear extract was diluted in a large volume of BCE100 and loaded twice on the column at 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed at 0.5 ml/min with 4 volumes of BCE100 and 3 volumes of BCE250. Most of the proteins were eluted by washing with 4 volumes of BCE500. Telomerase activity was collected as 1-ml fractions by elution with 10 volumes of BCE1000 and dialyzed against BCE100 containing 500 μm 1,4-dithiothreitol and 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The fractions were analyzed for their protein content with a Bradford assay and for telomerase activity in the TRAP assay (33Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. Ho M.D. West P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity was reconstituted with hTERT expressed in insect cells andin vitro transcribed hTR. Recombinant His-tagged hTERT associated with hTR was purified as described previously via specific affinity chromatography with an oligonucleotide directed against the hTR sequence (19Wenz C. Enenkel B. Amacker M. Kelleher C. Damm K. Lingner J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3526-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For the direct telomerase assay with the endogenous telomerase, 10 μl of telomerase-enriched extract was mixed with different concentrations of BIBR1532 in a final volume of 20 μl. After 15-min preincubation on ice, 20 μl of the 2× reaction mixture was added, and the reaction was initiated by transferring the tubes to 37 °C. The final concentrations in the reaction mixture were 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dATP, 1 mm dTTP, 6.3 μm cold dGTP, 15 μCi [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN), 1.25 mm spermidine, 10 units of RNasin, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 2.5 μm TS-primer (5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT, Pharmacia Biosciences). For the recombinant enzyme, 1–7 μl of affinity-purified telomerase (containing less than 0.025 μm hTERT) were assayed in a final volume of 40 μl containing 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.5), 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm spermidine, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dATP, 1 mm dTTP, 2.5 μm dGTP, 15 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and 2.5 μm (TTAGGG)3. The reaction was initiated by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h and stopped by addition of 50 μl of RNase mix (0.1 mg/ml RNaseA (Roche Applied Science)-100 u/ml RNaseT1 (Roche Applied Science) in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3) and 20 mm EDTA) and incubation for 20 min at 37 °C. Samples were deproteinated by adding 50 μl of 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3) and 0.5% w/v SDS, for a 30-min incubation at 37 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and the extension products were analyzed on an 8% (endogenous telomerase) or 12% (recombinant telomerase) polyacrylamide-urea gel. Dried gels were exposed to a Kodak phosphorimager screen, and the results were analyzed via a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The TRAP was performed as described previously (17Schnapp G. Rodi H.P. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. Damm K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3311-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. Ho M.D. West P.L.

In this assay BIBR1532 has no inhibitory effect when added after the telomerase reaction. Unless indicated, the dNTPs were each present at 80 μm and the oligonucleotide primer at 700 nm. The telomerase fraction and BIBR1532 were preincubated for 15 min on ice in reaction buffer. After addition of different concentrations of the variable reactant, the reaction was initiated by incubation at 23 °C for 3–6 min, stopped by heating at 90 °C for 90 s, and kept on ice. Before proceeding with the PCR reaction, the variable reactant was adjusted to a final concentration of 80 μm for each dNTP and 700 nm for the DNA primer. The PCR mix was added, and PCR was performed for 27 cycles (30 min at 94 °C, 30 min at 50 °C, 90 min at 72 °C). The amount of radiolabeled products was either quantified by liquid scintillation counting after precipitation with 5% trichloroacetic acid or on a PhosphorImager after fractionation on a 6% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel. To determine the kinetic constants of BIBR1532 inhibition, TRAP assays were carried out in triplicate in the presence of varying concentrations of substrate and inhibitor. Reactions were performed at linear conditions, and the results of three assays were used for further calculations. The reaction products were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, collected on glass fiber filters (Millipore), and the amount of incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For velocity plots, the incorporated radioactivity (in counts/min) was blotted against the variable substrate.Km values were calculated as the concentration of variable substrate required to reach ½Vmax. The inhibition constants were determined from secondary plots (Lineweaver and Burk). Ki and αKi correspond to the x-intercept of the linear replots slope = f(I) andy-intercept = f(I), respectively. BIBR1532 has been identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of human telomerase (1Damm K. Hemmann U. Garin-Chesa P. Hauel N. Kauffmann I. Priepke H. Niestroj C. Daiber C. Enenkel B. Guilliard B. Lauritsch I. Müller E. Pascolo E. Sauter G. Pantic M. Martens U.M. Wenz C. Lingner J. Kraut N. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6958-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To obtain a better understanding of the mechanism of action exerted by this compound, the mode of telomerase inhibition was adressed in further detail using both native enzyme enriched from HeLa cell nuclear extract as well as recombinant enzyme reconstituted from recombinant hTERT and in vitrotranscribed hTR. The effect of BIBR1532 on telomerase activity was analyzed using two published assay methods, a conventional assay (11Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar) relying on a direct measurement of enzyme activity and the PCR-based TRAP assay (33Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. Ho M.D. West P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar), which includes an amplification step. A shown in Fig.1A, the native enzyme synthesized long extension products in the conventional assay (lane 1). Increasing concentrations of BIBR1532 inhibit this process in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2–5). Calculation of the total signal intensity by PhosphoImager analysis revealed a IC50 value of ∼100 nm. Noticeably, at low concentrations of the inhibitor, the synthesis of long extension products appears to be more affected than the synthesis of shorter products (lanes 1–3). Inhibition of telomerase activity is also observed in a TRAP assay (Fig. 1B,lanes 1–7). Consistent with the result of the conventional primer extension assay, the synthesis of longer products is preferentially inhibited at low concentrations of BIBR1532 (lanes 2–7). To allow a quantification, the intensity of individual extension products was analyzed by PhosphoImaging, and dose-response curves were generated for each product. As shown in Fig.1C, the IC50 value for the shortest product (band 1), which corresponds to the two first cycles of template copying, is ∼750 nm. The formation of the two longest products analyzed (bands 11 and 15) is inhibited with IC50values of 150 nm and 100 nm, respectively. To determine whether BIBR1532 would directly act on the telomerase hTERT-hTR core enzyme, active telomerase was reconstituted by incubating insect cell lysate containing recombinant hTERT within vitro transcribed hTR. Reconstituted telomerase ribonucleoproteins were purified by RNA affinity chromatography, and the eluted enzyme was tested in the conventional primer extension assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, the purified reconstituted enzyme catalyzed the formation of the specific hexanucleotide repeat ladder characteristic for human telomerase (lane 1) with the most prominent product bands corresponding to the first four cycles of template copying. Also this recombinant telomerase was inhibited by BIBR1532 (lanes 4–9). As seen for the native enzyme, the formation of longer products is affected stronger than the formation of the shorter ones (Fig. 2B). The bottom band, which corresponds to the first cycle of template copying (+4), is only weakly inhibited at concentrations of BIBR1532 below 1 μm, whereas the formation of the +16 and +22 products, corresponding to three and four cycles of template copying, respectively, is inhibited with IC50 values of ∼100 nm. Interestingly, even in the presence of high concentrations of BIBR1532, no chain termination events (e.g. the appearance of new intermediate products) were observed. Thus, BIBR1532 does not inhibit the catalytic steps during a single round of template copying. To characterize the mode of inhibition by BIBR1532 as a function of the four substrates required for telomerase activityin vitro, namely, dATP, TTP, dGTP, and a DNA primer, a series of enzyme kinetic experiments were performed. The conditions for the linear phase of primer elongation were determined in an initial experiment in the presence of saturating substrate concentrations and variable amounts of partially purified native telomerase. As shown in Fig. 3A, a linear correlation between reaction time, enzyme concentration, and the generation of telomerase products was observed for incubations below 10 min. Therefore, for the subsequent experiments reaction times between 4 and 6 min were used, and velocity curves were determined for different substrate concentrations in the presence or absence of BIBR1532. As shown in Fig. 3B, a hyperbolic curve was obtained when telomerase activity was plotted as a function of the DNA primer concentration in the absence of the inhibitor (open circles). The maximum enzymatic reaction (Vmax) was reached with primer concentrations above 150 nm. In the presence of increasing amounts of BIBR1532, a clear reduction in Vmax was observed, a feature characteristic for a non-competitive inhibition. At the highest inhibitor concentration tested (1 μm),Vmax was decreased by 60%. The data were used to calculate the Michaelis-Menten constant of the DNA primer in the absence (Km) and in the presence of BIBR1532 (αKm) and to calculate the binding constants of the inhibitor in the absence (Ki) and in the presence (αKi) of the DNA primer. As shown in Fig.3C, the Km and αKm values for the DNA primer were not significantly different, suggesting that BIBR1532 does not affect the binding of the DNA primer to the enzyme. However, a small, but significant, increase of αKi (750 nm) over Ki (500 nm) was observed (Fig.3D), indicating a slightly higher affinity of BIBR1532 to the free enzyme than to the enzyme-DNA primer complex. The velocity curves and the resulting double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk diagrams) were determined for each of the three deoxyribonucleotides in the presence or absence of BIBR1532 (Figs.4 and 5,A–C, respectively). As shown in Fig. 4, A–C, for each of the three dNTPs a pronounced decrease inVmax was observed in the presence of BIBR1532, indicating a non-competitive mode of inhibition for the deoxyribonucleotides also. The Michaelis-Menten constants for each of the three dNTPs increased in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig.4D). At 1 μm BIBR1532, theKm values for dATP (5 μm), TTP (7 μm), and dGTP (14 μm) increased to 11, 14, and 23 μm, respectively (αKm, Fig.4D), suggesting for each dNTP a lower affinity to the telomerase-BIBR1532 complex. The affinity constants of BIBR1532 were calculated to be 250–300 nm for the nucleotide-free enzyme (Ki, Fig. 5D) and 600–800 nmfor a telomerase-dNTP complex (αKi, Fig. 5D). This indicates a tight binding of the drug to the nucleotide-free enzyme and a 2–3-fold lower affinity to each enzyme-dNTP complex. In the corresponding Lineweaver-Burk plots these conditions resulted in the intersection of the control (no inhibitor) and the “plus inhibitor” curves above the 1/[S]-axis, since αKi was larger thanKi (Fig. 5, A–C).Figure 5BIBR1532 is a mixed-type non-competitive inhibitor for the binding of dNTP. A–C, double-reciprocal plot (Lineweaver-Burk) of velocity curves shown in Fig. 4, A–C.

Library W.C. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The definition of the precise mechanism of enzyme inhibition, by pharmaceutically relevant small molecule drug candidates, is of considerable interest as shown for the HIV drugs (22Gu Z. Li Y. Quan Z. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31046-31051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). In this study we show that BIBR1532 targets directly telomerase core components as telomerase reconstituted from hTR and recombinant hTERT is inhibited by BIBR1532 with potencies comparable with the native enzyme derived from tumor cells. In addition, BIBR1532 exhibits a non-competitive mode of inhibition, which is clearly distinct from the inhibition described using nucleosidic compounds or antisense oligonucleotides. Both for the native and the recombinant enzyme our data show that BIBR1532 does not cause chain termination events but rather inhibits the formation of long reaction products. In particular, the inhibitor leads to an overall reduction in the number of added TTAGGG repeats; the periodicity of six nucleotides, however, is conserved. This suggests that BIBR1532 does not block the basic catalytic steps involved in template copying but specifically impairs the elongation of the DNA substrate after its extension to the 5′-end of the template. Thus, BIBR1532 may affect translocation of the enzyme DNA substrate complex or may promote dissociation between DNA substrate and the enzyme upon completion of template copying. As these steps are most likely unique to telomerase, this may explain the high selectivity of the compound. In a more detailed analysis the specific kinetic parameters of inhibition by BIBR1532 were determined. We detected only a slight inhibition of the binding of the DNA primer in the presence of BIBR1532. However, BIBR1532 reduced more than 2-fold the affinity for dNTPs. Conversely, binding of deoxyribonucleotides decreased the affinity of the enzyme for BIBR1532. This inhibition profile corresponds to a mixed-type non-competitive inhibition, in which the enzyme has different, but functionally interdependent, binding sites for deoxyribonucleotides and BIBR1532. Two hypotheses may explain such an interference. First, the binding of the substrate or the drug induces a conformational change of the enzyme structure interfering with the binding of the other molecule. Second, the binding site of the drug and the binding site of the deoxyribonucleotides are in close proximity or overlap, creating therefore a steric reciprocal interference for the binding efficiency. The biochemical data described above do not support an allosteric inhibition profile, and thus we favor the latter hypothesis. Compared with telomerase considerable more details on enzyme structure and function are known about HIV1 reverse transcriptase. The three-dimensional structure of this enzyme is often described as a right hand naming the subdomains as fingers, palm, and thumb, with the catalytic center being located within the palm subdomain (23Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). All three subdomains are important determinants for HIV1-RT processivity. The non-nucleosidic drug nevirapine inhibits preferentially the translocation step of polymerization (22Gu Z. Li Y. Quan Z. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31046-31051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization experiments revealed that nevirapine binds into a deep hydrophobic pocket between the palm and the base of the thumb (the “primer grip”) close to, but not overlapping, with the DNA binding site (23Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Binding of the drug may either induce repositioning of the catalytic aspartic acids or may prevent conformational changes required to complete the catalytic cycle. Although the primary sequence similarity between telomerase and HIV1 reverse transcriptase is low, key features in structure and basic mechanism of catalysis appear similar. For example, it has been shown that point mutations in amino acids that are conserved between TERTs and retroviral reverse transcriptases reduced or abolished activity in both types of enzymes or had similar effects on processivity (13Weinrich S.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46305-46312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, a detailed mutational analysis undertaken to study the processivity of yeast TERT primer grip and thumb subdomain suggested that telomerase, as its retroviral cousin, may contain hydrophobic pockets between the palm and thumb, which also might be available for binding of small molecule inhibitors (39Bosoy D. Lue N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46305-46312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, the apparent similarities in the mechanism of action of nevirapine on HIV1 reverse transcriptase and BIBR1532 on human telomerase together with the structural and mechanistic similarities of both enzymes are intriguing. However, a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of BIBR1532 inhibition will require the crystal structure analysis of the telomerase-inhibitor complex. For HIV1-RT a cooperative inhibitory effect has been observed when nevirapine and nucleosidic analogs were used concomitantly (22Gu Z. Li Y. Quan Z. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31046-31051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be of interest to determine whether inhibition of telomerase by BIBR1532 is potentiated when combined with nucleotide analogs in biochemical in vitro assays. Such cooperativity would increase interest in the discovery of nucleosidic telomerase inhibitors.

Whereas the synaptic mechanisms of gamma oscillations have been studied in detail, the ionic currents involved at the cellular level remain to be elucidated. Here we show that in vitro gamma oscillations induced by muscarine require activation of M1 receptors on hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons and are absent in M1 receptor-deficient mice. M1 receptor activation depolarizes pyramidal neurons by increasing the mixed Na(+)/K(+) current I(h) and the Ca(2+)-dependent nonspecific cation current I(cat), but not by modulation of I(M). Our data provide important insight into the molecular basis of gamma oscillations by unequivocally establishing a novel role for muscarinic modulation of I(h) and I(cat) in rhythmic network activity."
https://openalex.org/W2083712812,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) functions in the catabolism of numerous ligands including proteinases, proteinase inhibitor complexes, and lipoproteins. In the current study we provide evidence indicating an expanded role for LRP in modulating cellular signaling events. Our results show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB induces a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain in a process dependent on PDGF receptor activation and c-Src family kinase activity. Other growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, were unable to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP. The basis for this selectivity may result from the ability of LRP to bind PDGFBB, because surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated that only PDGF, and not basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor-1, bound to purified LRP immobilized on a sensor chip. The use of LRP mini-receptor mutants as well as in vitro phosphorylation studies demonstrated that the tyrosine located within the second NPXY motif found in the LRP cytoplasmic domain is the primary site of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and Src family kinases. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of LRPs cytoplasmic domain results in increased association of the adaptor protein Shc with LRP and that Shc recognizes the second NPXY motif within LRPs cytoplasmic domain. In the accompanying paper, Boucher et al. (Boucher, P., Liu, P. V., Gotthardt, M., Hiesberger, T., Anderson, R. G. W., and Herz, J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 15507–15513) reveal that LRP is found in caveolae along with the PDGF receptor. Together, these studies suggest that LRP functions as a co-receptor that modulates signal transduction pathways initiated by the PDGF receptor."

Although conflicting and opposing results have been reported on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation depending on the osteoblast model used, the most noticeable effects of TGF-β on human osteoblasts are stimulation of proliferation and bone matrix protein deposition, although it depresses the synthesis of osteocalcin (4Mundy G.R.

In addition to the effects on osteoblast growth and differentiation, both BMP-2 and TGF-β can induce osteoblast chemotaxis, which is essential for bone formation to occur (4Mundy G.R. Ciba Found.

Recently, Smad signaling has been well characterized to mediate TGF-β and BMP-2 activity in a variety of cells, including osteoblasts (20Massague J. Wotton D.

Upon binding to their respective receptors, pathway-specific Smad proteins (Smad1 and Smad5 for BMP-2; Smad2 and Smad3 for TGF-β) are activated and form complexes with Smad4. These complexes are subsequently transported into nucleus where they exert gene regulation either directly or indirectly. Although Smad signal transduction pathways appear to be the major mediators for TGF-β and BMP-2, other signaling molecules, such as Ras and MAPK, are also activated by these two factors in various cell systems (26Mulder K.M. Cytokine Growth Factor. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 27Tu J. Li Y. Lou S. Manske P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the induction of collagen and fibronectin and the suppression of cell proliferation by TGF-β are maintained in Smad4-null cancer cells and fibroblasts (28Sirard C. Kim S. Mirtsos C.

Carcinog. 1999; 26: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These combined data suggest that one or more Smad-independent signaling mechanisms also mediate TGF-β and BMP-2 activity. In osteoblasts, both BMP-2 and TGF-β stimulate the expression of c-Fos, an AP-1 component (31Subtamaniam M. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Ohta S. Hiraki Y. Shigeno C. Suzuki F. Kasai R. Ikeda T. Kohno H. Lee K. Kikuchi H. Konishi J. Bentz H. Rosen D.M. Yamamuro T.

Because Ras is the upstream effector of Fos and MAPK, and AP-1-responsive element is present in the promoters of major bone matrix proteins such as type I collagen, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and fibronectin, the induction of Ras/MAPK/AP-1 appears to be an important signal transduction pathway in mediating part of the effects of BMP-2 and TGF-β in osteoblasts. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of BMP-2 and TGF-β on the activity of Ras, MAPK, and AP-1 in normal human osteoblastic cells (HOB). It has been shown that the interaction between Smad proteins and AP-1 components are critical in TGF-β function (34Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 35Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

No information, however, is available as to whether this interaction is also essential in BMP-2 function. Therefore, the relationship between AP-1 and the Smad signaling induced by TGF-β and BMP-2 in osteoblasts and the roles of ERK and p38 MAPK in the regulation of osteoblast function by TGF-β and BMP-2 were investigated. TGF-β2 and BMP-2 were generously provided by Dr. Nico C. Cerletti (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) and Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA), respectively.

Polyethyleneimine cellulose plate coated with a fluorescence indicator was from J. T. Baker Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ). PD98059 and SB203580 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The rest of the reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Normal human osteoblastic cells (HOB) were isolated as described previously (37Cheng S.L. Lecanda F. Davidson M.K. Warlow P.M. Zhang S.F. Zhang L. St. Suzuki S. John T. Civitelli R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 633-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, trabecular bone chips were scraped out of ribs and digested with collagenase for 2 h. The remaining bone chips were cultured for 4–6 weeks in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium nutrient mixture F-12 Ham’s containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS). HOB outgrew from bone chips were subcultured into α-minimum Eagle’s medium (α-MEM) with 10% HIFBS. Only the first and second passaged cells were used for assays. The murine osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, which exhibits similar property as HOB, was employed for transfection experiment, because HOB were difficult to transfect consistently. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-MEM with 10% HIFBS. MC3T3-E1 cell lines stably expressing dominant negative Smad3 (Smad3m), Smad4 (Smad4m), Samd5 (Smad5m), or empty vector pcDNA3 were generated as described previously (23Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D.

HOB were incubated overnight in phosphate-free α-MEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Fresh phosphate-free α-MEM medium and [32P]phosphate (300 μCi/100-mm dish) were added, and the incubation continued for 3 h. At the end of incubation period, cells were treated with vehicle (Control), BMP-2 (100 ng/ml), or TGF-β (1 ng/ml) for the indicated period of time followed by lysis in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 16 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Aliquots (∼500 μl) of the lysates containing equal radioactivity were incubated overnight with 5 μl of monoclonal anti-Ras antibody and 10 μl of anti-mouse IgG on a rotating platform. The immune complex was extracted by Protein A-Sepharose (60 μl) and applied to thin-layer chromatography using a polyethyleneimine cellulose plate coated with fluorescent indicator and developed with 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.5, as described (39Vaillancourt R.R. Harwood A.E. Winitz S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). [32P]GTP and [32P]GDP on the plates were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometric analysis using ISS SepraScan 2001 (Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA). Ras activity was determined by the ratio of [32P]GTP over the sum of [32P]GTP and [32P]GDP. Nuclear extracts of HOB, which were previously treated with BMP-2, TGF-β, or vehicle for the indicated period of time, were prepared as described (38Lai C.-F. Feng X. Nishimura R. Teitelbaum S.L. Avioli L.V. Ross F.P. Cheng S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36400-36406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer consisting of 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.6% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min. After microcentrifugation, pellets were extracted with high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) to obtain nuclear extracts. Protein concentration in the nuclear extracts was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), radioactive double-stranded consensus oligonucleotide for AP-1 or AP-1 mutant, labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, was incubated with nuclear extracts (2 μg) and binding buffer (final concentration, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 4% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) at room temperature for 20 min as described previously (40Feng X. Teitelbaum S.L. Quiroz M.E. Cheng S.L. Lai C.F. Avioli L.V. Ross F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8331-8340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Assays were terminated by the addition of 1 μl of loading buffer. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis using 4–20% polyacrylamide gels in 0.3× Tris borate-EDTA buffer (26.7 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 0.6 mm EDTA) at 100 V for 2.5 h at room temperature. Gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed. For competitive EMSA or antibody supershift assays, 100-fold of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (1.75 pmol) or the indicated antibody (1 μg) was incubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min before the addition of radioactive probe. Nuclear extracts, obtained as described above, or the whole cell lysates in MAPK assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Sigma)) or in cadherin lysis buffer consisted of 0.5% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, and protease inhibitors (2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenanthroline, 0.12 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 40 μg/ml each of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone and bestatin, 50 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, chymostatin, and iodoacetamide) were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes. Western analysis was performed by incubating the membranes with the indicated primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody according to the rapid detection protocol provided by Millipore. Immune complexes on the membranes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL kit. To detect the association of AP-1 components with Smad proteins, MAPK assay buffer-diluted nuclear extracts (100 μg of protein) were first immunoprecipitated with anti-Smad4 antibody (sc-7966) followed by extraction with protein G-Sepharose. The extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with anti-c-Fos, FosB/ΔFosB, and JunB antibody. MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran for promoter activity analysis as described previously (41Cheng S.L. Lai C.F. Fausto A. Chellaiah M. Feng X. McHugh K.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Civitelli R. Hruska K.A. Ross F.P. Avioli L.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at high density (150,000/well) onto 24-well plates in α-MEM medium containing 10% HIFBS. Eighteen hours later, cells were transfected with 2 μg/ml pAP1-Luc and 0.7 μg/ml CMVβ-gal plasmid using DEAE-dextran and a 90-s shock with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. After 24-h recovery in growth medium, cells were treated with vehicle, BMP-2 (100 ng/ml), or TGF-β (1 ng/ml) in medium containing 0.2% HIFBS for another 24 h. Cells were then lysed in reporter lysis buffer and AP-1 activity determined by measuring the luciferase activity using Optocomp II Luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT). Luciferase activity was normalized with the β-galactosidase activity in extract, which was measured using the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer kit. To determine the role of Smad proteins on AP-1 activity, cells were transfected with pAP1-Luc together with the indicated Smad expression vectors (23Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and MEKK expression vector (pFC-MEKK). Luciferase activity was measured as described above after 24-h incubation. To analyze the role of ERK and p38 on osteocalcin promoter activity, MC3T3 E1 cells were transfected with rat osteocalcin promoter (−637/+32) using the LipofectAMINE method according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After preincubation with Me2SO, PD98059, or SB203580 for 30 min, cells were treated with TGF-β and BMP-2 in the presence or absence of inhibitor for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured as described above. Cell lysates extracted using the cadherin lysis buffer described above were sonicated in a Fisher dismembrator. Alkaline phosphatase activity in the sonicates was measured as described previously (38Lai C.-F. Feng X. Nishimura R. Teitelbaum S.L. Avioli L.V. Ross F.P. Cheng S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36400-36406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test. Each experiment was performed at least twice. The data were presented as means ± S.E. Exposure of HOB to BMP-2 for 5 and 10 min resulted in an increased Ras activity to 5- and 12-fold of the control level, respectively (Fig.1). TGF-β also activated Ras activity to 4-fold of the control level after 5-min exposure, which tapered off after 10 min (Fig. 1). Because Ras can activate ERK of the MAPK superfamily, we next examined the effect of BMP-2 and TGF-β on ERK activity. BMP-2 stimulated ERK activity 5-fold after 1 h of incubation as demonstrated by the increased phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) level relative to the total ERK level (pan-ERK) (Fig. 2A). The stimulation of ERK activity by BMP-2, however, was nearly over after 6 h (Fig. 2A). In contrast, TGF-β only marginally stimulated ERK activity after 1 h of incubation, which became remarkable after 6 h (5-fold, Fig. 2B). Because JNK and p38 also belong to the MAPK superfamily (42Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 43Cobb M.H. Prog.

Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of BMP-2 and TGF-β on their activity. As shown in Fig.3A, BMP-2 stimulated p38 and ERK activity, but not JNK activity, after 1-h incubation. Two hours after incubation with BMP-2, the stimulation of ERK persisted and JNK was activated, whereas p38 was no longer activated. TGF-β had little effect on ERK, JNK, and p38 activity after 1 h (Fig.3B). Two hours after addition of TGF-β, JNK and p38, but not ERK, were activated (Fig. 3B). Thus, BMP-2 and TGF-β stimulated ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK activities differentially, depending on the length of treatment.Figure 3BMP-2 and TGF -β stimulate ERK , JNK , and p38 activity in HOB. HOB were treated with vehicle (C), BMP-2 (B, 100 ng/ml), or TGF-β (T, 1 ng/ml) for 1 or 2 h. Nuclear extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis and probed for the active phosphorylated forms of ERK (p-ERK), JNK (p-JNK), and p38 (p-p38).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because components in the AP-1 complex serve as substrates for MAPK (45Murakami M. Ui M.H. Sonobe M. Kabuyama Y. Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. Iba H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 46Michael K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of BMP-2 and TGF-β on AP-1 activity. Using a pAP1-Luc plasmid, which carries a seven-tandem AP-1 enhancer element to transfect MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, TGF-β and BMP-2 were found to stimulate AP-1 activity to 3.2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, of the control level (Fig. 4A,thin-striped columns). Moreover, preincubation of cells with PD98059, which is a specific inhibitor of ERK upstream effector MEK, for 30 min before treatment with growth factors only partially inhibited the stimulation induced by TGF-β and BMP-2 (reduced to 2.4- and 2.0-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4A, dark columns). PD98059 was functional in our system, because it completely abolished the TGF-β-mediated stimulation of ERK activity without affecting the increase in nuclear Smad level (Fig.4B). Similarly, incubation of osteoblasts with p38 inhibitor SB203580 led to a partial reduction on the -fold stimulation induced by TGF-β (from 2.1- to 1.4-fold) and BMP-2 (from 2.5- to 2.2-fold) (Fig.4C). These combined data suggested that both ERK and p38 of MAPK superfamily were involved in the up-regulation of AP-1 activity by TGF-β and BMP-2. Stimulation of AP-1 activity by these two growth factors was further confirmed by EMSA. Nuclear extracts derived from TGF-β- and BMP-2-treated HOB exhibited higher binding activity to the radiolabeled double-stranded AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide than the control extracts (Fig. 5, left). This binding was AP-1-specific, because it was blocked only by the non-labeled AP-1, but not NFκB, consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 5,left). Furthermore, no complex formation was detected in all the samples tested when a mutated AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide (AP-1m) was used as the radiolabeled probe (Fig. 5,right). It has been well documented that members of Fos/Jun and CREB/ATF-2 families can bind to the AP-1-responsive element (47McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Kundu R. Harrison R.J. Dobner P.R. Stein J.L. Lian J.B.

We next examined the components in AP-1 complex that were regulated by TGF-β and BMP-2. Incubation of nuclear extracts, which were obtained 6 h after exposure to TGF-β, with antibodies against FosB/ΔFosB, Fra-2, and JunB led to retardation of the migration of AP-1·DNA complex in EMSA (Fig.6A, bottom panel,arrows). Because the intensity of these supershifted bands was higher in TGF-β-stimulated samples than those in the control samples, these results suggested that TGF-β up-regulated the activity of FosB/ΔFosB, Fra-2, and JunB. Although antibody to JunD also produced supershifted bands (Fig. 6A, top panel), no difference was detected in their intensity between the control and TGF-β-treated samples. Thus, TGF-β did not affect JunD activity after 6-h stimulation. Judging from the remaining AP-1·DNA band intensity after incubation with specific antibodies against c-Fos, c-Jun, and ATF-2, TGF-β had either very little or no effect on the activities of these AP-1 components 6 h after treatment (Fig.6A, top panel). When nuclear extracts were preincubated with anti-Fra-1 antibody before the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe, the remaining AP-1·DNA band intensity in the TGF-β-treated sample was reduced as compared with the sample in which no antibody was added (Fig.6A, top panel, compare lanes 7 and8 with lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Because anti-c-Fos and anti-ATF2 antibodies did not alter the AP-1·DNA band intensities in the TGF-β-treated samples under the same experimental condition (Fig. 6A), the reduction of the AP-1·DNA band intensity in TGF-β-treated sample by anti-Fra-1 antibody appeared to be specific. This suggested that Fra-1 was stimulated by TGF-β, because more Fra-1·Jun complexes were removed from this sample than the control. The absence of a supershifted band in the presence of anti-Fra-1 antibody despite a prolonged exposure to x-ray films (data not shown) may derive from the destabilization of the Fra-1·DNA complex by this antibody as a result of antibody competition with the oligonucleotide probe for Fra-1 or alteration of the conformation of Fra-1 by antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2078894227,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 (PGC-1) is a tissue-specific coactivator that enhances the activity of many nuclear receptors and coordinates transcriptional programs important for energy metabolism. We describe here a novel PGC-1-related coactivator that is expressed in a similar tissue-specific manner as PGC-1, with the highest levels in heart and skeletal muscle. In contrast to PGC-1, the new coactivator shows high receptor specificity. It enhances potently the activity of estrogen receptor (ER) α, while having only small effects on other receptors. Because of its nuclear receptor selectivity, we have termed the new protein PERC (PGC-1 related EstrogenReceptor Coactivator). We show here that the coactivation function of PERC relies on a bipartite transcriptional activation domain and two LXXLL motifs that interact with the AF2 domain of ERα in an estrogen-dependent manner. PERC and PGC-1 are likely to have different functions in ER signaling. Whereas PERC acts selectively on ERα and not on the second estrogen receptor ERβ, PGC-1 coactivates strongly both ERs. Moreover, PERC and PGC-1 show distinct preferences for enhancing ERα in different promoter contexts. Finally, PERC enhances the ERα-mediated response to the partial agonist tamoxifen, while PGC-1 modestly represses it. The two coactivators are likely to mediate distinct, tissue-specific responses to estrogens.

Nuclear receptors are ligand-regulated transcription factors with a broad range of functions in development, physiology, and behavior. They include steroid hormone receptors for glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progestins, estrogens, and androgens, as well as receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoids, vitamin D, and intermediary metabolites (1.Mangelsdorf D.J.

DNA-bound receptors can activate the expression of genes in the vicinity of HREs, via two transcriptional activation functions, denoted AF1 and AF2. AF1 lies in the N-terminal part of the receptors and varies significantly from one receptor to another. AF2 is located at the conserved ligand binding domain (LBD) and relies on an agonist ligand-induced protein conformation (2.Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P.

Depending on cellular and promoter context, AF1 and AF2 act independently or synergistically to regulate gene expression.A large number of proteins that interact with the AF2 domain and enhance the activity of nuclear receptors have been identified (reviewed in Refs. 6.Freedman L.P.

Most of these coactivators harbor one or multiple LXXLL motifs (L being leucine and X any amino acid) within short amphipathic helices (13.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G.

These LXXLL motifs, also called NR boxes, interact with a hydrophobic pocket of the ligand-activated LBD of the receptors, thereby recruiting the coactivators to target DNA sites (15.Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 16.Nolte R.T.

The diverse coactivators are then thought to regulate transcription via enzymatic modification of chromatin or other transcription proteins, and/or physical recruitment of components of the transcriptional machinery (reviewed in Refs. 6.Freedman L.P.

The multitude of nuclear receptor coactivators suggests that at least some of them carry distinct and specific functions. They may do so by interacting with specific subsets of receptors, acting in selective cell types, directing receptor function to subsets of target genes or conferring regulation by other signals.Of the so far identified AF2 coactivators, most interact with many, if not all, nuclear receptors. Although particular LXXLL motifs of SRC-1, TIF2, and SRC-3 display preferences for specific receptors, the three p160 coactivators can enhance the activity of most nuclear receptors (18.Wong C.W. Komm B. Cheskis B.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19.Suen C.S. Berrodin T.J. Mastroeni R. Cheskis B.J. Lyttle C.R. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27645-27653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). CBP and p300 are general coactivators, not only of nuclear receptors but also of many nonreceptor transcription factors (7.Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AF2 coactivators that display receptor specificity include NRIF3, PELP1, CAPER, and CITED1. NRIF3 enhances selectively the activity of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), without affecting the glucocorticoid (GR), estrogen (ER) or vitamin D receptors (9.Li D. Desai-Yajnik V. Lo E. Schapira M. Abagyan R. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7191-7202Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The other three receptor-selective coactivators potentiate preferentially the activity of the two ERs, ERα and ERβ (10.Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol.

None of the ER-specific AF2 coactivators described so far distinguish between ERα and ERβ, receptors that bind similar ligands and carry distinct biological functions (20.Hall J.M. Couse J.F.

One of them is PGC-1, which is expressed at high levels in tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brown fat (22.Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M.

PGC-1 expression is induced also in a tissue-specific manner, in response to particular physiological states such as exposure to cold or fasting (22.Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M.

PGC-1 interacts with and enhances the activity of many nuclear receptors, like the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) α and γ, TR, GR, ERα, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), as well as nonreceptor transcription factors like the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) (22.Puigserver P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of PGC-1, not shared by other nuclear receptor coactivators, is its C-terminal domain. It harbors sequence motifs typical of RNA processing regulators and has been implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing (31.Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).The existence of sequence-related coactivators, such as the three p160 SRC proteins, or CBP and p300, may reflect the evolutionary adaptation of duplicated genes to similar but distinct biological functions. Recently, a PGC-1 relatedcoactivator (PRC) that is ubiquitously expressed and enhances the activity of NRF1 was described (32.Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a third member of the family. PERC (PGC-1 related estrogen receptorcoactivator) is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and displays a striking preference for functional interactions with ERα among the nuclear receptors.DISCUSSIONWe report here the cloning and characterization of PERC, a new member of the PGC-1 family of proteins and a coactivator of ERα. In contrast to PGC-1, which activates many nuclear receptors, PERC shows a unique receptor selectivity. It potently enhances the ligand-dependent activity of ERα, while having only minimal effects on the activity of the related receptor ERβ or other nuclear receptors tested here. Furthermore, PERC and PGC-1 confer distinct properties to ERα signaling. Thus, the relative activities of the two coactivators may contribute to the specific profiles of estrogen responses in different tissues.PERC, PGC-1, and the recently described PRC (32.Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) define a new, small family of coactivators. The conserved features of the family reside primarily in the N- and C-terminal domains, which carry the effector functions of these coactivators: activation of transcription and regulation of pre-mRNA processing (24.Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 28.Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Thus, the three coactivators are likely to employ similar mechanisms to mediate their biological functions. Whether PERC, which lacks the RS domain of PGC-1, is able to regulate RNA processing has to be addressed in future experiments. PERC, PGC-1, and PRC also share sequence similarities outside the effector domains: the LXXLL motifs that enable interactions with nuclear receptors and additional small conserved motifs that may represent interaction surfaces for other transcription factors or regulators (Fig. 1). At the same time, the significant sequence divergence, particularly in the unique central domains of the proteins, suggests that the three members of the family have acquired unique functions and roles.The mechanism by which the N-terminal AD of PERC regulates transcription is not clear yet. The corresponding region of PGC-1 can interact with SRC-1 and CBP, suggesting that it acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of other coactivators (41.Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Our studies here indicate a bipartite AD that contacts more than one target. The reduced transcriptional activity of the L1A mutant points to the conserved motif L1 as one of the interaction surfaces. An additional contact must reside in the first 90 aa, which are essential and sufficient for transcriptional activation. Neither SRC-1 nor CBP overexpression enhanced PERC transcriptional activity, implicating targets other than these two coregulators. Since PGC-1 and PERC are strong activators of transcription in yeast, which do not have SRC-1 or CBP, it seems likely that the N-terminal ADs can contact evolutionary conserved components of the transcriptional machinery (24.Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). 2D. Kressler and A. Kralli, unpublished observations. Delineation of the exact interaction surfaces of PGC-1, PRC, and PERC, as well as identification of the proteins they contact, will shed light on the mechanisms by which these ADs act.An important feature of the PGC-1 family is the presence of LXXLL motifs, which mediate interactions with the LBDs of nuclear receptors. PERC has two canonical LXXLL motifs: NR1, which is conserved in PGC-1 and PRC, and NR2, which is unique to PERC (28.Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 30.Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D. Spiegelman B.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3738-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 42.Knutti D. Kressler D. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9713-9718Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Both NR boxes contribute to the physical interaction with ERα and to efficient coactivation of this receptor. Notably, the presence of NR1 depends on the inclusion of the small exon 4. The detection of two PERC isoforms, with and without this exon, and the decreased ability of the short PERC-s to activate ERα, suggest that regulation of this alternative splicing event could be used to modulate ERα signaling. Interestingly, the mouse homolog of PERC, which was recently described as PGC-1β, harbors an additional LXXLL motif that is upstream of NR1 (aa 140–144) and not conserved in the human protein (33.Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1645-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We do not know yet whether this third motif functions as a nuclear receptor interaction domain, and if so, whether it enables functional interactions with ERα or other receptors. Although no data have been presented yet on the ability of the mouse protein to coactivate the different receptors we have tested here, it is possible that the mouse and human homologs may have diverged in their nuclear receptor specificity.Our experiments demonstrate clearly that PERC is a coactivator of ERα. The fact that this coactivation function depends on a physical interaction between the LXXLL motifs of PERC and the AF2 domain of ERα raises the question of why PERC has only minor effects on many other nuclear receptors that harbor similar AF2 domains. The reason for this receptor selectivity is not clear, particularly since PERC can interact physically with other ligand-activated receptors, such as GR.2 One possible explanation is that the affinity of the GR-PERC interaction is lower than that of GR with other endogenous AF2 coactivators. If so, PERC may not get recruited efficiently at GR target sites. An alternative explanation is that the physical interaction mediated by the PERC NR boxes and the receptor AF2 binding pocket is a necessary, but not sufficient, step for coactivation. Coactivators have been proposed to undergo conformational changes subsequent to docking to transcription factors. These changes may enable their enzymatic activities or the recruitment of additional regulators (41.Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 43.Soutoglou E. Viollet B. Vaxillaire M. Yaniv M. Pontoglio M. Talianidis I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similarly, the conformation of nuclear receptors may change upon interaction with coactivators. Thus, specificity in the functional interaction between PERC and ERα could be due to conformational changes subsequent to binding that may activate either PERC, by unmasking its AD, or ERα, by enabling its AF1 activity. Consistent with an activation step for PERC, we have observed that deletion of C-terminal and central domains of PERC result in a much more potent transcriptional regulator (Fig. 6). It seems likely that the PERC AD is masked in the context of the full-length protein, similar to what has been shown for PGC-1 (41.Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar).Besides their differences in nuclear receptor specificity, PERC and PGC-1 display distinct preferences for the promoter context in which they enhance ERα activity. The two types of EREs we have tested, a vERE and a synthetic cERE, contain the same consensus core but differ in the flanking sequences. Such differences have been shown before to influence ERα-ERE interactions (44.Driscoll M.D. Sathya G. Muyan M. Klinge C.M. Hilf R. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Moreover, the vitellogenin fragment includes additional 5′ sequences, where a second, nonconsensus ERE can be discerned (−312 to −298 nucleotides, relative to transcription initiation). Finally, due to the difference in the length of the flanking sequences, the dimerized elements vERE×2 and cERE×2 present ERα binding sites with different spacing. Thus, multiple properties, such as flanking sequences, the presence of additional nonconsensus sites, and the spacing between EREs, may account for the distinct utilization of PERC and PGC-1 at the different promoters. Notably, PERC seems to prefer promoters with multiple sites, such as the dimerized EREs, or the C3 promoter that has at least three EREs (40.Norris J.D. Fan D. Wagner B.L. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Different response elements may induce distinct nuclear receptor conformations and thereby influence either the recruitment of the coactivators or the activity of the recruited coactivators (45.Takeshita A. Yen P.M. Ikeda M. Cardona G.R. Liu Y. Koibuchi N. Norwitz E.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

In a cell and promoter context where tamoxifen is an agonist, PERC enhances this agonist activity, while PGC-1 represses it. In this respect, PERC acts like the p160 coactivators, which can enhance the agonist activity of tamoxifen (47.Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol.

PGC-1 cannot do so, at least in the context of the C3 promoter in U2OS cells. Because of its antagonist activity in the mammary gland, tamoxifen is used to treat estrogen-dependent breast tumors. Many of these tumors develop resistance to tamoxifen and some start recognizing it as an agonist (reviewed in Ref. 39.McDonnell D.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the nature, as well as the relative levels of different AF2 coactivators, may determine the cellular response to tamoxifen. Evaluation of PERC and PGC-1 levels in breast tumors will be important to test whether these two coactivators contribute to the responsiveness, or lack of, to endocrine therapy.PERC mRNA distribution is very similar to that of PGC-1. PGC-1 function in heart, muscle, and liver may mediate physiological state signals to tissue-specific transcriptional activation of proteins that regulate energy and glucose homeostasis. For example, in response to exposure to cold, PGC-1 induces the expression of uncoupling proteins and stimulates energy expenditure in brown fat and muscle, while in response to fasting, it stimulates gluconeogenesis in liver (Refs. 26.Yoon J.C.

The similar expression profile of PERC may be indicative of a second pathway that relates energy needs to specific metabolic responses, possibly under different regulatory input and with a different outcome. This could increase specificity and flexibility of the transcriptional responses. Estrogens can have profound effects on systems other than the reproductive"
https://openalex.org/W1983376590,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene family represents a class of multifunctional, endocytic cell surface receptors. Recently, roles in cellular signaling have also emerged. For instance, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and the apolipoprotein receptor-2 (apoER2) function in a developmental signaling pathway that regulates the lamination of cortical layers in the brain and involves the activation of tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic domain of the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) was found to be a substrate for the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src, but the physiological significance of this phosphorylation event remained unknown. Here we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP occurs in caveolae and involves the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor β and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Receptor-associated protein, an antagonist of ligand binding to LRP, and apoE-enriched β-VLDL, a ligand for LRP, reduce PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain. In the accompanying paper (Loukinova, E., Ranganathan, S., Kuznetsov, S., Gorlatova, N., Migliorini, M., Ulery, P. G., Mikhailenko, I., Lawrence, D. L., and Strickland, D. K. (2002) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 277, 15499–15506) Loukinova <i>et al.</i>further demonstrate that one form of PDGF, PDGF-BB, binds specifically to LRP and that phosphorylation of LRP requires the activation of Src family kinases. Taken together, these findings provide a biochemical basis for a cellular signaling pathway that involves apoE and LRP."

In this study, we demonstrate that apoptosis results from the exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells to DOX and that the apoptotic cell death is accompanied by a significant increase in cellular iron (55Fe) uptake and activation of iron regulatory protein-1.

It was postulated that iron needed to catalyze intracellular radical reactions originated from mitochondrial aconitase or ferritin, the intracellular iron storage protein (16.Thomas C.E. Aust S.D.

Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).Previously it has been shown that cellular iron is regulated by the cell surface transferrin receptor (TfR)-mediated uptake of iron as transferrin iron (21.Klausner R.D.

Exposure of murine fibroblasts to hydrogen peroxide decreased ferritin synthesis and enhanced the expression of TfR mRNA (24.Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), implicating a possible link between oxidant generation and TfR-mediated iron regulation.In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the TfR-dependent uptake of iron is responsible for DOX-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells. The results from this study show that an anti-TfR monoclonal antibody (42/6) dramatically blocked DOX-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells, suggesting that the TfR-dependent influx of extracellular iron is responsible for mediating DOX-induced apoptosis. DOX-induced iron uptake was inhibited by the pretreatment of cells with cell-permeable antioxidants and iron chelators. The biological implications of oxidant-induced iron signaling in endothelial cells are discussed.DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that DOX-mediated apoptosis in endothelial cells is accompanied by a significant increase in TfR-mediated uptake of transferrin iron and that blockade of iron uptake by an anti-transferrin receptor antibody abolishes DOX-induced apoptosis. In addition, TfR-mediated iron uptake and apoptotic signaling are mitigated by antioxidants that inhibit DOX-dependent intracellular oxidant generation. These findings place the TfR as a “gatekeeper” for iron uptake by BAEC and act as an effective modulator of apoptotic signaling initiated by DOX.Role of Iron in DOX-induced Toxicity and Apoptosis: Old and New PerspectivesThe possible involvement of iron in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity was demonstrated in the early 1970s when a series of nonpolar derivatives of EDTA, including a bis-ketopiperazine derivative (ICRF-187 or dexrazoxane), was reported to prevent DOX-mediated cardiac damage and myocardial dysfunction in an isolated perfused heart model and in whole animals (53.Herman E.H. Ferrans V.J. Myers C.E. Van Vleet J.F. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 276-281PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that DOX semiquinone and superoxide anion derived from redox activation of DOX could mobilize iron from ferritin or aconitase (16.Thomas C.E. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17.Minotti G. Cairo G. Monti E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 18.Thomas C.E. Morehouse C.A. Aust S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3275-3280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that the secondary alcohol metabolite of DOX could cause the release of iron from cytosolic fractions of myocardial tissues (54.Minotti G. Recalcati S. Mordente A. Liberi G. Calafiore A.M. Mancuso C. Preziosi P. Cairo G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). DOX itself can form iron complexes (iron binding constant, ∼1018) under acidic conditions, and this preformed complex has been shown to oxidize lipids, protein, and DNA (55.Myers C.E. Gianni L. Simone C.B. Klecker R. Greene R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1707-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 56.Muindi J.R. Sinha B.K. Gianni L. Myers C.E. FEBS Lett. 1984; 172: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The current thinking is that DOX modifies the cellular iron-induced redox signaling through oxidative modification of aconitase (17.Minotti G. Cairo G. Monti E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,23.Gehring N.H. Hentze M.W. Pantopoulos K. J. Biol.

Exposure of hydroperoxides to murine B6 fibroblasts increased the expression of the TfR mRNA, because of the induction of a 98-kDa, cytosolic iron regulatory protein (IRP-1) (24.Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 25.Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This process also leads to the reduced synthesis of ferritin, an intracellular iron storage protein, which triggers a signal for increased iron uptake. Quinone-induced oxidative stress has also been reported to induce iron signaling via IRP-1 (25.Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Treatment of murine B6 fibroblasts with a redox-active quinone such as menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone or vitamin K3) activated IRP-1 binding to IREs through increased generation of intracellular oxidants (25.Pantopoulos K.

However, the IRP-1 response in cells treated with extracellular and intracellular H2O2 has been reported to be different (25.Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).In the present study we have shown that DOX causes an induction in TfR expression and increases iron influx into cells through TfR. Antioxidants inhibit DOX-induced TfR overexpression and the associated iron uptake, implicating a role for oxidant-induced iron signaling mechanism in DOX toxicity.Effect of DOX on the Molecular Regulation of Transferrin Receptor Expression by IRPsThe proposed model linking DOX-induced oxidative stress and iron signaling is shown in Scheme 1. As shown in Scheme 1, the TfR plays a key role in regulating the entry of iron into cells. The cellular iron-sensing mechanism enables synchronized regulation of TfR and ferritin levels in cells. TfR and ferritin syntheses are regulated by iron at the mRNA translation level by the interaction of cytoplasmic regulatory proteins (IRPs) with their respective mRNAs (57.Worwood M. J. Intern. Med. 1989; 226: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 58.Testa U. Pelosi E. Peschle C. Crit. Rev. Oncogenesis. 1993; 4: 241-276PubMed Google Scholar, 59.Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). The IRPs (IRP-1 and-2) function as sensors of cellular iron status. Under conditions of iron deprivation or when the [4Fe-4S] cluster in aconitase is disassembled, the IRPs bind with high affinity to IRE present on TfR and ferritin mRNAs. The increased binding to TfR mRNA stabilizes the mRNA, resulting in increased mRNA translation and increased receptor synthesis (Scheme 1). On the other hand, when cellular iron is in excess, IRP-1/IRE binding is decreased, leading to rapid degradation of TfR mRNA and to efficient translation of ferritin mRNA. IRP-1 senses iron levels by switching between cytoplasmic aconitase and IRP-1, an IRE-binding protein (Scheme 1). Because a large portion of the iron needs of the cell is for the assembly of iron sulfur clusters and heme biosynthesis in the mitochondria, the partial inactivation of the mitochondrial iron sulfur protein (e.g. aconitase) is presumably sufficient to stimulate cellular iron signaling (60.Schueck N.D. Woontner M. Koeller D.M. Mitochondrion. 2001; 1: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism of oxidant-induced activation of IRP-1 remains unknown, it has been proposed that either a direct interaction between the 4Fe-4S cluster of IRP-1 and H2O2 (or derived oxidant) or an H2O2-dependent stress-response signaling pathway is operative (23.Gehring N.H. Hentze M.W. Pantopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6219-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Scheme 1 shows the relationship between DOX-induced mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS generation, glutathione depletion, iron-sulfur protein (e.g. aconitase) inactivation, IRP-1 activation, TfR-mediated iron transport, and apoptotic cell death.Recent reports indicate that DOX is primarily sequestered in mitochondria in DOX-treated cells (61.Sarvazyan N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2079-H2085PubMed Google Scholar). The intramitochondrial concentration of DOX was nearly 100 times higher (50–100 μm) in cells treated with 0.5–1.0 μm of extracellular DOX. The enzyme involved in the activation of DOX in mitochondria appears to be the NADH dehydrogenase (10.Davies K.J.A. Doroshow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3060-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The one-electron reduction of DOX to its semiquinone radical by NADH dehydrogenase, followed by its redox cycling in the presence of molecular oxygen generates O2⨪, which dismutates to form H2O2 in the mitochondria (10.Davies K.J.A. Doroshow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3060-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that DOX-generated H2O2 enhances endothelial nitric-oxide synthase expression in endothelial cells and that the reductase domain of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase amplifies O2⨪ and H2O2 generation from DOX (62.Kalivendi S.V. Kotamraju S. Zhao H. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47266-47276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is possible that an increase in ROS levels may diminish the putative iron pool (i.e. complexes of Fe with low molecular weight ligands in the cell) leading to a decrease in the cytosolic aconitase activity and enhanced TfR-mediated iron signaling (Scheme 1).Role of Cell-permeable Antioxidants and Iron Chelators in DOX-induced ApoptosisWe previously reported that BAEC incubated with ICRF-187, a clinically well established iron chelator, did not inhibit DOX-induced apoptosis (20.Kotamraju S. Konorov E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These results differed from those previously reported for myocytes, where ICRF-187 significantly inhibited DOX-induced apoptosis (19.Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that preincubation of BAEC with three different iron chelators (desferral (or deferoxamine), HBED, and ICRF-187) is absolutely essential for inhibiting DOX-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 B). The three iron chelators are presumably transported into cells by different mechanisms. Deferoxamine is hydrophilic and easily endocytosed into cells, whereas the lipophilic HBED readily diffuses into cells and chelates intracellular iron (63.Bergeron R.J. Wiegand J. Brittenham G.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 370-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICRF-187 is metabolized intracellularly to generate an in situ iron chelator (64.Hasinoff B.B. Kala S.V. Agents Actions. 1993; 39: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because treatment with ebselen completely inhibits DOX-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells and myocytes, it appears that both H2O2 and iron are responsible for DOX apoptosis (19.Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 20.Kotamraju S. Konorov E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol.

Endothelial cell injury is presumed to be an early oxidative insult in the development of atherosclerosis (65.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9931) Google Scholar). It was proposed that H2O2 generated in leukocytes and macrophages caused endothelial dysfunction (66.Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). H2O2 and other peroxides including a lipid hydroperoxide were shown to induce NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent O2⨪ production in nonphagocytic cells (67.Li W.-G. Miller Jr., F.J. Zhang H.J. Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Weintraub N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29251-29256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that hyperglycemia could promote transition metal-catalyzed hydroxyl radical reactions in the microenvironment of the diabetic artery wall (68.Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 69.Pennathur S. Wagner J.D. Leeuwenburgh C. Litwak K.N. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Another clinical study found that redox-active iron might contribute to endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerotic patients and demonstrated the beneficial effects of iron chelation with desferral (70.Duffy S.J. Biegelsen E.S. Holbrook M. Russell J.D. Gokce N. Keaney Jr., J.F. Vita J.A. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2799-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). From these reports, it is evident that the role of cellular iron signaling and iron-mediated oxidative damage is relevant in cardiovascular and lung diseases (68.Monnier V.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 71.Rehman A. Nourooz-Zadeh J. Moller W. Tritschler H. Pereira P. Halliwell B.

A major long term toxic effect of this drug is the development of cardiac damage (e.g. cardiomyopathy and heart failure) in cancer patients treated with DOX (3.Bristow M.R. Billingham M.E. Mason J.W.

Endothelial dysfunction is an acute toxic side effect of DOX. One of the proposed mechanisms responsible for the acute and chronic toxicity is the formation of ROS formed from the redox activation of DOX (5.Handa K. Sato S.

DOX, a quinone-containing drug, undergoes a one-electron reduction to a semiquinone intermediate that generates superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide (9.Goodman J. Hochstein P. Biochem. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2046191483,"Surface proteins of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> are anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan by a mechanism requiring a C-terminal sorting signal with an LP<i>X</i>TG motif. Surface proteins are first synthesized in the bacterial cytoplasm and then transported across the cytoplasmic membrane. Cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide of the cytoplasmic surface protein P1 precursor generates the extracellular P2 species, which is the substrate for the cell wall anchoring reaction. Sortase, a membrane-anchored transpeptidase, cleaves P2 between the threonine (T) and the glycine (G) of the LP<i>X</i>TG motif and catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between the carboxyl group of threonine and the amino group of cell wall cross-bridges. We have used metabolic labeling of staphylococcal cultures with [<sup>32</sup>P]phosphoric acid to reveal a P3 intermediate. The <sup>32</sup>P-label of immunoprecipitated surface protein is removed by treatment with lysostaphin, a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase that separates the cell wall anchor structure. Furthermore, the appearance of P3 is prevented in the absence of sortase or by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis.<sup>32</sup>P-Labeled cell wall anchor species bind to nisin, an antibiotic that is known to form a complex with lipid II. Thus, it appears that the P3 intermediate represents surface protein linked to the lipid II peptidoglycan precursor. The data support a model whereby lipid II-linked polypeptides are incorporated into the growing peptidoglycan via the transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions of cell wall synthesis, generating mature cell wall-linked surface protein."
https://openalex.org/W2081498194,"Axon bifurcation results in the formation of sister branches, and divergent segregation of the sister branches is essential for efficient innervation of multiple targets. From a genetic mosaic screen, we find that a lethal mutation in the Drosophila Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) specifically perturbs segregation of axonal branches in the mushroom bodies. Single axon analysis further reveals that Dscam mutant axons generate additional branches, which randomly segregate among the available targets. Moreover, when only one target remains, branching is suppressed in wild-type axons while Dscam mutant axons still form multiple branches at the original bifurcation point. Taken together, we conclude that Dscam controls axon branching and guidance such that a neuron can innervate multiple targets with minimal branching."
https://openalex.org/W1976832203,"The gene mutated in reeler (reelin) encodes a protein secreted by neurons in the developing brain that controls laminar positioning of migrating cells in the CNS by an unknown mechanism. To investigate Reelin function, we used the nestin promoter to express Reelin ectopically in the ventricular zone and other brain regions in transgenic mice. In the presence of the endogenous protein, ectopic Reelin did not alter cell migration in the neocortex or the cerebellum. However, in the reeler background, ectopic Reelin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab-1 in the ventricular zone and rescued some, but not all, of the neuroanatomic and behavioral abnormalities characteristic of reeler. These results indicate that Reelin does not function simply as a positional signal. Rather, it appears to participate in multiple events critical for neuronal migration and cell positioning."

Cells exposed to the synthetic androgen, R1881, show distinct, punctate, nuclear co-localization of the AR and β-catenin.

Structurally, the AR belongs to a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors composed of a highly conserved DNA binding domain (ARDBD) and a moderately conserved ligand binding domain (ARLBD), while containing an N-terminal domain (ARNt), which is least conserved (5Evans R.M.

These receptors show a certain degree of trafficking either to or from the nucleus but also in a subnuclear fashion. Those that show a strong migration to the nucleus upon exposure to ligand are termed “translocating receptors” and can be contrasted with receptors that are constitutively nuclear (4Hager G.L. Lim C.S. Elbi C. Baumann C.T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol Biol. 2000; 30: 249-254Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ER shows expression that is mainly nuclear in the absence of ligand (22Htun H. Holth L.T. Walker D. Davie J.R. Hager G.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), whereas the AR and GR show a distribution that is both cytoplasmic and nuclear (23Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasudu K.

Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 226: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and in the nucleus (6Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H. Trapman J. Brinkman A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1396-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) in many cell types. Upon receptor stimulation by DHT, or potent analogues of DHT, including R1881, the AR will dissociate from heat-shock proteins, translocate to the nucleus, and form transcriptionally active DNA-protein complexes (4Hager G.L. Lim C.S. Elbi C. Baumann C.T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol Biol. 2000; 30: 249-254Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In general, this two-step model for steroid hormone receptor action can be applied to the AR and GR whereby the unliganded receptor is localized in the cytoplasm and upon ligand binding undergoes conformational change that permits translocation to the nucleus. This homodimerization leads to initiation of target gene regulation (15Tyagi R.K. Lavrosky Y. Soon C.A. Chung S.S. Chatterjee B. Roy K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 8: 1162-1174Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus most members of the receptor superfamily form focal accumulations within the nucleus in the presence of ligand (4Hager G.L. Lim C.S. Elbi C. Baumann C.T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol Biol. 2000; 30: 249-254Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Proteins that are carried or shuttled with steroid receptors into the nucleus have not been thoroughly explored. Therefore, with the ability of the AR to translocate to the nucleus, we hypothesize that the AR could co-traffic other molecules to the nucleus. Examples of this phenomenon are few if any. Cytoplasmic to nuclear and subnuclear trafficking could allow for formation of multiprotein-DNA complexes and AR transcriptional activation (15Tyagi R.K. Lavrosky Y. Soon C.A. Chung S.S. Chatterjee B. Roy K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 8: 1162-1174Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Given the documented ligand-dependent relationship between the AR and β-catenin (25Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 17: 4709-4713Google Scholar), we hypothesize that β-catenin could be part of a complex that translocates to the nucleus as a pre-requisite to forming transcriptionally active, nuclear complexes. β-Catenin is a multifunctional protein. Specifically, it plays a central role in cell adhesion by its association with E-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton via linking to α-catenin (26Barker N. Clevers H. Bioessays. 2000; 11: 961-965Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 27Polakis P. Cell. 2001; 5: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to its role at adherens junctions, β-catenin is a major component in the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway. This well-studied pathway is important both in normal tissue development and differentiation (28Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar) as well as in oncogenesis (27Polakis P. Cell. 2001; 5: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt/Wingless signaling, β-catenin is found mainly at cell junctions but also associates with cytoplasmic proteins, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (29Fearnhead N.S. Britton M.P. Bodmer W.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 7: 721-733Crossref Scopus (737) Google Scholar); glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3) (30Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfield B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 10: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and axin (30Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfield B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 10: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). When β-catenin accumulates, it is phosphorylated by GSK-3 and targeted for ubiquitination by the proteasome complex (30Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfield B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 10: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Stimulation of the Wnt/Wingless pathway inhibits GSK-3 and allows for accumulation of hypo-phosphorylated β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Stabilized β-catenin can then translocate to the nucleus, with Lef, and interact with the Lef/Tcf family to stimulate gene expression of cell cycle-associated proteins. Some of the targeted genes, that are thought to be regulated by a β-catenin-Tcf complex, include c-myc,tcf-1, and cyclin D1 (31Hecht A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 1: 24-28Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An intriguing feature of Wnt signaling is the manner in which β-catenin is actively translocated to the nucleus. Although β-catenin does not have a nuclear localization signal (32Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) can act as a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein (32Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Such studies have shown that alteration of the amino nuclear export sequence on APC could accumulate nuclear β-catenin and concluded that APC can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm while directing β-catenin to functionally important locations. APC also contains two nuclear localization signals that are necessary for optimal nuclear APC activity (33Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 23: 12577-12582Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and likely for its tumor suppressor function. Recently, studies have shown that nuclear export of β-catenin can occur independent of the CRM1 export protein and suggested that there could be alternative pathways associated with β-catenin transport (34Eleftheriou A. Yoshida M. Henderson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25883-25888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Previous studies have also shown that β-catenin can localize to the nucleus independent of the shuttling protein Ran (35Yokoya F. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Little is known about the functional contribution of the recently identified ligand-dependent interaction between β-catenin and the AR. In this study, 1) we used confocal microscopy and a novel DNA binding assay to provide evidence that β-catenin binds in an AR ligand-dependent manner, via the AR, to an androgen-regulated promoter; 2) we defined the domains of the AR and β-catenin as they related to protein interactions and related this to transcriptional activity; 3) we demonstrated that AR can translocate β-catenin to the nucleus in an AR ligand-dependent fashion as a distinct pathway that is independent of APC; 4) finally, we identified the structural components of the AR and β-catenin that are necessary and sufficient for co-translocation. PC3 and HeLa FLAG-AR cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% FBS and LNCaP cells in RPMI media containing 5% FBS. Cells were transiently transfected in serum-free media for 6–20 h with the following expression cDNAs: (WT HA-tagged), β-catenin (WT myc-tagged), β-catenin (Nt), β-catenin (Arm repeats HA-tagged), β-catenin (Nt/Ct HA-tagged), rat AR (WT), AR (Nt), AR (Nt/LBD), AR (DBD), AR (DBD/LBD), GR (WT), TR (WT), and RAR (WT). Cells were treated with 10 nm steroid receptor ligand in 5% dextran/charcoal-stripped serum. Stable AR FLAG-tagged HeLa cells were kindly donated by Dr. Michael Carey (UCLA School of Medicine). AR luciferase reporter, AR, and GR expression constructs were constructed as previously described (Snoek et al. (8Snoek R. Bruchovsky N. Kasper S. Matusik R.J. Gleave M. Sato N. Mawji N.R. Rennie P.S. The Prostate. 1998; 36: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). β-catenin cDNAs were obtained both from Dr. Berry Gumbiner (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) and Dr. Randall Moon (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Washington). All remaining receptor expression constructs were obtained from Dr. Ronald Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Cells were grown in 5% FBS in RPMI on glass coverslips, fixed in cold methanol for 10 min, and air-dried. Cells were reconstituted in 4% normal serum in 0.1% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. Primary polyclonal β-catenin (sc-8199) antibodies and monoclonal AR (DNA binding domain, 15071A) antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100 and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C followed by 3 × 10-min washes. Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores were used at a 1:100 dilution and were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 3 × 10-min washes. Coverslips were mounted with mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Laboratory) on glass slides. Confocal microscopy images were obtained used a Bio-Rad 1024 system and were digitally compiled using IMAGE software (National Institutes of Health). Subsequent to transfection and a least 12-h growth in charcoal-stripped serum, LNCaP, PC3, and HeLa FLAG-AR cells were treated with 10 nm ligand for up to 60 min. Prior to harvest, cells were washed once in cold PBS and separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions using the Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent (Pierce) at 10-min intervals. Fractions were assayed for total protein using the BCA protein assay (Pierce, 23223). Subconfluent cell cultures were washed with PBS, sheared with a 30-gauge needle, and solubilized with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet-P-40, 150 nm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) on ice for 30 min with the addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1697498). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, standardized for total protein, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight at 4 °C with up to 5 μg of precipitation antibody. During the last 60 min of incubation 30 μl of Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2003) were added. Immune complexes were washed four to five times in cold lysis buffer containing inhibitors. After boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (AmershamBiosciences, Inc.). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TPBS (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h and then incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies, either actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A2066), Histone (Chemicon International), β-catenin (Transduction Laboratory, C19220; Santa Cruz, sc-8199), E-Cadherin (Santa Cruz, sc-1500), GSK-3β (Transduction Laboratory, G22320), N-terminal Androgen Receptor (ABR, PA1–111A), DNA binding domain Androgen Receptor (BD PharMingen, 15071A), or C-terminal domain Androgen Receptor (Santa Cruz, sc-815). Detection was achieved with either anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz, sc-2031) or anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz, sc-2030) and ECL Western blotting detection agents (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., RPN 2106). Plasmid cDNA was transcribed and translated in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate TnT (Promega) system. A standard reaction was used consisting of 40 μl of TnT Quick Master (SP6 or T7 promoter), 2 μl of cold 2 mmmethionine (1000 Ci/mol at 10 mCi/ml), 1–2 μg of plasmid DNA made up to a final volume of 50 μl with nuclease-free water. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and either used immediately for binding reactions or stored at −20 °C. The efficiency of in vitro translation reactions were assessed by monitoring [35S]methionine incorporation by SDS-PAGE and radiography following equilibration in ENHANCE (Cat. NEF981, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gels were washed 2 × 10 min with dH2O, dried, and exposed to radiographic film. Recombinant proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine (Promega TnT) in a volume of 50 μl. GST-bound beads were equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and incubated with lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. Complexes were washed 4× with 1 ml of cold binding buffer, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were enhanced, dried, and exposed to film. The ACDC assay (36Nelson, C., Hendy, S., Reid, K., and Cavanagh, J. (2001)BioTechniques, in pressGoogle Scholar) was carried out by incubating recombinant His-tag androgen receptor DNA binding domain (His-tag ARDBD) without DNA or with NF-1 acrydite binding sites or ARE acrydite binding sites (ARE-ac). The nuclear factor-1 (NF-1) acrydite served as a negative binding control. Binding reactions were polymerized in the well of a 5% polyacrylamide acrydite gel, run on a 15% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti His-tag antibody. LNCaP nuclear extracts (NE) treated with 10 nm R1881 were incubated with ARE-ac and polymerized inside the well of a 5% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the specifically bound protein was extracted from the acrydite gel, separated by SDS-PAGE (8.5%), and probed with an anti-AR antibody (DBD epitope). NE were incubated without DNA or with acrydite probasin (Pβ-ac) promoter (−286 to +28) or the pBluescript acrydite multiple cloning site (MCS-ac) created by PCR amplification using specific primers with a 5′-acrydite moiety attached. PC3 and LNCaP cells were plated in 6-well dishes and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with a total of no more than 4 μg of DNA per well for 8–16 h using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, cells were incubated in charcoal-stripped serum containing 10 nm R1881, dexamethasone, estradiol, all-trans-retinoic acid, or tri-iodothyronine for at least 16 h. All assays were carried in at least triplicate and evaluated using the Dual Luciferase Reporter system (Promega). The localization of AR (Fig. 1,ai) and β-catenin (aii) was viewed with confocal microscopy using antibodies to the DNA binding domain of the AR and Arm repeats/Ct portion of β-catenin in fixed LNCaP cells that were treated with and without R1881 for 60 min (Fig. 1). Images captured by confocal microscopy and compiled in images analysis software suggest that in the absence of androgen the AR (bi) stained diffusely throughout the cell, whereas β-catenin staining (bii) was predominately found at cell borders, diffusely in the cytoplasm, and within the nucleus. In the presence of ligand we observed a specific, punctate staining pattern of AR (ai), which was strongly nuclear. β-Catenin also showed nuclear localization (aii) in cells upon ligand addition and co-localized in many instances with AR (arrowheads) whereas in some instances it did not (arrows). Levels of β-catenin at cell borders were not observed to change in response to AR ligand, whereas cytoplasmic levels appeared to decrease moderately. Nuclei were stained using DAPI (Fig. 1, aiv and biv). As a prerequisite to assessing the trafficking properties of the AR, we determined the relative affinity of binding between the AR and β-catenin. To do this we used recombinant AR proteins, including ARNt, ARDBD/LBD, ARDBD, and ARNt/DBD (Fig. 2a). β-Catenin35S-labeled deletion mutants included Nt-(1–140), Arm repeats-(140–664), and Ct-(664–781) domains (Fig. 2b) translated in vitro from Xenopus expression constructs. Although relatively weak interactions were detected between the β-CatNt, or β-CatCt, and any portion of the AR (only slightly greater than the GST-negative control), strong interactions were detected between the β-catenin Arm repeats and AR (Fig. 2c). The Arm repeats showed moderate interactions with the ARDBD but increased affinity with the ARDBD/LBD suggesting a role both for the DBD and LBD in binding AR and β-catenin. Despite the differences detected in our physical mapping using our recombinant truncations we were unable to detect a significant difference (<10%) between AR-GST/β-catenin binding affinity in the presence or absence of ligand. We have attributed this to potential masking of interaction sites by chaperone proteins in the cell in absence of ligand, which is not present in the recombinant system. In general, these data support transcriptional assays, immunoprecipitation studies, and shuttling time courses. To determine if β-catenin was able to translocate to the nucleus in an androgen-dependent manner, we performed a series of cell fractionations on LNCaP cells and HeLa-FLAG AR cells over a time course of androgen exposure (Fig. 3). Cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments were efficiently separated as determined by probing nuclear fractions for pan-Cadherin and probing cytoplasmic fractions for total histone (Fig. 3A). The low levels of pan-Cadherin in nuclear fractions and histone in the cytosol suggested an efficient separation of cellular compartments. We further demonstrated equal total protein loads through a time course by assessing total cytosolic actin and nuclear histone (Fig. 3A). Non-transfected LNCaP cells that were treated with R1881 and were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments at 10-min intervals over 60 min (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min) showed a moderate accumulation of endogenous, nuclear β-catenin (Fig. 3B). We observed a similar increase in nuclear AR. Densitometry evaluation of nuclear accumulation of AR and β-catenin suggest a similar rate of increase. Loading controls (actin) remained constant (Fig. 3Bii). A less noticeable decrease in cytosolic β-catenin was observed when compared with changes in nuclear β-catenin levels. This is likely accounted for by the large amount of β-catenin that remained stationary; that is, that does not migrate upon addition of AR ligand. Interestingly, the shift in β-catenin found in cytosolic and nuclear compartments was considerably more noticeable in LNCaP cells, which were transiently transfected with tagged expression constructs for β-catenin (Fig. 3C). Specifically, by transfecting LNCaP cells with either HA-tagged and myc-tagged β-catenin constructs, we observed a greater amount of nuclear accumulation of the de novo synthesized β-catenin as compared with non-transfected cells. Densitometry analysis (Fig. 3Cii) showed a similar trend in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and illustrated a plateau at 50-min post-ligand addition suggesting a decreased rate of nuclear import. We further chose to consider whether AR-dependent movement of β-catenin could occur using other AR ligands, including the physiological androgen, DHT. DHT, like its analogue, R1881, promoted nuclear accumulation of both the AR and β-catenin although to a slightly lesser extent than with R1881 (data not shown). We next investigated whether other non-prostate cancer cell lines, including stably AR-FLAG-transfected HeLa cells could mediate AR-mediated β-catenin nuclear translocation. To do this we isolated cell fractions at 0 and 60 min post-ligand addition and immunoprecipitated AR, FLAG, and β-catenin (Fig. 3D). We observed a trend of nuclear accumulation of β-catenin similar to that in LNCaP cells, although β-catenin movement from the cytosol was not as apparent as neither was the overall movement of the FLAG-AR. We further assessed the relative amounts of nuclear and cytosolic AR-associated β-catenin in these cells by immunoprecipitation of FLAG tagged AR (Fig. 3D). In the absence of androgen, there were greater amounts AR in the cytosol as judged by anti-FLAG and anti-AR antibodies whereas greater amounts in the nuclear fractions of cells were treated with ligand. We found detectable β-catenin with AR and FLAG-AR immunoprecipitates in the absence of androgen confirming the presence of a constitutive interaction as observed with LNCaP immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3D). We further demonstrated that there were detectable amounts of the AR/β-catenin complex in nuclei without androgen but substantially higher in its presence (Fig. 3D). Having found evidence that the AR can translocate β-catenin to the nucleus in LNCaP and HeLa cells, we chose to ascertain whether other nuclear receptors have this capability in PC3 prostate cancer cells. To do this we used a prostate cancer cell line that dose not express the androgen receptor. When PC3 cells were transiently transfected with RAR (Fig. 4A), ER (Fig. 4B), GR (Fig. 4C), TR (Fig. 4D), or β-catenin (HA-tag) we observed an inability t"

Computer-generated 3D objects defined by shading, random dots, texture elements, or silhouettes were presented either statically or dynamically (rotating). Results suggest that 3D shape representations are highly localized, although widely distributed, in occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices and may involve common brain regions regardless of shape cue.

A combination of Wnt and SHH signals regulates the expression of both β-catenin and Lef1 in the myotome prior to MyoD expression in the chick (29Schmidt M. Tanaka M. Munsterberg A. Development. 2000; 127: 4105-4113PubMed Google Scholar). Studies suggest that β-catenin regulates the expression of both Pax 3 (15Capdevila J. Tabin C. Johnson R.L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 193: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as well as Gli2 and Gli3 (13Borycki A. Brown A.M. Emerson C.P. Development. 2000; 127: 2075-2087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, somites were disrupted and dorsal markers were down-regulated in embryos injected with a dominant negative β-catenin/engrailed chimera in Xenopus (30Ji W.T. Montross H. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1759-1770PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies implicate β-catenin in skeletal muscle development, a direct role has not been shown. P19 cells are pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells that differentiate into several cell types, including cardiac and skeletal myocytes upon cellular aggregation in the presence of Me2SO (31Edwards M.K. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,32McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines that express transcription factors involved in myogenesis, including MyoD, myogenin, MEF2C, and Pax3, have been shown to induce skeletal muscle development upon cellular aggregation, in the absence of Me2SO (19Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19033-19039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 33Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The resulting myocytes are biochemically and physiologically comparable to embryonic skeletal myocytes (35Skerjanc I.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The temporal expression of mesodermal factors induced during skeletal muscle differentiation in P19 cells is similar to the pattern of expression seen in the embryo (36Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Primitive streak factors, including Wnt3a are expressed early after cellular aggregation and prior to factors found in the somite, such as Pax3, Six1, Gli2, and Mox1. Mox1 is a homeobox gene expressed in the dermomyotome during somite differentiation (37Hu A.F. Candia J. Crosby J. Lalley P.A. Noden D. Nadeau J.H. Wright C.V. Development. 1992; 116: 1123-1136PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, MRF expression is initiated, accompanied by markers of differentiated skeletal muscle. In addition, P19 cells are induced to form skeletal muscle when co-cultured with pieces of dorsal neural tube (38Angello J.C. Stern H.M. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, P19 cells are a useful system in which to study the induction of skeletal myogenesis by Wnts expressed in the neural tube. In this study, we have shown that the expression of Wnt3a or an activated β-catenin is sufficient to induce skeletal myogenesis in aggregated P19 cells. Both factors induced the expression of somite factors, including Pax3, Mox1, Gli2, and Six1. By the overexpression of a dominant negative β-catenin/engrailed chimera, we have shown that the nuclear function of β-catenin is essential for the expression of these factors leading to skeletal myogenesis. These studies represent the first observation that β-catenin is both sufficient and necessary for MRF expression leading to skeletal muscle development. An EcoRI fragment containing the full-length mouse Wnt3a cDNA (kindly provided by R. Nusse) was cloned into the expression vector driven by thepgk-1 promoter (39Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene. 1987; 60: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Activated Xenopusβ-catenin, termed β-catenin*, consisting of the armadillo repeats (40Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by R. Johnson) was also cloned into thepgk-1 promoter. The β-catenin/engrailed (Xenopus/Drosophila, respectively) construct, driven by a CMV promoter was kindly provided by P. McCrea (30Ji W.T. Montross H. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1759-1770PubMed Google Scholar). P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured as described previously (41Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar) in α-minimum essential media (Canadian Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 5% cosmic calf/5% fetal bovine serum (Cansera, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada and HyClone, Logan, UT, respectively). The serum supported the differentiation of skeletal muscle in the presence of Me2SO (42Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PGK-Wnt3a was stably transfected into P19 cells by the calcium phosphate method (43Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). In 60-mm culture plates, 7.5 × 105 cells in 5 ml of media were exposed to DNA precipitate for 9 h. The DNA precipitates were composed of 8 μg of PGK-Wnt3a or PGK vector alone for controls, plus 1 μg of PGK-puromycin, 1 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 2.5 μg of B17 (44McBurney M.W. Fournier S. Jardine K. Sutherland L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PGK-β-catenin* and CMV-β-catenin/engrailed were stably transfected utilizing the FuGENE6 transfection reagent as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Quebec, Canada). A mixture of 0.8 μg of PGK-β-catenin* or PGK vector alone for controls, plus 0.2 μg of PGK-puromycin, 0.3 μg of PGK-LacZ, 0.7 μg of B17, and FuGENE6 reagent was added to 2.5 × 105 cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. A mixture of 2.04 μg of CMV-β-catenin/engrailed or vector alone for controls, plus 0.1 μg of PGK-puromycin, 0.17 μg of PGK-LacZ, 0.77 μg of B17, and FuGENE6 reagent was added to 2.5 × 105 cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. In each case, transfection efficiency was analyzed by β-galactosidase assays as described previously (45Norton P.A. Coffin J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 281-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then plated into 150-mm tissue culture dishes and selected for puromycin resistance for 7–9 days from which stable cells lines were isolated and termed P19[Wnt3a] (36Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), P19[β-catenin*], or P19[β-cat/EnR] cells, respectively. Differentiation of both P19[Wnt3a] and P19[β-catenin*] cell lines was carried out by aggregating 5.0 × 105 cells for 4 days in Petri dishes, followed by plating on day 4 into tissue culture dishes and maintenance in culture until day 9. P19[β-cat/EnR] cells were aggregated in the presence of 0.8% Me2SO, plated on day 4, and harvested on day 9. In each case, experiments were carried at least twice utilizing at least two cell lines. Total RNA was extracted by the lithium chloride/urea method on the day of differentiation indicated and examined as described previously (19Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19033-19039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6–12 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose, formaldehyde gel, and transferred overnight onto Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Baie d’Urfe, Quebec, Canada) by capillary blotting. RNA was cross-linked and hybridized overnight at 42 °C to DNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Blots were washed 5 × 5 min in low stringency wash at 42 °C (2× SSC and 0.1% SDS) and 1 × 15 min in high stringency wash at 65 °C (0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS). Fragments utilized for cardiac α-actin, Wnt3a, Wnt5b, Brachyury T, Pax3, Mox1, Gli2, Six1, and MyoD probes were described previously (19Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19033-19039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Xenopus β-catenin probe utilized was a ClaI fragment encoding the armadillo repeat domain of β-catenin. Rat β-catenin probe, utilized to detect endogenous β-catenin, was aSphI-SstI fragment of cDNA that was kindly provided by W. Rushlow. The Lef1 probe was an NdeI fragment of the coding region of mouse Lef1, provided kindly by J. McDermott. A 750-bp EcoRI fragment of rabbit 18 S cDNA was utilized as a probe to standardize loading. Northern blots were visualized by autoradiography. For detection of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) expression, aggregates from each differentiation were plated onto 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing gelatin-coated coverslips on day 4. On day 9, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with −20 °C methanol for 5 min at room temperature and rehydrated with PBS. Cells were stained for myosin heavy chain (MyHC) utilizing MF20 antibody (46Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). To detect localization of β-catenin protein, P19[β-catenin*] and control cells were fixed with −20 °C methanol and reacted with β-catenin antibody, kindly provided by K. Knudsen, at a 1:10 dilution in PBS/5% sheep serum. Cells were fixed with −20 °C acetone and reacted with HA anti-body (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Quebec, Canada), at a 1:100 dilution in PBS/5% sheep serum. Nuclei were detected by Hoechst stain as described previously (36Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was visualized on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Images were captured on a Sony 3CCD camera and processed utilizing Axiovision software. To detect nuclear localization of endogenous β-catenin during Wnt3a-induced skeletal myogenesis, P19[Wnt3a] and control cells were aggregated in the absence of Me2SO. Aggregates in suspension (day 2–4) were fixed in 2.5% paraformaldehyde/PBS, extracted in −20 °C methanol, and washed in PBS. Aggregates were plated onto coverslips on days 5, 6, and 9 and fixed in −20 °C methanol. All aggregates were stained with β-catenin antibody at a 1:50 dilution in PBS/5% sheep serum and with propidium iodide to detect nuclei. Fluorescence was visualized utilizing a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal laser scanning microscope. We have shown previously that Wnt3a is expressed early during Me2SO-induced skeletal myogenesis in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (36Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To study the ability of Wnt3a to regulate MRF expression and subsequent skeletal muscle development, P19[Wnt3a] cells were aggregated in the absence of Me2SO. These cells differentiated into skeletal muscle as shown by immunofluorescence utilizing an antibody against the muscle-specific marker MyHC (Fig.1). Bipolar MyHC-positive myocytes, which represented between 5 and 10% of total cells, were found in the P19[Wnt3a] cells (Fig. 1D) but not in the control cell lines (Fig. 1B). Therefore, Wnt3a can induce skeletal myogenesis in aggregated P19 cells. The ability of Wnt factors to induce skeletal muscle in P19 cells agrees with explant and overexpression studies in the mouse and chick (2Stern H.M. Brown A.M. Hauschka S.D. Development. 1995; 121: 3675-3686PubMed Google Scholar, 3Munsterberg A.E. Kitajewski J. Bumcrot D.A. McMahon A.P. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4Wagner J. Schmidt C. Nikowits Jr., W. Christ B. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Tajbakhsh S. Borello U. Vivarelli E. Kelly R. Papkoff J. Duprez D. Buckingham M. Cossu G. Development. 1998; 125: 4155-4162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the cascade of factors activated during Wnt3a-induced myogenesis, a time course was analyzed (Fig.2). Wnt3a was expressed at high levels throughout the time course as expected in P19[Wnt3a] cells and not in control cells (Fig. 2A). One or 2 days of aggregation was sufficient to induce the expression of primitive streak factors and early mesoderm markers such as Brachyury T and Wnt5b in P19 control cells (Fig. 2, B and C). However, P19 control cells do not continue to differentiate and expression of these factors diminishes rapidly. In contrast, P19[Wnt3a] cells express high levels of these early factors throughout the majority of the differentiation program (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating an abundance of early mesoderm present in these cultures. Both β-catenin and Lef1, which are downstream components of the Wnt signaling pathway, are expressed throughout the time course in both control and P19[Wnt3a] cells (Fig. 2, D and E). The presence of β-catenin and Lef1 in aggregated control cells indicates that, in the absence of Wnt3a signaling, β-catenin and Lef1 expression is not sufficient to induce myogenesis. The progression of differentiation was marked by the activation of transcription factors normally found in the early somite, including Mox1, Gli2, Pax3, and Six1, which were present on days 5 and 6 in P19[Wnt3a] cells but not in control cell lines (Fig. 2,F–I). Skeletal muscle differentiation was confirmed by the appearance of MyoD beginning on day 8 of the time course in P19[Wnt3a] cells (Fig. 2J). This temporal pattern of expression suggests that Wnt3a induces skeletal myogenesis by activating the expression of transcription factors upstream of the MRFs. Wnt3a is thought to transduce its signal via the canonical β-catenin/Lef/TCF pathway. Lef1 and β-catenin were expressed fairly constitutively in P19 cells aggregated in the absence of Me2SO (Fig. 2E), indicating that Lef1 is available to interact with β-catenin to activate downstream genes. Although abundant β-catenin staining was present in the cytoplasm and membrane of the cells, we could not reliably detect endogenous β-catenin in the nucleus during differentiation of P19[Wnt3a] cells (data not shown). It is likely that our staining methods were not sensitive enough to detect endogenous levels of nuclear β-catenin above the intense cytoplasmic and membrane staining at the cell surface in aggregated P19 cells. Furthermore, the nuclear expression is likely restricted to a small proportion of the aggregate and a narrow window of time and, therefore, is not easily detected in the heterogeneous population of aggregated cells. Others (40Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 47Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) have found that, although nuclear staining of β-catenin could not be detected, overexpression of β-catenin could mimic the effects of Wnt signaling and induce the expression of putative target genes. We therefore isolated P19 cell lines expressing an activated β-catenin, termed β-catenin*, to determine if Wnt3a is acting via β-catenin and not a Ca2+-dependent pathway or the JNK kinase pathway, to stimulate myogenesis. β-Catenin* consists of the internal armadillo repeat region, which was shown to be necessary and sufficient for axis duplication in Xenopus(40Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and sufficient to emulate Wnt1 activity when ectopically expressed in chick embryos (15Capdevila J. Tabin C. Johnson R.L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 193: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular localization, β-catenin* was detected with an antibody against the HA tag in P19[β-catenin*] cells. β-Catenin* was localized primarily in the nucleus with some staining in the cytoplasm, as compared with Hoechst stain (Fig. 3, compare A andB) as shown previously (40Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Conversely, endogenous β-catenin, which was detected by anti-β-catenin antibody, was found predominantly in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface of control cells (Fig. 3, compare G and H). A comparison of β-catenin subcellular localization in control cells and P19[β-catenin*] cells shows only a slight enhancement of nuclear staining in P19[β-catenin*] (Fig. 3F) cells compared with control (Fig. 3H), indicating the difficulty of identifying changes in subcellular localization in a small proportion of the β-catenin protein population. P19[β-catenin*] cells (Fig.4I, panel B) were aggregated for 4 days and shown to differentiate into skeletal muscle compared with control cells (Fig. 4I, panel D) on day 9, as shown by the presence of MyHC-positive bipolar skeletal myocytes (2–5% of total cells). The expression of factors activated by β-catenin*-induced myogenesis was studied by Northern blot analysis. Exogenous β-catenin* was expressed at high levels compared with control cell lines (Fig. 4II, panel E). Endogenous β-catenin and Lef1 were expressed in both control and P19[β-catenin*] cells and were slightly up-regulated in P19[β-catenin*] cells (Fig. 4II, panels F andG). Gli2, Mox1, Pax3, and Six1 expression was activated by the presence of β-catenin* (Fig. 4II, panels H–K). Interestingly, both Pax3 and Gli2 are expressed on day 0 of differentiation, indicating that these factors do not require cellular aggregation for activation by β-catenin*. The observation that β-catenin* triggers the expression of transcription factors similar to those induced by Wnt3a suggests that Wnt3a is acting via β-catenin to induce myogenesis in P19 cells. To determine whether β-catenin is essential for skeletal myogenesis, we isolated cell lines expressing a β-catenin/engrailed chimera (30Ji W.T. Montross H. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1759-1770PubMed Google Scholar). This negative regulator was created by replacing the activation domain of β-catenin with the repression domain of engrailed, which is known to interact with transcriptional repressors to actively block transcription (50Smith S.T. Jaynes J.B. Development. 1996; 122: 3141-3150PubMed Google Scholar, 51Tolkunova E.N. Fujioka M. Kobayashi M. Deka D. Jaynes J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2804-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The chimera was shown to specifically repress the transcriptional function of β-catenin (30Ji W.T. Montross H. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1759-1770PubMed Google Scholar). Control cells and cell lines expressing the chimera, termed P19[β-cat/EnR] cells, were differentiated in the presence of 0.8% Me2SO. Under these conditions, control cells differentiate efficiently along the skeletal muscle pathway, as shown by the appearance of MyHC-positive myocytes on day 9 by immunofluorescence (Fig. 5B). Skeletal myocytes were not detected in P19[β-cat/EnR] cells (Fig.5D). A time course of myogenesis was analyzed to identify which transcripts were affected by the expression of the inhibitory chimera. The expression of the engrailed fusion was shown to be high throughout the time course in P19[β-cat/EnR] cells but not in control cells (Fig.6A). The inhibition of skeletal muscle development was confirmed by a loss of MyoD expression compared with control cells (Fig. 6K). Early primitive streak and mesodermal markers such as Brachyury T, Wnt5b, and Wnt3a were reduced compared with control cells (Fig. 6, B–D). Endogenous β-catenin and Lef1 expression was not diminished by the presence of β-catenin/engrailed (Fig. 6, E andF). The expression of somite factors detected during both Wnt3a- and β-catenin-induced myogenesis, including Mox1, Gli2, Pax3, and Six1, was lost in P19[β-cat/EnR] cell lines but not in control cells that differentiated efficiently into skeletal muscle (Fig. 6,G–J). These findings indicate that β-catenin is essential for the specification of cells to the myogenic lineage by controlling the expression of Mox1, Gli2, Pax3, and Six1. In this study, we have shown that Wnt3a and its nuclear mediator, β-catenin, are both sufficient to induce the skeletal muscle program when expressed in aggregated P19 cells. The expression of transcription factors, including Pax3, Mox1, Gli2, and Six1, is activated in Wnt3a- and β-catenin*-induced myogenesis. Furthermore, we have shown that β-catenin is essential for the expression of these transcription factors and the progression of skeletal muscle differentiation in P19 cells by expressing a β-catenin/engrailed chimera. This data implies a model in which Wnt3a works via β-catenin to induce the expression of transcription factors present in the early somite of the developing embryo (Fig. 7). These somite factors may, in turn, activate MRF expression and skeletal muscle differentiation in aggregated P19[Wnt3a] cells. This model is consistent with the order of expression of factors during P19 cell differentiation (36Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and murine embryonic myogenesis (5Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 52Borycki A.G. Emerson Jr., C.P. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2000; 48: 165-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that the Wnt mediator β-catenin is both necessary and sufficient for skeletal myogenesis. Although the ability of Wnt3a to induce skeletal myogenesis supports the findings of several others (2Stern H.M. Brown A.M. Hauschka S.D. Development. 1995; 121: 3675-3686PubMed Google Scholar, 3Munsterberg A.E. Kitajewski J. Bumcrot D.A. McMahon A.P. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2911-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4Wagner J. Schmidt C. Nikowits Jr., W. Christ B. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Tajbakhsh S. Borello U. Vivarelli E. Kelly R. Papkoff J. Duprez D. Buckingham M. Cossu G. Development. 1998; 125: 4155-4162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we are the first to show that β-catenin is sufficient to induce myogenesis. Studies in the chick have shown that ectopic expression of Wnt1 or activated β-catenin can enhance Pax3 but not MyoD expression (15Capdevila J. Tabin C. Johnson R.L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 193: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Another study used a similar approach with Wnt1 in the chick and found that both Pax3 and MyoD expression was up-regulated (4Wagner J. Schmidt C. Nikowits Jr., W. Christ B. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These authors suggest that differences in the position of injection or in levels of Wnt1 may account for the ability of Wnt1 to activate MyoD expression in one study but not the other. Our ability to observe induction of myogenesis with β-catenin is most likely due to the lack of background skeletal muscle development in P19 control cells. Studies in the embryo generally observe an enhancement of myogenesis over the background of endogenous developmental programs occurring during embryogenesis. Furthermore, the presence of inhibitory factors in the embryo may hinder the ability of ectopic β-catenin to enhance myogenesis. Our observation that Wnt and β-catenin can activate Gli2 expression supports data in the chick where LiCl treatment resulted in Gli2 up-regulation (13Borycki A. Brown A.M. Emerson C.P. Development. 2000; 127: 2075-2087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, our data agree with previous studies showing that Wnt signals can activate Pax3 expression (4Wagner J. Schmidt C. Nikowits Jr., W. Christ B. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Fan C.M. Lee C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Capdevila J. Tabin C. Johnson R.L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 193: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We extend these studies to include the activation of Six1 and Mox1. Pax3 can activate the expression of Six1 and Mox1 but not Gli2 (19Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19033-19039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the activation of Gli2 by Wnt3a is independent of Pax3 activity. In fact, recent studies have shown that Gli2 may bind and activate the Myf-5 epaxial enhancer, providing a direct mechanism for MRF activation (16Gustafsson M.K. Pan H. Pinney D.F. Liu Y. Lewandowski A. Epstein D.J. Emerson Jr., C.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although our model of Wnt activating the expression of transcription factors upstream of MyoD (Fig. 7) fits the temporal pattern of expression of factors during Wnt3a-induced myogenesis, we cannot rule out the possibility that β-catenin/Lef1 is also able to activate MRF expression directly. The expression of Pax3 and Gli2 but not Mox1 or Six1 on day 0 in P19[β-catenin*] cells suggests that β-catenin may directly activate the expression of Pax3 and Gli2. Alternatively, β-catenin may indirectly activate Pax3 and Gli2 in the absence of secondary events mediated by cellular aggregation. Experiments involving the Pax3 and Gli2 promoters may provide more insight into the mechanism by which β-catenin/Lef1 leads to the activation of these factors. The expression of Pax3 and Gli2 on day 0 in P19[β-catenin*] cells did not accelerate myogenic differentiation compared with Wnt-induced myogenesis on day 9. This is similar to the finding that overexpression of Pax3 in P19 cells did not accelerate myogenic differentiation (19Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19033-19039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although several studies have shown the ability of Wnts to induce skeletal myogenesis, we are the first to show that β-catenin is sufficient to activate the expression of Mox1, Six1, and the myogenic program. The observation that β-catenin is sufficient to induce skeletal muscle development suggests that Wnt signaling acts through the canonical pathway and not alternate Wnt pathways that include Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways and the JNK kinase pathway. However, we did observe less skeletal muscle development in P19[β-catenin*] cells compared with P19[Wnt3a] cells. Although this observation may be cell line-dependent, we cannot rule out the possibility that the other pathways play a role in the ability of Wnt3a to induce more robust skeletal muscle differentiation in P19 cells. β-Catenin is known to function in both cell-cell adhesion, by associating with the cadherin complex at adherens junctions, and as a transcriptional regulator, by associating with Lef/TCF factors in the nucleus (53Zhurinsky J. Shtutman M. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3127-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular localization of exogenous β-catenin* in P19[β-catenin*] cells suggests that the factor is acting in the nucleus and not at adherens junctions to induce the myogenic program. Furthermore, the ability of β-catenin/engrailed to inhibit myogenesis supports that β-catenin is acting in the nucleus, because engrailed is known to act as a repressor of transcription (50Smith S.T. Jaynes J.B. Development. 1996; 122: 3141-3150PubMed Google Scholar, 51Tolkunova E.N. Fujioka M. Kobayashi M. Deka D. Jaynes J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2804-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The β-catenin/engrailed chimera was shown to associate with members of the cadherin complex and function normally at the adherens junctions in cell-cell adhesion, making β-catenin/engrailed a specific repressor of β-catenin’s function in the nucleus (30Ji W.T. Montross H. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1759-1770PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, myoblast differentiation was shown to be dependent on the association of β-catenin with adherens junctions (54Goichberg P. Shtutman M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was consistent with a role for cadherins in skeletal muscle differentiation (55Goichberg P. Geiger B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3119-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 56Seghatoleslami M.R. Myers L. Knudsen K.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Together these studies imply a dual role for β-catenin in myogenesis. First, β-catenin would function in the nucleus to activate transcription during commitment (this study), and, second, it would function in complexes with cadherins during differentiation of committed myoblasts (54Goichberg P. Shtutman M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out a role for β-catenin/cadherin-mediated junctions in commitment, and previous studies have shown a role for Wnt signaling in the regulation of MyoD and myogenin activity (36Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Schmidt et al. (29Schmidt M. Tanaka M. Munsterberg A. Development. 2000; 127: 4105-4113PubMed Google Scholar) put forth a model in which Wnt and SHH co-operate to induce β-catenin/Lef1 to active MRF expression in the somite. The mesodermal cells then become competent to receive the Wnt signal in the absence of SHH, and myogenesis is induced. We were unable to observe a specific induction of endogenous β-catenin expression during myogenesis in P19 cells. This may be due to the decrease in structural architecture found in the P19 cell aggregates compared with embryos as well as to the high levels of ubiquitous β-catenin expression found in P19 cells. In addition, we did not detect SHH during differentiation by Northern blot analysis (data not shown), although we cannot exclude the possibility that low levels of SHH are sufficient to play a role in skeletal muscle induction in the P19 cell system. Finally, aggregation may render the cells competent for myogenic induction by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The role of SHH during skeletal muscle development of P19 cells is currently being investigated. Our observation that β-catenin/engrailed inhibits myogenesis suggests that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is essential for mammalian skeletal myogenesis. Our findings are similar to those in Xenopuswhere mesoderm was present in embryos expressing the β-catenin/engrailed chimera, whereas somites did not form normally and the expression of dorsal markers was reduced (30Ji W.T. Montross H. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1759-1770PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the Wnt antagonist Frzb1 in developing murine embryos suggested that Wnts are essential for skeletal myogenesis, although somites did form and factors such as Pax3 and Mox1 were not lost (10Borello U. Coletta M. Tajbakhsh S. De Leyns L. Robertis E.M. Buckingham M. Cossu G. Development. 1999; 126: 4247-4255PubMed Google Scholar). We observed a total loss of markers expressed in the dorsal somite, including Pax3, Mox1, as well as Gli2 and Six1. The difference in the stage at which differentiation was blocked may be attributed to redundancy of Wnt signals in the embryo and an incomplete inhibition of embryonic Wnt activity by Frzb1 (57Wang S. Krinks M. Moos Jr., M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, the β-catenin/engrailed fusion protein should block all Wnts that signal through the canonical pathway. The observation that Brachyury T was down-regulated in P19[β-cat/EnR] cells is consistent with a positive relationship between Brachyury T and Wnt3a (11Arnold S.J. Stappert J. Bauer A. Kispert A. Herrmann B.G. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 12Yamaguchi T.P. Takada S. Wu Y. Yoshikawa N. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3185-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Although these studies showed that β-catenin directly activates the Brachyury T promoter, a recent study indicated that Wnt regulates but does not initiate Brachyury T expression in the embryo (58Galceran J. Hsu S.C. Grosschedl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8668-8673Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggesting that other factors play a crucial role in activating Brachyury T. In agreement with these findings, expression of the engrailed inhibitory domain results in a decrease but not loss of expression of Brachyury T, Wnt3a, and Wnt5b, similar to the disruption of mesoderm in Xenopus embryos treated with the β-catenin/engrailed chimera (30Ji W.T. Montross H. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1759-1770PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, mice lacking β-catenin exhibited defects during gastrulation, with a total loss of Brachyury T expression and defective anterior-posterior axis formation (59Haegel H. Larue L. Ohsugi M. Fedorov L. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Development. 1995; 121: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Huelsken J. Vogel R. Brinkmann V. Erdmann B. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The earlier and more severe phenotype may implicate an early embryonic role for non-nuclear β-catenin. In conclusion, we have shown that β-catenin, the downstream mediator of Wnt3a signaling, is both sufficient and essential for skeletal myogenesis in P19 cells. The finding that a dominant negative β-catenin inhibits the expression of several transcription factors present in the developing somite indicates that the Wnt signaling pathway is necessary for the specification of mesodermal cells to muscle precursors. Therefore, P19 cells represent an ideal system in which to study the roles of factors involved in specifying muscle precursors to the myogenic program.

https://openalex.org/W2119631008,"Ionizing radiation at clinical dose levels activates both pro- and anti-proliferative signal transduction pathways, the balance of which determines cell fate. The initiating and amplifying mechanisms involved in the activation are poorly understood. We demonstrate that one mechanism involves stimulation of constitutive nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) activity. NOS activity of Chinese hamster ovary cells was measured by the arginine → citrulline conversion assay. Irradiation stimulated a transient activation of NOS with maximal activity at 5 min of post-irradiation. Western blot analysis and genetic manipulation by overexpression of wild type or dominant negative NOS mutant identify the radiation-induced isoform as NOS-1. Further evidence that NOS-1 is activated by radiation was the demonstration of radiation-induced cGMP formation in cells transiently transfected with the NO-dependent soluble guanylate cyclase. Protein Tyr nitration, a footprint of peroxynitrite formation, followed radiation exposure and was inhibited by expression of a dominant negative NOS-1 mutant. Radiation-induced ERK1/2 kinase activity, a cytoprotective response to radiation, was also blocked by inhibiting NOS activity. These experiments establish NO-dependent signal transduction pathways as being radioresponsive. Given the lipophilic and relatively stable properties of NO, these results also suggest a possible mechanism by which ionization events in one cell may activate signaling processes in adjacent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2138743300,"Recent studies have shown that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can assemble as high molecular weight homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes. This can result in altered receptor-ligand binding, signaling, or intracellular trafficking. We have co-transfected HEK-293 cells with differentially epitope-tagged GPCRs from different subfamilies and determined whether oligomeric complexes were formed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. This gave the surprising result that the 5HT1A receptor was capable of forming hetero-oligomers with all GPCRs tested including the 5HT1B, 5HT1D, EDG1, EDG3, GPR26, and GABAB2 receptors. The testing of other GPCR combinations showed similar results with hetero-oligomer formation occurring for the 5HT1D with the 5HT1B and EDG1 receptor. Control studies showed that these complexes were present in co-transfected cells before the time of lysis and that the hetero-oligomers were comprised of GPCRs at discrete stoichiometries. These findings suggest that GPCRs have a natural tendency to form oligomers when co-transfected into cells.

Co-expression studies with chimeric α2C-adrenergic/M3 muscarinic receptor constructs have shown that intermolecular interactions can occur between different GPCR subtypes (1Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J.

The finding that co-transfection of the κ and δ opioid receptors results in the formation of heterodimers with ligand binding and functional properties that are distinct from singly transfected receptors suggests that heterodimerization may be involved in modulation of GPCR function (13Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Also, Western blot studies have shown that the 5HT1D and 5HT1B receptors form homodimers when expressed alone although they preferentially form heterodimers when co-expressed (14Xie Z. Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have directly examined whether 5HT1 receptors are capable of forming oligomeric complexes with a variety of GPCRs by specific immunoprecipitation of each receptor followed by identification of the co-precipitated proteins using immunoblot analysis. The main objective was to determine the specificity of the interactions across different GPCR subfamilies to gain further insight into the mechanism of GPCR hetero-oligomerization. Restriction endonucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. All other biochemicals were obtained from Sigma unless specified otherwise. The c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) was inserted at the amino termini of 5HT1A and 5HT1Dreceptors by PCR mutagenesis using a Stratagene Robocycler with Hot-Top assembly (Amsterdam, Holland) as described by Nelson and Long (15Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was inserted by a similar procedure into the amino termini of 5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT1D, EDG1, and EDG2 receptors. FLAG-tagged EDG3, GPR26, and GABAB2receptors were a gift from Dr. Kevin Lynch (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). PCR products were cloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pCDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) using standard techniques (16Davis L.G. Kuehl W.M. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1994Google Scholar). Inserts were sequenced with an ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 373A stretch DNA sequencer. Transient transfection of HEK-293 cells with the epitope-tagged constructs was performed by calcium phosphate-mediated gene transfer as described previously (17Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g. The pelleted cells were homogenized at 4 °C by drawing up and down through a 20-gauge syringe needle in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (Sigma). The homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were combined with 12.5 μl (packed gel) of either anti-c-Myc or anti-FLAG M2 affinity agarose (Sigma) and mixed overnight at 4 °C. The immunoadsorbents were recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g and washed three times by resuspension and centrifugation (5 min at 700 × g) in cell lysis buffer and two times in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 150 mm NaCl. The samples were eluted into 60 μl of SDS loading buffer (Sigma). Eluted samples were heated for 3 min at 100 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE on slab gels (180 × 160 × 1.5 mm) polymerized from 10% (w/v) acrylamide and 0.1%N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide in Tris/glycine/SDS buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA) using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The electrophoresed proteins were subjected to semi-dry electrophoretic transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (19Guest P.C. Ravazzola M. Davidson H.W. Orci L. Hutton J.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with either mouse c-Myc antibodies (1:1000) or mouse FLAG antibodies (1:1000) and then with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse serum (1:1000) for detection of immunoreactive bands by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular size calibration was achieved with the MultiMark standards (Novex). HEK-293 cells transfected with either FLAG-tagged 5HT1A, 5HT1B, or 5HT1Dreceptor constructs were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose, and immunoblot analysis of the precipitates revealed the presence of 46, 44, and 42-kDa FLAG-immunoreactive bands, respectively (Fig.1A). Higher molecular weight immunoreactive forms were also present, which might represent oligomeric forms of the 5HT1 receptors. An immunoreactive band that migrated at a size predicted for a FLAG-tagged 5HT1A receptor dimer (92 kDa) showed a strong increase in immunostaining with the reciprocal decrease of the 46-kDa monomer band when the disulfide bond-reducing agent dithiothreitol was omitted from the sample loading buffer (Fig. 1B). An immunoreactive band that migrated at a size predicted for a FLAG-tagged 5HT1Breceptor dimer (88 kDa) showed increased immunostaining with the loss of the 44-kDa monomer band when the samples were electrophoresed in the absence of dithiothreitol (Fig. 1B). Similarly, a possible FLAG-tagged 5HT1D receptor dimer (82 kDa) showed an increase in immunostaining on non-reducing gels with the reciprocal disappearance of the 41-kDa monomer band (Fig. 1B). Similar results have been shown previously for the 5HT1B and 5HT1D receptors, which led to the suggestion that they form homodimers (14Xie Z. Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mechanism of 5HT1B receptor homodimerization appeared to differ from that of the 5HT1Aand 5HT1D receptors because a high proportion 5HT1B receptor homodimer was observed even when gels were run under disulfide bond-reducing conditions (Fig. 1A). To directly test for hetero-oligomerization of different GPCR combinations we used sequential co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses of cells co-transfected with differentially epitope-tagged receptors. This showed that the c-Myc-tagged 5HT1A receptor co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged versions of all receptors tested including the 5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT1D, EDG1, EDG3, GPR26, and GABAB2 receptors (Fig. 2,A and B). The same finding was observed for the c-Myc-tagged 5HT1D receptor, which was co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged versions of the 5HT1B and EDG1receptors (Fig. 2, A and B). Previous studies have also shown that the 5HT1B and 5HT1Dreceptors form heterodimers (14Xie Z. Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The finding that the FLAG- and c-Myc-tagged versions of the 5HT1A receptor were co-precipitated provides direct evidence that this GPCR forms a homo-oligomer. This was also found for the 5HT1D receptor using the c-Myc- and FLAG-tagged versions of this GPCR (data not shown). Co-precipitation of high molecular weight FLAG-immunoreactive 5HT1B, 5HT1D, EDG1, and EDG3 species with the c-Myc-5HT1A receptor (Fig. 2A) suggests that these GPCRs might be present as homodimers and trimers in higher order hetero-oligomeric complexes comprised of at least one c-Myc-5HT1A receptor and two or more of the FLAG-tagged constructs. To rule out the possibility that the observed hetero-oligomerizations were caused by nonspecific aggregation of receptors, extracts from cells separately expressing the c-Myc-tagged 5HT1A and FLAG-tagged 5HT1Breceptors were mixed, immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc agarose, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with FLAG antibodies. In this case, the FLAG-5HT1B receptor was not detected in the precipitated material (Fig.3A). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of the mixed extract with anti-FLAG agarose followed by immunoblot analysis with c-Myc antibodies did not detect the c-Myc-5HT1A receptor (Fig. 3B). This confirmed that successful immunoprecipitation of 5HT1A/5HT1B hetero-oligomers requires co-expression within the same cells before the time of lysis. Thus, the oligomerization of the c-Myc-tagged 5HT1A and FLAG-tagged 5HT1B receptors in the present study is not likely to be caused by nonspecific aggregation. The same results were found for all of the other GPCR/GPCR hetero-oligomers tested in this study (data not shown). To determine whether the hetero-oligomers observed in this study are comprised of GPCRs at discrete protein/protein ratios, HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with a fixed amount (25 μg) of the c-Myc-tagged 5HT1A receptor and varying amounts (25, 5, 1, and 0.2 μg) of the FLAG-tagged EDG1 receptor. The relative amounts of the c-Myc-5HT1A receptor that were associated with the decreasing levels of the FLAG-EDG1 receptor were determined by sequential immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-EDG1 receptor with anti-FLAG-agarose resulted in co-precipitation of similar decreasing levels of c-Myc-5HT1A receptor (Fig.4B) as shown by immunoblot analysis with c-Myc antibodies. Similarly, immunoprecipitation of the c-Myc-5HT1A receptor resulted in co-precipitation of decreasing levels of the FLAG-EDG1 receptor (Fig.4D). Sequential immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis of the lysates with c-Myc/c-Myc or FLAG/FLAG confirmed that the c-Myc-5HT1A receptor was actually expressed in the cells at relatively constant levels and that expression of the FLAG-EDG1 receptor decreased accordingly with the amounts of cDNA transfected into the cells (Fig. 4, Aand C). Similar results were obtained for all of the other receptors under study (data not shown). We have used a co-immunoprecipitation approach to provide direct evidence that GPCRs from different subfamilies are capable of forming hetero-oligomers when co-expressed in HEK-293 cells. Cells were co-transfected with GPCR constructs containing different epitope tags followed by immunoprecipitation of one receptor and detection of co-precipitated receptors by immunoblot analysis. The 5HT1Areceptor formed a homo-oligomer when expressed alone and formed hetero-oligomers when co-expressed with the closely related 5HT1B and 5HT1D receptors (∼36% amino acid homology) and also with the more distantly related EDG1, EDG3, GPR26, and GABAB2 receptors (4–16% amino acid homology). Interestingly, hetero-oligomer formation was shown for all other GPCR combinations tested including the 5HT1D receptor with the 5HT1B and EDG1 receptors. The heterodimerization of 5HT1Band 5HT1D receptors has been shown previously in insect SF9 cells using a viral expression system followed by Western blot analysis (14Xie Z. Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest that the receptor complexes were pre-existing in cells at the time of lysis and were not caused by nonspecific aggregation. Oligomerization was observed only in lysates from co-transfected cells and not in mixed lysates from singly transfected cells. Also, the observed receptor/receptor interactions appeared to occur at defined stoichiometries in co-transfected cells because decreased expression of one receptor resulted in a similar incremental decrease in the amount of the second receptor immunoprecipitated. The appearance of high molecular weight immunoreactive bands corresponding in size to 5HT1A and 5HT1D receptor homo-oligomers appeared to require intact disulfide bonds because these were only detected when gels were run under non-reducing conditions. Little or no 5HT1A and 5HT1D receptor homo-oligomers could be detected when gels were run under reducing conditions. In contrast, a significant proportion of the 5HT1B receptor was detected as high molecular weight oligomers when gels were run under reducing conditions with increased levels of the oligomer and reciprocal loss of the monomer under non-reducing conditions. This indicates that the mechanism of 5HT1B receptor homo-oligomer formation differs from that of the 5HT1A and 5HT1D receptors. Also, the observed immuno-isolation of the putative 5HT1Breceptor dimer by immunoprecipitation of the 5HT1A receptor indicates that these receptors may be present as higher order hetero-oligomers such as trimers or tetramers. A major prerequisite for the physiological assembly of hetero-oligomeric GPCRs is co-expression in the same cells. To demonstrate this would require detailed immunological or specific binding experiments that localize the receptors under study to the same cells combined with co-precipitation studies using receptor-specific antibodies or ligands. The GPCRs tested in this study show a wide range of tissue distributions in the brain. Within the 5HT receptor subfamily 5HT1A, 5HT1B, and 5HT1D receptors all show pre- and postsynaptic localizations and can be found together in some of the same brain regions including the cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus (20Fink K.

The 5HT1B receptor shows co-expression with the 5HT1A receptor in the hippocampus and with the 5HT1D receptor in the olfactory tubercle although the 5HT1B receptor is expressed separately in the anterior caudate putamen, hypothalamus, and thalamus, and the 5HT1Dreceptor is localized separately in the trigeminal nucleus and in parts of the cerebellum (21Bonaventure P. Voorn P. Luyten W.H. Jurzak M. Schotte A. Leysen J.E. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 469-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hetero-oligomerization of the 5HT1Awith the GABAB2 and GPR26 receptors may be of interest because all of these receptors are widely distributed throughout the cortex and may therefore share some regions of overlap (22Barnes N.M. Sharp T. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1083-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (2724) Google Scholar, 23Durkin M.M. Gunwaldsen C.A. Borowsky B. Jones K.A. Branchek T.A. Mol.

The physiological relevance of the hetero-oligomerization of 5HT1A receptor with the EDG1 and EDG3 receptors is not clear because no detailed studies have been carried out on the distribution of the latter receptors within the brain. However, the interactions observed between the 5HT1A and EDG3 receptors are not likely to occur in vivo because the relative expression levels of the latter are relatively low in the brain with the highest levels observed in peripheral tissues such as lung and heart (25Yamaguchi F.

Supporting evidence for oligomerization of endogenously expressed GPCRs comes from Western blot studies of brain tissues revealing the presence of high molecular weight immunoreactive forms of the dopamine D2 receptor (27Ng G.Y.

Res. 1995; 42: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). More recently an immunoelectron microscopy study showed that CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors are clustered and closely apposed on microvilli and in trans-Golgi vesicles of human macrophages and T cells (29Singer I.I.

Springer M.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3779-3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The strongest evidence comes from studies showing that GABABR1 and GABABR2 receptors could be co-immunoprecipitated from rat cortex (9Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W. Beck P.

This is the first study in which the phenomenon of GPCR oligomerization has been investigated using a large number of diverse receptor subtypes. Interestingly, all of the receptors tested were capable of forming hetero-oligomers when co-expressed in tissue culture cells suggesting that this might be a general characteristic of these receptors. These findings highlight the importance for further studies to investigate the occurrence of GPCR hetero-oligomerization in tissues and cells where they are endogenously expressed. Such studies will help to establish the physiological role of such complexes in GPCR function."

In this study, we identify the γ isoform of the human protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (PP1cγ) as a high affinity in vitro target of PA. PA inhibited the enzyme dose-dependently with an IC50 of 15 nm. Mechanistically, PA inhibited the enzyme noncompetitively with the kinetics of a tight binding inhibitor and aKi value of 0.97 ± 0.24 nm. Together, these data describe one of the most potent in vitro effects of PA. To further elucidate the interaction between PA and PP1cγ, structure/function analysis of the lipid was carried out using commercially available and synthetically generated analogs of PA. These studies disclosed that the lipid-protein interaction is dependent on the presence of the lipid phosphate as well as the presence of the fatty acid side chains, because lipids lacking either of these substituents resulted in complete loss of inhibition. However, the specific composition of the fatty acid side chains was not important for inhibition. Using 1-O-hexadecyl,2-oleoyl-PA, it was also shown that the carbonyl group of the sn-1 acyl linkage is not required for the lipid-protein interaction. Finally, using a lipid-protein overlay assay, it was demonstrated that PP1cγ specifically and directly interacts with phosphatidic acid while not significantly binding other phospholipids. These results identify PA as a tight binding and specific inhibitor of PP1, and they raise the hypothesis that PP1cγ may function as a mediator of PA action in cells.

Cellular PA levels are regulated through three major pathways; 1) the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase, 2) the phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) by diacylglycerol kinase, and 3) the hydrolysis of choline from phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phospholipase D (PLD). The tight regulation of these pathways results in low basal cellular concentrations of PA that can be rapidly induced upon stimulation of cells with cellular agonists. This paradigm forms the basis of the hypothesis that PA is a lipid second messenger and a key mediator of these pathways. However, PA still remains without a clearly defined cellular target. The most extensively characterized target of PA is the Raf-1 kinase. Ghosh et al. (1Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, they demonstrated in cells that PA plays a critical role in the docking of Raf-1 at the plasma membrane upon translocation by treatment with phorbol ester. In addition to Raf-1, other putative targets have been identified including SHP-1, phospholipase Cγ1, p47phox, and an undefined PA-dependent protein kinase (4Frank C. Keilhack H. Opitz F.

Yet of these potential targets, few have exhibited direct interaction at physiologically relevant concentrations of PA. Protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is a serine/threonine phosphatase expressed in all eukaryotic cells and has been found to regulate a diverse number of cellular functions including cell cycle regulation, muscle contraction, glycogen metabolism, gene expression, and neurotransmission (8Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 9Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

PP1 in cells is found as a holoenzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit (PP1c) and single targeting/regulatory subunit. There are three major isoforms of PP1c: α, β, and γ1, having greater than 90% homology on the protein level. Regulation of phosphatase activity is thought to occur principally through the action of endogenous peptide inhibitors and association with regulatory/targeting subunits (11Watanabe T. Huang H. Horiuchi A. da Cruze Silva E.F. Hsieh-Wilson L. Allen P.B. Shenolikar S. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been suggested that association with specific targeting subunits can regulate PP1 activity by directing its subcellular localization and substrate specificity, thus allowing it to carry out unique functions in the cell. In addition to the regulation by association with a regulatory subunit, PP1 has also been shown to be modulated by lipid mediators as well as direct phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit (13Kishikawa K.

J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Previously our group has established that PP1cα is inhibited in vitro by acidic phospholipids at relatively high concentrations (13Kishikawa K. Chalfant C.E. Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21335-21341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This inhibition was especially pronounced for PA, which caused complete inhibition at concentrations 10-fold lower than the other phospholipids. In this report, we demonstrate that the γ-isoform of the human PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1cγ) is inhibited by PA with an IC50 of 15 nm, demonstrating high potency. To date, this is one of the most potent in vitro effects of PA observed and may link these two mediators of cellular signal transduction. We therefore set out to describe the mechanism of this inhibition through studying the structure/function relationship mediating the lipid-protein interaction, the biochemical kinetics of PA inhibition, and the direct interaction of PA with PP1cγ. The results from these studies lay the foundation for future investigation of the physiological interaction between PA and PP1cγ. The γ-isoform of the Escherichia coli recombinant human catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1cγ) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Native PP1c was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and contains a mixture of PP1c isoforms. This preparation was provided to us as a generous gift from Dr. Mathieu Bollen. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Anti-His6 mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Anti-PP1c (E-9) mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-mouse peroxidase was acquired from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). The pBAD/His-B E. coli expression vector was purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes XhoI andKpnI were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All other reagents, unless otherwise noted, were purchased from Sigma. Chloroform stocks of the various lipids were stored at −20 °C. An aliquot of the chloroform stock was dried in a glass vial under a stream of nitrogen gas. The dried lipid was resuspended in phosphatase assay buffer (see below) by sonication with a probe tip sonicator (Sonic Dismembrator 550; Fisher) using three 30-s pulses at 8% power. The resulting aqueous suspension was diluted to generate 20× working concentrations, 5 μl of which, was used per reaction. All vesicles were prepared at room temperature. 32P-MBP was labeled as previously described by Kishikawa et al.(13Kishikawa K. Chalfant C.E. Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21335-21341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). [32P]Phosphorylase a was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the protein phosphorylation assay system from Invitrogen. Dephosphorylation of 32P-MBP or [32P]phosphorylase a was carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), pH 7.4. Duplicate reactions containing 10.6 microunits of PP1cγ (EC 3.1.3.16) (or an equivalent amount of activity for native PP1c) were preincubated in the presence or absence of lipid vesicles for 10 min at 30 °C. The reactions were then initiated with the addition of32P-labeled substrate and were allowed to proceed for 20 min. The reactions were stopped with the addition of 60% trichloroacetic acid (v/v) to achieve a final concentration of 30% in the reaction mix. To facilitate precipitation of the substrate and enzyme, 250 μg of bovine serum albumin were added as a carrier, and the samples were allowed to incubate on ice for 10 min. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and 200 μl of the resulting supernatants were scintillation counted. Scintillation counts were expressed as percentages of the vehicle-treated control. To determine the kinetic mechanism of PA inhibition, phosphatase assays were carried out as above but included the addition of 100 μm MnCl2 to the reaction buffer to stabilize the basal activity and reduce experiment to experiment variation. The activities of substrate dose-response curves were expressed as pmol of Pi/min/ml released. The data were analyzed using the enzyme kinetics module of the Sigma Plot 2001 software package. This module was specially equipped to handle tight binding inhibitor kinetics. 1-Oleoyl,2-stearoyl-PC, dielaidoyl-PC, di-O-octadecyl-PC, and 1-O-hexadecyl,2-oleoyl-PC were converted in vitro to their respective PA analogs for use as inhibitors in the phosphatase assay. Briefly, 5 mg of lipid was dried from a chloroform stock under a stream of nitrogen. It was then resuspended in 2 ml of PLD reaction buffer (200 mm sodium acetate, 80 mm calcium chloride, pH 5.6) by sonication with a probe tip sonicator. One hundred units of cabbage PLD (EC 3.1.4.4) (Sigma) solubilized in PLD reaction buffer was added to the lipid suspension, and the mixture was overlaid with 2 ml of ether. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature and was supplemented with additional enzyme at 2 h increments for 6 h. The reaction was then allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature. The following day, the ether phase was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the aqueous lipid suspension was extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 341-345Crossref Scopus (42861) Google Scholar). The converted lipid was separated from its PC precursor by thin layer chromatography using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (80:15:8:0.5) as the mobile phase. Precursor and product lipids were visualized by staining with iodine and identified based on standards run on adjacent lanes. The converted lipid was scraped and extracted from the silica resin using chloroform:methanol:water (5:5:1). The extracted lipid was then dried down, resuspended in chloroform, and quantitated by measuring lipid phosphate content as previously described (19Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The converted, quantitated lipid was then used in phosphatase assays as indicated above. The human PP1cγ sequence was cloned by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-CCG CTC GAG CAT GGC GGA TTT AGA TAA ACT C-3′ containing an 5′-XhoI restriction site and 5′-GCG GTA CCC TAT TTC TTT GCT TGC TTT GTG-3′ containing a 3′-KpnI restriction site. The resulting product was restriction digested then ligated into the inducible bacterial expression vector pBAD/His-B, which had been linearized with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid sequence was verified prior to expression and purification of the recombinant protein. Clones of transformed TOP10 E. coli (Invitrogen) were screened to contain a correct and inducible plasmid. His6-PP1cγ was purified from a 4-liter bacterial culture grown slowly overnight in the presence of 0.0002%l-arabinose to induce expression of the recombinant protein. The bacterial cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 3000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mmsodium phosphate, 0.2 m sodium chloride, 20 mmimidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.0 (binding buffer). The cells were broken by two passages through a French press, followed by mild sonication with a probe tip sonicator. The total cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to remove nonsoluble protein, cell debris, and unbroken cells. The total lysate was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter prior to being loaded on the affinity column. All subsequent steps were preformed at 4 °C. The His-tagged protein was captured on metal chelating affinity Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) prebound with nickel sulfate. The soluble bacterial cell lysate was loaded onto the column at a rate of 0.25 ml/min, and the column was washed extensively with binding buffer followed by an increasing step gradient of imidazole ranging from 50 to 500 mm. When no protein was eluted with 500 mm imidazole, the column was washed with binding buffer containing 0.05 m EDTA. The His6-PP1cγ was recovered from the EDTA fraction and concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged on a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was then loaded on to a 1-ml MonoQ column (0.5 × 10 cm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, and eluted with a linear gradient of the same buffer containing 1m NaCl. The peak fractions were identified by activity assays. They were then pooled, and the buffer was exchanged as before. The purified protein was exchanged into 25 mmtriethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm EGTA, 0.03% Brij 35, and 25% glycerol. The protein purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining, and protein content was quantitated with the Pierce BCA protein assay system. The purified recombinant His6-PP1cγ was stored at −70 °C. Lipid-protein overlay assays were performed according to the protocol of Dowler et al.(20Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of the indicated lipids were spotted onto Hybond C extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) from chloroform stocks. The membranes were allowed to dry under vacuum for 1 h and were then wetted by floating on purified water. The membranes were equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 5 min, followed by blocking with 3% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin/TBS-T (blocking reagent) for 1 h at room temperature. Purified human E. coli recombinant PP1cγ (Calbiochem, >95% purity) or purified recombinant His6-PP1cγ (>90% purity) was diluted into blocking reagent to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. The membranes were then incubated in the presence of the enzyme overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The following day the membranes were washed six times for 5 min with TBS-T. All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. The protein was then identified by incubating with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-PP1c or anti-His6 antibody in blocking reagent for 1 h. This was followed by a second wash step of six times for 5 min with TBS-T. Secondary antibody was diluted 1:5000 into blocking reagent and incubated for 1 h. This was followed by a final wash step of twelve times for 5 min with TBS-T. Finally, the protein was visualized using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) with exposure to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Because PA has been previously shown to inhibit PP1c, we pursued the mechanism of this inhibition. Initially, the E. coli recombinant catalytic subunit of human PP1γ was incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of PA. Dose-dependent inhibition of phosphatase activity was observed with an IC50 of 15 nm (Fig. 1A). The control PP1cγ phosphatase activity, in this experiment (similar for all subsequent experiments), was 4.9 ± 1.6 pmol Pi/min/ml released. The inhibition was independent of the substrate used because identical inhibition was observed when using an artificial substrate, 32P-MBP, versus a physiological substrate, [32P]phosphorylase a. Because of reported differences between recombinant and purified preparations of PP1c, we assessed whether PA could inhibit native PP1c (21Alessi D.R. Street A.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Endo S. Connor J.H. Forney B. Zhang L. Ingebritsen T.S. Lee E.Y. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6986-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, native PP1c was inhibited by PA with an IC50 of 135 nm. This suggests that PA specifically interacts with a subset of PP1c isoforms contained in the purified preparation. The high degree of potency and specificity of PA for PP1cγ led us to investigate the mechanism of inhibition. To define the biochemical parameters of PA inhibition of PP1cγ, kinetic analysis was performed on substrate dose-response data carried out in the presence and absence of PA. As shown in Fig.2A, PA was able to inhibit PP1cγ activity to the same degree over a wide range of substrate concentrations. However, when the substrate and inhibitor concentrations were maintained in the presence of varying concentrations of enzyme, inhibition of enzyme activity by PA was lost as the enzyme concentration was increased (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the inhibitor concentration is not in excess of the enzyme concentration, indicating that PA functions as a tight binding inhibitor of PP1cγ. We next performed kinetics analysis using nonlinear least squares regression to determine the kinetics parameters (Fig. 2, C and D). The following equation was used to account for the amount of inhibitor effectively removed from free solution as it bound to the enzyme. v=(v0/(2⋅E))⋅(E-I-Ki+((E-I-Ki)2+4⋅E⋅Ki))Equation 1 where the velocity was calculated in terms ofv0, the initial velocity; E, the initial total enzyme concentration; I, the free inhibitor concentration; and Ki, the inhibition constant.Km and Vmax for MBP were determined to be 7.69 ± 1.22 μm and 37.11 ± 4.37 pmol Pi/min/ml released, respectively. PA inhibited the enzyme noncompetitively (see Fig. 2D), and theKi of PA was determined to be 0.97 ± 0.24 nm. In an attempt to gain a greater understanding of the interaction between PA and PP1cγ, a detailed series of experiments was carried out to identify the critical structural components of PA required for inhibition of PP1cγ. As seen in Fig. 3, there are three major structural features of PA; the phosphate head group (panel I), the lipid side chains (panel II), and the lipid acyl-linkage (panel III). By using commercially available PA or PC analogs (subsequently converted to PA analogs in vitro; indicated by asterisks in Fig. 3), we tested the requirement of these structural features for their contribution toward PP1cγ inhibition. First, the requirement for the phosphate head group was investigated. Inhibition of phosphatase activity was assessed using DAG and monooleoyl-glycerol, both of which lack the phosphate head group. Fig. 4A illustrates that neither DAG nor monooleoyl-glycerol was capable of inhibiting PP1cγ activity, suggesting that the phosphate head group may be required for interaction between the protein and lipid. This was further explored by assessing the effects of the dioleoyl-phosphatidyl-alcohols: phosphatidylmethanol, phosphatidylethanol, and phosphatidylbutanol, on phosphatase activity. We hypothesized that if the phosphate was needed to make a critical contact with amino acids of the enzyme, by placing a methyl group on the phosphate we may be able to inhibit the lipid-protein interaction. Moreover, phosphatidyl-alcohols are formed in cells when phospholipase D is activated in the presence of primary alcohols. Thus, by using a series of phosphatidyl-alcohols, the resulting effects of substituting a hydroxyl group from the phosphomonoester of PA with various alkyl chains from primary alcohols allowed us to assess the significance of the phosphate contact with the enzyme. As can be seen in Fig.4B, when the phosphate of PA has an alkyl substituent, it loses its ability to inhibit PP1cγ. These data imply not only that the presence of the phosphate head group is a requirement but that inhibition of the enzyme is dependent on its direct interaction with critical amino acid residues of PP1cγ. Second, the requirement for the presence of an aliphatic side chain for inhibition of PP1cγ was determined. To this end, analogs that lacked both lipid side chains were evaluated. As seen in Fig.5A, the phosphorylated glycerols, α-glycerophosphate and β-glycerophosphate, were not able to inhibit enzyme activity. This argues that there is a requirement for at least one side chain. To determine whether one side chain is sufficient, we next tested LPA, which mimics PA except that it lacks the sn-2 lipid side chain. LPA was not able to inhibit PP1cγ (Fig. 5B), thus suggesting that both side chains are required for PA to inhibit enzyme activity. Next, the contribution of the length and composition of the lipid side chains toward the inhibition of PP1cγ was explored. Initially, the degree of saturation of the lipid side chains was evaluated to determine the effect on enzyme inhibition. Using the fully saturated PA analogs distearoyl-PA and dioctanoyl-PA, it was observed that neither of the saturated compounds were capable of inhibiting phosphatase activity (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, eliminating the double bond on the lipid side chains abolished inhibitory activity of the lipid, even when the lipid chains were truncated prior to the cis9–10 double bond of PA. These results may indicate that there is a requirement for at least one double bond in the lipid side chains for PA to interact with PP1cγ. However, because these results were somewhat unexpected, we further explored the significance of side chain composition by testing mixed saturated/unsaturated PA analogs. As can be seen in Fig. 6B, 1-stearoyl,2-oleoyl-PA was fully capable of inhibiting PP1cγ phosphatase activity. Furthermore, the use of 1-oleoyl,2-stearoyl-PA was also able to inhibit enzyme activity to the same degree (data not shown). Together these data suggest that there may be a requirement for a single unsaturated side chain; however, there is no specificity for the sn-1 versus the sn-2 position in the structure. To further address the issue of lipid side chain composition, we examined the ability of 1-stearoyl,2-arachidonoyl-PA to inhibit PP1cγ. This compound contains a fully saturated sn-1linked side chain and a polyunsaturated (cis5, 8, 11, 14)sn-2 linked side chain. As can be seen in Fig.6C, this analog was fully capable of inhibiting PP1cγ to the same extent as PA. Similarly, dielaidoyl-PA (diC18:1), containing a [trans9–10] double bond in place of the cis9–10 double bond, also inhibited phosphatase activity to the same extent as dioleoyl-PA (Fig.6D). Together these data support the suggestion that the composition of the lipid side chains is not a major determinant of PP1cγ inhibition. This requirement for at least one double bond in one of the hydrocarbon chains may result from physical conditions such as the solubility of PA and/or the need for vesicle formation and not from differences in interaction with the enzyme. To further evaluate this possibility, we tested a few key compounds for their ability to inhibit PP1cγ when delivered in mixed detergent/lipid micelles. Mixed micelle delivery systems have been used extensively for delivering lipids, which do not easily form vesicles, to soluble enzymes. To explore the possibility that saturated PAs were not forming suitable vesicles, we employed Triton X-100 micelles to deliver dioleoyl-PA, distearoyl-PA, and dioleoyl-DAG to PP1cγin vitro. As shown in Fig. 7, both dioleoyl-PA, and distearoyl-PA were able to inhibit PP1cγ activity, whereas dioleoyl-DAG was not. These data substantiate the notion that lipid side chain composition is not a major determinant of enzyme inhibition by these analogs, while further supporting the evidence that the presence of the phosphate group is crucial for PP1cγ inhibition. Moreover, the mode of lipid delivery to PP1cγ is of critical importance and may indicate a requirement for the presence of a lipid surface to coordinate the lipid-protein interaction. It should be noted that Triton X-100 detergent micelles alone were capable of activating PP1cγ ∼2-fold when delivered as a 0.3% solution. Although the observed activation was dose-dependent, it is believed to be a result of a general sensitivity of the enzyme to hydrophobic compounds, because we observed a similar response with other detergent micelle preparations (data not shown). The last major feature of the PA structure to be investigated was the requirement of the acyl-linkage of the lipid side chains for PP1cγ inhibition. To gain insight as to the significance of the carbonyl group, a mixed alkyl/acyl-PC-derivative was converted to the respective PA analog using cabbage PLD. The converted compound was purified by thin layer chromatography, quantitated, and used to inhibit PP1cγ. As can be seen in Fig. 8, 1-O-hexadecyl,2-oleoyl-PA lacking the carbonyl at thesn-1 position was still capable of potent inhibition of PP1cγ. Unfortunately, the dialkyl-derivative did not serve as a suitable substrate for cabbage PLD and thus could not be converted to its corresponding PA analog. In light of this, these data demonstrate that the sn-1 carbonyl group is not required for PP1cγ inhibition. Given the unavailability of the dialkyl-derivative, we could not determine the contribution of the sn-2carbonyl, if any, in respect to inhibition of PP1cγ. To demonstrate a direct physical interaction between PP1cγ and PA, binding studies were carried out using the lipid-protein overlay method developed by Boss and co-workers (23Stevenson J.M.

The NifL protein utilizes discrete mechanisms to perceive these signals leading to the formation of a protein-protein complex, which inhibits NifA activity.

The nif-specific transcriptional activator, NifA, activates transcription by σ54 (σN)-RNA polymerase holoenzyme at nif promoters under conditions appropriate for nitrogen fixation, and the regulatory protein NifL controls the transcriptional activation functions of NifA in response to environmental cues (1Dixon R.

Eydmann T Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), leading to the formation of a protein-protein complex that inhibits NifA activity (3Money T. Jones T. Dixon R. Austin S. J.

NifL is a flavoprotein that senses redox status via an N-terminal FAD-containing PAS domain (6Hill S. Austin S. Eydmann T. Jones T. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism whereby the NifL-NifA system perceives the nitrogen status is less well understood although recent evidence implicates direct interaction with PII-like signal transduction proteins (9Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PII-like proteins are among the most widely distributed signal transduction proteins in nature and serve to integrate signals of carbon and nitrogen status to regulate nitrogen metabolism (10Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 11Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top.

Many proteobacteria encode two paralogous PII signal-transducing proteins, termed PII and GlnK, and representatives of this protein family have been most thoroughly characterized in the enteric bacteria. The Escherichia coli PII-like proteins are covalently modified in response to nitrogen limitation by the uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme (UTase/UR) encoded byglnD (13Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12782-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the noncooperative uridylylation of PII with up to three UMP groups covalently attached per trimer. Glutamine is the primary signal for the fixed nitrogen status in enteric bacteria (14Ikeda T.P. Shauger A.E. Kustu S. J. Mol.

Microbiol. 2000; 41: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and this effector binds to UTase/UR to stimulate the uridylyl-removing activity, thus de-uridylylating PII under nitrogen-sufficient conditions. Conversely, under conditions of nitrogen limitation when the concentration of glutamine is low, the UTase/UR uridylylates PII (10Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 11Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top.

Covalent modification of the PII-like proteins influences their ability to interact with different receptors to control nitrogen assimilation, including adenylyltransferase (ATase)1 (16Jaggi R. van Heeswijk W.C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12795-12801Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli PII protein (Ec PII) activates the phosphatase activity and inhibits the kinase activity of NtrB (NRII) (19Atkinson M. Kamberov E.S. Weiss R.L. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28288-28293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jiang P. Ninfa A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PII also stimulates ATase to adenylylate glutamine synthetase. In contrast, PII-UMP inhibits the activity of ATase to stimulate de-adenylylation of glutamine synthetase but does not interact with NtrB, thus enabling the latter to phosphorylate NtrC (nitrogen regulatory protein NRI) (10Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 11Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Atkinson M.R. Peliska J.A. Curr. Top.

In addition to control via covalent modification, the activity of the PII paralogues is also modulated by the synergistic binding of the low molecular weight effectors, ATP and 2-oxoglutarate (21Kamberov E. Atkinson M. Ninfa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17797-17807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Atkinson M.R. Ninfa A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The interaction between PII with the ATase and NtrB is allosterically regulated by the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to PII such that binding of a single molecule of 2-oxoglutarate enhances the interaction of PII with these effectors, whereas anti-cooperative binding of more than one 2-oxoglutarate molecule per PII trimer diminishes the interaction with NtrB and ATase (17Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12802-12810Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12795-12801Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A. vinelandii apparently encodes only a single PII-like protein (called Av GlnK or formerly Av PII), which is expressed from the glnK amtB operon (23Meletzus D. Rudnick P. Doetsch N. Green A. Kennedy C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3260-3264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein appears to be essential for cell survival, as knock-out mutations in theglnK gene are apparently lethal. Av GlnK is subject to covalent modification by a homologue of E. coli UTase/UR encoded by A. vinelandii glnD (24Rudnick P. Colnaghi R. Green A. Kennedy C. Newton W. Biological Nitrogen Fixation in the 21st Century. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 123-124Google Scholar, 25Colnaghi R. He P. Rudnick L. Green A. Yan D. Larson E. Kennedy C. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The UTase/UR appears to be involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation in A. vinelandii because mutations in glnD give rise to a Nif phenotype that can be suppressed by secondary mutations innifL (25Colnaghi R. He P. Rudnick L. Green A. Yan D. Larson E. Kennedy C. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Contreras A. Drummond M. Bali A. Blanco G. Garcia E. Bush G. Kennedy C. Merrick M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7741-7749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possible interpretation of this result is that the uridylylation status of Av GlnK mediates regulation of nitrogen fixation via interaction with the NifL-NifA system. We have recently demonstrated with purified components that Av GlnK, but not Av GlnK-UMP, stimulates the ability of NifL to inhibit transcriptional activation by NifA in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate and ATP (9Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of NifL was also stimulated by Ec PII, consistent with our observation that PII-like proteins are required for NifL to inhibit NifA under conditions of nitrogen excess when the A. vinelandii nifL-nifA operon is expressed in E. coli (27Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3076-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The role of 2-oxoglutarate in regulating the NifL-NifA system is further complicated by our observation that the activities of these proteins are modulated by 2-oxoglutarate in the absence of Av GlnK (9Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, 2-oxoglutarate controls NifL-NifA activity directly, in addition to its potential role in controlling the activity of Av GlnK. These observations suggest a model in which Av GlnK signals the nitrogen status by direct interaction with the NifL-NifA system under conditions of nitrogen excess and that inhibition of NifA by NifL is relieved by elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate when Av GlnK is uridylylated under conditions of nitrogen limitation (Fig.1). To elucidate the mechanism of nitrogen sensing by the A. vinelandii NifL-NifA system, it is necessary to determine which protein component(s) interact with Av GlnK and to analyze the effectors required for this interaction. Potentially, Av GlnK could interact with either NifL or NifA, or both of these components, to modulate transcriptional activation. In this report we have investigated, with purified components, the interaction of Av GlnK with NifL and NifA. We observe a specific interaction between NifL and Av GlnK that is dependent on the presence of both 2-oxoglutarate and ATP. The interaction was not detectable with a mutant form of GlnK that is defective in stimulating inhibition of NifA activity by NifL in vitro. Furthermore, our data indicate that the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of NifL is sufficient for the interaction with Av GlnK. Plasmid pTJ42 expressing native A. vinelandii NifA with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (NifA6-His) was prepared from plasmid pDB737 (28Austin S. Buck M. Cannon W. Eydmann T. Dixon R. J.

An EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pDB737 containing the 3′ end of NifA was cloned into the vector pTE103 to give plasmid pTJ39 containing a single BglII site within theEcoRI-BamHI region. A double-stranded oligonucleotide with engineered BglII and BamHI sticky ends and encoding a hexahistidine tag and stop codon, respectively, was cloned into pTJ39 yielding plasmid pTJ41. TheEcoRI-BamHI fragment from pTJ41 was subsequently cloned into pDB737 to give plasmid pTJ42. Plasmid pVCO1, expressingA. vinelandii GlnD with a N-terminal histidine tag, was obtained by cloning a NdeI-BamHI fragment from pYZ5 (9Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R.

Mutagenesis was carried out with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mutagenic primers were 5′-AAGGGCCATACCTGCCTGTACCGGGG-3′ (E44C) and 5′-GTACCGGGGTGCGTGCTACGTAGTCGAC-3′ (E50C). All constructs were sequenced commercially (MWG Biotech) over their entire length to ensure that only the desired mutations were introduced. Plasmids overexpressing Av GlnK mutants were derived from plasmid pYZ1 described previously (9Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R.

Two 1-ml HiTrap Chelating HP columns (Amersham Biosciences) were connected in series and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mmKSCN, 5 mm imidazole, 250 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Purification was carried out using Biocad Sprint Perfusion chromatography (PerkinElmer Biosystems) using a linear gradient from 0 to 750 mm imidazole over a 40-ml elution volume. Av GlnK, Ec PII, σ54, and IHF were purified as described previously (9Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R.

Molar protein concentrations were calculated on the basis that NifL6-His purifies as a tetramer and the truncated NifL polypeptides NifL-(1–284)6-His, NifL-(147–519)6-His, and NifL-(360–519)6-Hisare tetrameric, dimeric, and monomeric, respectively (2Söderbäck E.

The molar concentrations of NifA and Av GlnK were calculated on the basis that these proteins are a dimer and trimer, respectively. NifA-promoted catalysis of open promoter complexes by σ54-RNA polymerase was used to assay NifA activity and its inhibition by NifL as described previously (5Eydmann T. Söderbäck E. Jones T. Hill S.

Linearized template DNA was provided by digesting plasmid pNH8 with EcoRI and BamHI to yield a 260-bp fragment, containing the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifH promoter and upstream activator sequences, which was 3′ end-labeled with [α-32P]dGTP at the BamHI site. Reactions (final volume of 15 μl) were carried out in TAP buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 3.5% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) and contained 5 nmtemplate DNA, 3.4 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 125 nm core RNA polymerase, 200 nmσ54, 100 nm IHF, and 3.5 mm ATP. GTP (final concentration 500 μm) was present prior to the heparin challenge to allow formation of initiated complexes, which are more stable than open promoter complexes (5Eydmann T. Söderbäck E. Jones T. Hill S. Austin S. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1186-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases an ATP regenerating system was provided by adding creatine kinase (20 units/ml) and creatine phosphate (12 mm). The reaction components (including Av GlnK at concentrations indicated in Fig. 2) were preincubated for 2 min at 30 °C, and reactions were then initiated by the addition of either NifA alone or NifA plus NifL. After 20 min of incubation, reactions were mixed with 3 μl of dye mix containing 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 2 μg of heparin and immediately loaded onto a 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio 80:1) in 25 mm Tris, 400 mm glycine, pH 8.6, which had been prerun at 180 V at room temperature down to a constant power of 2 watts. Gels were run for 2.5–3 h at 100 V. Gels were dried down, and the percentage of radioactivity in open complexes quantitated with the Fujix BAS1000 phosphorimager. Ni-NTA-magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen) were equilibrated in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. NifL polypeptides, at a concentration of 0.3 μm, were immobilized by preincubation in a total volume of 500 μl containing 50 μl of the magnetic bead suspension. After 30 min, the beads were washed in the above buffer and Av GlnK was added to a final concentration of 1 μm in a volume of 500 μl. Following an additional 60-min incubation, the beads were washed, the buffer subsequently removed, and elution performed with HEPES buffer as above but containing 500 mm imidazole. Aliquots of each sample were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a BIAcore X biosensor system (BIAcore AB). Hexahistidine-tagged derivatives of NifL and NifA were immobilized on nickel-NTA biosensor chip surfaces. Nickel was first bound to the NTA surface through injection of 20-μl volumes of 500 μm nickel chloride. Proteins for immobilization were introduced to the protein-chip surface at a concentration of 40 nm. Experiments were performed at 25 °C in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Most experiments were carried out in the presence of a control protein in the reference flow cell, as stated in the figure legends. In all cases it was ensured that the binding response of the control protein upon immobilization was at least equal to that of the sample protein. Experiments were performed in a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) at 28 °C in a cell volume of 1.35 ml. Binding of 2-oxoglutarate to PII-like proteins was measured by titrating 2 mm ligand from a 250-μl injection syringe into the sample cell, which was stirred at 300 rpm. 5- or 10-μl injections were made to the stoichiometric excess given in Fig. 6. Buffer conditions were 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.0. The PII proteins were dialyzed overnight prior to ITC, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The heat change for the dilution of the ligand in the absence of protein was measured for each experiment and was subtracted from the measured heat change of ligand binding to protein. Data analysis was performed with the Origin program, provided by MicroCal. The uridylylation method was based on previously published methods (22Atkinson M.R. Ninfa A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm UTP, 500 μm 2-oxoglutarate, pH 7.5. Av GlnK was present at a concentration of 15 μm and GlnD6-His at a concentration of 1 μm. Following incubation at 30 °C, aliquots of the reaction were removed at time intervals to monitor uridylylation. Glycerol and KCl were added to 10% (v/v) and 350 mm final concentrations, respectively, and the samples were heated to 60 °C for 15 min to inactivate UTase/UR. Samples were added to an equal volume of native sample buffer (125 mmTris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, pH 8.0) and analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Limited proteolysis was performed at 20 °C in Tris acetate buffer comprising 50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 8 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmATP, 500 μm 2-oxoglutarate, pH 7.0. NifL and GlnK were combined in a final reaction volume of 130 μl and preincubated for 10 min prior to initiation of digestion. A trypsin:NifL weight ratio of 1:200 was used. 15-μl samples were removed at the time intervals indicated in the figure legend to tubes containing a 2-fold weight excess of soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor. To these samples was added 15 μl of gel loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, pH 8.6). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 4 min prior to electrophoretic separation. To provide controls for the protein-protein interaction experiments, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the surface exposed T-loop region of Av GlnK, which contains the tyrosine residue that is the target site for uridylylation and, by analogy with the well characterized E. coli PII-like proteins, is likely to play a major role in the interaction with receptors (31Jiang P.

The T-loop sequence of the Av GlnK protein (residues 37–55) differs from Ec PII in only a single amino acid at position 52. Engineered derivatives of Ec PII with single cysteine substitutions at glutamate 44 and glutamate 50 have been used previously to probe interactions between Ec PII and NtrB (NRII) with heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents, which label thiol groups (35Pioszak A.A. Jiang P. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13450-13461Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although these mutations do not perturb the PII-NtrB interaction, mutations in the T-loop frequently allow discrimination between receptors (31Jiang P. Zucker P. Atkinson M.R. Kamberov E.S. Tirasophon W. Chandran P. Schefke B.R. Ninfa A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4342-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We prepared the equivalent E44C and E50C mutations in Av GlnK and purified the mutant proteins following overexpression in E. coli (Fig.2A). Both mutant proteins behaved similarly to the native protein on purification. However, in contrast to the native protein, neither of the mutant proteins could be uridylylated by purified A. vinelandii UTase/UR (data not shown), indicating that they are either defective in the interaction with the UTase or are defective as substrates in the catalytic step. The ability of the mutant proteins to activate the inhibitory function of NifL was assayed by measuring the influence of NifL on transcriptional activation by NifA at the nifH promoterin vitro. These assays quantitate the formation of heparin-resistant open promoter complexes by σ54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme catalyzed by NifA in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates and IHF (5Eydmann T. Söderbäck E. Jones T. Hill S. Austin S. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1186-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To simplify the assays, we use a truncated form of NifL, NifL-(147–519)6-His, which lacks the redox response but retains the response to nitrogen status in vivo(2Söderbäck E. Reyes-Ramirez F. Eydmann T Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the ability to respond to Av GlnK in vitro (9Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This truncated protein thus allows reactions to be performed under aerobic conditions without activating the redox response of NifL. NifL-(147–519)6-His inhibits NifA activity in the presence of ATP, but this inhibition is relieved by the addition of 2-oxoglutarate. However, the addition of native Av GlnK enhances the inhibitory activity of NifL-(147–519)6-His when both ATP and 2-oxoglutarate are present (9Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Whereas Av GlnK E50C, like native Av GlnK, possesses this activity, the mutant Av GlnK E44C protein exerted little or no influence on inhibition of NifA activity by NifL (Fig. 2B). Neither the native nor the mutant proteins had any influence on NifA activity in the absence of NifL (data not shown). It would therefore appear that the GlnK E44C mutant is substantially defective in activating the inhibitory function of NifL, whereas the Av GlnK E50C mutant is not defective in this function. A “pull-down” assay using Ni-NTA-magnetic agarose beads was employed to probe for interactions between Av GlnK and immobilized NifL and NifA in the presence and absence of effectors. Purified derivatives of NifL and NifA bearing a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus were immobilized on the Ni-NTA bead surface, and the beads were then incubated in the presence of Av GlnK. A wash phase was carried out to remove adventitiously bound protein, and elution of the His-tagged proteins was subsequently performed with 500 mmimidazole. By analogy with the well characterized interactions between Ec PII-like proteins and their receptors, we suspected that the binding of both 2-oxoglutarate and ATP to Av GlnK would be required to detect any interaction. Accordingly, no interaction was resolved in the absence of ATP or 2-oxoglutarate, or in the presence of only a single effector (Fig. 3, lanes 2–4). In the presence of both ATP (3.5 mm) and 2-oxoglutarate (2 mm), Av GlnK co-eluted with the native NifL6-His protein (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and6) but not with the NifA6-His protein (Fig. 3,lane 9). The Av GlnK E44C mutant protein defective in stimulation of NifL inhibition in vitro did not co-elute with NifL (Fig. 3, lane 7). In contrast, the GlnK E50"

TRPC activity is linked through unknown mechanisms to G-protein-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases that activate phospholipase C. To investigate the properties and function of TRPC4 in neuronally derived cells, we transiently expressed mouse TRPC4 and histamine H1 receptor in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 cells.

No current was evoked by perfusion with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. When exocytosis was monitored with the capacitance detection technique, the magnitude of the membrane capacitance increase (ΔCm) on application of histamine in H1 receptor/TRPC4-expressing chromaffin cells was comparable with that triggered by a train of depolarizing pulses. Our results indicate that TRPC4 channels behave as receptor, but not store-operated, channels in neuronally derived cells.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 643-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the product of the trp gene functions as a Ca2+-permeable channel required for inositide-mediated Ca2+ entry and that flies deficient intrp product lack sustained Ca2+ entry. Since the cloning of the original trp gene (3Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), the “TRP” family of proteins has expanded rapidly. Recently, TRPs were subdivided into three groups, short, long, and Osm (4Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Mammalian “short” TRP channels (TRPCs)1 form a seven-member group of second messenger-operated, non-selective Ca2+-permeable cation channels (TRPC1–7) that can be activated by G-protein-coupled receptors or tyrosine receptor kinases. Phospholipase C plays a key role in stimulation of TRPC activity, although the specific mechanism of channel activation is unclear (5Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Several activation mechanisms have been proposed, including stimulation by store depletion, direct coupling with IP3receptor/ryanodine receptors, and activation by second messengers such as diacylglycerol (6Zhu X.

Cell. 2000; 6: 421-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). TRPCs are widely expressed in mammalian tissues, and the mRNAs of some isoforms such as TRPC4 and TRPC5 are expressed predominantly in brain (11Mori Y. Takada N. Okada T. Wakamori M. Imoto K. Wanifuchi H. Oka H. Oba A. Ikenaka K. Kurosaki T. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 507-515PubMed Google Scholar, 12Philipp S. Hambrecht J. Braslavski L. Schroth G. Freichel M. Murakami M. Cavalie A.

Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To date, almost all studies of TRPC isoforms have been performed in non-excitable expression systems such as HEK293 cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and oocytes (5Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). There is no universal agreement on the ion selectivity and kinetic properties of individual TRPCs. At least part of the controversy arises because TRPC isoforms can exhibit different characteristics in different cellular environments (14Strubing C. Krapinivsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Neurotransmitter release in neurons and neuroendocrine cells is triggered by a rise in [Ca2+]. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) provide highly localized, rapid [Ca2+] elevations. Additional Ca2+ entry pathways, however, may trigger or modulate exocytosis. For example, numerous metabotropic presynaptic receptors can modulate synaptic release via second messenger systems. G-protein-coupled receptors that activate phospholipase Cβ cause release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and may activate additional cationic conductances such as store-operated or other cation channels. To determine whether TRPCs can respond to G-protein-coupled receptor signaling and mediate exocytosis in neuronal cells, we transiently expressed TRPC4 in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells, which are developmentally related to sympathetic neurons. We found that stimulation of TRPC4 via the Gq/11-linked histamine H1 receptor induced exocytosis in chromaffin cells co-transfected with TRPC4 and H1-R. Thapsigargin and IP3 did not stimulate TRPC4 in the cells, suggesting that activation is not store-operated. Because TRPC4 is abundant in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cortical neurons (11Mori Y. Takada N. Okada T. Wakamori M. Imoto K. Wanifuchi H. Oka H. Oba A. Ikenaka K. Kurosaki T. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 507-515PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that activation of by agonists of metabotropic receptors may regulate secretory responses in neurons. TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA from the mouse brain. The primers used for the polymerase chain reaction were 5′-GTCGACGCCACCATGGCTCAGTTCTATTACAAAAG (sense) and 5′-GGATCCGTTCACAATCTTGTGGTCACATAATC (antisense). The β (accession number AAD10168) isoform of mouse TRPC4 was amplified from total RNA by employing SuperScript one-step reverse transcription-PCR with Platinum Taq System. The PCR product was subcloned into the pCR2.1 cloning vector using the Original TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into theSalI/BamHI sites of the pEYFP-N1 vector or the pEYFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The mouse H1 histamine receptor was amplified using primers 5′-TCTCTATGGATTATGTGG (sense) and 5′-CGAGCAGAGAATGAATGC (antisense). The product was subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of the pEYFP-N1 vector. The identity of the inserts were confirmed by sequencing. Chromaffin cells were isolated using a modified Tischler method (15Tischler A.S. Powers J.F. Shahsavari M. Ziar J. Tsokas P. Downing J. McClain R.M. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1997; 35: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, adrenal glands were dissected from 4–10-week-old outbred Swiss Webster mice and placed into Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Locke’s buffer that contained 154 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm K2HPO4, 0.95 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), supplemented with penicillin (200 μg ml−1)/streptomycin (50 μg ml−1) at room temperature. Glands were cleaned free of surrounding fatty and cortical tissue. Isolated medullae were digested in Locke’s buffer containing first 1.5 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by 1.25 mg/ml trypsin (1:250) (Invitrogen) and 0.075 mg/ml DNase 1 (Sigma) at 37 °C. Chromaffin cells were isolated by trituration through a flame-polished Pasteur pipette in F12-K medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum and were plated onto Matrigel-coated 25-mm circular glass coverslips (Fisher). PC12 cells (a kind gift of Dr. Lisa Elferink, Wayne State University) were maintained in F12-K medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum and were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Only undifferentiated PC12 cells were used in experiments. Chromaffin cells as well as PC12 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Mouse histamine H1receptor fused to EYFP (H1-R) was expressed alone or co-expressed with TRPC4 (ratio 1:4). Only about 25% of cells were found expressing EYFP. Cells that were co-transfected with both constructs (H1-R/TRPC4) exhibited enhanced cell death, possibly because of increased Ca2+ influx and/or exocytosis. All experiments were performed 1–3 days after transfection. The standard extracellular solution contained 150 mmn-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-MeSO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). To study capacitance changes activated by trains of depolarizing pulses in undifferentiated PC12 cells, we increased extracellular [Ca2+] to 10 mm. “High K+” solution contained 30 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The fura-loading buffer contained 130 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). During fluorescence measurement the standard extracellular solution was supplemented with 100 μm LaCl3 to block Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and 1 mm MnCl2 to perform fura-2 quench experiments. The pipette solution contained 115 mmCsMeSO3, 20 mm triethylammonium chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). All chemicals were from Sigma except for thapsigargin and IP3, which were purchased from Calbiochem. A monochromator-equipped imaging system (TILL-Photonics, Martinsreid, Germany) was used to monitor fluorescence changes in fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) loaded cells. Cells were loaded with fura-2/AM (2–5 μm) for 30 min in a fura-loading buffer at room temperature. After loading, cells were washed 3 times with loading buffer without fura-2/AM and then incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature. Fura-2 was excited at 340 and 380 nm for determinations of [Ca2+]i and at the isosbestic wavelength of 360 nm for determining Mn2+ quench. Depending on loading, exposure times were 10–100-ms intervals, indicated in the text. Emitted light was collected with a 510-nm long pass filter. An H Plan Fluotar 40× oil immersion objective was used. Data were analyzed using TILLvisION software (version 3.02). Background fluorescence was subtracted. The intracellular concentration of Ca2+ was determined as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To study the cellular localization of mTRPC4 fusion proteins, a Nikon PCM2000 confocal microscope with a Plan 63× oil-immersion objective was used. EYFP was excited at 488 nm, and emitted light was collected with a 515-nm long pass filter. The pin-hole diameter was set to ∼1 Airy disc. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments as well as capacitance measurements were performed using a List EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier. To monitor current through mTRPC4 channels, cells were voltage-clamped at a potential of −60 mV. Current amplitudes were obtained from voltage ramps. The ramps (1 mV/ms) from −100 to 100 mV were applied at 5-s intervals. The acquisition rate was set to 1 kHz, and currents were filtered at 3 kHz. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. A computer-based phase-tracking capacitance detection technique in the whole-cell patch clamp mode was used to study exocytosis in the cells (for details see Ref. 17Seward E.P. Chernevskaya N.I. Nowycky M.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3390-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During capacitance measurements, a 15-mV root mean square, 1.2-kHz sine wave was added to the holding potential of −90 mV. Membrane capacitance (Cm) and conductance (G) phase angles were calculated and reset at the beginning of each capacitance trace (about 11 s) by switching in a 500-kiloohm resistor in series with ground. Capacitance changes were calibrated by adding 100-fF capacitor in the capacitance compensation circuitry of the patch-clamp amplifier. All experiments were performed at room temperature. To study the role of TRPCs in mediating exocytosis we isolated the cDNAs of mouse brain β-TRPC4 isoform using a reverse transcription-PCR based approach and subcloned the PCR product into the multiple cloning site of the pEYFP-C1 vector upstream of the stop codon of EYFP. Expression of this construct resulted in formation of the EYFP-mTRPC4 fusion protein. We found that in confocal images of PC12 cells the fusion construct of β-TRPC4 was localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, 4 independent experiments). Because fusion of YFP to TRPC4 may affect the channel properties, we subcloned β-TRPC4 into pEYFP-N1. YFP is not expressed in the product of this construct because a stop codon follows the coding sequence for TRPC4. In all subsequent experiments, only the construct without fusion to YFP was used. In a non-excitable expression model, TRPC4 can be activated via phospholipase Cβ by Gq/11-protein-coupled receptors such as the histamine H1 receptors (HEK-293 cells; Ref. 18Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We tested whether mouse chromaffin cells expressed sufficient endogenous histamine H1 receptors to stimulate phospholipase Cβ. In fura-2-loaded, non-transfected mouse chromaffin cells, histamine (20 μm) evoked only small, infrequent intracellular Ca2+ transients. The same cells responded to high potassium-induced depolarization with a pronounced Ca2+transient due to Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated calcium channels (averages of data from five cells; Fig.2A). Similar results were observed in three independent experiments. After transient expression of mouse histamine H1 receptors, histamine (10 μm) consistently evoked a large Ca2+transient (Fig. 2B). Transient expression of H1-R did not impair the depolarization-activated Ca2+ transient (Fig. 2B, note different time scale). In this and subsequent experiments we used mouse H1receptors fused to EYFP to serve as a marker of transfected cells. The histamine-induced intracellular Ca2+ transient could be due to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores or extracellular Ca2+ influx or both. To determine the source of the Ca2+, we measured Mn2+ quench of fura-2 at the Ca2+ isosbestic point (360 nm), which is a reliable indicator of divalent cation influx (19Thomas A.P. Bird G.S.J. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In H1-R-expressing cells, the slow basal Mn2+ leak was increased only slightly but consistently by histamine application (Fig. 3A, upper panel, n = 5 independent experiments (coverslips)). In the same cells, histamine evoked a large increase in the fura-2 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio, indicating that the Ca2+ transient evoked by histamine was largely caused by release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig.3A, lower panel). Most chromaffin cells co-expressing TRPC4 with H1-R, in contrast, displayed robust Mn2+ quench after histamine application (Fig. 3B, upper panel,n = 7 coverslips). In these cells, rapid Ca2+ release from intracellular stores was followed by a second rise in [Ca2+]i that occurred with a delay of 5–60 s (Fig. 3, A and B, lower panel, compare insets), due to Ca2+ entry via TRPC4. To test whether TRPC4 is gated by a store-depletion mechanism, we used thapsigargin (1 μm), a sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump inhibitor, which depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores by preventing the re-uptake of passively leaked Ca2+. Application of thapsigargin resulted in slow depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, which in some cells was manifested by a slow rise in [Ca2+]i before clearance by extrusion or alternative uptake mechanisms (Fig. 3,C and D, lower panels). In H1-R-expressing cells, thapsigargin stimulated a detectable, but small Mn2+ influx (n = 10 coverslips, Fig. 3C). Histamine application after thapsigargin had little effect on Ca2+ transients, indicating that stores were depleted. Thapsigargin application also had only a small effect on Mn2+ influx in TRPC4/H1-R-expressing cells. Subsequent application of histamine, however, induced a marked Mn2+ influx (n = 4 coverslips, Fig. 3D). The fura-2 340/380 ratio showed a robust rise with a delay of 10–60 s, similar to that observed in the absence of thapsigargin (Fig. 3B), indicating a Ca2+ rise due to influx through TRPC4. The Mn2+ quench experiments indicate that β-TRPC4 can support divalent cation influx when expressed in mouse chromaffin cells. To examine the kinetics of the TRPC4 current, we performed whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings. TRPC4 currents were identified by applying voltage ramps from −100 mV to +100 mV every 5 s. The extracellular recording solution contained NMDG+ as the sole monovalent cation to avoid contamination by voltage-gated Na+ channels. Before histamine application, the ramp evoked an inward current representing the activity of VGCC (Fig.4A, inset,trace 1, the cell was clamped at −70 mV to reduce contribution of VGCC activation to the currents at a holding potential). Application of histamine (10 μm) activated a large outward current via the TRPC4 channel (202.2 ± 123.7 pA at +100 mV, n = 5, Fig. 4A). Under these conditions, TRPC4 currents exhibit a characteristic outward rectification due to Cs+ efflux at positive potentials (Fig. 4A, inset, trace 2). The dip of the current-voltage relation between 0 and 60 mV results from voltage-dependent, Mg2+-induced inhibition of TRPC4 (18Schaefer M. Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17517-17526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The TRPC4 current inactivated spontaneously despite the continued presence of histamine (τdecay = 37.9 ± 10.1 s, n = 5). The rapid decay of TRPC4 currents was not due to internalization of H1-R because the intensity of EYFP fluorescence at the plasma membrane did not change after stimulation with histamine (data not shown). VGCC currents were effectively inhibited after activation of the histamine H1-receptor (Fig. 4A, trace 3), in agreement with a previous report (20Currie K.P. Fox A.P. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Some TRPC channels may be activated by a direct interaction with IP3 receptors (9Kiselyov K. Muallem S. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 334-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To test whether IP3receptors are involved in the activation of TRPC4 in adrenal chromaffin cells expressing H1-R/TRPC4, we dialyzed the cells with IP3 (10 μm). In these experiments, the VGCC currents were markedly reduced or absent, probably due to Ca2+-dependent inactivation of VGCC after Ca2+ release from intracellular stores by IP3. IP3 did not stimulate TRPC4 outward current (Fig.4B, trace 1). Subsequent application of histamine induced a current nearly identical to that evoked with no IP3 in the pipette (164 ± 86.5 pA at +100 mV,n = 6, Fig. 4B, trace 2). Currents were induced with a short delay after histamine application and reached a maximum within 10–25 s. TRPC4 currents inactivated relatively quickly (τdecay = 32.8 ± 9.3 s,n = 6). No currents were recorded in control chromaffin cells expressing H1-R alone, with (n = 5) or without IP3 (n = 6, Fig. 4C) in the pipette. Chromaffin cells are a widely used model system for studying Ca2+-evoked exocytosis. Typically, a train of depolarizing pulses stimulated a robust rise in the cell capacitance, as illustrated in Fig. 5A (n= 11), and the capacitance response was a function of the integral of the Ca2+ current (Fig. 5B). We tested whether TRPC4 could supply sufficient Ca2+ to support exocytosis in these cells. Capacitance changes were measured in chromaffin cells expressing either H1-R alone or a mixture of H1-R and TRPC4. Because inward currents through TRPC4 interfered with capacitance measurements (21Gillis K.D. Single-channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 155-198Crossref Google Scholar), we substituted monovalent cations with NMDG+. TRPC4 currents were monitored at positive voltages by applying depolarizing pulses at regular intervals of ∼11 s. After application of histamine (10 μm), the cell surface capacitance increased markedly in the cells co-expressing H1-R and TRPC4 (481.2 ± 124.4 fF versus 43.3 ± 23.4 fF in control, H1-R-expressing cells, n = 6, Fig.6). The increase of cell capacitance paralleled the development of the TRPC4 currents (n = 6, Fig. 6A). A comparison of the amount of exocytosis triggered by depolarizing pulses or the activation of TRPC4 by histamine showed that both stimuli were almost equipotent in stimulating secretory responses in chromaffin cells: trains of 10 depolarizing pulses induced a capacitance increase of 369 ± 94.5 fF (n = 9, Fig. 6C), which is not significantly different from the value obtained on stimulation with histamine in chromaffin cells expressing TRPC4/H1-R. Assuming the capacitance contribution of individual catecholaminergic vesicles is about 1.3 fF in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells (22Moser T. Neher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6735-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we estimated that, in chromaffin cells expressing TRPC4, the secretory response may correspond to the fusion of as many as about 300 vesicles at physiological extracellular [Ca2+].Figure 6Histamine-induced capacitance changes in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells.

To test whether the histamine-evoked response is also observed in this neuroendocrine cell line, we expressed TRPC4 in PC12 cells. As in chromaffin cells, fura-2AM-loaded PC12 cells co-expressing TRPC4 and H1-R-EYFP displayed marked Mn2+ influx upon H1-receptor stimulation (n = 9, data not shown), which was not observed in control PC12 cells expressing only H1-R-EYFP (n = 7). Thapsigargin did not stimulate mTRPC4 activity in TRPC4/H1-R-EYFP co-expressing PC12 cells (n = 7, data not shown). Histamine (10 μm) stimulated TRPC4 currents in PC12 cells co-expressing TRPC4 and H1-R (Fig.7A). The TRPC4 specific current exhibited the same current-voltage relationship during voltage ramps from −100 to +100mV as in mouse chromaffin cells (see theinset in Fig. 7A; compare with Fig. 4). The outward current measured at +100 mV was activated with a delay of 10–30 s after histamine application and averaged 376.6 ± 160.5 pA (n = 4). As in chromaffin cells, TRPC4 currents decayed relatively quickly (τ = 23.9 ± 3.9 s,n = 4) in maintained histamine. PC12 cells possess fewer secretory vesicles compared with primary chromaffin cells (15Tischler A.S. Powers J.F. Shahsavari M. Ziar J. Tsokas P. Downing J. McClain R.M. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1997; 35: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Capacitance changes evoked by depolarization-stimulated exocytosis were smaller in these cells, probably as a result of both fewer vesicles and smaller voltage-gated Ca2+ currents (Fig. 7B; Ref. 23Elhamdani A. Brown M.E. Artaljeo C.M. Palfrey H.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2495-2503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ entry was less effective in triggering exocytosis because more Ca2+ ions were required to stimulate a capacitance response in PC12 cells comparable with that in a chromaffin cell (compare Fig. 5B and 7B; note the different scale). Histamine-stimulated capacitance responses were significantly larger in PC12 cells expressing TRPC4 and H1-R than in control H1-R-expressing cells (130 ± 18.1versus 35.1 ± 7.8, n = 9 and 13, respectively; Fig. 7, C–E). In summary, even in cells that have less robust secretory responses, TRPC4 can provide sufficient Ca2+ to support exocytosis. Here we demonstrate that the receptor-operated cation channel, TRPC4, can provide sufficient Ca2+ influx to support agonist-evoked secretion in both mouse primary chromaffin cells and rat-derived PC12 cells, two widely used neuronally related models for studying Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis. We used chromaffin cells and PC12 cells as a functional expression system in which both the G-protein coupled receptor, H1, and TRPC4 are transiently expressed. Our results demonstrate that all tested aspects of the G-protein-coupled receptor-signaling pathway and the secretory pathway are intact and functional in our neuroendocrine expression system. Both the H1-YFP receptor construct and β-TRPC4-YFP were appropriately targeted to the plasma membrane. Sustained histamine application inhibited VGCC for the duration of the recording in chromaffin cells expressing H1-R or H1-R/β-TRPC4. Similar effects were previously observed by Currie and Fox (20Currie K.P. Fox A.P. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in non-transfected chromaffin cells. Histamine activation of TRPC4, on the other hand, was transient. A second application of histamine did not re-activate any TRPC4-like currents in the same cell. Mammalian TRPCs were cloned by homology to the Drosophila trp gene, with the goal of identifying store-operated channels, such as ICRAC, that are critical for the function of certain cells of the blood lineage (24Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 25Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol.

Currently, despite numerous reports postulating store-dependent mechanisms for TRPC stimulation, there is little experimental evidence for this hypothesis (5Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The exceptions are reports on TRPC1 (26Singh B.B. Zheng C. Liu X. Lockwich T. Liao D. Zhu M.X. Birnbaumer L.

This process involves a selection among several multipotential progenitors so that ultimately only one survives to supply descendants to the fully formed crypt. In this report, we examine the hypothesis that the level of β-catenin (β-cat)-mediated signaling is an important factor regulating this stem cell selection. In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin can partner with Lef-1/Tcf high mobility group (HMG) box transcription factors to control gene expression. Both Lef-1 and Tcf-4 mRNAs are produced in the fetal mouse small intestine. Tcf-4 expression is sustained, whereas Lef-1 levels fall as crypt formation is completed during the first two postnatal weeks. A Tcf-4 gene knockout is known to block intestinal epithelial proliferation in late fetal life. Therefore, to test the hypothesis, we enhanced β-catenin signaling in a chimeric mouse model in which the stem cell selection could be monitored. A fusion protein containing the HMG box domain of Lef-1 linked to the trans-activation domain of β-catenin (Lef-1/β-cat) was constructed to promote direct stimulation of signaling without being retained in the cytoplasm through interactions with E-cadherin and Apc/Axin. Lef-1/β-cat was expressed in 129/Sv embryonic stem cell-derived small intestinal epithelial progenitors present in developing B6-ROSA26←129/Sv chimeras. Lef-1/β-cat stimulated expression of a known β-catenin target (E-cadherin), suppressed expression of Apc and Axin, and induced apoptosis in 129/Sv but not in neighboring B6-ROSA26 epithelial cells. This apoptotic response was not associated with any detectable changes in cell division within the Lef-1/β-cat-expressing epithelium. By the time crypt development was completed, all 129/Sv epithelial cells were lost. These results indicate that developmental changes in β-catenin-mediated signaling can play an important role in establishing a stem cell hierarchy during crypt morphogenesis.

Recent reports have emphasized the role of β-catenin, Tcf-3, and Lef-1 in regulating the ability of multipotent mouse skin stem cells to give rise to descendant lineages. A skin-specific knockout of β-catenin attenuates placode formation during embryogenesis and dramatically restricts specification of cell fates by the multipotent bulge stem cell after completion of the initial hair cycle. As the second anagen commences, β-catenin-deficient stem cells cannot give rise to any follicular epithelial cells and are restricted to producing epidermal keratinocytes (12Huelsken J. Vogel R. Erdmann B. Cotsarelis G. Birchmeier W. Cell. 2001; 105: 533-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Merrill et al. (13Merrill B.J. Gat U. DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1688-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) generated several pedigrees of transgenic mice that overexpress wild-type Lef-1, Tcf-3, and dominant negative derivatives. They showed that the balance of signaling through these HMG box transcription factors has profound effects on cell fate selection by descendants of the pilosebaceous unit’s multipotent bulge stem cells. The role of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway in regulating the activity and survival of the multipotent intestinal epithelial stem cell is less well understood. Studies of chimeric mice have disclosed that the stem cell hierarchy of the intestine is established coincident with formation of its crypts of Lieberkühn. These flask-shaped mucosal invaginations are the proliferative units of the adult intestine. Crypts develop from a flat intervillus epithelium located between finger-like villi. Villi first arise from the pseudostratified gut epithelium at E14 (14Karlsson L. Lindahl P. Heath J.K. Betsholtz C. Development. 2000; 127: 3457-3466PubMed Google Scholar). During this stage of development, multipotent stem cells in the intervillus epithelium are able to specify three of the four epithelial lineages that are ultimately represented in the mature intestine: absorptive enterocytes, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells (15Jensen J. Pedersen E.E. Galante P. Hald J. Heller R.S. Ishibashi M. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Serup P. Madsen O.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 16Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 537-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). The intervillus epithelium undergoes reshaping to yield fully formed crypts by the end of the second postnatal week (17Calvert R. Pothier P. Anat. Rec. 1990; 227: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In late fetal life, the intervillus epithelium of a chimeric mouse contains several active multipotent stem cells representing both genetic backgrounds used to generate the chimera (i.e. it is polyclonal). As the intervillus epithelium develops into crypts, a poorly understood process of stem cell “purification” occurs that converts a polyclonal nascent crypt to a monoclonal mature crypt where all epithelial cells share a common genotype (18Schmidt G.H. Winton D.J. Ponder B.A. Development. 1988; 103: 785-790PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been interpreted to mean that all active stem cells in each purified monoclonal crypt are descended from a single crypt progenitor cell that occupies the highest position in the established stem cell hierarchy. Korinek et al. (19Korinek V. Barker N. Moerer P. van Donselaar E. Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar) showed that mice homozygous for aTcf-4 null allele die shortly after birth with an absence of proliferative activity in the intervillus epithelium. Proliferative activity appears normal at E14.5 in Tcf4−/− animals but is lost by E16.5 when only differentiated epithelial lineages are evident. The loss of proliferative activity indicates that multipotent stem cells in the developing intestine require some level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling for their maintenance. Further understanding of the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in establishing the stem cell hierarchy of the crypt has been impeded by several factors. First, Tcf-4−/− mice die before the hierarchy is established. Second, conventional knockout mice are not suited for an assessment of the evolution of the hierarchy; chimeric mice currently provide the only direct way of monitoring the stem cell selection process. Third, information is lacking about the impact of augmented Wnt/β-catenin signaling on gut development. Prior genetic studies that provided an opportunity to examine the consequences of enhanced signaling have been limited by embryonic lethality (e.g. Apc−/− mice die prior to gastrulation (20Moser A.R. Shoemaker A.R. Connelly C.S. Clipson L. Gould K.A. Luongo C. Dove W.F. Siggers P.H. Gardner R.L. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)), have not described the effects on the intestine (as in a recently described Apc truncation mutant that produces viable mice (21Smits R. Kielman M.F. Breukel C. Zurcher C. Neufeld K. Jagmohan-Changur S. Hofland N. van Dijk J. White R. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Khan P.M. Fodde R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar)), or have not focused on the developing gut (e.g. mice expressing a mutant β-catenin with an N-terminal truncation that removes Gsk-3 phosphorylation sites and thereby increases protein stability (22Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 23Harada N. Tamai Y. Ishikawa T. Sauer B. Takaku K. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar)). In this report, we test the hypothesis that the level of β-catenin-mediated signaling is an important factor in stem cell selection during crypt morphogenesis. The experimental approach was based on the following. We had previously identified transcriptional regulatory elements from a fatty acid-binding protein gene (Fabpl) that function in the multipotent intestinal stem cell prior to, during, and after completion of crypt purification (24Wong M.H. Saam J.R. Stappenbeck T.S. Rexer C.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We knew that 129/Sv ES cells transfected with Fabpl/reporter constructs could be introduced into C57Bl/6-ROSA26 (B6-ROSA26) blastocysts (25Friedrich G. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar), and the effect(s) of transgene expression monitored in the resulting developing or adult chimeric mouse by comparing the phenotype of its 129/Sv intestinal epithelial cells with the phenotype of readily identifiable neighboring B6-ROSA26 epithelium (22Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Stappenbeck T.S. Gordon J.I. Development. 2000; 127: 2629-2642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we reasoned that a fusion protein containing an HMG box domain linked to the trans-activation domain of β-catenin would allow direct stimulation of signaling without being retained in the cytoplasm through interactions with Apc/Axin. As described below, expression of this fusion protein had a dramatic effect on the survival of multipotent 129/Sv intestinal stem cells during crypt formation/purification. p3021 encodes a protein consisting of an N-terminal 15-residue c-Myc epitope tag, amino acids 33–368 of human Lef-1, and the C-terminal 124 residues of human β-catenin (abbreviated Lef-1/β-cat; see Fig. 1A). 2 × 106IIAI.6 B cells were transfected with a CAT reporter (pTK(56)7; see Ref. 27van de Wetering M.

A 1540-bpNcoI-EcoRI fragment from p3021 containing Lef-1/β-cat coding sequences was subcloned at engineeredNcoI-MfeI sites in pLPNDon (28Hermiston M.L. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), yielding pLF:Lef-1/β-cat. This subcloning placed Lef-1/β-cat downstream of nucleotides −596 to +21 of rat Fabpl and upstream of nucleotides +3 to +2152 of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene and apgk-neomyocin-resistance selection cassette. Multiple stop codons separated the open reading frame encoding Lef-1/β-cat and the initiator Met of hGH, thereby ensuring that hGH would not be produced from transcripts derived fromFabpl-Lef-1/β-cat-hGH. The 6.24-kbFabpl-Lef-1/β-cat-hGH-pgk-neo insert in pLF:Lef-1/β-cat was excised with SacII, purified by gel electrophoresis, and electroporated into D3 129/Sv ES cells (22Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Stably transfected ES cells were identified using PCR. Twelve ES cell lines were established and then injected (separately) into B6-ROSA26 blastocysts (22Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) to produce B6-ROSA26←129/Sv(Lef-1/β-cat) chimeras. Non-transfected ES cells were used to generate control B6-ROSA26←129/Sv chimeras. The 129/Sv contribution in 6-week-old chimeras derived from all ES cell lines ranged from 20–60% based on coat color. Chimerism in E13.5–P7 mice was assessed by glucose phosphate isomerase assay of limb tissue (29Nagy A. Rossant J. Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 147-178Google Scholar). Chimeras generated from each of the 12 different cell lines were analyzed for transgene expression. Total cellular RNA was isolated (RNeasy kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) from the entire small intestine of E13.5–E18.5 and postnatal day 1 (P1) B6-ROSA26←129/Sv(Lef-1/β-cat) chimeras and from the middle third of the small intestines of P42 adult mice. RT-PCR was used to identify the Fabpl-Lef-1/β-cat-hGH mRNA transcript. Two μg of DNase-treated total cellular RNA was used in each oligo(dT)-primed cDNA synthesis reaction (final volume of 200 μl; described in Ref. 24Wong M.H. Saam J.R. Stappenbeck T.S. Rexer C.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two-μl aliquots from the cDNA synthesis reaction mixture were added to RT-PCR assays, each containing one of two primer pairs. One primer pair produced a 150-bp amplicon from hGH sequences (forward primer, 5′-AGGTGGCCTTTGACACCTACCAGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCTGTTGTGTTTCCTCCCTGTTGG-3′; note that the amplicon spanned an intron/exon junction). The other primer pair generated a 722-bp amplicon from the junction between Lef-1/β-catenin and hGH (β-cat forward primer, 5′-GGACTTGATATTGGTGCCCAG-3′; hGH reverse primer, 5′-TCTGTTGTGTTTCCTCCCTGTTGG-3′). The annealing temperature for PCR was 67 °C (total of 30 cycles). Primers designed to produce a 300-bp amplicon from β-actin mRNA were used to confirm the integrity of intestinal RNAs (forward primer, 5′-CACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCATCAGGTAGTCAGTGAGGTCGC-3′; annealing at 65 °C). Control reactions contained cDNA prepared from intestinal RNAs that had been isolated from age-matched normal (B6-ROSA26←129/Sv) chimeras. To detect Lef-1/β-cat, proteins were extracted from the small intestines of B6-ROSA26←129/Sv(Lef-1/β-cat) and control B6-ROSA26←129/Sv chimeras using previously published procedures (22Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Western blots of extracted small intestinal proteins were probed with rabbit antibodies raised against a C-terminal peptide from β-catenin (22Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or the N-terminal c-Myc tag (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, 1:100) of Lef-1/β-cat. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using the Western Light kit from Tropix (Foster City, CA). Small intestines were removed from E13.5–E18.5, P1, P28, and P42 mice. For E13.5–P1 animals, the intestines were fixed immediately in periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) for 1 h at 24 °C, washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in X-gal solution (22Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Intestines dissected from chimeric mice were embedded in 2% agar and subdivided into 2-mm segments with a razor blade. Each segment was placed cut side down on a flat surface (carefully preserving their cephalocaudal orientation) and lined up into parallel rows of six segments each. The arrayed clusters were first embedded in 2% agar, then embedded in paraffin. Serial 5-μm sections of the tissue block were cut and counterstained with nuclear fast red. Surveys of these serial sections allowed the distribution of 129/Sv and B6-ROSA26 epithelial cells to be defined throughout the small intestine. For P28 and P42 mice, the small intestine was removed en bloc immediately after sacrifice and flushed with ice-cold PBS followed by PLP. The intestine was opened with a longitudinal incision along its mesenteric side, pinned onto dissecting wax, and fixed in PLP for 1 h at 24 °C. Whole mounts were washed three times with PBS (5 min each) followed by a 45-min incubation in 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20% EtOH, 150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to remove surface mucus. Following three more PBS washes, the whole mount preparations were placed in X-gal solution for 12 h at 4 °C and photographed. Serial sections were prepared from the middle third of X-gal-stained small intestines obtained from E17.5, E18.5, and P1 B6-ROSA26←129/Sv(Lef-1/β-cat) mice and age-matched normal chimeric controls (n = 2–3 animals/group/time point). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the number of apoptotic and M-phase cells in B6-ROSA26 and 129/Sv intervillus epithelium was scored (n = 1767–2865 intervillus regions surveyed/time point). Mean values ±S.E. per genotype were computed. Observed differences between 129/Sv and B6 epithelium were analyzed using Student’s t test. E18.5 small intestines were fixed in PLP for 1 h at 24 °C, washed three times with PBS, cryo-protected in 15% sucrose/PBS (12–16 h at 4 °C), frozen in OCT (VWR, Batavia, IL), and 5–8 μm sections were cut. The protocol used for multilabel immunohistochemical studies has been described in an earlier publication (22Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Sections were stained with affinity-purified rabbit anti-Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase (Ref. 22Wong M.H. Rubinfeld B. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar; diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mmCaCl2 in PBS)) and with rabbit anti-Apc (raised against residues 1034–2130 of the human protein (30Nathke I.S.

Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with indocarbocyanine- or fluorescein isothiocyante-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; West Grove, PA; 1:500). SYBR Green-based qRT-PCR (32Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (4981) Google Scholar) was used to quantitate levels of gene expression in age-matched B6-ROSA26←129/Sv(Lef-1/β-cat) and normal B6-ROSA26←129/Sv chimeras. Primer pairs were designed to the 3′ end of the targeted transcript to produce 100–200-bp amplicons and, whenever possible, spanned an intron-exon boundary. A melting curve (Tm) was used to identify a temperature at which only the amplicon, and not primer dimer, accounted for the SYBR Green-bound fluorescence (24Wong M.H. Saam J.R. Stappenbeck T.S.

Science. 2001; 291: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.25 UDP-N-glycosidase (Invitrogen), 900 nmforward and reverse primers, and a 2-μl aliquot from the 200-μl cDNA synthesis reaction mixture. The primers and melting temperatures used for qRT-PCR were as follows: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 5′-TGGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTGCC, 5′-AAGATGGTGATGGGCTTCCCG, 80 °C); Lef-1 (5′-AGACACCCTCCAGCTCCTGA, 5′-CCTGAATCCACCCGTGATG, 78.6 °C); Tcf-4 (5′-GGCGTTGGACAGATCACC, 5′-GGTGAAGTGTTCATTGCTGTACTG, 82.4 °C); β-catenin (5′-AGCCGAGATGGCCCAGAAT, 5′-AAGGGCAAGGTTCGAATCAA, 79.2 °C); E-cadherin (5′-GTCAACACCTACAACGCTGCC, 5′-GTTGTGCTCAAGCCTTCGC, 80.2 °C); Apc (5′-TGACAAGACGGCAGCTGGAG, 5′-TCTTCGCTGTGCACGCTTC, 79.2 °C); Axin (5′-CCCCCATACAGGATCCGTAA, 5′-GGTACCCGCCCATTGACTT, 76.8 °C); and cyclooxygenase-2 (5′-TGAGTACCGCAAACGCTTCTC, 5′-TGGACGAGGTTTTTCCACCAG, 80 °C). All assays were performed in triplicate, on three separate occasions, using an Applied Biosystems Model 7700 Sequence Detector. Members of the Lef-1/Tcf HMG box family of transcription factors have overlapping patterns of expression during development (34Galceran J. Farinas I. Depew M.J. Clevers H. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).In situ hybridization studies have shown that Tcf-4 and Tcf-3 are expressed during and following development of the mouse small intestine and colon (35Korinek V. Barker N. Willert K. Molenaar M. Roose J. Wagenaar G. Markman M. Lamers W. Destree O. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1248-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Lef-1 shares a high degree of sequence homology with Tcf-4/Tcf-3 and recognizes a similar DNA binding site ((A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)GG); see Ref. 36Clevers H. van de Wetering M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 485-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although Lef-1 is not expressed in the adult intestinal epithelium, it is expressed in colorectal tumors (37Li K. Hovanes T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57PubMed Google Scholar, 38Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Since gene expression during tumorigenesis can recapitulate patterns observed during normal organogenesis, we examined whether Lef-1 mRNA is present in the developing mouse intestine. Fig. 1 presents the results of a real-time quantitative RT-PCR study of the relative levels of Lef-1, Tcf-4, and β-catenin mRNAs in the small intestines of E13.5–P14 B6 mice. The time points encompass the period prior to the initiation of villus formation (E13.5), the period when nascent villi and the proliferating intervillus epithelium appear (E14.5–E18.5), and the period when crypts form from the intervillus epithelium with concomitant establishment of a final stem cell hierarchy (P1–P14). The figure shows that Tcf-4 mRNA levels are relatively constant during these periods. In contrast, Lef-1 expression is significantly higher than Tcf-4 expression from E13.5–17.5 and then drops precipitously from E17.5 to P1. β-Catenin mRNA levels vary <3-fold between E13.5 and P14 and are 2000–5000-fold higher than the levels of either Lef-1 or Tcf-4 mRNA. Because Lef-1 expression changes during the critical period when stem cell selection is occurring in the developing crypt, we proceeded to design a fusion protein that would allow us to enhance Lef-1/β-catenin trans-activation of target genes as crypts form. Fig.2A outlines the salient features of the fusion protein. Residues 33–368 of human Lef-1, encompassing a functional HMG box and nuclear localization signal, were linked to the 13th armadillo repeat and C-terminal trans-activation domain of human β-catenin. Physical linking of these two domains obviated the need for the β-catenin binding domain of Lef-1. Moreover, exclusion of armadillo repeats 1–12 minimized potential interactions with cytoplasmic E-cadherin, Apc/Axin, and Gsk-3 that might compromise the ability of the Lef-1/β-cat fusion protein to activate gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells. The ability of Lef-1/β-cat to activate transcription of a target reporter gene was first tested in a cultured mouse B cell line (IIAI.6) that lacks endogenous Lef-1 mRNA and contains very low levels of β-catenin (39van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Dooijes D. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). IIAI.6 cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid containing seven tandem repeats of the Lef-1 DNA consensus binding site (CTTTGTT) linked to the thymidine kinase gene promoter and a bacterialchloramphenicol transferase (CAT) gene (pTK(56)7; see Ref. 40Clevers H. Lonberg N. Dunlap S. Lacy E. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with plasmids encoding wild-type Lef-1 and β-catenin produced a 10-fold increase in CAT activity as compared with cells containing the Lef-1 plasmid plus the reporter plasmid (Fig. 2B). Expression of Lef-1/β-cat resulted in even more robust induction of CAT activity (15-fold as compared with Lef-1 alone; Fig. 2"
https://openalex.org/W2003821601,"Presynaptic I(h) channels become activated during a tetanus through membrane hyperpolarization resulting from Na(+) accumulation and electrogenic Na(+)/K(+) exchange. I(h) activation is obligatory for inducing long-term facilitation (LTF), a long-lasting synaptic strengthening. cAMP-induced synaptic enhancement also requires I(h) activation, and both processes are sensitive to actin depolymerization. Other mechanisms are responsible for expression of the responses. Once initiated, continued response to cAMP is I(h) and actin independent. Moreover, LTF-induced activation of I(h) renders subsequent cAMP enhancement insensitive to both I(h) blockers and actin depolymerization. This actin-stabilized ""temporal synaptic tagging"" set by I(h) activation is prolonged when I(h) is activated concurrent with an elevation in presynaptic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), permitting the further strengthening of synapses given appropriate additional stimuli."

These proteins define a new family of actin-binding proteins. They bind G-actin in a 1:1 complex with thermodynamic and kinetic parameters similar to β-thymosins.

On the other hand, they behave as functional homologs of profilin because their complex with MgATP-G-actin, unlike β-thymosin-actin, participates in filament barbed end growth, like profilin-actin complex. Therefore these proteins play an active role in actin-based motility processes. In addition, proteins of the actobindin family interact with the pointed end of actin filaments and inhibit pointed end growth, maybe via the interaction of the β-thymosin repeats with two terminal subunits.

Because β-thymosins are simple passive sequesterers in rapid equilibrium with ATP-G-actin, the balance between polymerized (F-actin) and nonassembled actin in living cells is in fact controlled by regulatory proteins that affect the steady-state concentration of free ATP-G-actin by modulating the dynamic parameters of filament assembly-disassembly at the barbed and pointed ends. The amount of sequestered actin is increased by proteins that cause an increase in steady-state ATP-G-actin and vice versa. For instance, profilin makes a complex with G-actin that energetically contributes to monomer-polymer exchanges at the barbed ends as well as ATP-G-actin itself. As a result, profilin causes a decrease in the partial critical concentration of ATP-G-actin. Therefore, upon addition of profilin to a solution of F-actin in the presence of Tβ4, the amount of Tβ4-actin complex decreases, i.e. F-actin increases (15.Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Conversely, addition of actin depolymerizing factor (ADF), which increases the concentration of ATP-G-actin at steady state, leads to increased sequestration of G-actin by Tβ4, i.e. causes F-actin disassembly (16.Didry D. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25602-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The structure of the Tβ4-actin complex is not known at atomic resolution; however, NMR and biochemical studies consistently show that Tβ4 binds actin in an extended configuration, the N-terminal segment interacting with the barbed end of the actin monomer, while the C-terminal region binds subdomain 2 at the pointed end of the actin monomer (13.Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14.De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This view satisfactorily accounts for the fact that Tβ4 inhibits G-actin association with both the barbed and the pointed ends of actin filaments. β-Thymosins have been found in all vertebrates and in echinoderms and mollusks (17.Stoeva S. Horger S. Voelter W. J. Pept. Sci. 1997; 3: 282-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Safer D. Chowrashi P.K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 38: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, a cDNA clone encoding for a 41-amino acid β-thymosin has been identified in the calcareus spongeScyon raphanus (19.Manuel M. Kruse M. Müller W.E.G. Le Parco Y. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), indicating the ancient character of β-thymosin among metazoa. On the other hand, β-thymosins are absent in yeast, amoeba, Drosophila, and plants. InAcanthamoeba castellanii, a protein called actobindin consists of two β-thymosin repeats and has been identified as a G-actin-binding protein that may also sequester actin dimers (20.Lambooy P.K.

A BLAST search on the complete genomic sequences of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans identified a triplicate β-thymosin sequence (19.Manuel M. Kruse M. Müller W.E.G. Le Parco Y. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Independently, this 3-β-thymosin repeat protein, called ciboulot (Cib), has been identified in Drosophila as being involved in the control of brain development during metamorphosis and characterized as a G-actin-binding protein (25.Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.-F. Préat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Amazingly, although ciboulot shares sequence homology with Tβ4, the Cib-actin complex participates in filament barbed end assembly like profilin-actin (25.Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.-F. Préat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The profilin-like property of Cib accounts for its function in actin-based motility and axonal growth. These observations raise an issue of structural and functional relevance about the evolution of the actin binding domain of β-thymosins. Are some biochemical properties of β-thymosins found unaltered in actobindin and Cib? What are the structural features at the origin of the functional difference between Tβ4 and Cib? Is actobindin, the amoeba β-thymosin two-repeat protein, functionally similar to Tβ4 or to Cib? Here we compare Cib and actobindin regarding their binding to G-actin, their effects on nucleotide exchange on G-actin, and their effects on actin assembly at the two ends of filaments, with either MgATP-actin or CaATP-actin. We show that actobindin is functionally similar to Cib or profilin, and differs from β-thymosins, regarding the control of filament dynamics. On the other hand, actobindin and Cib both slow down nucleotide exchange on G-actin like Tβ4. We conclude that proteins that consist of β-thymosin repeats like actobindin inAcanthamoeba or ciboulot in Drosophila and probably the C. elegans homolog must play a positive role in motile properties of living organisms. The pure G-actin sequestering function of regular β-thymosins may result from divergent evolution. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle, isolated as CaATP-G-actin by Sephadex G 200 chromatography in G buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% NaN3). Actin was pyrenyl labeled on cysteine 374 (26.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and NBD 1The abbreviations used are: NBD12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))AEDANS1,5-I-AEDANS, 5-[2-(iodoacetamido)ethylamino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acidIANBDN-((2-iodoacetoxy)ethyl)N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole -labeled on lysine 373 (27.Detmers P. Weber A. Elzinga M. Stephens R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gelsolin was a kind gift from Dr. Yukio Doi (University of Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan) and actobindin was purified fromAcanthamoeba castellanii (20.Lambooy P.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17150-17155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thymosin β4 and profilin were prepared as described previously (15.Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The fusion protein GST-Cib cloned in the expression vector p-GEX2T* (Amersham Bioscience) was induced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified (15.Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The Cib protein was then cleaved off the GST moiety with thrombin, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of Cib was derived from amino acid analysis, from which a standardized bicinchoninic acid assay was developed. 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)) 1,5-I-AEDANS, 5-[2-(iodoacetamido)ethylamino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid N-((2-iodoacetoxy)ethyl)N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole Steady-state measurements of F-actin were derived from fluorescence measurements of pyrenyl-labeled actin. Actin (10% pyrenyl-labeled) was polymerized under physiological ionic conditions (0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2) in the absence or presence of gelsolin (at 1:300 molar ratio to actin) and in the presence or absence of Cib or actobindin at the indicated concentrations. The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant K C for the Cib-actin (or actobindin-actin) complex [CA] was derived from measurements of the amount of assembled actin at steady state (after 18-h incubation) (see the following equations), [AU]=[A]+[CA][A]=CC[C0]=[CA]+[C]KC=[C]·[A]/[CA]=([C0]−[AU]+CC)·CC/([AU]−CC)Equation 1 where [AU] and [A] are the concentrations of unassembled actin and free G-actin at steady state and [C 0] is the total concentration of actobindin or Cib. Initial rates of filament growth from the barbed and the pointed ends were measured spectrofluorometrically using either spectrin-actin seeds (28.Casella J.F. Maack D.J. Lin S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10915-10921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or gelsolin-actin seeds, respectively. Gelsolin-actin seeds were prepared by mixing gelsolin and a 2.5 molar equivalent CaATP-G-actin in G buffer. The adequate amount of seeds was added at time 0 together with salt to a solution of MgATP- or CaATP-G-actin (10% pyrenyl-labeled) and Cib or actobindin. The initial rate of pyrene fluorescence increase was converted into molar amount of assembled F-actin using a critical concentration plot derived from the same actin solution. Data were analyzed and simulated as described in Yarmolaet al. (29.Yarmola E.G. Parikh S. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45555-45563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) Depolymerization rates at the pointed ends were measured by 20-fold dilution of a solution of 2.5 μm gelsolin-capped filaments (50% pyrenyl-labeled) in F buffer containing known amounts of Cib or actobindin. Kinetics of nucleotide exchange on monomeric actin were monitored using the change in fluorescence of εATP upon binding to G-actin (30.Perelroizen I. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1501-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ATP-G-actin 1:1 complex was obtained by Dowex-1 treatment and diluted to 1 μm in 5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, in the presence of Cib or actobindin. The increase in fluorescence (λexc = 350 nm, λem = 410 nm) upon addition of 5 μm εATP was monitored using a Safas flx spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence time courses were satisfactorily analyzed in terms of a monoexponential process. The observed first order rate constant displayed hyperbolic saturation behavior with the concentration of Cib or actobindin, consistent with a model in which Cib or actobindin shuttle from one molecule of G-actin to the other at a faster rate than nucleotide dissociates from G-actin or from Cib-actin or actobindin-actin complexes. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the Cib-actin or actobindin-actin complex was derived from the dependence of the apparent exchange rate constant on the concentration of Cib or actobindin, as follows, [A]+[CA]=[A0][C]+[CA]=[C0]kobs=(k1[A]+k2[CA])/[A0]=([A]/[A0]){k1Equation 2 +k2([C0]−[A0]+[A])/KC}with[A]=(1/2){[A0]−[C0]−KC±(([A0]−[C0]−KC) 2+4KC[A0]) 1/2}Equation 3 [CA]=(1/2){[A0]+[C0]+KC±(([A0]+[C0]Equation 4 +KC) 2−4[A0]·[C0]) 1/2}where [A], [A 0], [C], [C 0] are the free and total concentrations of G-actin and Cib or actobindin and [CA] is the concentration of the complex;k 1 and k 2 are the rate constants for nucleotide dissociation from G-actin and from theCA complex, respectively; K C is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the CA complex. The values of k 1 and k 2 were determined experimentally in the absence and in the presence of saturating amounts of Cib. The value of K C was derived from the adjustment of the calculated curvesk obs ([C 0]) to the data. The change in fluorescence of NBD-labeled G-actin was used as a probe for the formation of the complexes of G-actin with Tβ4, actobindin, or Cib. Static fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Spex Fluorolog 2 spectrofluorimeter in G buffer for CaATP-G-actin and in G buffer supplemented with 10 μmMgCl2 and 0.2 mm EGTA for MgATP-G-actin. Samples contained 1.5 μm NBD-G-actin and different amounts of Cib. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 475 nm and 525 nm, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the complex was derived from the dependence of the fluorescence change on the total concentration of Tβ4, actobindin, or Cib, analyzed using Equation 4. The kinetics of interaction of NBD-G-actin with Cib were monitored by fluorescence (λexc = 470 nm, slit 0.25 mm) using a stopped-flow apparatus (DX-18 MV, Applied Photophysics), with a 270-μs noise filter. A solution of K2Cr2O7 was placed on the emission beam to eliminate light scattered at the excitation wavelength. Four to six superimposable time courses were averaged for each concentration of Cib. To evaluate the thermodynamic and rate parameters of the interaction of Cib and of actobindin with G-actin, we sought suitable spectroscopic probes. While binding of Tβ4 to G-actin is accompanied by a 20% increase (11.Jean C. Rieger K. Blanchoin L. Carlier M.-F. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and binding of profilin by a 25% decrease (30.Perelroizen I. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1501-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in tryptophane fluorescence of actin, no change was observed with Cib. Tβ4 also causes a large change in the fluorescence of AEDANS-labeled actin (14.De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Binding of Cib to AEDANS-G-actin caused a 7-nm blue shift in the excitation and emission spectra and a 5% increase in fluorescence (λexc = 340 nm, λem = 480 nm), suggesting a less polar environment of the AEDANS fluorophore in the Cib-actin complex than in G-actin (an effect conspicuously opposite to the one observed (14.De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with Tβ4), but the signal was too small to be useful in kinetic experiments. Like Tβ4, neither actobindin nor Cib affected the fluorescence of pyrenyl-labeled G-actin, in agreement with previous reports (22.Bubb M.R. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3820-3826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.-F. Préat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the fluorescence of actin in which lysine 373 was NBD-labeled was increased by 25% upon binding of Cib, actobindin, or Tβ4 (Fig. 1). A similar change has been reported when actobindin bound to actin in which cysteine 374 was labeled by IANBD (22.Bubb M.R. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3820-3826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equilibrium dissociation constantsK C of the 1:1 complexes of G-actin with Tβ4, Cib, and actobindin were derived from the analysis of the dependence of the fluorescence change on protein concentration according to Equation 4 (Fig. 1). Similar values of K C were obtained for all proteins, typically 2–4 μm for CaATP-G-actin and 0.7–2 μm for MgATP-G-actin (Table I).Table ICompared equilibrium parameters for binding of Tβ4, actobindin, and ciboulot to G-actin using different methodsMethodG-actin speciesK CTβ4ActobindinCibμmChange in NBD-actin fluorescenceCaATP-G-actin2.52.53.7LatA-CaATP-G-actin4.44.24.6MgATP-G-actin0.65ND1.2LatA-MgATP-G-actin1.2ND2.7Nucleotide exchangeCaATP-G-actin12.01.7Depolymerization at barbed endsCaATP-G-actin988Depolymerization at pointed endsCaATP-G-actin988MgATP-G-actin2.052.5Values of K C derived from the change in NBD-actin fluorescence and from the decrease in the rate of nucleotide exchange were obtained in low ionic strength G buffer.

Open table in a new tab Values of K C derived from the change in NBD-actin fluorescence and from the decrease in the rate of nucleotide exchange were obtained in low ionic strength G buffer.

Latrunculin A is a drug that interacts with G-actin with high affinity (5 μm−1) and prevents polymerization (31.Coue M. Brenner SL. Spector I. Korn ED. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Latrunculin A has been shown to noncompetitively inhibit Tβ4 binding to G-actin, decreasing the affinity of actin for Tβ4 by approximately an order of magnitude in the ternary complex (32.Yarmola EG. Somasundaram T. Boring TA. Spector I. Bubb MR. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The present data show that in the presence of saturating (20 μm) concentrations of latrunculin A, the change in fluorescence of NBD-actin (1.5 μm) upon binding Cib or actobindin or Tβ4 was lower. The value of K C for binding Tβ4 or Cib or actobindin to NBD-G-actin was increased about 2-fold by latrunculin A (Table I). The data are consistent with the formation of a ternary complex between G-actin, latrunculin A, and either Cib or actobindin or Tβ4. No binding of Cib or actobindin to ADP-actin was detected using the change in NBD-fluorescence (data not shown). It is known that the fluorescence of NBD-actin, in contrast to pyrenyl-actin, is not affected by the bound nucleotide (33.Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6565-6572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, like Tβ4 and profilin, Cib has a high specificity for binding ATP-G-actin. The change in NBD fluorescence was used to monitor the kinetics of Cib-actin complex formation. Cib bound to NBD-G-actin within a single exponential process. The apparent first order rate constantk obs increased practically linearly with Cib concentration in the range 0–40 μm Cib (Fig. 2). The apparent association rate constant (k + = 1.6 μm−1·s−1) was derived from the slope, and the apparent dissociation rate constant (k−= 14 s−1) was derived from the lower limit ofk obs at low Cib concentration. The value of the ratio k −/k + (3 μm) was in good agreement with the equilibrium dissociation constant derived from the dependence of the fluorescence change on Cib concentration. The value of 14 s−1 fork − was then confirmed by a competition experiment in which Cib was displaced from the Cib-NBD-actin complex by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled actin. To verify that the affinity of Cib or actobindin is not affected by NBD labeling, the following experiment was carried out. Increasing amounts of actobindin or Cib were added to two parallel samples of actin, containing either 10 or 50% NBD-actin, polymerized at 1.6 μm in the presence of 4 nm gelsolin. The linear decrease in the amount of F-actin was consistent with the same affinity of Cib or actobindin for G-actin independently of the proportion of labeled actin (supplementary data, Fig. 1). Thymosin β4 is known to slow down nucleotide dissociation from G-actin, while profilin accelerates it. It has often been proposed that the effect of profilin on nucleotide exchange supports its effect on motility in vivo. Both actobindin and Cib, which enhance actin-based motility like profilin in an in vitro reconstituted motility assay (25.Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.-F. Préat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), slow down nucleotide dissociation from G-actin, like Tβ4 (Fig. 3). The exchange rate was decreased 12- and 9-fold by actobindin and by Cib, respectively, while it was decreased 20-fold by Tβ4 under the same conditions. Analysis of the data using Equation 2 yielded values of 2.0 μm and 1.7 μm for the equilibrium disssociation constants for binding of actobindin and Cib, respectively, to CaATP-G-actin in G buffer. This result indicates that Cib and actobindin share some of the binding features of Tβ4. Their association with G-actin is linked to the slower dissociation of ATP. However, the effects of these two proteins on the dynamics of actin filaments are independent of their effects on nucleotide exchange on G-actin. The effect of actobindin on the steady-state amount of 10% pyrenyl-labeled F-actin was measured under physiological conditions (0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2) in the absence and in the presence of gelsolin (Fig. 4). When the barbed ends of filaments were capped, actobindin caused depolymerization of F-actin. The amount of depolymerized actin increased linearly with the concentration of actobindin, consistent with sequestration of MgATP-G-actin by actobindin in a 1:1 complex, with an equilibrium dissociation constant K C of 6 μm. This value is in good agreement with previous measurements (22.Bubb M.R. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3820-3826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Bubb M.R. Knutson J.R. Porter D.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25592-25597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Bubb M.R. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as well as with the value derived from nucleotide exchange kinetics (Fig. 3). A similar value (K C = 2.5 μm) had been found for the Cib-actin complex using the same assay (25.Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.-F. Préat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, actobindin did not depolymerize F-actin when barbed ends were free. The very slow decrease in F-actin versus actobindin concentration is consistent with the lowering of the steady-state concentration of G-actin upon addition of actobindin. As an example, at 20 μm actobindin, the measured concentration of unassembled actin was 0.15 μm (Fig. 4). Using Equation 1with [C 0] = 20 μm, [A U] = 0.15 μm, andK C = 5 μm, the value ofC C (free G-actin) is 0.03 μm, much lower than the value of 0.1 μm measured in the absence of actobindin. This result implies that actin-actobindin complex, like profilin-actin complex, participates in barbed end assembly as well as actin itself, hence it lowers the energetic contribution of G-actin to monomer-polymer exchanges at steady state. In conclusion, actobindin-actin complex, like Cib-actin and profilin-actin, can stabilize the barbed ends, via monomer-polymer exchange reactions, as efficiently as G-actin. The validity of the above conclusions relies on the assumption that the affinity of actobindin for actin is not affected by pyrenyl labeling. This was first established by Lambooy and Korn (20.Lambooy P.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17150-17155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have confirmed this conclusion both for Cib and actobindin by checking that the value of K C derived from assays shown in Fig. 4 was independent of the proportion of pyrenyl-actin. In agreement with the above data, actobindin failed to completely inhibit barbed end growth in a seeded polymerization assay (Fig. 4,inset). When all MgATP-G-actin was in complex with actobindin, the rate of barbed end growth was 70% of the rate observed with G-actin alone, indicating that the actobindin-actin complex associates with barbed ends with a rate constant only 30% lower than G-actin. This value is identical to the one found first for profilin-actin (30.Perelroizen I. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1501-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Cib-actin (25.Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.-F. Préat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) association with barbed ends. The steady-state measurements displayed in Fig. 1 show that actobindin and Cib form a 1:1 complex with MgATP-G-actin that does not participate in pointed end filament assembly. Formation of this complex is expected to cause inhibition of filament pointed end elongation from G-actin subunits. Seeded growth assays using gelsolin-actin seeds were carried out at two different concentrations of G-actin. The decrease in the initial rate of elongation off gelsolin-actin seeds upon addition of actobindin should reflect saturation of G-actin by actobindin. Hence more actobindin should be needed to saturate a higher amount of G-actin. Typically, since the pointed end critical concentration is 0.5 μm, the rate of growth is expected to reach zero when 1.5 μm complex is formed at 2 μm actin and when 4.5 μm complex is formed at 5 μm actin. 50% inhibition of elongation should therefore be reached at an actobindin concentration A 50% = 3.75 μm at 2 μm actin and A50% = 6.34 μm at 5 μm actin (using the law of mass action with actin-actobindin complex = 1/2(total actin − 0.5 μm) and K C = 5 μm). In the case of Cib, 50% inhibition of filament growth should be achieved by addition of 2.25 μm Cib at 2 μm actin and 4.3 μm Cib at 5 μm actin. The experimental data differed from the expected behavior. Elongation of filaments off gelsolin-actin seeds was inhibited by actobindin and Cib, but the rate of growth at pointed ends displayed superimposable concentration dependencies (within experimental error) at 2 μm and at 5 μmG-actin and could not be accounted for by the calculated curves within a sequestration model (Fig. 5). Half-inhibition was observed at a lower concentration of actobindin or Cib than expected within the sequestration activity. The superimposable curves at two different actin concentrations suggest that actobindin or Cib bind to pointed ends with high affinity, preventing their growth. Analysis within pointed end capping with a K Pvalue of 0.6 μm and a sequestration constantK C of 5 μm for actobindin and 2.5 μm for Cib satisfactorily accounted for the data (Fig. 5). The fact that a higher affinity is observed for binding to the pointed end than for binding to monomeric actin suggests, in agreement with previous results (23.Bubb M.R. Knutson J.R. Porter D.K. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25592-25597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that actobindin and Cib may interact with two actins at the pointed end, via their Tβ4 repeats. Similar data were obtained using CaATP-actin instead of MgATP-actin and a polymerization buffer that contained 0.1 m KCl. To determine whether actobindin and Cib prevent pointed end disassembly, dilution-induced depolymerization of gelsolin-capped filaments was performed. The initial rate of depolymerization from the pointed ends was not affected by either actobindin or Cib up to 10 μm (see supplemetary data Fig. 2). In conclusion, association of actobindin or Cib with pointed ends prevents growth but not depolymerization. The behavior of Cib and actobindin has some similarity here with DNase I, which also prevents pointed end growth but does not prevent depolymerization (34.Weber A. Pennise C.R. Pring M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4780-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The failure of Cib and actobindin to prevent pointed end depolymerization may be in relation with the poor binding of these proteins to ADP-actin, which is exposed at depolymerizing pointed ends, while ATP-actin is at the end of growing filaments. Therefore at the steady state of assembly of gelsolin-capped filaments, the relevant reaction is essentially the sequestration of monomeric actin by actobindin or Cib. Polymerization of CaATP-actin is quasi-reversible due to the slow hydrolysis of ATP on CaATP-F-actin. Consistently, the critical concentrations are practically identical (0.6 μm) at the two ends. Profilin-CaATP-actin failed to polymerize at the barbed ends (35.Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N.-H. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both actobindin and Cib displayed the same behavior as profilin regarding interaction with CaATP-actin and caused depolymerization of F-actin (i.e. sequestration of G-actin) at the barbed and at the pointed end (Fig. 6). Values of 8 ± 1 μm were derived from the data for the equilibrium dissociation constants of the complexes of CaATP-G-actin with either actobindin or Cib. In conclusion, the general features of the different interactions of profilin with CaATP-actin and MgATP-actin are displayed by actobindin and Cib. We have shown that regarding its biochemical properties and biological function, the amoeba protein actobindin is a member of a new family of actin-binding proteins. These proteins consist of two or three β-thymosin repeats and share some biochemical properties with β-thymosins. For instance they bind ATP-G-actin specifically with thermodynamic and rate parameters very similar to Tβ4 and slow down nucleotide dissociation from G-actin-like β-thymosins, indicating that their binding sites appreciably overlap the Tβ4 binding site on G-actin. This conclusion is in agreement with results from EDC-cross-linking experiments, which indicated that lysine 18 of Tβ4 (13.Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and lysine 16 of actobindin (36.Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Bubb M.R. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15427-15431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) make contacts with the 4 N-terminal acidic residues of actin. The rate constant for association to G-actin is lower than the expected diffusion-limited rate constant, suggesting, as proposed for Tβ4 (14.De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), that the formation of a low affinity rapid equilibrium collision complex is followed by a reversible isomerization step leading to a tighter interaction; alternatively, the protein might be in rapid equilibrium between several conformational states, one of which only binds G-actin. On the other hand, unlike β-thymosins, these proteins are not pure G-actin sequesterers but actually regulate the dynamics of filament assembly using the same mechanism as profilin, i.e. their complex with MgATP-G-actin participates in barbed end growth exclusively. This property is observed in kinetic assays of seeded filament growth. Its consequence at steady state is the lowering of the steady-state concentration of free G-actin, consistent with copolymerization of actin and actobindin-actin or Cib-actin complexes. The failure of actobindin to depolymerize actin at steady state when barbed ends are free or inhibit barbed end growth had been noticed previously but had been explained differently (24.Bubb M.R. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Due to the ability of their complex with actin to participate in barbed end growth, proteins of the actobindin family play an active role, like profilin, in actin-based motility processes. We have shown that theDrosophila homolog, ciboulot, is required for axonal growth during central brain development in metamorphosis of the fly and that either Cib or actobindin can replace profilin in a reconstituted motility assay (25.Boquet I. Boujemaa R. Carlier M.-F. Préat T. Cell. 2000; 102: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The present work indicates that actobindin likewise must be required for some motile processes of the amoeba. Like for profilin, the participation of actobindin-actin or Cib-actin to barbed end growth is observed with MgATP-actin only, and a pure G-actin sequestering function is observed with CaATP-actin. These results point to a possible role of ATP hydrolysis associated with actin polymerization in this function. Actobindin consists of two imperfect β-thymosin repeats, while the Drosophila and C. elegans proteins harbor three β-thymosin repeats, suggesting that their functional difference with Tβ4 might correlate with the fact that the β-thymosin motif is repeated. This view is not supported, however, by the following observations. Similar G-actin binding motifs showing similarity with Tβ4, called “verprolin homology region” or WH2 domain, are found in WASp family proteins, and in the ActA protein of Listeria, where they have been demonstrated to share the same functional homology with profilin (Refs.37.Egile C.

In these proteins, the G-actin binding module is generally not repeated, except in the case of N-WASp (the neural form of WASp), which contains a tandem of two verprolin homology regions. Hence it seems likely that a subtle difference in sequence in the G-actin binding motif, rather than the repeat of the motif, is responsible for the functional difference between β-thymosins and these proteins. The repeated sequences would then simply help to enhance the affinity of these proteins for G-actin. Further studies of the biochemical properties of the isolated repeats are required to challenge this view. A mutagenetic analysis of these proteins should also help to elucidate the structural basis for the change in function of the β-thymosin motif. In this respect, previous studies have shown that changing the sequence17LKKTET22 in the actin binding motif of Tβ4 into LKETET caused Tβ4-induced actin aggregation in low ionic strength buffer (9.Vancompernolle K. Goethals M. Huet C. Louvard D. Vandekerckhove J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4739-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to this segment, Tβ4 interacts with G-actin via helix 1 (residues 5–16) and helix 2 (residues 31–39) (42.Simenel C. Van Troys M. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Delepierre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3530-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). According to Safer and co-workers (13.Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M.

This contact may prevent association of the Tβ4-actin complex to the barbed end of an actin filament. In binding to G-actin, Cib and actobindin do not sterically interfere with subdomain 2 association to a barbed end. Finally, β-thymosin repeat proteins display the original property, not shown by either profilin or β-thymosins, to prevent pointed end growth by a capping effect. This result has no physiological significance since in vivo pointed ends only depolymerize, but it is interesting from a structural point of view. The affinity for pointed ends is about 5-fold higher than for monomeric actin. This result is surprising and paradoxical. Actually, the view that actobindin-actin and Cib-actin participate in barbed end growth intuitively suggests that these proteins are transiently bound to the terminal subunit at the barbed end of the filament, but cannot be bound to the pointed end. To accommodate the unexpected pointed end capping we propose that two β-thymosin repeats of a single protein may interact with two terminal subunits at the pointed end. The structure of actobindin or Cib bound to the pointed end may be similar to the structure of the reported high affinity complex of actobindin with covalently cross-linked actin dimers obtained by reacting F-actin withpara-phenylene-bis-maleimide (43.Bubb M.R.

Resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the complex of actobindin or Cib with G-actin is required to challenge this hypothesis. Download .pdf (.16 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W1566461421,"Increased production of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is associated with the development of alcoholic liver disease. Culture of RAW264.7 macrophages with 25 mm ethanol for 48 h increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated accumulation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) peptide and mRNA by 2-fold. We investigated whether chronic ethanol-induced increases in the DNA binding and/or promoter activity of the key transcription factors regulating LPS-stimulated TNFα promoter activity contribute to increased TNFα expression. Binding of Egr-1 to theTNFα promoter was increased by 2.5-fold after ethanol exposure, whereas NFκB binding was decreased to 30% of control. AP-1 binding was not affected. Changes in binding activity were paralleled by an increased contribution of the Egr-1 binding site and a decreased contribution of the NFκB site to LPS-stimulated TNFα promoter activity. Overexpression of dominant negative Egr-1 prevented the ethanol-induced increase in LPS-stimulated TNFα mRNA accumulation. Chronic ethanol exposure enhanced LPS-stimulatedEgr-1 promoter-driven CAT expression and transcription ofEgr-1. Induction of Egr-1 is dependent on ERK1/2 activation in other systems. Therefore, we investigated whether the ERK1/2 pathway mediated the chronic ethanol-induced increases in Egr-1 and TNFα. Increased Egr-1 promoter activity and TNFα mRNA accumulation after chronic ethanol were both prevented by overexpression of dominant negative ERK1/2. LPS-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased 2-fold in cells cultured with ethanol compared with controls. These results demonstrate that enhanced LPS-dependent activation of Egr-1 contributes to increased TNFα production after chronic ethanol exposure."

However, several gluco- and phosphofructokinases have been reported to have different phosphoryl group donor specificity. The glucokinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis can utilize both ATP and polyphosphate as the phosphoryl group donor (1.Hsieh P.C. Shenoy B.C. Samols D. Phillips N.F. J. Biol.

PPi-dependent phosphofructokinases have been reported to be present in several eucarya and bacteria and in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermoproteus tenax (2.Li Z. Phillips N.F. Protein Expr.

Recently novel sugar kinases, ADP-dependent (AMP-forming) glucokinase (ADP-GK)1 and phosphofructokinase (ADP-PFK), were discovered in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (5.Kengen S.W. de Bok F.A. van Loo N.D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17537-17541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those enzymes require ADP as the phosphoryl group donor instead of ATP and are involved in a modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway in this organism. The hyperthermophilic archaea are relatively deeply branched archaea and are considered to be phylogenetically ancient organisms. Therefore, structural analysis of the kinases from these organisms may provide abundant information for phylogenetic analysis of the sugar kinases. We cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the ADP-GKs from P. furiosus and Thermococcus litoralis (The nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the GenBankTM data bases as the genes for ADP-dependent hexokinase and are available under accession numbers E14588 and E14589.) (6.Koga S. Yoshioka I. Sakuraba H. Takahashi M. Sakasegawa S. Shimizu S. Ohshima T. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). About 59% identity in amino acid sequence was observed between these two enzymes, although they did not show similarity with any ATP-dependent kinases that have been reported so far. In addition, the amino acid sequence of the P. furiosus ADP-GK showed high identity (26%) with that reported for the P. furiosus ADP-PFK (7.Tuininga J.E. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Kengen S.W. Stams A.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21023-21028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This suggests that those kinases belong to a novel kinase family and might have evolved from a common origin. Recently a gene encoding the ADP-PFK homologue has been identified from genome information in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii (8.Ronimus R.S. de Heus E. Morgan H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Verhees et al. (9.Verhees C.H. Tuininga J.E. Kengen S.W. Stams A.J. van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. J.

They performed characterization of the enzyme with regard to the ADP-PFK activity. We have also analyzed the same gene of M. jannaschii and found that the identity (29%) in amino acid sequence between the M. jannaschii ADP-PFK homologue and P. furiosus ADP-GK is somewhat higher than that (26%) observed between P. furiosus ADP-PFK and -GK. We expressed the gene in E. coli and examined characteristics of the product. As a result, we found that the produced enzyme has high ADP-dependent activity for both glucokinase and phosphofructokinase. We show here that the enzyme is a novel type of enzyme, a bifunctional ADP-dependent glucokinase/phosphofructokinase (ADP-GK/PFK). The enzyme was proposed to be a common origin of the ADP-GK and -PFK from genome analysis. This is the first example of a kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of both d-glucose andd-fructose 6-phosphate. The gene (MJ1604) encoding the ADP-PFK homologue, which shows high similarity to that of the P. furiosus ADP-PFK, has been identified in the M. jannaschii genome (8.Ronimus R.S. de Heus E. Morgan H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA pET15b, which carries an N-terminal His tag sequence, was obtained from Novagen, Inc. (Madison, WI). The following set of oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify the ADP-PFK gene fragment by PCR: the primer (5′-CTAGAGGAATAACCATATGTGTG-3′) introduced a unique NdeI restriction site overlapping the 5′-initiation codon, and the other primer (5′-CATGCGGATCCTTAGCTCATTC-3′) introduced a unique BamHI restriction site proximal to the 3′-end of the termination codon. The chromosomal M. jannaschii DNA was isolated as described before (10.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.23Google Scholar) and used as the template. The amplified 1.4-kb fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated with the expression vector pET15b linearized with NdeI and BamHI to generate pMJGK/PFK. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL, which was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), was transformed with pMJGK/PFK. The transformants were cultivated at 37 °C in 2 liters of Luria Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. The induction was carried out by the addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the medium, and cultivation was continued for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 m Na2SO4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and disrupted by ultrasonication. The crude extract was heated at 80 °C for 10 min, and the denatured protein was then removed by centrifugation (15,000 × gfor 15 min). The supernatant solution was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mNaCl and 10 mm imidazole and loaded on a nickel-charged chelating Sepharose column (2.6 × 10 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. Protein was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0–0.5 m imidazole in the same buffer. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and applied to an Uno-Q column (1.5 × 10 cm) (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with 30 ml of the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and used as the purified enzyme preparation. Assays for ADP-GK and ADP-PFK activities were conducted at 50 °C essentially as described by Kengen et al. (5.Kengen S.W. de Bok F.A. van Loo N.D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J. de Vos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17537-17541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADP-GK was determined by measuring the formation of NADPH in a coupled assay with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from yeast. The assay mixture contained 50 mmBisTris buffer (pH 6.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NADP, 20 mm glucose, 2 mm ADP, 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzyme preparation. The absorbance of NADPH was followed at 340 nm (εM = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1). ADP-PFK was determined by measuring the oxidation of NADH in a coupled assay with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The assay mixture contained 50 mm BisTris buffer (pH 6.5), 2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 20 mm fructose 6-phosphate, 2 mm ADP, 1 unit of aldolase (rabbit muscle), 11 units of triose-phosphate isomerase (rabbit muscle), and 4 units of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (rabbit muscle), and enzyme preparation. The relative reactivity of d-glucose,d-fructose, d-glucosamine,d-mannose, d-galactose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, d-fructose 6-phosphate,d-fructose 1-phosphate, and d-glucose 6-phosphate as substrates was tested by measuring the formation of AMP from ADP by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) basically as described by Koga et al. (6.Koga S. Yoshioka I. Sakuraba H. Takahashi M. Sakasegawa S. Shimizu S. Ohshima T. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm BisTris Buffer (pH 6.5), a 20 mmconcentration of each substrate, 2 mm ADP, 2 mmMgCl2·6H2O, and 20 μl of enzyme preparation in a total volume of 0.5 ml. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by cooling on ice. After 5 min, each solution was passed through a cellulose acetate filter (pore size, 0.2 μm; ADVANTEC, Tokyo, Japan). An aliquot (20 μl) of each filtrate was subjected to a column (7.6 mm × 25 cm) of Asahipak GS320HQ (Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan). NaH2PO4 (200 mm, pH 5.0) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The effluent from the column was monitored by a UV detector at a wavelength of 260 nm. ATP, ADP, and AMP were separated on a column at retention times of about 7.6, 8.6, and 11.6 min, respectively. For the detection of specificity for the phosphoryl group donor, GDP, CDP, ATP, GTP, pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate, trimetaphosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate (each 2 mm) and polyphosphate (0.2 mg/ml) were used instead of ADP in the standard assay mixture. The divalent cation requirement was tested by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2, CoCl2, NiCl2, MnCl2, ZnCl2, PbCl2, or CaCl2 to the standard assay mixture. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined by gel filtration on a TSK gel column G3000SW XL (7.8 mm × 30 cm) (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), and the subunit molecular mass of the purified enzyme was determined by SDS-PAGE as described previously (6.Koga S. Yoshioka I. Sakuraba H. Takahashi M. Sakasegawa S. Shimizu S. Ohshima T. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL transformed with the expression vector pMJGK/PFK exhibited high activities for both ADP-dependent glucokinase and phosphofructokinase, which were not lost by incubation at 80 °C for 10 min. Hereafter we refer to the enzyme as the M. jannaschii ADP-GK/PFK. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the extract of E. coli cells. About 10 mg of the purified enzyme was obtained from 2 liters of the E. coli culture. The specific activity of the purified M. jannaschiiADP-GK/PFK was estimated to be 7.7 μmol/min/mg at 50 °C for phosphofructokinase activity at the optimum pH of 6.5. The specific activity for the ADP-PFK reaction of the M. jannaschiienzyme has been reported to be 8.2 μmol/min/mg at 50 °C by Verhees et al. (9.Verhees C.H. Tuininga J.E. Kengen S.W. Stams A.J. van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7145-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and this is compatible with that measured in this study. On the other hand, the specific activity for the ADP-GK reaction of the enzyme was about 3 times that for the ADP-PFK reaction and was estimated to be 21.5 μmol/min/mg at 50 °C. Upon heating at 80 °C for 10 min, the enzyme retained its full activity but lost 20% of the activity at 90 °C after a 10-min incubation. The purified ADP-GK/PFK showed activity only in the forward direction. The biochemical characteristics of the purified enzyme were determined and compared with those of the ADP-GKs from P. furiosus and T. litoralis (6.Koga S. Yoshioka I. Sakuraba H. Takahashi M. Sakasegawa S. Shimizu S. Ohshima T. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and ADP-PFK from P. furiosus(7.Tuininga J.E. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J. Kengen S.W.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the M. jannaschiiADP-GK/PFK gene showed 52, 29, and 33% identities to the P. furiosus ADP-PFK, P. furiosus ADP-GK, and T. litoralis ADP-GK, respectively. SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme gave only one band; the subunit molecular mass was determined to be about 53 kDa, and was consistent with the molecular weight (55,524) calculated from the amino acid sequence including the His tag sequence. The native molecular mass of the enzyme determined by HPLC was about 55 kDa; this indicates the enzyme is monomeric. Although the P. furiosus ADP-PFK shows high homology with the M. jannaschii ADP-GK/PFK, it has a tetramer structure composed of four identical subunits (7.Tuininga J.E. Verhees C.H. van der Oost J.

Open table in a new tab ADP could be replaced by GDP to some extent for both the ADP-GK and -PFK reactions of the M. jannaschii enzyme (Table I). When d-glucose was used as a phosphoryl group acceptor, ADP could be replaced by CDP to a limited extent. ATP, GTP, pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate, trimetaphosphate, polyphosphate, and phosphoenolpyruvate were inert. The ADP-GKs from P. furiosusand T. litoralis utilize GDP to a very limited extent as the phosphoryl group donor, although the two enzymes showed comparable activity for ADP and CDP. On the other hand, the P. furiosusADP-PFK has some reactivity for GDP. In this respect, the M. jannaschii enzyme is similar to the P. furiosus ADP-PFK (Table I). The enzymes required divalent cations for both activities. MgCl2 and CaCl2 were comparatively effective, and they were able to be replaced by NiCl2,MnCl2, PbCl2, or CoCl2 to some extent (Table I). However, the ADP-GKs from P. furiosus and T. litoralis do not utilize CaCl2, and the P. furiosus ADP-PFK shows very low activity for CaCl2. Therefore, the reactivity for CaCl2 is one of the remarkable characteristics of the enzyme. The ability of the enzyme to catalyze the phosphorylation of various sugars was examined. The enzyme catalyzed the phosphorylation of d-fructose and 2-deoxy-d-glucose to a limited extent in addition to d-glucose andd-fructose 6-phosphate (Table I).d-Glucosamine, d-mannose,d-galactose, d-fructose 1-phosphate, andd-glucose 6-phosphate were inert. Typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed for both the phosphorylation ofd-glucose and d-fructose 6-phosphate at 50 °C. The apparent Km values for fructose 6-phosphate and d-glucose were calculated to be 0.010 and 1.6 mm, respectively. The Km values for ADP were 0.032 and 0.63 mm when d-glucose andd-fructose 6-phosphate were used as a phosphoryl group acceptor, respectively. To date, the ADP-PFK that utilizesd-glucose as a phosphoryl group acceptor has not been found. The ADP-GKs do not utilize d-fructose 6-phosphate (Table I). To the best of our knowledge, the ADP-GK/PFK of M. jannaschii is the only enzyme having significantly high levels of both activities. We performed inhibition studies for the glucokinase activity of the enzyme with fructose-6-phosphate as an inhibitor. The double-reciprocal plots of v versus glucose concentrations at several fixed concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate showed a typical competitive inhibition pattern (Fig. 1A). Ki for fructose 6-phosphate was calculated to be 0.0047 mm from Dixon plots (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the substrate recognition site of the enzyme for glucose and fructose 6-phosphate is identical. Fig. 2 shows an amino acid alignment of ADP-GK and -PFK homologues from M. jannaschii, P. furiosus, Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3, and Pyrococcus abyssi. A phylogenetic tree produced using the alignment of Fig. 2 by the neighbor-joining method is shown in Fig. 3. The genome information of those organisms is available at the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (genome.ad.jp/kegg/) and the Utah Genome Center (www.genome.utah.edu.). The data bases were screened for homologues of ADP-GKs and -PFKs using blastP. As shown in Fig. 3, the ADP-GKs clustered together and are separated from another cluster of the ADP-PFKs. Interestingly both the ADP-GK and -PFK homologues are present in P. furiosus, P. horikoshii OT-3, and P. abyssibut not in M. jannaschii, except for the ADP-GK/PFK. This suggests that the gene encoding the enzyme might be an ancestral gene of the ADP-GK and -PFK, and a gene duplication event has lead to the two enzymatic activities.Figure 3Phylogenetic tree of the ADP-PFKs and ADP-GKs.

Cocrystallization with ADP elucidated the position of the nucleotide-binding site, and the residues that interact directly with ADP were identified. In addition, the important residues involved in the binding of sugars have been predicted based on the sugar binding position of the ATP-dependent ribokinase family that was observed to have significant structural similarity to the ADP-GK (11.Ito S. Fushinobu S. Yoshioka I. Koga S. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Structure. 2001; 9: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Verhees et al. (9.Verhees C.H. Tuininga J.E.

This indicates that those residues are common to both the ADP-GK and -PFK, and the other residues may contribute to the discrimination betweend-glucose and d-fructose 6-phosphate in those kinases. As shown in Fig. 2, several residues of the M. jannaschii ADP-GK/PFK are conserved in the ADP-GKs but not in the ADP-PFKs. In particular, Lys31, Tyr32, Asp37, Ser74, Glu82, Leu115, Gln135, Asp141, Ala192, Lys382, Asn387, Lys435, and Ser446 of the M. jannaschii enzyme are well conserved in all the ADP-GKs including the T. litoralis ADP-GK (not shown). Some or one of those residues might be responsible for the reactivity of the ADP-dependent kinases for d-glucose. To clarify the amino acid residues that are responsible for the binding ofd-glucose and d-fructose 6-phosphate, x-ray reflection analysis of the M. jannaschii ADP-GK/PFK is under investigation. The presence of a glycolytic pathway in methanogen has been proposed on the basis of enzyme analyses of several mesophilic and thermophilic methanogens (9.Verhees C.H. Tuininga J.E. Kengen S.W.

A number of methanogens have been known to synthesize glycogen intracellularly and accumulate it as a reserve polysaccharide (9.Verhees C.H. Tuininga J.E. Kengen S.W.

Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1517: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that a modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway, present in P. furiosus, might also be operational in methanogens. It is therefore interesting to examine whether the production of methane from glycogen or d-glucose by methanogen itself is permitted. The observations described above and our results suggest that such a probability is not completely ruled out."

The cytosolic, ribosomal, and ribosome salt wash fractions from yeast cells lacking RMT2 were used as substrates for the recombinant RMT2. Using S-adenosyl-l-methionine as co-substrate, RMT2 methylated a protein in the ribosome salt wash fraction. The same protein in the ribosomal fraction was also methylated by RMT2 after pretreating the sample with endonuclease.

The process involves the transfer of methyl group fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)1 to the guanidino nitrogen atoms of arginine with protein-arginineN-methyltransferases (PRMTs) (1Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least three types of PRMTs (2Tang J. Frankel A. Cook R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. Williams K.R.

The type I PRMTs mediate the formation of ω-NG-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine. The type II enzymes have the symmetric ω-NG,NG′-dimethylarginine in addition to the ω-NG′-monomethylarginine as products (see Ref. 1Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

At least five complete genes have been reported for the type I PRMTs. They are the PRMT1 from rat and human, the protein-arginine methyltransferase 1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RMT1), the PRMT3 from rat, and the mouse coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1/PRMT4.

Jak-binding protein 1/PRMT5 was found interacting with Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) (11Pollack B. He S. Kotenko W. Izotova L. Barnoski B. Pestka S. J. Biol.

It has been shown that Jak-binding protein 1/PRMT5 can utilize myelin basic protein, histones H2A and H4, and interestingly, a glutathione S-transferase fibrillarin glycine- and arginine-rich domain fusion protein (GST-GAR) as substrates. GST-GAR has been routinely used in the assay of type I PRMTs (2Tang J. Frankel A. Cook R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K. Williams K.R. Clarke S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

In addition to the PRMTs mentioned above, there are two other clones that code for arginine methyltransferases. The human PRMT2 (HRMT1L1) has 60% amino acid sequence similarity with the yeast RMT1 protein (14Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Lalioti M.D. Rossier C. Silver P.A. Henry M.F. Genomics. 1998; 48: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the recombinant GST-PRMT2 fusion protein does not show any enzymatic activity with GST-GAR, myelin basic protein, or cytosolic extracts from a yeast rmt1 deletion strain as substrates (1Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lately, the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1B-AP5 has been suggested as the in vivo substrate of PRMT2 (15Kzhyshkowska J. Schutt H. Liss M. Kremmer E. Stauber R. Wolf H. Dobner T. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, Zobel-Thropp et al. (3Zobel-Thropp P. Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29283-29286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) identified the presence of δ-N-monomethylarginine in the yeast cell lysate. Furthermore, Niewmierzycka and Clarke (16Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the gene product of YDR465c, RMT2, is responsible for the formation of the δ-N-monomethylarginines. RMT2 is a protein of 412 amino acid residues, including the initiator methionine. It shares 23 and 22% sequence identity with yeast RMT1 and the rat PRMT1, respectively. Noticeably, the protein contains the sequence motif (GXGXG) conserved inS-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases (16Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the substrate(s) for RMT2 has not been identified in either in vivo or in vitrolabeling experiments. We report here that ribosomal protein L12 from the YDR465cdisruption mutant (ΔRMT2) can be specifically labeled by recombinant RMT2 heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. We affirm that the reaction product is δ-N-monomethylarginine. We demonstrate with synthetic peptides, recombinant L12, and its mutant that Arg67 on ribosomal protein L12 is the methyl acceptor of RMT2. Furthermore, L12 isolated from wild type yeast strain contains δ-N-monomethylarginine. Yeast strain SEY6210 (MATα, ura3–52, leu2–3, leu2–112, his3Δ200, trp1-Δ901, lys2–801, suc2-Δ9, GAL), open reading frames (ORFs) (YBR034c andYDR465c), and genomic DNA from S. cerevisiaeS288C were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). The expression vector pET-15b and the His-Bind resin were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). The yeast integrating plasmids (pRS403 and pRS404) and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The Fast Q chromatographic medium, the prepacked Mono Q and Superdex 75 columns, the Immobiline DryStrips, Pharmalytes, and the IPGphor electrophoresis system were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Precast Novex Tris/glycine gels were products of Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).S-Adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet) (75 Ci/mmol, 0.55 mCi/ml) and Enlightening enhancer were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The AA511 column (0.46 × 12 cm) prepacked with sulfonated polystyrene divinylbenzene copolymer was obtained from Pierce. Synthetic peptides were custom made by SynPep (Dublin, CA). They were partially purified by gel filtration chromatography and judged to be at least 70% pure by HPLC on a C18 reverse-phase column according to the absorption profile at 214 nm. The masses of these peptides are within 1 dalton of their theoretical values as measured in a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). ZipTip pipette tips for MALDI sample preparation were purchased from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Yeast ORFs encoding YBR034c andYDR465c were used as templates in PCR experiments. Primers employed in the cloning experiments are listed in Table I.YBR034c was amplified with PCR using primers 1 and 2. The product was restricted with NdeI and XhoI and then inserted into the pET-15b vector and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The recombinant protein (His-RMT1) has a His tag at the N terminus and was purified on a Ni2+ affinity column according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The recombinant proteins in this study (His-RMT1, His-RMT2, and RMT2) have the tendency to form aggregates. All buffers used in the chromatographic steps contain 10% glycerol for protein stabilization. Soluble proteins (15 mg/ml for His-RMT1, 2–5 mg/ml for His-RMT2, 7–9 mg/ml for RMT2) were separated from precipitates by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C in the elution buffer containing 1 m imidazole.Table IPrimers used in molecular cloningPrimerSequence15′-GGAATTCCAGCTGACCATATGAGCAAGACAGCCGTGAAAGATTCTGCTAC-3′25′-CCAGCAAACTCGAGTCTTAATGCATTAAATAAGAACCTTCG-3′35′-GATCGATGTTGCTACATACGGTATGAAATGCGATTACACC-3′45′-ATTATTCTCGAGTTAAGCAAACGTGATACGTGGATGG-3′55′-ATCTACTCACATATGTCAGAATTACATGCTTTGCTTACTTTCCCAG-3′65′-GGAATTGTCGACTTAAGCAAACGTGATACGTGGATGG-3′75′-AAGCTAAGTGAAAGCGAACAGCACTAGTTCAATTCGTACGAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC-3′85′-TTGAATTACGGTCGATGCCATTCGATTCGAACTTGTAAGACTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG-3′95′-CCATTTCTCAAAGTTACTATGTACCAAAACTGCAGCATTTAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC-3′105′-AGTTAAAGTAAGACCGCTTAACATCATTCCAATCTGGCAACTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG-3′115′-CCAGCTGACCCATATGCCTCCAAAGTTTGATCCAAATG-3′125′-GATCCGTCGACTCGAGCATGTTAGTTTTCTGGAATTTCAATTTCACCAGC-3′135′-CCAATTGAAAATCCAAAACAAACAAGCTGCTGCTTC-3′Restriction sites, the nucleotides substituted for mutagenesis, and the sequences of TRP1 and HIS3 are underlined. Open table in a new tab Restriction sites, the nucleotides substituted for mutagenesis, and the sequences of TRP1 and HIS3 are underlined. YDR465c contains an NdeI site near the C terminus of the coding sequence. PCR was carried out with primers 3 and 4 to eliminate this NdeI restriction site. The product was then combined with primer 5 in another PCR experiment to obtain the complete coding sequence of RMT2. The PCR product was restricted withNdeI and XhoI and then inserted into pET-15b vector. The resulting plasmid is designated as pET-RMT2. Transformation into bacterial cells, expression of the His-tagged protein (His-RMT2), and purification with metal affinity column were carried out as outlined above. Samples from the affinity column were further separated from low molecular weight contaminants on a gel filtration column eluted with buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). Alternatively, YDR465c was PCR-amplified from pET-RMT2 with primers 5 and 6. The product was inserted into the NdeI andSalI sites of the pBAce vector and transformed intoEscherichia coli DH5α cells for protein expression at 30 °C as described (17Liu L.-F. Hong J.-L. Tsai S.-P. Hsieh J.-C. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein (RMT2) thus expressed does not have a His tag. Cells containing RMT2 were lysed in buffer II (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol), and the debris was removed by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Type 70 Ti rotor at 50,000 rpm for 2.5 h. The supernatant was loaded directly onto a Fast Q anion exchanger equilibrated in buffer II. The column was eluted with an NaCl gradient, and RMT2 came off of the column at ∼0.4 m NaCl. Fractions containing RMT2 were collected and diluted an with equal volume of buffer II. The sample was then loaded onto a prepacked Mono Q column (1.0 × 10 cm) and eluted with an NaCl concentration gradient. The purity of the RMT2 preparation was examined by SDS-PAGE, and the molecular mass of the recombinant protein was confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (18Yeh H.-I. Hsieh C.-H. Wang L.-Y. Tsai S.-P. Hsu H.-Y. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strain SEY6210 was used in this study. A DNA fragment in which TRP1 is flanked by the 5′ and 3′ sequences of RMT1 was obtained by PCR amplification of a plasmid encoding the TRP1 gene (pRS404). The primers used for amplification contain the flanking sequences of TRP1 (underlined) and either the 5′ (primer 7) or 3′ (primer 8) sequence of RMT1 (Table I). The amplified DNA fragment was transformed into the haploid strain SEY6210 to disrupt the genomic RMT1 by homologous recombination. Transformants with disrupted RMT1 gene (ΔRMT1) were screened and verified by PCR. The yeast strain lacking RMT2 (ΔRMT2) was obtained similarly. A DNA fragment in which HIS3 is flanked by the 5′ and 3′ sequences of RMT2 was PCR-amplified from pRS403 with hybrid primers containing the flanking sequences of HIS3(underlined) and either the 5′ (primer 9) or 3′ (primer 10) sequence ofRMT2 (Table I). The amplified DNA fragment was transformed into the haploid strain SEY6210 for homologous recombination. Transformants with disrupted RMT2 were screened and verified by PCR. YDR418W, the ORF encoding yeast ribosomal protein L12B, was obtained by amplifying genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae strain S288C with primers 11 and 12 (Table I). The PCR product was restricted with NdeI and SalI and then inserted into the pBAce vector (pBA-L12) for protein expression as outlined above. Yeast ribosomal protein L12 with an Arg67 to lysine substitution was generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pBA-L12 vector was used as template, and primer 13 (TableI) was used as the mutation primer. Cell transformation and protein expression were carried out as outlined above. Ribosomal protein L12 and its mutant were expressed as inclusion bodies. DH5α cells containing recombinant proteins were lysed in buffer III (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 m sucrose) at a concentration of 75 A600 units/ml. After cell lysis, the debris and the recombinant proteins were pelleted in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The recombinant proteins were then dissolved in buffer IV (0.25 m Tris, pH 8.5, 6m guanidinium chloride, and 1 mm EDTA) and separated from cell debris and organelles by centrifugation in a Beckman Type 70.1 Ti rotor at 50,000 rpm for 3 h. The recombinant proteins were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. Yeast strains were grown with constant shaking at 30 °C in YPD medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, and 2% d-glucose) untilA600 = 2. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer V (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmEGTA. The wet pastes were used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Cells from 4 liters of culture were suspended in 50 ml of buffer V in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). Cell breakage was induced by passing the suspension through a Microfluidizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) at 25,000 p.s.i. 7–9 times. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation in a Beckman Type 70 Ti rotor at 20,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and layered on top of a 10% sucrose cushion, and centrifugation was carried out in a Type 70 Ti rotor at 50,000 rpm for 4 h. The supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction (C) and stored at −80 °C after dialysis against buffer V. The crude ribosomal pellet was resuspended overnight at 4 °C in buffer VI (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mNH4Cl). Insoluble particulate was removed by spinning in a Type 70 Ti rotor at 20,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was then spun down in a 10% sucrose cushion as mentioned above and designated as the ribosome salt wash (S) fraction. The pelleted ribosome (R) was redissolved in buffer V. Both fractions were dialyzed extensively against buffer V before storage at −80 °C. The cytosolic (C), R, and S fractions from SEY6210, ΔRMT1, and ΔRMT2 strains were used as methyl acceptors in the assays. The reactions were carried out in buffer V at a final volume of 40 μl. The reaction mixture contained 340 μg of protein, 5 μg of methyltransferase, and 0.59 μm (1.65 μCi) of [3H]AdoMet. Incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid or SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to stop the methylation reaction. For the methylation of synthetic peptides, a mixture of 4 μg of methyltransferase, 2.5 nmol of N-terminal biotinyl peptides, and 0.39 μm (1.38 μCi) [3H]AdoMet was prepared in 50 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h. N-terminal biotinyl peptides were captured on streptavidin-agarose beads and washed extensively with buffer VII (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) to remove the unincorporated [3H]AdoMet prior to scintillation counting. Recombinant L12 and its R67K mutant in buffer III were diluted 25-fold into a phosphate buffer and modified with RMT2 in a substrate/enzyme (w/w) ratio of 10:1. The final reaction mixture contained 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.24 m guanidinium chloride, and 7.86 μm [3H]AdoMet (6.6–11 μCi). Incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 2 h. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and collected on glass fiber filters for scintillation counting or redissolved in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. The methylated proteins were boiled with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) for 5 min. Typically, one-twentieth of the assay mixture was separated on a precast Novex 4–20% polyacrylamide gel at 125 V for ∼120 min. Proteins on the gels were visualized with Coomassie Blue dye staining. After destaining, the gels were soaked in Enlightening Enhancer, dried, and exposed to x-ray films (X-Omat AR; Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C. Isoelectric focusing was carried out on 13-cm Immobiline DryStrips (pH 3–10 and 6–11) with the IPGphor system. The DryStrips were rehydrated overnight at room temperature in 240 μl of 8.5 m urea, 2.25% CHAPS, 0.5% (v/v) Pharmalyte 3-10, and 15 mmdithiothreitol (DTT). Proteins in samples for isoelectric focusing were quantified by the Bradford assay (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) and then precipitated with 2 volumes of 20% trichloroacetic acid and washed at least three times with cold acetone to remove the acid. Pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of isoelectric focusing sample buffer (9 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.8% (v/v) Pharmalyte 3-10, and 15 mm DTT), loaded onto the DryStrips with a sample cup, and focused for 32,000 V-h for the pH 3–10 DryStrips. An additional 0.5% (v/v) Pharmalyte 9–11 was included in the sample buffer for runs with pH 6–11 DryStrips. After focusing, the DryStrips were equilibrated in 10 ml of isoelectric focusing equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6m urea, 4% SDS, 30% glycerol, 100 mm DTT, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and layered on top of a vertical 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for the second dimension separation. Proteins from the methylation assays were transferred to 6 × 50-mm glass vials and precipitated with 2 volumes of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The protein pellets were hydrolyzed with gaseous HCl at 110 °C for 24 h in a Waters (Milford, MA) Pico-Tag work station. Amino acids released were analyzed on an AA511 cation exchanger at 0.5 ml/min driven by a Waters model 510 HPLC pump. Eluents were collected for ninhydrin test or scintillation counting. Base treatment of the candidate δ-N-monomethylarginine peak was carried out according to the method of Zobel-Thropp et al. (3Zobel-Thropp P. Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29283-29286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The δ-N-monomethylornithine used as a standard was a generous gift from Dr. Steven Clarke (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). N-terminal biotinyl peptides captured on streptavidin-agarose beads as described above for the protein-arginine methytransferase assay were further washed with water to replace buffer VII. The beads were then resuspended in 10% (v/v) acetic acid and boiled for 10 min. The supernatant was then passed through a filtration unit equipped with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane, and the filtrate was dried in vacuo to completion. The peptides thus collected were hydrolyzed and analyzed as outlined above. The SEY6210 and ΔRMT2 yeast cells were labeled in vivo with [3H]AdoMet for 60 min as described (16Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 μl of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 μg/ml of leupeptin and pepstatin) and then lysed by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma). The lysate was collected, and the glass beads were washed repeatedly with buffer VIII (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm Mg(OAc)2). These fractions were combined and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 15 min. The ribosomes in the combined fractions were pelleted by spinning at 427,300 × g for 2 h. The ribosomes were then resuspended in 150 μl of buffer IX (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm KCl, 5 mmMg(OAc)2, and 1 mm DTT). Two volumes of glacial acetic acid were added, and the magnesium ion concentration was raised to 0.1 m for rRNA precipitation. The rRNA was removed by centrifugation, and the proteins in the supernatant were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 66.7% acetic acid. Proteins in the sample was then dried down in vacuo, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie Blue dye staining and fluorography. Recombinant L12 was loaded on the same gel to facilitate the localization of the corresponding in vivo labeled protein. L12 is one of the two major methylated ribosomal proteins on the fluorograph (data not shown). The in vivo methylated L12 was excised from the gel and eluted overnight by diffusion in 100 μl of 0.3 m(NH4)HCO3 and 0.5% SDS. The eluted protein was then dried in vacuo and hydrolyzed for amino acid analysis as described above. Overlaying the fluorograph with the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel identified the methylated protein. The protein was excised from the gel with a pipette tip. In gel digestion was performed essentially as described by Liet al. (21Li G. Waltham M. Anderson N.L. Unsworth E. Treston A. Weinstein J.N. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The gel plug was washed extensively with destaining solution (10% acetic acid and 50% methanol in water). It was then incubated in the digestion buffer (0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 mmCaCl2) for 10 min. The buffer was removed, and the gel plug was dehydrated by adding acetonitrile followed by vacuum centrifugation. Trypsin solution (0.0375 mg/ml in digestion buffer) was then added to restore the gel plug to its original volume. Digestion was carried out at 25 °C overnight. Resulting peptides in the gel plug were extracted sequentially with 60% acetonitrile in digestion buffer, 60% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. The solutions were combined, and the acetonitrile was removed by vacuum centrifugation. The solution was further cleaned up with a ZipTip pipette tip before MALDI-TOF analysis. Peptide mass mapping was performed on a Bruker (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) REFLEX III time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with the SCOUT source and delayed extraction. Detection was set in positive ion reflector mode with each mass determination being an average of 100 spectra. Samples for mass measurement were prepared using the solution-phase nitrocellulose method (22Landry F. Lombardo C.R. Smith J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Angiotensin II (DRVYIHPF; 1045.54 atomic mass units), and two N-terminal biotinylated synthetic peptides (Biotin-DEKLQGKINDEY (1676.77 atomic mass units) and Biotin-GGY(SR)9 (2709.39 atomic mass units)) were used as external calibration standards. Peptide masses obtained were searched against a comprehensive nonredundant protein sequence data base (NCBInr) using the Mascot program (23Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J.C. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S.

Full-Text PDF Open Access wild-type Nucleic acid-dependent NTPases of the DEX(H/D)-box family play important roles in many biological processes including transcription, DNA repair, and pre-mRNA splicing. They use NTP hydrolysis to remodel macromolecular interactions involving nucleic acids and proteins, and many of the DEX(H/D)-box NTPases have RNA or DNA helicase activity (1de la Cruz J. Kressler D.

Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The importance of individual residues for ATPase and/or helicase activity has been demonstrated by mutational analysis of several prototypal DEX(H/D) proteins (4Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 5Linder P. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Yeast. 2000; 16: 507-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the DEXH protein NS3 and other DEX(H/D)-box NTPases show that conserved residues in the motifs comprise the NTP binding site (2Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes PRP16 andPRP22 encode essential splicing factors of the DEAH-box family (9Company M. Arenas J. Abelson J. Nature. 1991; 349: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 10Burgess S. Couto J.R. Guthrie C. Cell. 1990; 60: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Prp16 is required for the second step of pre-mRNA splicing, whereby the 3′ splice site of the lariat-intermediate is cleaved and the exons are joined (11Schwer B. Guthrie C. Nature. 1991; 349: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This was demonstrated byin vitro reconstitution assays. In extracts depleted of Prp16, spliceosomes assemble onto precursor RNA and catalyze 5′ splice site cleavage and formation of a branched lariat-intermediate. Purified Prp16 can act on the step-arrested spliceosomes and trigger the formation of mature RNA. Complementation of splicing requires ATP hydrolysis by Prp16, which elicits a conformational change in the spliceosome that can be measured as protection of the 3′ splice site against RNase H cleavage (12Schwer B. Guthrie C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5033-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The rearrangement that leads to 3′ splice site protection and mRNA formation requires the recruitment of splicing factors Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22 (13Ansari A. Schwer B. EMBO J. 1994; 14: 4001-4009Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Zhang X. Schwer B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The role of Prp22 during the second step is independent of ATP. However, ATP is necessary for the function of Prp22 in catalyzing the release of mature RNA from the spliceosome (15Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 16Wagner J.D.O. Jankowsky E. Company M. Pyle A.M. Abelson J.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2926-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We have undertaken a mutational analysis to evaluate the role of the NTPase motifs of Prp16 and Prp22 in pre-mRNA splicing. Single alanine mutations at conserved residues in motifs I (GKT), II (DEAH), III (SAT), and VI (QRXGRXGR) were tested for complementation of prp16Δ and prp22Δ deletion strains. Most of the mutations were either lethal or caused conditional growth defects. Overexpression of nonfunctional proteins led to dominant-negative growth phenotypes in wild-type cells (17Hotz H.R. Schwer B. Genetics. 1998; 149: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Prior studies of Prp22 had focused on the analysis of cold-sensitive Prp22 mutants H606A (motif II) and S635A and T637A (motif III) (18Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,19Campodonico E. Schwer B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 407-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The S635A and T637A proteins retained full ATPase activity, but were defective in catalyzing mRNA release in vitro and failed to unwind RNA duplexes. Thus, ATPase activity was insufficient for Prp22's function in mRNA release. It was proposed that Prp22 couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to a conformational step, either RNA unwinding or disruption of protein-RNA interactions (18Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). That the ATPase activity of Prp22 was necessary for mRNA release was inferred from an analysis of a mutant in which Lys-512 in motif I was replaced by alanine; the K512A mutant was lethal, defective for ATP hydrolysis and for mRNA release in vitro (15Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Here we address the following questions. 1) Does the correlation between biological activity, ATPase activity, and splicing activity pertain to other Prp22 mutants? 2) How do mutations in conserved residues affect the ATPase and splicing function of Prp16? 3) Are mutational effects concordant for Prp22 and Prp16? 4) Can the mutational effects explain the dominant-negative effects on cell growth? pET16b-based plasmids were constructed for the expression of His-tagged Prp22 mutants D603A, E604A, Q804A, and R808A. The His10 tag does not interfere with the function of Prp22in vivo, insofar as His-Prp22 complements aprp22Δ strain. The expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21-Codon Plus(DE3) RIL (Stratagene). In parallel, we transformed with pET16b-PRP22 and pET16b-K512A (15Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from soluble bacterial lysates as described (18Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Schneider S. Schwer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21184-21191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment carrying the coding sequence of the PRP16 gene (3278 bp) was ligated into the T7-based expression vector pET16b (Novagen). The pET16-PRP16 plasmid encodes a protein in which 10 histidines are fused in frame to the N terminus of Prp16. The His10 tag does not interfere with the function of Prp16in vivo, insofar as His-Prp16 complements aprp16Δ strain. Plasmids carrying mutant prp16alleles were obtained by exchanging the corresponding mutated DNA fragments from the p358-based PRP16 plasmids (17Hotz H.R. Schwer B. Genetics. 1998; 149: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar). E. coliBL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the pET-PRP16 plasmids. Individual transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. When the A600 reached 0.6–0.7, the cultures were chilled on ice for 30 min. Sorbitol and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were added to final concentrations of 1 m and 0.5 mm, respectively. The culture was incubated at 18 °C for 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. All subsequent operations were performed at 4 °C. Cell pellets from 3-liter cultures were suspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. After 30 min, the lysate was adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble lysate was adjusted to 40% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate and then stirred for 30 min. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 15 ml of buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol). The protein solution was adjusted to 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then mixed for 1 h with 3 ml (50% slurry) of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer III (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). The mixture was poured into a column, washed with 20 ml of 35 mm imidazole in buffer III, and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 50–500 mm imidazole in buffer III. Fractions of 1.2 ml were collected and their polypeptide compositions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. An aliquot of the peak fraction containing recombinant Prp16 was diluted with buffer IV (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) to a final NaCl concentration of 30 mm, and loaded on a 1-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated with 30 mm NaCl in buffer IV. The column was washed, and the adsorbed polypeptides were eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of 30–500 mm NaCl in buffer IV. The elution profiles of recombinant Prp16 proteins were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations in the DEAE fractions were measured using the Bradford dye reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The ATPase activity of recombinant Prp16 proteins was measured using the conditions established for Prp16 proteins purified from yeast (21Schwer B. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3540-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.2, 75 mmpotassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.25 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 0.25 mm poly(A) (expressed as concentration of adenosine), and increasing amounts of Prp16 proteins (90–360 ng) were incubated for 20 min at 23 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 270 μl of a 5% (w/v) suspension of activated charcoal in 20 mmphosphoric acid. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and the charcoal was recovered by centrifugation. 32P radioactivity in the supernatant was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The values represent averages from at least two independent experiments, and the variation between experiments was below 10%. The ATPase activity of Prp22 proteins was measured as described (18Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Campodonico E. Schwer B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 407-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schneider S. Schwer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21184-21191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP, 0.5 μg of poly(A) and Prp22 proteins as indicated were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of activated charcoal and processed as described above. The results are average values from duplicate reactions. Yeast whole cell extract from strain BJ2168 was prepared using the liquid nitrogen method (13Ansari A. Schwer B. EMBO J. 1994; 14: 4001-4009Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The extract was immunodepleted of Prp22 using Prp22 affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies as described (15Schwer B. Gross C.H.

Splicing reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 50% Prp22-depleted extract, ∼400 fmol of [32P]GMP-labeled actin precursor RNA, 60 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 3% polyethylene glycol 8000. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 23 °C, after which 50 ng of wild-type or mutant Prp22 were added and incubation was continued for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were halted by transfer to ice. Aliquots (90 μl) were layered onto 15–40% glycerol gradients containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmEDTA. The gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C for 14 h at 35,000 rpm in a Sorvall TH641 rotor. Fractions (400 μl) were collected from the tops of the tubes. RNA was recovered from the gradient fractions by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNAs from alternate fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA. Radiolabeled RNA was visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the dried gel. The amounts of the mRNA products were quantified by scanning the gels using a STORM PhosphorImager. p133-PRP22 plasmids (TRP1 CEN) carry wild-type Prp22 or the mutants K512A, D603A, and R808A under the transcriptional control of the GAL1 promoter (18Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The plasmids were introduced into wild-type yeast cells. Trp+transformants were selected and grown in glucose-containing synthetic medium (SD−trp) at 30 °C to mid-logarithmic phase. Cells were recovered by centrifugation and suspended in SD−trp medium containing either 2% glucose or 2% galactose. The cells in glucose medium were harvested by centrifugation, washed in ice-cold water, and stored as cell pellets at −80 °C. The cells in galactose-containing medium were incubated for 12 h at 30 °C and then harvested. During the incubation in galactose, the A600 of the culture doubled for cells carrying the p133-PRP22 (wild-type (WT)1) plasmid, but did not increase for the cells bearing the mutant Prp22 plasmids. RNA was isolated from thawed resuspended cells as described (22Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobsen A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The RNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA. RNA concentration was calculated on the basis of A260. Equivalent amounts (30 μg) of total RNA of each sample were electrophoresed through a formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel. A radiolabeled RNA marker (RiboMark from Promega) was co-electrophoresed. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and then transferred to a Hybond membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Radiolabeled probes were prepared with a random priming kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the vendor’s instructions. Hybridization was performed as described elsewhere (22Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobsen A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar); hybridized probes were visualized by autoradiography. Three identical blots were generated in parallel. These were first hybridized with probes for CYH2 and ACT1 (exon 2 probes) and for PGK1. The blots were then stripped by boiling in hot water and re-probed with intron probes (CYH2,ACT1, and SNR17A). Conserved residues in motifs I (511GKT), II (603DEAH), and VI (804QRKGRAGR) are essential for the biological function of Prp22; alanine substitutions for Lys-512, Asp-603, Glu-604, Gln-804, and Arg-808 are lethal in vivo (18Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To examine the biochemical consequences of the lethal mutations, we produced recombinant His10-tagged Prp22 proteins K512A (motif I), D603A and E604A (motif II), Q804A and R808A (motif VI) and purified them from soluble bacterial lysates by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, and glycerol gradient sedimentation. The level of purity, as gauged by SDS-PAGE analysis, was comparable for the five mutants and the wild-type Prp22 control (Fig.1A; the Prp22 polypeptide is denoted by an asterisk). The extent of ATP hydrolysis by wild-type Prp22 was proportional to input protein (Fig. 1B); we calculated that Prp22 hydrolyzed 420 ATP min−1. The motif I K512A mutant hydrolyzed 20 ATP min−1 (5% of wild type) (Fig. 1C). The motif II mutant proteins D603A and E604A exhibited no activity (<0.5% of wild type), whereas the motif VI mutants Q804A and R808A hydrolyzed 40 and 85 ATP min−1 (10 and 20% of wild type), respectively (Fig. 1C). We infer that a threshold level of ATPase activity is required for the in vivo function of Prp22. Previous work showed that the ATPase-defective mutant K512A supported mRNA formation but not mRNA release (15Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We now tested splicing activity of the ATPase-defective mutants D603A, E604A, Q804A, and R808A (Fig. 2). Splicing intermediates were formed during a 15-min pre-incubation in extract immunodepleted of Prp22. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were then supplemented with 50 ng of wild-type or mutant Prp22. Wild-type Prp22 and each of the mutants relieved the second step block and promoted the formation of mature actin mRNA. However, excised lariat-intron accumulated in reactions supplemented with each of the ATPase-defective Prp22 mutants, but not in the wild-type Prp22 reactions, suggesting that spliceosome disassembly was affected. To test directly whether the mutants catalyzed mRNA release from the spliceosome, we analyzed the reaction products by glycerol gradient sedimentation (Fig. 3). When the reaction mixture was supplemented with wild-type Prp22, 85% of the mature mRNA was released and sedimented near the top of the gradient (fractions 7–13). In contrast, the Q804A mutant did not catalyze mRNA release and 78% of the mRNA was found in the heavy spliceosome peak (fractions 21–27). When the reactions were supplemented with the K512A, D603A, E604A, and R808A mutants, 65, 61, 83, and 82% of the mature RNA was retained in the spliceosome fractions, respectively (data not shown). Thus, the relevant defect of the lethal Prp22 mutants with respect to splicing is their inability to promote mRNA release from the spliceosome. Lethal Prp22 mutants exert dominant-negative effects when overexpressed in vivo (18Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tested whether the ATPase-defective Q804A mutant inhibits the function of wild-type Prp22 in vitro. Spliceosomes were formed in extracts immunodepleted of Prp22. The reaction mixture was then supplemented with wild-type and Q804A proteins pre-mixed at a ratio of either 1:1 or 1:10 (Fig. 4). Analysis of the splicing products by glycerol gradient sedimentation showed that, when equal amounts of wild-type and Q804A proteins were added, 68% of the mature mRNA was released and 26% was retained in the spliceosome. However, when Q804A was in 10-fold excess (500 ng) over wild-type Prp22 (50 ng), only 25% of mature mRNA was released and 71% was retained (Fig. 4A). Similar experiments performed with mutants E604A and R808A revealed that 10-fold excess of E604A and R808A led to retention of 80 and 81% of the mature RNA in the spliceosome, respectively (data not shown). Thus, excess mutant protein blocks the function of wild-type Prp22 in vitro, providing a plausible explanation for the dominant-negative phenotypes observed in vivo. Previous studies showed that the K512A mutant remained associated with the spliceosome after completion of step 2, i.e.immunoprecipitation of the reaction products under native conditions with Prp22-specific antibodies resulted in the recovery of mature mRNA and lariat-intron, but not pre-mRNA (15Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Here, using the same immunoprecipitation assay, we found that the ATPase-defective Prp22 mutants D603A, E604A, Q804A, and R808A also remained bound to the spliceosomes after step 2 transesterification (data not shown). We surmise that the ATPase-defective mutants inhibit wild-type Prp22 because they occupy a Prp22 binding site on the spliceosome, but do not function in spliceosome disassembly subsequent to their action in forming mature mRNA. The in vitro analysis (Fig. 4) would suggest that overexpression of the nonfunctional Prp22 mutants in vivoshould elicit a splicing defect. To test this directly, we analyzed RNAs from wild-type cells in which PRP22 or theprp22 alleles K512A, D603A, or R808A were placed under the transcriptional control of the GAL1 promoter. RNA was isolated from the strains grown either in glucose-containing medium (expression repressed) or in galactose-containing medium (expression induced). Northern blots were probed for RNAs derived from theACT1, CYH2, and SNR17A (U3 small nuclear RNA) genes (Fig. 5).PGK1 RNA is not spliced and served as a loading control. Hybridization to probes that specifically recognized intron sequences showed the accumulation of CYH2 and of ACT1pre-mRNA upon galactose-induced overexpression of K512A, D603A, and R808A. Note that galactose-induced overexpression of wild-typePRP22 did not lead to increased levels of pre-mRNA (Fig.5, lane 5). The intron probe also detected the excised intron RNA product of splicing of ACT1, CYH2, and U3 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 5). The excised intron is undetectable under normal circumstances (Fig. 5, lanes 1–5). Exon 2 probes were used to detect mRNA and pre-mRNA of ACT1 and CYH2. Although low levels of unspliced pre-CYH2 RNA were detectable in uninduced cells, the galactose-induced overexpression of K512A, D603A, and R808A resulted in the accumulation of unspliced pre-CYH2 RNA (Fig. 5, lanes 6–8). We conclude that overexpression of nonfunctional Prp22 mutants leads to a pre-mRNA splicing defectin vivo. This defect, which is manifest in increased steady-state levels of pre-mRNA and of excised intron, is probably caused by the inhibition of spliceosome disassembly and subsequent recycling of splicing factors. The DEAH-box ATPase Prp16 is required for the second step of splicing. Prior mutational analysis identified 10 positions in the NTPase motifs at which alanine substitutions abrogated Prp16 functionin vivo (17Hotz H.R. Schwer B. Genetics. 1998; 149: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar). These residues were Gly-378, Lys-379, and Thr-380 in motif I (378GKT); Asp-473 and Glu-474 in motif II (473DEAH); and Gln-685, Arg-686, Gly-688, Arg-689, and Arg-692 in motif VI (685QRSGRAGR). We next assessed the splicing activity of purified recombinant mutant Prp16 proteins in vitro (Fig.6). Yeast extracts immunodepleted of Prp16 catalyzed the first step of splicing of pre-mRNA leading to accumulation of exon 1 and lariat-exon 2 intermediate (11Schwer B. Guthrie C. Nature. 1991; 349: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The pre-formed splicing intermediates could be readily chased into mature RNA upon addition of 50 ng of wild-type Prp16 protein, but mutants G378A, K379A, D473A, E474A, Q685A, G688A, R689A, and R692A were unable to complement the step 2 defect (Fig. 6A). Step 2 complementation correlated with ATPase activity. In the linear range of enzyme dependence, wild-type Prp16 hydrolyzed 270 ATP min−1 in the presence of poly(A) (data not shown). The Prp16 mutants that were nonfunctional in splicing had reduced ATPase activity as follows: G378A (2% of wild type), K379A (9% of wild type), D473A (1% of wild type), E474A (2% of wild type), Q685A (12% of wild type), R689A (4% of wild type), and R692A (24% of wild type) (data not shown). These findings suggest that a threshold level of ATPase activity (≥24% of wild type) is necessary for Prp16 function. However, it is possible that ATPase activity is not sufficient for Prp16 function and that the R692A mutant, which retains 24% of wild-type activity, uncovers an additional requirement for motif VI in splicing. Prp16 mutants S505A and T507A in motif III and H476A in the DEAH-box (motif II) are functional in vivo (17Hotz H.R. Schwer B. Genetics. 1998; 149: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants are of particular interest in light of studies of NPH-II, NS3, and eIF-4A, which suggested that motif III and the DEX(H/D)-box histidine/aspartate are responsible for coupling NTP hydrolysis to RNA unwinding (23Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 24Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4729-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Heilek G.M. Peterson M.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6264-6266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we purified the recombinant H476A, S505A, and T507A proteins and tested their activity in vitro. H476A, S505A, and T507A supported step 2 transesterification in extracts immunodepleted of Prp16 (Fig.6A). H476A, S505A, and T507A displayed 65, 71, and 34% of wild-type ATPase activity, respectively. We conclude that the Ser and Thr hydroxyls of motif III and the His in motif II are not essential for Prp16 function in splicing in vitro, for ATP hydrolysis, or for cell growth. We noted previously that overexpression of lethal Prp16 mutants blocked the growth of wild-type yeast cells (17Hotz H.R. Schwer B. Genetics. 1998; 149: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar). Exogenous K379A mutant protein was shown to inhibit splicing of actin pre-mRNA in whole cell lysates in vitro (26Chanfreau G. Gouyette C. Schwer B. Jacquier A. RNA. 1999; 5: 876-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Here we tested whether other Prp16 mutants that were inactive for splicing would affect splicing step 2 in the presence of wild-type Prp16. Whole cell extract containing endogenous wild-type Prp16 was supplemented with 50 ng of recombinant Prp16. Mature actin mRNA was efficiently generated in unsupplemented mixtures, and additional wild-type Prp16 had no impact on the reaction (Fig.6B). The H476A, S505A, and T507A mutants also had no effect on splicing. However, each of the eight mutant proteins that were nonfunctional in complementing splicing in immunodepleted extracts were inhibitory to splicing in extract containing Prp16. We surmise that the G378A, K379A, D473A, E474A, Q685A, G688A, R689A, and R692A proteins can bind to spliceosomes and thus block the function of wild-type Prp16 intrans. To determine directly whether the Prp16 mutants bind to spliceosomes, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 7). Because wild-typ"

DeFranco D.B. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2007-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) found that Hic-5, a mouse homolog of human ARA55, could also function as a coregulator to increase the transactivation of AR or glucocorticoid receptor and induce cell senescence in fibroblasts (11Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue distribution studies suggest that ARA55 may be differentially expressed during various stages of prostate cancer (12Fujimoto N. Mizokami A. Harada S. Matsumoto T. Urology. 2001; 58: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The detailed physiological role of ARA55 and its potential regulation of prostate cancer progression, however, remain unclear. Early studies showed that various kinase signaling pathways could modulate AR transactivation via phosphorylation of AR at various amino acids (13Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19900-19907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 14Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). For example, the HER2/Neu-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway can phosphorylate AR, increasing its ability to recruit coregulators and enhancing AR transactivation (14Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PI3K/Akt pathway can phosphorylate AR, reducing its ability to recruit coregulators and decreasing AR transactivation (15Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Similar results indicating cross-talk between kinase signaling pathways and other nuclear receptors (NR) to increase NR recruitment of coregulators have been reported including estrogen receptor (16Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) (17Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.L. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 521-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several kinases have been reported to phosphorylate NR coregulators resulting in increased NR transactivation including SRC-1 and SRC-3 (18Rowan B.G. Weigel N.L. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

These findings lead us to hypothesize that some kinases may be able to modulate AR function via phosphorylation of AR coregulators. Using full-length ARA55 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay we found that proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) can interact with ARA55. We subsequently investigated if Pyk2 could modulate AR function via interaction/phosphorylation of ARA55. Pyk2, a member of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family, is a mediator of G-protein-coupled receptors and may be involved in the regulation of the MAP kinase and JNK signal pathways (20Lev S.

The significance of Pyk2 interaction/phosphorylation of ARA55 in prostate cancer progression is currently unclear. Here we demonstrate that Pyk2 is an ARA55-interacting protein that represses AR transactivation via phosphorylation of ARA55. This new signal pathway from Pyk2-ARA55-AR may represent a novel mechanism to modulate AR function in prostate cancer. 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and doxycycline were obtained from Sigma. PDGF-B-chain homodimer (PDGF-BB) and hygromycin B were purchased from Invitrogen. The anti-AR polyclonal antibody, NH27, was produced as described (31Hu S. Yeh Y.C. Rahman M. Lin H.K. Hsu C.L. Ting H.J. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11256-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody for ARA55 (anti-Hic-5) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies for Pyk2 (anti-Pyk2) and phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. His probe (H-3) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The pKH3Pyk2 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Jun-Lin Guan, Cancer Biology Laboratory, Dept. of Molecular Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University. The pEF-PKM expression plasmid (kinase-negative Pyk2) was kindly provided by Dr. Aknori Takaoka, Dept. of Immunology, University of Tokyo, Japan and Dr. Joseph Schlessinger, Dept. of Pharmacology, New York University Medical Center. The PKM cDNA was subcloned into theEcoRI site of the pcDNA4A expression vector. The PC-3(AR)2 cell line was provided by T. J. Brown, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We also constructed ARA55 into the pcDNA4-His, GAL4, and VP16 vectors using the BamHI enzyme. The Pyk2 C terminus (675–1009) that was isolated from the yeast library was constructed into the GAL4 and VP16 vectors. DU145, PC-3, H1299, and MCF-7 human cancer cells, as well as COS-1 monkey kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). PC-3(AR)2 human cancer cells were maintained in RPMI enzyme 1640 containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 10% charcoal-stripped FCS. LNCaP human prostate cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 10% FCS. A CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system (Stratagene) and pMyr plasmid library (Stratagene) consisting of a DNA sequence encoding a myristylation membrane localization signal fused with human prostate and testis cDNAs were used for yeast two-hybrid screening. The pSos vector containing the hSos gene fused with the full-length ARA55 cDNA using the BamHI cloning site served as bait. Expression of the myristylation sequence-tagged target protein is induced by galactose but not glucose and is anchored to the cell membrane. The library was screened by co-transformation of the pSos-ARA55 bait construct into a temperature-sensitive cdc25H yeast strain that cannot grow at 37 °C. Once the bait protein physically interacts with the target protein, the hSos protein is recruited to the membrane activating the Ras signaling pathway and allowing the temperature-sensitive mutant yeast strain to grow at 37 °C. The potential tyrosine kinase target site on wild type ARA55 was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using two primers 5′-GGACCACCTGTTCAGCACGGTATG-3′ and 5′-CATACCGTGCTGAACAGGTGGTCC-3′, substituting phenylalanine for tyrosine at amino acid 43 (Y43F). The mutant ARA55 PCR product was constructed into the pcDNA4A expression vector for the AR transactivation assay and constructed into the GAL4 and VP16 expression vectors for mammalian two-hybrid assay. DU145 cells, an ARA55-negative human prostate cancer cell line, was transfected with pBig or pBig-ARA55 for 24 h using SuperFect (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The cells were then selected using 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (32Strathdee C.A. McLeod M.R. Hall J.R. Gene. 1999; 229: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A single colony was chosen, amplified, and confirmed by reporter gene and Western blotting assay. DU145, H1299, MCF-7, LNCaP, PC-3(AR2), and COS-1 cells were grown in appropriate medium. Transfection was performed by modified calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (33Mizokami A. Yeh S.Y. Chang C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) or by using SuperFect according to the manufacturer's procedure. After incubation for 24 h with charcoal-stripped medium, the medium was changed, and cells were treated with ethanol or DHT for another 24 h and then harvested for the luciferase assay. The MMTV-LUC or PSA-LUC plasmids were used as the reporter genes, and SV40-pRL (Promega) was used as an internal control. The Dual-luciferase reporter 1000 assay system (Promega) was employed to measure LUC activity. Transfections in DU145, H1299, or COS-1 cells were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The cells were transiently co-transfected with the pG5-LUC reporter plasmid and 3.5 μg of both the GAL4 and pVP16-hybrid expression plasmids. The SV40-pRL plasmid was used as an internal control. For the interaction between ARA55 and AR the cells were treated with 10 nm DHT for another 24 h and then harvested for luciferase assays as previously described. H1299 cells were co-transfected with Pyk2 and His-ARA55 expression plasmids by SuperFect. Cells were lysed using radioimmune precipitation buffer (RIPA) following the protocol from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 mm phenylmethlsulfonyl fluoride. Anti-His probe antibody (Santa Cruz) was used to immunoprecipitate the complex from the whole cell lysate. The complex was then resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then blotted with anti-Pyk2. The Pyk2 bands were resolved by an alkaline phosphatase detection kit (Bio-Rad). In the PC-3 whole cell lysate, an anti-Hic-5 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the endogenous ARA55 and Pyk2 complex followed by the previously described procedure. After transfection with various combinations of pcDNA4A-ARA55, pSG5AR, Pyk2, and PKM by SuperFect, H1299 cells were treated with l0 nm DHT for another 24 h and then starved in DMEM with 0.1% FCS and 10 nm DHT for 16 h. The cells were treated with 1.5 nm PDGF-BB and then harvested. His probe was used to precipitate the His-ARA55 and AR complex that was resolved by Western blotting using anti-AR NH27 and anti-Hic-5 antibodies, respectively. For the ARA55 phosphorylation experiment, RIPA was supplemented with 1 mm pyrophosphate, 50 mmsodium fluoride, and 2 mm sodium vanadate. The anti-Hic-5 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate ARA55, and then the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was applied for Western blotting. Full-length ARA55 was used as bait to screen prostate and testis libraries using the CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system. The Pyk2 C-terminal sequence (amino acids 675–1009) was isolated, and its interaction with ARA55 was reconfirmed in a yeast growth assay. When we co-transfected the pSos-ARA55 and pMyr-Pyk2 C terminus plasmids into the temperature-sensitive mutant yeast, cell colonies appeared on both SD/glucose (-UL) agar and SD/galactose (-UL) agar plates at 25 °C and also on SD/(-UL)/galactose agar plates at 37 °C (Fig.1A). Glucose represses the expression of target proteins, preventing yeast growth at 37 °C. Then we constructed ARA55 and the Pyk2 C terminus into both the GAL4 and VP16 vectors and tested their interaction via the mammalian two-hybrid system in various human cell lines. As shown in Fig.1B, GAL4-ARA55 and VP16-Pyk2 C terminus (left panel) and GAL4-Pyk2 C terminus and VP16-ARA55 (right panel) can interact strongly in H1299, DU145, and COS-1 cells. ARA55 also interacts with Pyk2 in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.2A, exogenous Pyk2 can be co-immunoprecipitated with His-ARA55 from H1299 whole cell extracts using an anti-His antibody. In addition, endogenous ARA55 and Pyk2 can be co-immunoprecipitated in PC-3 cells using an anti-Hic-5 antibody, confirming the in vivo interaction of the two proteins (Fig.2B). Together, results from Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate that ARA55 can interact with Pyk2 using various in vitro andin vivo systems in several yeast and mammalian cells. Interestingly, whereas Pyk2 can interact with ARA55, an AR-interacting protein, Pyk2 cannot interact with AR in the same mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3) or co-immunoprecipitation assays (data not shown) suggesting that any effect of Pyk2 on AR activity may require interaction with ARA55.Figure 3Pyk2 interacts with ARA55 but not AR in the mammalian two-hybrid assay. COS-1 and H1299 cells were transiently co-transfected with 3 μg of pG5-LUC reporter plasmid, 10 ng of SV40-pRL internal control plasmid, as well as 3.5 μg of GAL4DBD, VPl6, GAL4-ARA55, GAL4-Pyk2C terminus, or VP16-AR as indicated. 24 h after transfection the cells were treated with 10 nm DHT for another 24 h. The LUC activity of the sample transfected with GAL4DBD and VPI6 was set as 1-fold. All values represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 50 μg of whole cell lysate of each cell line were separated on a SDS-PAGE gel and blotted by anti-Pyk2 and anti-ARA55 antibodies. Pyk2 is almost ubiquitously expressed among these cell lines with the exception of H1299 (Fig. 4). In contrast, ARA55 was only expressed in PC-3, PC-3(AR2), and COS-1 cells (Fig. 4). H1299 cells were then used for further study because of relatively lower expression of both Pyk2 and ARA55. Results from Fig. 4 also offered us the opportunity to study Pyk2 function in ARA55-positive versus -negative cells. To study the potential influence of Pyk2 on AR function via interaction with ARA55, we compared the effect of Pyk2 on AR transactivation in ARA55-negative versus ARA55-positive cells. As shown in Fig.5, whereas Pyk2 can significantly repress AR transactivation in ARA55-positive PC-3(AR)2 cells, Pyk2 has only a marginal effect in LNCaP, MCF-7, and DU145 cells that lack endogenous ARA55. These results further suggest that Pyk2 may suppress AR transactivation through the interaction with ARA55. We then used PC-3(AR2), an ARA55-positive cell line stably transfected with AR to further characterize the effect of Pyk2 on AR transactivation. As shown in Fig. 6, Pyk2 can suppress AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner using the PSA or MMTV promoters linked to the LUC (Fig. 6A) or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter systems (data not shown). In contrast, PKM with a lysine to alanine substitution at amino acid 475 of Pyk2 (20Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) only slightly affected AR transactivation (Fig.6A). To verify that ARA55 is required for Pyk2 to suppress AR activity, we then stably transfected DU145 with ARA55 using a doxycycline-inducible system. As with PC-3(AR2), transfection of Pyk2, ARA55, and AR into parent ARA55-negative DU145 cells resulted in suppression of AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Treatment of the stably transfected pBIG-ARA55 DU145 cells with doxycycline to induce ARA55 expression resulted in enhanced AR transactivation that could be suppressed by the exogenous Pyk2. In contrast, DU145 cells stably transfected with the pBIG vector demonstrated no increased AR activity upon doxycycline treatment and were unaffected by exogenous Pyk2. (Fig. 6B). These results support the essential role of ARA55 in suppression of AR transactivation by Pyk2. Since PKM, a kinase-negative Pyk2 mutant (20Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar), failed to repress AR transactivation, we suspected that Pyk2 may need to phosphorylate ARA55 to suppress AR function. Sequence analysis revealed a potential Pyk2 tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site, HLYST, on ARA55 at amino acids 41–45. We therefore mutated this potential Pyk2 target site to HLFST and tested its effect on the AR transactivation. Results in Fig.7A demonstrate that PDGF-induced Pyk2 can enhance the tyrosine phosphorylation of ARA55(lane 3 versus lane 2) in vivo. In contrast, PDGF-induced Pyk2 only marginally increased the phosphorylation of mutant ARA55 (lane 4 versus lane 3). As shown in Fig. 7B wild type ARA55 alone, but not Pyk2, enhances AR transactivation (lanes 4 versus 2 and lanes 3 versus 2, respectively), but addition of Pyk2 suppresses the ARA55-enhanced AR transactivation (lane 5 versus lane 4). Interestingly, the mutant ARA55, like wild type ARA55, enhances AR transactivation (lane 6 versus lane 2), but addition of Pyk2 only marginally suppresses mutant ARA55-induced AR transactivation (lane 6 versus lane 7). The data from Fig. 7,A and B demonstrate that Pyk2 enhances the phosphorylation of ARA55 at residue 43 to suppress AR transactivation. Pyk2 may also inhibit ARA55-induced AR transactivation by blocking the interaction between AR and ARA55 or by sequestering ARA55 away from AR. Results from the mammalian two-hybrid assay in H1299 cells show that wild type Pyk2, but not kinase-negative PKM, can block the interaction between AR and ARA55 (Fig.8A). Interestingly, the interaction between AR and the Y43F ARA55 mutant can only be partially blocked by either Pyk2 or PKM. We then used co-immunoprecipitation to verify the ability of Pyk2 to block the interaction between AR and ARA55 in H1299 cells. As shown in Fig. 8B, anti-His antibody precipitates the complex containing AR and wild type or mutated ARA55. Addition of Pyk2 in the presence of PDGF, a growth factor that activates Pyk2, can then block the interaction between AR and wild type ARA55 but not the interaction between AR and mutated ARA55 (lanes 3 and 4 versus lanes 7 and 8). PKM only slightly blocks the interaction between AR and ARA55 (lanes 5 and6). Results from both the mammalian two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that Pyk2, but not kinase-negative PKM, can block the interaction between AR and wild type ARA55. Cross-talk between various kinase signals and the androgen/AR pathway has been well documented. The phosphorylation of AR co-regulators to modulate AR transactivation, however, is currently unclear. Pyk2 is an important tyrosine kinase that can be induced by various extracellular stimuli (24Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S.

Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The linkage from the Pyk2 pathway to NR transactivation, however, remains largely unknown. Here we provide evidence demonstrating that Pyk2 can interact with and phosphorylate ARA55 to suppress AR transactivation. This finding may represent a new mechanism to modulate AR function and supports the role of ARA55 as an AR co-regulator (6Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Tissue distribution analysis indicates that ARA55 is differentially expressed in various stages of prostate cancer (6Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 12Fujimoto N. Mizokami A. Harada S. Matsumoto T.

These findings, in addition to our data showing that ARA55 and Pyk2 modulate AR function, suggest that the regulation of AR function may be altered in prostate cancer by changes in Pyk2 and ARA55 expression. The significance of these alterations in the progression of prostate cancer from androgen dependence to androgen independence, however, has yet to be determined. Results from Figs. 5 and 6 clearly demonstrate that Pyk2 needs ARA55 to suppress AR function. Pyk2, a tyrosine kinase linked to the MAPK and JNK signaling pathways and thereby the regulation of cell growth and adhesion, may also utilize non-ARA55-mediated pathways to exert its physiological functions. The discovery of new pathways that cross-talk with Pyk2→ARA55→AR signaling may therefore expand the importance of Pyk2 in the control of prostate cancer growth. The inability of PKM to suppress AR function via wild type ARA55 and the inability of Pyk2 to suppress AR function via mutated ARA55 suggests that the Pyk2 phosphorylation of ARA55 at residue 43 is critical in the suppression of AR function. Since this phosphorylation site is not located in the AR interaction domain of ARA55, amino acids (251–444) (6Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), it is possible that other mechanisms may also be involved in the suppression of AR function by Pyk2-ARA55. Nevertheless, our mammalian two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays indicate that Pyk2 blocks the interaction between AR and ARA55. Therefore, it is possible that Pyk2 may have multiple ways to communicate with ARA55 to suppress AR transactivation. In summary, Pyk2 can dramatically repress AR transactivation by inhibiting the coregulatory activity of ARA55. This interruption may entail both the direct phosphorylation of ARA55 to impair its coregulatory activity and/or sequestering ARA55 to reduce its interaction with AR. Our findings not only expand the role of Pyk2 in AR-mediated prostate cancer growth but also support the importance of ARA55 in the control of AR function. We thank Drs. Jun-Lin Guan, Aknori Takaoka, and Joseph Schlessinger for valuable plasmids and Dr. T. J. Brown for the PC-3(AR2) cell line. We also thank Karen Wolf for manuscript preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2052365987,"We have isolated a novel secreted dorsalizing factor of the neural tube, Xenopus Tiarin, which belongs to the olfactomedin-related family. Tiarin expression starts at the late gastrula stage in the nonneural ectoderm adjacent to the anterior neural plate. Overexpression of Tiarin in the embryo causes expansion of dorsal neural markers and suppression of ventral markers. In the eye-forming field, Tiarin overexpression induces the retinal markers and represses optic stalk markers. Tiarin directly dorsalizes neural tissues in the absence of mesodermal tissues and antagonizes the ventralizing activity of Sonic hedghog (Shh). Unlike BMP4, another dorsalizing factor, Tiarin does not display antineuralizing activity on the ectoderm or mesoderm-ventralizing activity. These findings show that Tiarin is a novel patterning signal candidate acting in the specification of the dorsal neural tube."

K215RGRK6 expression inhibited methacholine-stimulated M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation by 50% compared with plasmid transfected control cells. Guanosine-5′-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate binding and immunoprecipitation studies, conducted after agonist pretreatment (3 min), indicated that M3 mACh receptor-Gαq/11 uncoupling was attenuated by 50% in cells expressing K215RGRK6 when compared with control cells. In contrast, expression of the related dominant-negative kinaseK215RGRK5 had no effect on M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation or uncoupling.

However, agonist-stimulated receptor phosphorylation by either CK1α or PKC does not appear to mediate rapid desensitization of the M3 mACh receptor (10Willars G.B. Muller-Esterl W. Nahorski S.R. Am.

Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More recently, we have examined the potential involvement of GRKs in the desensitization of the M3 mACh receptor endogenously expressed in the SH-SY5Y cell line (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This human neuroblastoma expresses GRKs 3 and 6, and overexpression of GRK3 and GRK6 leads to enhanced M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation and reduced activation of phospholipase C (PLC). However, only GRK6 overexpression enhanced uncoupling of the receptor from Gαq/11 assessed by a [35S]GTPγS binding/immunoprecipitation protocol. In contrast, only GRK3 overexpression suppressed AlF4− activation of PLC (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data strongly support an action of GRK3 independent of phosphorylation, possibly via direct binding to activated Gαq/11 and/or free Gβγ subunits, but highlight a potential role for GRK6 via receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling of Gαq/11. Although GRK6 overexpression can be shown to enhance the M3mACh receptor desensitization process in SH-SY5Y cells, this experimental approach is unable to resolve whether endogenous GRK6 contributes to M3 mACh receptor regulation. Therefore, in an attempt to block the actions of endogenous GRK6, we have introduced a kinase-dead, dominant-negative mutant form of GRK6, created by introducing a K215R point mutation into the ATP-binding domain, into SH-SY5Y cells to create cell lines stably expressing this construct. Using this approach we have shown that K215RGRK6 expression inhibits the phosphorylation and subsequent desensitization of the M3 mACh receptor. Our data suggest that GRK6 plays a significant role in the desensitization of the endogenously expressed M3 mACh receptor in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal and 5% new born calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (2.5 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). All of the cells were maintained at 37 °C in humidified conditions under 5% CO2. Wild-type SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 alone or human dominant-negative GRK5 or GRK6, both with a single point mutation at K215R, cloned into pcDNA3 at BamHI andXbaI, or EcoRI for GRKs 5 (14Tiruppathi C. Yan W. Sandoval R. Naqvi T. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kelly, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK), using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h, geneticin (300 μg/ml) was added to the cells. The surviving colonies were selected and expanded into cell lines. The cells were lysed and subjected to electrophoretic separation exactly as described previously (15Mundell S.J. Luty J.S. Willets J.M. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Willets J.M. Kelly E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 431: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The separated protein was transferred to nitrocellulose, and GRK expression was detected using anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies (1:1000 dilution) specific for GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, or GRK6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Gαq/11 expression was detected using an anti-rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). CK1α was detected using an anti-rabbit polyclonal as described previously (12Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19667-19675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Protein expression was determined by the addition of ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions and exposure to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). The Bmax andKd values were determined byN-methyl-[3H]scopolamine ([3H]NMS; Amersham Biosciences) saturation binding analysis of SH-SY5Y cell monolayers grown to confluence in 24-well plates as described previously (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). M3 mACh receptor internalization was assessed after treatment with either vehicle or methacholine (100 μm) for 0–60 min at 37 °C, prior to intensive washing (four times with 1 ml of ice-cold Krebs buffer, pH 7.4). [3H]NMS-binding sites were determined as above using a single saturating concentration (5 nm) of [3H]NMS for 18 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of excess atropine (20 μm). Receptor internalization was determined as the percentage of loss of specific [3H]NMS-binding sites after methacholine treatment when compared with vehicle-treated controls. The effect ofK215RGRK6 and K215RGRK5 expression on the phosphorylation of endogenously expressed M3 muscarinic receptors was assessed by the method of Tobin and Nahorski (9Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, either plasmid control or cells expressing eitherK215RGRK6 or K215RGRK5 were seeded into 6-well culture plates. Confluent cells were loaded with [32P]orthophosphate (5 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-free Krebs buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h prior to agonist challenge (methacholine, 100 μm). After 3 min, the agonist was removed, and the cells were solubilized, immunoprecipitated, and electrophoretically resolved as described previously (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were documented and quantified using the GeneGenius system and software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Any potential kinase activity of dominant-negative GRK5 and GRK6 was assessed by measuring their ability to phosphorylate the substrate α-casein as described previously (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Either plasmid control or cells expressingK215RGRK5 or K215RGRK6 were seeded into 24-well plates at ∼50% confluency. After 24 h, the cells were incubated in the presence of [3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) in geneticin-free medium for a further 24 h. Confluent cell monolayers were then washed twice with Krebs buffer (118.6 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 11.7 mm glucose, and 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. LiCl (final concentration, 10 mm) was added to each well for 10 min prior to the addition of methacholine. Reaction termination, sample neutralization, and separation of the [3H]inositol phosphate fraction (containing inositol mono-, bis-, and tris-phosphates) were performed as described previously (17Challiss R.A.J. Jenkinson S. Mistry R. Batty I.H. Nahorski S.R. Neuroprotocols. 1993; 3: 135-144Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Plasmid control or dominant-negative GRK-expressing cells were grown in 80-cm2cell culture flasks until confluent. The cells were then harvested in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2% (v/v) EDTA, 0.9% (v/v) NaCl. After centrifugation the cells were resuspended in Krebs buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 15 min prior to the addition of either vehicle or MCh (100 μm). After 3 min, excess ice-cold Krebs buffer (50 ml) was added, and the cells were pelleted at 1000 ×g for 5 min. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA and homogenized at maximum speed for 30 s using a PT210 Polytron. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA and centrifuged for a further 15 min at 20,000 × g. The resulting pellet was resuspended at 1 mg/ml of protein and stored at −80 °C until required. [35S]GTPγS binding and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (18Barr A.J. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 2223-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 19Akam E.C. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of membranes were added to 1 nm [35S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 μm GDP, 100 μm ±methacholine in assay buffer (100 mmHEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated for 2 min at 30 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 μm GTPγS. Termination, solubilization, and Gαq/11-specific immunoprecipitation were performed exactly as described previously (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Desensitization was determined as a reduction in [35S]GTPγS binding after pretreatment with methacholine and expressed as a percentage of the response found when compared with a nonpretreated matched control. In addition to desensitization experiments, M3 mACh receptor activation of Gαq/11 was assessed in nonpretreated cell membranes via generation of methacholine (300 nm to 1 mm) concentration-response curves. All concentration-response curves were fitted, and the EC50 values were determined using nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism 3). All data were analyzed using one- or two-way analysis of variance (Microsoft Excel version 5). Significance was accepted when p < 0.05. Transfection of wild-type SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with either K215RGRK6 or K215RGRK5 and selection with geneticin (300 μg/ml) yielded several surviving colonies, which were expanded into cell lines. Two clones that expressedK215RGRK6 and that were matched with plasmid controls for receptor number based on [3H]NMS binding were selected for further study (named D1 and D5; Fig.1A). Estimation of the level of K215RGRK6 expression was determined by serial dilution of cell lysates and subsequent Western blotting, indicating ∼30-fold greater levels than endogenous GRK6 expression (data not shown). In an attempt to examine the specificity of the effects ofK215RGRK6, a single clone expressing the closely relatedK215RGRK5 (D2; Fig. 1B) was chosen for some experiments. The level of overexpression of K215RGRK5 was difficult to assess because there was no detectable endogenous GRK5 in SH-SY5Y cells. To determine whether K215RGRK6 lacked kinase activity (i.e. was kinase-dead), HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector, GFP-tagged wt-GRK6, or GFP-tagged K215RGRK6. After 48 h the kinases were immunoprecipitated with either GFP polyclonal or wt-GRK6 antibodies. Kinase activity was assessed by addition of dephosphorylated α-casein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). No phosphorylation of α-casein was detected after transfection with empty vector, followed by immunoprecipitation with GFP antibody (Fig. 1C). As expected, enhanced α-casein phosphorylation was detected after transfection of GFP-tagged GRK6. Furthermore, a slight phosphorylation of α-casein was detected after immunoprecipitation of endogenously expressed GRK6 from nontransfected HEK293 cells. In contrast, α-casein phosphorylation was not evident in the presence ofK215RGRK6. In an attempt to determine whether overexpression of K215RGRK5 orK215RGRK6 altered the expression of other endogenously expressed kinases, we first blotted all the clones used in this study for GRKs 2, 3, 5, and 6, as well as CK1α (Fig.2). Overexpression ofK215RGRK5 had no effect on the expression of any of the kinases studied. Furthermore, K215RGRK6 overexpression had no effect on GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, or CK1α expression in any of the cell lines. However, it was not possible to assess whetherK215RGRK6 altered the expression of endogenous GRK6 because both K215RGRK6 and wild-type GRK6 are not distinguishable with the antibody used (Fig. 2D). Whole cell binding studies were undertaken using [3H]NMS to determine whether expression of dominant-negative constructs affected M3 mACh receptor expression. The data obtained for Bmax and KD indicated that expression of either K215RGRK6 or K215RGRK5 had no significant effect on M3 mACh receptor expression (TableI). Moreover, receptor expression levels did not alter with passage (data not shown).Table IWhole cell [3H]NMS saturation binding to determine M3mACh receptor expression in plasmid control, K215RGRK6, andK215RGRK5 expressing clonesCloneBmaxKD(fmol/mg protein)(nM)P1138 ± 150.16 ± 0.02P3137 ± 90.22 ± 0.05D1144 ± 90.16 ± 0.02D5127 ± 60.22 ± 0.03D2150 ± 110.21 ± 0.03The Bmax and KD values were determined using nonlinear regression analysis and curve-fitting programs of GraphPad Prism 3.

The effects ofK215RGRK6 expression on methacholine-stimulated (100 μm) M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation was examined in clones D1 and D5. As shown in Fig.3 (A and B), after 3 min of agonist exposure a robust phosphorylation was observed in the plasmid control cell lines (P1 and P3). In contrast, M3mACh receptor phosphorylation was reduced by ∼50% in cells expressing K215RGRK6. Furthermore, expression ofK215RGRK5 had no effect on agonist-stimulated M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Densitometric analysis confirmed that K215RGRK6 had no effect on basal M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation. However,K215RGRK6 significantly (p < 0.01) reduced agonist-stimulated M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation by 50 and 43% for D1 compared with P3 and for D5 compared with P1 clones, respectively (Fig. 4). Furthermore, expression of K215RGRK6 did not affect PKC-mediated M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation stimulated by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (1 μm, 3 min; Fig.3D).Figure 4Analysis of the effects ofK215RGRK6 expression on MCh-stimulated M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation in two clones (D1 and D5).

Thus, we have used agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding followed by immunoprecipitation of Gαq/11 in a membrane preparation (see “Experimental Procedures”). First, we assessed whether expression of K215RGRK6 had any effects on acute M3 mACh receptor-Gαq/11interaction. Concentration-response curves in membranes from nonpretreated K215RGRK6-expressing clones, undertaken at 2 min, the optimal time point for M3 mACh receptor-Gαq/11 activation (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Akam E.C. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), showed binding identical to that seen in controls (Fig.5A). However, as described previously (11Bundey R.A. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), pretreatment of intact cells with MCh (100 μm) for 3 min leads to reduced agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to immunoprecipitated Gαq/11 in the subsequent membrane assay (Fig.5B). Plasmid control cells (P1 and P3) showed 59 (D1versus P3) and 46% (D5 versus P1) less M3 mACh receptor-Gαq/11 coupling when compared with nonpretreated controls. In contrast, the degree of receptor-Gαq/11 uncoupling was inhibited by 50% withK215RGRK6 expression (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, despite agonist pretreatment, expression of K215RGRK5 had no effect on M3 mACh receptor-Gαq/11uncoupling (Fig. 5B). These effects were not due to a loss of membrane-associated Gαq/11 because total Gαq/11 immunoreactivity in the membrane fraction was unaltered after 3 min of pretreatment (Fig. 5C). To further study the effects of GRK6 on M3 mACh receptor regulation, we examined the effects of K215RGRK6 on PLC activity using total [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation. Time course studies indicated that clones expressing K215RGRK6 produced significantly (p < 0.01) greater [3H]inositol phosphate accumulations than plasmid controls matched for receptor number (Fig.6, A and B). In addition, concentration-response curves to MCh produced after 3 min indicate that expression of K215RGRK6 enhanced [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation when compared with plasmid control cells (Fig. 7). Interestingly, expression of the structurally similar dominant-negative kinase K215RGRK5 had no effect on [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation (Fig. 6C). In addition, [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation was similar in all clones after direct stimulation of Gαq/11with AlF4− for 20 min (P3, 2873 ± 44; D1, 3121 ± 147; P1, 2754 ± 133; and D5, 3617 ± 768 dpm ± S.E., after subtraction of basal values for three separate experiments).Figure 7Methacholine concentration-response curves in plasmid control or cells expressing either K215RGRK6 or GRK6.

Subsequent [3H]NMS binding revealed that overexpression of GRK6 had no effect on M3 mACh receptor internalization. Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous GRK6 with K215RGRK6 failed to inhibit M3 mACh receptor internalization (Fig.8). We have recently shown that recombinant GRK6 can enhance both M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation and receptor/Gαq/11 uncoupling, subsequently increasing desensitization of the endogenously expressed M3 mACh receptor in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data are suggestive of a role for endogenous GRK6 in the regulation of M3 mACh receptor desensitization. Therefore, in an attempt to block the action of endogenously expressed GRK6 in SH-SY5Y cells, we have introduced a kinase-dead, dominant-negative mutant,K215RGRK6. Our data show for the first time the potential role of endogenous GRK6 in the regulation of an endogenously expressed Gαq/11-coupled receptor. Despite the many studies indicating that GRKs are able to enhance the phosphorylation of overexpressed receptors (reviewed in Ref. 1Bunemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), relatively few have examined the role of endogenous GRK6 activity in the regulation of endogenously expressed receptors. Introduction of antisense GRK6 oligonucleotides inhibited desensitization of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor stably expressed in HEK293 cells (20Aiyar N. Disa J. Dang K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Nambi P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 403: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, several recent studies have reported the use of differing versions of dominant-negative GRK6 and have provided conflicting evidence as to their effectiveness in inhibiting endogenous GRK6. Lazari et al. (21Lazari M. Liu X. Nakamura K. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 866-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were able to inhibit endogenous GRK6 phosphorylation of follitrophin receptors in HEK293 cells by introducing a double point-mutated GRK6 (K215M/K216M). Zhou et al. (22Zhou H. Yan F. Tai H.-H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 1243-1251PubMed Google Scholar) introduced a triple point-mutated (R215K/D484S/D485S) dominant-negative GRK6 that reduced agonist-stimulated thomboxane A2 receptor phosphorylation when compared with equivalent overexpression of GRK6 (22Zhou H. Yan F. Tai H.-H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 1243-1251PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike the present data, where we show a 50% reduction in agonist-stimulated M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation with expression of K215RGRK6, the action of endogenous GRK6 appeared not to be inhibited by this dominant-negative (R215K/D484S/D485SGRK6) (22Zhou H. Yan F. Tai H.-H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 1243-1251PubMed Google Scholar). In view of these findings we chose to determine the catalytic activity of our dominant-negative GRK6 using immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged GRK6 orK215RGRK6 and α-casein as substrate. These studies indicated that unlike wt-GRK6, K215RGRK6 was devoid of α-casein phosphorylating activity. The finding that certain GRKs can mediate inhibition of PLC activity via nonreceptor phosphorylation mechanisms (23Carman C.V. Parent J.-L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedergaertner P.B.

De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) cautions against the use of dominant-negative GRKs. However, the ability of GRK2 and GRK3 to directly bind to activated, GTP-bound Gαq/11 via their N-terminal RGS domain is not seen with GRK5 and GRK6 (23Carman C.V. Parent J.-L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N.

D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, direct stimulation of PLC via activation of G proteins using AlF4−, which is inhibited by GRK3 overexpression, was unaffected by either wt-GRK6 (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) orK215RGRK6. Nevertheless, to further examine the specificity of K215RGRK6 to inhibit M3 mACh receptor desensitization, we introduced the dominant-negative version of GRK5 (K215RGRK5). Interestingly, despite the close structural similarities between GRK5 and GRK6 (83.5% amino acid similarity for human forms of GRK5 and GRK6) (2Sterne-Marr R. Benovic J.L. Vitam. Horm. 1996; 51: 193-234Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), K215RGRK5 did not affect M3 mACh receptor signaling. This might seem surprising because both GRK5 and GRK6 are membrane-associated and thought to be regulated in a similar manner, i.e. negatively by calmodulin (25Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and positively through phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate binding (26Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence from GRK5 knockout mice suggests that GRK5 regulates many muscarinic responses attributable to M2 receptors in vivo (27Gainetdinov R.R. Bohn L.M. Walker J.K. Laporte S.A. Macrae A.D. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. Neuron. 1999; 24: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is possible that the lack of effect of K215RGRK5 on M3 mACh receptor signaling in SH-SY5Y cells may reflect a lack of wt-GRK5. Although we were unable to detect endogenous GRK5 by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation studies from plasmid control SH-SY5Y cells indicated the presence of a GRK5 immunoprecipitable protein able to phosphorylate α-casein (data not shown). However, if the M3 mACh receptor was able to recruit GRK5, one might expectK215RGRK5 to block access of similar kinases to the receptor after agonist stimulation. The absence of this finding, combined with the inhibition of M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation by K215RGRK6, suggests that the recruitment signals for GRK5 or GRK6 are likely to be different even for these closely related kinases. It is also of interest that phosphorylation of the M3 mACh receptor by direct stimulation of PKC (by PDBu) was unaltered by the expression of K215RGRK6. All of these data imply that K215RGRK6-mediated inhibition of M3 mACh phosphorylation is not due to a nonspecific physical association of receptor and kinase but requires the specific recruitment of GRK6 by the receptor after agonist activation. Because GRK6 appears to regulate M3 mACh receptor desensitization, it is interesting to speculate which phosphoacceptor sites GRK6 may phosphorylate. Despite the wealth of studies implicating GRK involvement in receptor desensitization, no consensus sequence has been agreed for GRK phosphorylation (3Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Recent evidence examining the phosphorylation profile of the B2 bradykinin receptor has indicated that GRK (2, 3, 5 or 6) phosphorylation is limited to three distinct serines situated in the C-terminal tail (33Blaukat A. Pizard A. Breit A. Wernstedt C. Alhenec-Gelas F. Muller-Esterl W. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40431-40440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Closer examination of the individual serine moieties highlighted distinct phosphorylation patterns between GRKs, raising the possibility that different GRKs may regulate different receptor signaling mechanisms. These data suggest that GRK6 and GRK2 M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation sites may not be mutually exclusive but that phosphorylation patterns may differ both temporally and positionally. However, it is also noteworthy that unlike for the bradykinin B2 receptor, determination of M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation patterns is potentially much more complex because of the presence of 36 serine and 16 threonine residues within the third intracellular loop alone. Nevertheless, we have previously shown that although GRK3 and GRK6 enhance M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation, only GRK6 mediates uncoupling of the receptor from Gαq/11 (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous GRK6 with a 30-fold excess of K215RGRK6 only produced a 50% decrease in M3 receptor phosphorylation and Gαq/11 uncoupling. This finding could suggest either that increasing K215RGRK6 overexpression may further inhibit M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation and Gαq/11uncoupling or more likely that other kinases such as GRK2 or 3 may contribute to M3 mACh receptor desensitization in SH-SY5Y cells. Many studies have reported that GRK overexpression not only leads to enhanced desensitization but also accelerated internalization of receptors (reviewed in Refs. 1Bunemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and 3Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). The present data indicate that although GRK6 is capable of desensitizing the M3 mACh receptor, it appears not to play a significant role in receptor internalization. This finding may appear surprising, but for some receptors kinase-mediated phosphorylation does not always enhance receptor internalization. Indeed, in agreement with our data, Lazariet al. (21Lazari M. Liu X. Nakamura K. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 866-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) found that although dominant-negative GRK2 or GRK6 are equally capable of inhibiting follitropin receptor phosphorylation, only inhibition of GRK2-mediated phosphorylation prevents receptor internalization. Moreover, our data suggest that the potential pattern of phosphoacceptor sites that mediate M3mACh desensitization and internalization may be different. The presence of GRK2, GRK3, CK1α, and PKCs in SH-SY5Y cells and their ability to phosphorylate the M3 mACh receptor (10Willars G.B. Muller-Esterl W. Nahorski S.R. Am. J.

Indeed, recent preliminary studies have shown that dominant-negative CK1α inhibits M1 receptor internalization when concurrently overexpressed in HEK293 cells (34Kellerbauer A. Krudewig R. Langer B. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363 (suppl.): 72Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that overexpression of GRK3 in SH-SY5Y cells (13Willets J.M. Challiss R.A.J. Kelly E. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and others have reported that GRK2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells (35Tsuga H. Okuno E. Kameyama K. Haga T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 1218-1226PubMed Google Scholar) enhanced M3 mACh receptor internalization. It will be interesting to examine which of these kinases plays a role in the internalization of the endogenously expressed M3 mACh receptor in SH-SY5Y cells and whether this is crucial for recruitment of adaptor proteins and initiating alternative signaling cascades. In conclusion we have examined the potential role of endogenously expressed GRK6 in the desensitization of M3 mACh receptors in the human SH-SY5Y cell line. Introduction of a dominant-negative, catalytically inactive GRK6 (K215RGRK6) inhibited both agonist-stimulated M3 mACh receptor phosphorylation and receptor/Gαq/11 uncoupling. Furthermore,K215RGRK6 expression partially reversed the time-related decay of agonist activation of PLC. In contrast, the closely relatedK215RGRK5 was unable to affect M3 mACh signaling in any way. Despite the obvious effects of GRK6 on M3 mACh receptor PLC-coupled signaling, manipulation of GRK6 activity had no effect on receptor internalization. Overall these data suggest that endogenous GRK6 regulates, at least in part, M3 mACh receptor desensitization in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.

Here we present structure-function characterizations of these polymorphisms at physiological pH (7.4) and at an acidic pH (6.8) that would be encountered during stress such as renal, respiratory, or heart failure. Through a series of competition binding and G-protein activation assays (measured by cAMP production), we determined that the V25M polymorph exhibited agonist binding and G-protein activation similar to wild-type receptor at normal pH (7.4). However, the R212H variant demonstrated a significant decrease in binding affinity at lower pH (R212H at pH 7.4,Ki = 2.2 ± 1.2 nm; pH 6.8Ki = 45.6 ± 12.0 nm).

This study provides the mechanistic basis for further research into genetic risk factors and pharmacogenetics of cardiovascular disease associated with hIP. human prostacyclin receptor transmembrane domain single nucleotide polymorphism Similar to other prostanoids, prostacyclin is a derivative of the C-20 unsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid), and its cellular action is conveyed through cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors that predominantly couple to the heterotrimeric G-protein Gs stimulating the production of cAMP (1Kobayashi T. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24294-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The human prostacyclin receptor (hIP)1 is expressed on platelets, where it mediates inhibition of platelet aggregation and on vascular smooth muscle cells, where it mediates vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Dysfunctional prostacyclin activity has been implicated in the development of a number of cardiovascular diseases including thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis, and systemic and pulmonary hypertension (2Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Accordingly, IP receptor knock-out mice exhibit increased thrombosis and reduced inflammatory and pain responses (3Murata T. Ushikubi F. Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Yamasaki A. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Aze Y. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Ueno A. Oh-ishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 388: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Limited studies have begun to identify generalized regions within the IP and other prostanoid receptors that appear crucial for ligand-binding specificity and affinity. Studies using chimeric combinations of mouse prostaglandin D (mDP) and prostaglandin I (mIP) receptors have shown that protein segments within transmembrane domains VI and VII (TMVI and TMVII) are involved in distinct binding interactions with prostacyclin side chains. In addition, TMI (along with a portion of the first extracellular loop) confers broader binding functions, incorporating recognition and interaction with the cyclopentane ring of prostacyclin (1Kobayashi T. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24294-24303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Kobayashi T. Kiriyama M. Hirata T. Hirata M. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S.

Glycosylation at Asn-17 and Asn-78 in the extracellular domain (see Fig. 1), has also been demonstrated to be essential for proper binding and G-protein activation (5Zhang Z. Austin S.C. Smyth E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 480-487PubMed Google Scholar). As observed with other G-protein-coupled receptors, genetic variants of the hIP receptor may act as predisposing and/or modifying factors for disease states or therapeutic response. In this investigation, we have undertaken a functional analysis of the first polymorphisms identified in the coding region of the hIP receptor, recently identified in the SNP database (6Sherry S.T. Ward M. Sirotkin K. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 677-679PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of this study is to determine the effects of these polymorphisms on agonist binding and G-protein activation at physiologic and pathological pH levels. Our results indicate that the V25M polymorph had no significant effects on agonist binding or Gs activation, functioning in a manner consistent with the wild-type hIP. In contrast, the R212H polymorph showed a significant decrease in signal transduction activation, requiring a 6-fold increase of agonist to elicit a wild-type-like response at both pH 7.4 and 6.8. Furthermore, under acidotic conditions (pH 6.8), a defect in binding was also observed for R212H. Iloprost ligands, radiolabeled [3H]iloprost (17.0 Ci/mmol), and non-radiolabeled iloprost as well as the cAMP radioimmunoassay system were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The hIP cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Mark Abramovitz (Merck Frosst, Quebec, Canada). Human IP cDNA was cloned along with a C-terminal 1D4 epitope tag (native nine C-terminal amino acids from rhodopsin) into the pMT4 expression vector. Point mutations were generated using conventional methods of PCR mutagenesis as previously described (7Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotide primers were designed extending 10–12 nucleotides 3′ and 5′ from the desired mutation sites (V25 or R212). All mutant constructs were confirmed via PCR DNA dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing (Dartmouth Medical School Molecular Biology Core Facility). Transient transfections of COS-1 cells were performed initially at a DNA concentration of 2.0 μg/ml followed by decreasing concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.05, and 0.025 μg/ml using diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-Dextran; Sigma) as previously described (7Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Preparations of COS-1 cell membranes were carried out as follows. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping. Subsequent washes in 0.25m sucrose solution were followed by vigorous vortexing (providing shear forces) for 3 min. A low speed spin (∼1,260 ×g) was performed for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected. After a high speed centrifugation (∼30,000 ×g for 15 min) the pellet was washed twice in 1× HEM (20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EGTA, and 12.5 mm MgCl2) followed by resuspension in 1× HEM containing 10% glycerol and was stored at −70 °C. A Bradford protein assay was performed to quantitate membrane proteins. Ligand-binding characteristics for the expressed receptors were determined through a series of competition binding assays using radiolabeled [3H]iloprost (fixed concentration), an IP receptor-specific agonist, versusnon-radiolabeled iloprost (varied concentrations). Mock transfected COS-1 cell membranes revealed no specific binding to iloprost. 2J. Stitham, A. Stojanovic, and J. Hwa, unpublished data. Reaction mixtures (performed in duplicate) contained 50 μg of membrane, 1× HEM buffer (pH 7.4, 6.8, and 5.9), 15 nm [3H]iloprost, and one of 12 different concentrations (10 μm to 0.1 nm) of cold (non-radiolabeled) iloprost. After a 1.5-h incubation at 4 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and the reaction mixture was filtered onto Whatman® GF/C glass fiber filters using a Brandel® cell harvester. The filters were washed five times with ice-cold Tris/HCl buffer, and radioactivity remaining on the filter paper (trapped membranes) was measured in the presence of 5 ml of Liquiscint™ scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of a 500-fold excess of non-radiolabeled iloprost, whereas the concentration of [3H]iloprost was varied from 1 to 100 nm for saturation binding studies. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism® software. IC50values were converted to Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, and Ki values were expressed as means ± S.E. An analysis of variance (post-test Newman-Keuls) and Student’st tests were used to determine statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). The wild-type hIP with the epitope tag hIP1D4 and mutant constructs were analyzed for signal transduction capabilities. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 2.0 μg/ml receptor DNA in 25-mm plates as described above. After 72 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline plus 4 mm EDTA and 2 mm IBMX (Sigma) (pH 7.4, 6.8, or 5.9) and incubated at 20 °C for 10 min. This was followed by addition of defined concentrations of iloprost to selected plates. Dose-response curves were determined by the addition of six different concentrations (1 μm to 10 pm) in duplicate. After 20 min, the cells were harvested and boiled for 3 min, followed by high speed (10,000 rpm) centrifugation. Fifty microliters of the resultant supernatant (a total of 300 μl) was used to determine cAMP production in the competition assay. cAMP levels were measured using the radio-receptor competition assay (Amersham Biosciences). In brief, [3H]cAMP was used in competition for a cAMP-binding protein against known concentrations of non-radiolabeled cAMP, followed by determination of the unknowns. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C. Charcoal was used to remove excess unbound cAMP. Samples were counted in 5 ml of Liquiscint™(National Diagnostics). Results were analyzed with GraphPad Prism® software. Mean ± S.E. was calculated for basal and maximal cAMP production. For the dose response, a non-linear, curve-fitting program (GraphPad Prism®) was used, and the EC50 was determined for wild-type hIP1D4 and mutant constructs. An analysis of variance (post test Newman-Keuls) and Student’s t tests were used to determine statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Two polymorphisms in the coding region of the hIP were recently identified and appeared on the SNP database (6Sherry S.T. Ward M. Sirotkin K. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 677-679PubMed Google Scholar). Using PCR mutagenesis we have reproduced these polymorphisms, V25M and R212H (Fig.1). The overall goal of our study was to determine whether these naturally occurring mutations would modify hIP receptor function. In particular, we analyzed binding of the high-affinity agonist iloprost (a stable derivative of the native hIP ligand prostacyclin), activation of the native Gs pathway, and cell surface expression of the receptor. Receptor binding was initially evaluated at physiological pH 7.4 with iloprost, a stable high-affinity analogue of prostacyclin. No significant difference was detected in theKi values for wild-type hIP1D4, V25M, or R212H (Table I). All binding curves were best fit by a one-site model. Thus, iloprost binding for both polymorphism mutants remained unaffected as compared with the wild-type hIP1D4 receptor. Saturation binding performed on the three constructs showed expression levels of 1.8 ± 0.3 pmol/mg membrane protein for the hIP1D4 (n = 3) and 1.5 ± 0.4 pmol/mg membrane protein for the V25M (n = 3). However, the R212H expressed significantly (p < 0.05) lower (0.8 ± 0.2 pmol/mg membrane protein; n = 3) than the hIP1D4.Table ILigand binding studies for hIP1D4, V25M, and R212H under different pH conditionsKipH 7.4pH 6.8pH 5.9nmhIP1D45.9 ± 1.9 (6)1-aNumber in parentheses is the number of experiments (n).7.1 ± 3.2 (4)7.3 ± 3.0 (3)V25M6.1 ± 2.3 (4)6.8 ± 3.6 (4)10.3 ± 3.1 (5)R212H2.2 ± 1.2 (4)45.6 ± 12.0 (5)1-bp < 0.05.33.7 ± 7.7 (4)1-bp < 0.05.Shown are Ki ± S.E.

Unpaired Student’s t tests were used to determine significant changes from wild-type hIP1D4. Receptor activation, as measured by increases in the production of cAMP, revealed a significant defect associated with the R212H polymorph, which exhibited an EC50 (2.8 ± 0.5 nm; p < 0.01) 6-fold greater than that of the wild-type hIP1D4 receptor (EC50 = 0.5 ± 0.1 nm) (Table II). Conversely, the V25M mutant did not show any significant difference from the wild-type hIP1D4 in regards to cAMP generation (Table II). Thus, with respect to both ligand binding and activation the V25M variant exhibited wild-type-like characteristics. In contrast, at pH 7.4 the R212H mutant had adverse effects upon receptor activation exclusively, with no significant effect on agonist binding.Table IIDose-response studies under different pH conditionsEC50pH 7.4pH 6.8pH 5.9nmhIP1D40.5 ± 0.1 (3)2-aNumber in parentheses is the number of experiments (n).0.5 ± 0.2 (4)2.1 ± 0.7 (3)2-bp < 0.05.V25M0.9 ± 0.4 (3)0.4 ± 0.2 (4)7.5 ± 2.6 (3)2-bp < 0.05.R212H2.8 ± 0.5 (5)2-cp < 0.01.3.2 ± 1.6 (8)2-bp < 0.05.7.0 ± 1.6 (3)2-bp < 0.05.cAMP response EC50 ± S.E.

Significant differences were determined using Student’s t tests and comparing the results to wild-type hIP1D4. During conditions of stress such as those observed with renal, cardiac, or respiratory failure, severe acidosis (both metabolic and respiratory) can ensue, lowering in vivo pH levels nearly 10-fold. The hIP receptor (located on the plasma membrane) is thus vulnerable to such pH changes. Our results showed deterioration in ligand binding at pH 6.8 with the R212H polymorph (Ki = 45.6 ± 12.0 nm, p < 0.05) (Fig.2, Table I), which persisted at a lower pH of 5.9. However, neither the wild-type hIP1D4 nor the V25M variant showed any detrimental effects in binding from the change in pH (Fig.2, Table I). The effect of pH on receptor activation was then determined. Constructs were transfected and assayed in parallel. There was no significant change in activation from pH 7.4 to 6.8 for all three constructs (Table II, Fig. 3). The R212H still differed from wild-type hIP1D4 by 6-fold. At pH 5.9, however, there was a significant decrease in EC50 for both wild-type hIP1D4 (EC50 = 2.1 ± 0.7 nm,p < 0.05) and V25M (EC50 = 7.5 ± 2.6 nm, p < 0.05) (Table II, Fig. 3). The R212H still remained abnormal at 7.0 ± 1.6 nm. For both the wild-type hIP1D4 and the two variants, activation was impaired at lower pH. However, only at pH 5.9 was a defect observed with wild-type hIP1D4 and V25M. (Table II). Despite the change in affinity at lower pH for R212H, we did not observe a further reduction of the already abnormal EC50.Figure 3cAMP activation at pH 7.4, 6.8, and 5.9.Mean ± S.E. of cAMP production (pmol/105 cells) from at least three identical experiments in which each construct was performed in parallel with wild-type hIP1D4 is shown.

However, using the same concentration of DNA our saturation binding indicated that R212H expressed at half the levels of V25M and hIP1D4. We hypothesized that this apparent difference arose from our overexpression system. We thus sequentially titrated the plasmid DNA used for our transfection (0.025–2.0 μg of DNA/ml), using equal concentrations for hIP1D4 wild-type and R212H (Fig. 4). DNA concentrations of 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 μg of DNA/ml yielded no significant differences in maximal cAMP produced. However, lower DNA concentrations (0.25, 0.05, and 0.025 μg/ml) showed a significant difference that correlated with receptor expression. At 0.05 μg of DNA/ml, the Bmax was 0.3 pmol/mg membrane protein for hIP1D4 and 0.2 pmol/mg membrane protein for R212H. At 0.025 μg of DNA/ml expression was 0.2 pmol/mg for hIP1D4 and 0.1 pmol/mg for R212H. Further experiments were performed to assess whether EC50 was affected by the reduction in expression (Fig. 5). At 0.6 pmol/mg membrane protein the maximal cAMP values were the same for both hIP1D4 and R212H. The EC50 for wild-type hIP1D4 was 0.6 nm in comparison to 2.5 nm for R212H. At lower expression levels for the R212H (0.2 pmol/mg membrane protein) the EC50 was 3.1 nm, and at 0.1 pmol/mg membrane protein the EC50 was 7.1 nm (Fig. 5). Although a change was noted in maximal cAMP produced, there were no significant differences in EC50 for both hIP1D4 and R212H at lower cell surface expression.Figure 5Iloprost potency at the lower levels of expression. Dose responses (as described in Fig. 3) were determined for different levels of expression using transfection DNA concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, 0.05, and 0.025 μg/ml. To obtain the hIP1D4 expression level of 0.6 pmol/mg membrane protein, 0.5 μg/ml DNA was required. For equivalent R212H expression 1.0 μg/ml DNA was needed.

Similarly, variants detected in the intracellular loops in the dopamine D2 receptor (14Cravchik A. Sibley D.R. Gejman P.V. J. Biol.

Such studies have uncovered many new functionally important residues (11Rana B.K. Shiina T. Insel P.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 593-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). There are, however, many polymorphisms that may be silent under normal physiological conditions with the underlying functional abnormalities becoming apparent only in the diseased state (17Liggett S.B.

Defects in hIP receptor structure and function caused by such naturally occurring mutations may ultimately lead to explanations concerning the intrinsic differences observed in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and responses to therapy (e.g. variable responses to iloprost in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension) (19Olschewski H.

In this study, we characterize the effects of the V25M and R212H polymorphisms on hIP function. Two hIP polymorphisms in the coding region of the hIP, were recently identified and appeared on the SNP database (6Sherry S.T. Ward M. Sirotkin K. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 677-679PubMed Google Scholar). The V25M variation was found to originate from a single guanine-to-adenine mutation at codon position 1 (corresponding to the amino acid position number 25), and multiple PCR reactions from a sample size of 62 chromosomes (i.e. 31 chromosomal pairs) were used to confirm this change. Homozygotes were detected, implying an ample rate of mutant incidence; however, actual prevalence and population frequency requires further determination. This polymorphism is located in transmembrane helix I in the region of the putative agonist binding pocket (Fig. 1). The R212H mutation arose from a single guanine-to-adenine change at codon position 2 (corresponding to the amino acid position 212) with a sample size of 40 chromosomes (i.e. 20 chromosomal pairs). Homozygous samples were also detected for this variant, which is located in the important third intracellular loop (Fig. 1). The goal of our study was to determine the effects of these naturally occurring mutations on hIP receptor function. In particular, we analyzed agonist binding, activation of the native Gs pathway, and cell surface expression of the receptor. Receptor binding was initially evaluated at physiological pH 7.4 with iloprost as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No significant difference was observed in agonist binding (Ki) between wild-type hIP1D4 and the V25M or R212H polymorphisms. Receptor activation, as measured by increases in the production of cAMP, revealed that there was a significant defect associated with the R212H mutation. Conversely, the V25M mutant did not show any significant difference from the wild-type hIP1D4 in regards to cAMP generation. Thus, with respect to both ligand binding and activation, the V25M variant exhibited wild-type-like characteristics, indicating that the valine-to-methionine mutation was well tolerated despite a significant change in amino acid size. In contrast, at pH 7.4 the R212H mutant (located in the important third intracellular loop) had adverse effects upon receptor activation exclusively, with no significant effects on agonist binding. A variety of pathophysiological conditions (e.g. cardiac failure) can result in severe acidosis, drastically reducing in vivo pH levels. The hIP receptor located on the plasma membrane is thus vulnerable to such pH changes. Positive charges in the third intracellular loop play an important role in receptor activation, coupling to the Gs subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein. Under normal physiological conditions (pH 7.4), the amino acid histidine (pKa 6.5) is relatively neutral as compared with the positively charged native amino acid arginine (pKa 12.0). Although the pKavalues of these amino acids are directly affected by the intrinsic intermolecular environment of the protein itself, we hypothesized that decreasing the pH level of the local environment (similar to a disease-induced acidosis) may foster protonation of the histidine residue. This may correct the activation defect noted at physiological pH by reproducing the positive charge and normal functionality, as seen with the native arginine at position 212 of the wild-type hIP1D4 receptor. Surprisingly, our results showed deterioration in ligand binding at pH 6.8 with the R212H polymorph, which persisted at a lower pH of 5.9. However, neither the wild-type hIP1D4 nor the V25M variant showed any detrimental effects in binding caused by the change in pH (Fig. 2, Table I). Despite the binding defect in R212H there was no significant change in activation from pH 7.4 to 6.8 for any of the three constructs (TableII, Fig. 3), and the R212H polymorphism still differed from wild-type hIP1D4 by 6-fold. Activation was impaired at lower pH levels for wild type as well as both variants, but only at pH 5.9 was a defect observed for hIP1D4 and V25M (Table II). Despite the change in affinity at lower pH for R212H, we did not observe a significant lowering of the already abnormal EC50. This may be related to the sensitivity of our assay system in detecting small but significant changes in EC50. However, mutations have been found in the prostacyclin receptor that significantly decrease agonist binding affinity without an equivalent effect on activation (21Stitham, J., Martin, K. A., and Hwa, J. (2002) Mol. Pharmacol. (in press)Google Scholar). We believe that this stems from amino acid-ligand interactions (receptor binding pocket) that contribute to affinity but do not contribute to receptor conformational changes required for Gsactivation.2 Reduced pH (6.8) may alter such critical residues (protonation) mimicking such mutations. The defect in receptor activation for R212H remains markedly abnormal at acidic pH. Our cAMP activity assays revealed equivalent maximal activation for all three constructs using 2.0 μg/ml DNA for transfection. However, using the same concentration of DNA saturation binding indicated that R212H expresses at half the levels of V25M and hIP1D4. This apparent difference may be attributable to our overexpression system in which the stoichiometry of components in G-protein-coupled receptor signaling plays an important role (22Ostrom R.S. Post S.R. Insel P.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 407-412PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that adenylyl cyclase is the critical component that limits maximal response to the β-adrenergic receptor (22Ostrom R.S. Post S.R. Insel P.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 407-412PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of the receptor (or Gs) in isolated cells (23Gaudin C. Ishikawa Y. Wight D.C. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Wagner T.E. Vatner D.E. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1676-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or transgenic animals (24Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R. Chien K.R. Johnson T.D. Bond R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1994; 264: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) results in only modest enhancements in activation. We thus titrated the plasmid DNA used for our transfection (0.025–2.0 μg of DNA/ml) using equal concentrations for hIP1D4 and R212H (Fig. 4). Lower DNA concentrations (0.25, 0.05, and 0.025 μg/ml) showed a significant difference in maximal Gsactivation that correlated with receptor expression. Although a change was noted in maximal cAMP produced, there were no significant differences in EC50 for both hIP1D4 and R212H at lower cell surface expression. The amino acid at position 212 in mouse and rat IP (mIP and rIP) receptors is a histidine residue. Moreover, the genes for human and mouse IP are only 80% homologous, sharing only 66% amino acid identity in the sequence of the third intracellular loop. Of the many differences, only three (including the R212H) result in an altered charge (at pH 7.4). As expected, and given the low degree of primary sequence conservation, interspecies variation between human and mouse IP receptors has been noted regarding signal transduction activation. Recent studies of cloned mIP (expressed in HEK293 or Chinese hamster ovary cells) revealed EC50 levels for cAMP generation of 2–5 nm (25Hayes J.S. Lawler O.A. Walsh M.T. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23707-23718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Kam Y. Chow K.B. Wise H. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as compared with 0.4–1 nm for cloned hIP (also in HEK293 cells and COS-1 cells) (5Zhang Z. Austin S.C. Smyth E.M. Mol.

Thus, this critical residue may account, at least in part, for these differences. In conclusion, this study highlights the resultant structural and functional defects associated with the first known naturally occurring human prostacyclin receptor polymorphisms V25M and R212H in conjunction with a common in vivo pathophysiological stressor, acidosis. Important clinical corollaries may arise during episodes of acute severe acidosis in patients possessing hIP polymorphisms such as R212H. In these situations an urgent correction of bodily pH may be required to restore normal hemostasis and vasodilation, as well as to improve therapeutic responses. This study provides the mechanistic basis for further research into genetic risk factors and pharmacogenetics of human prostacyclin receptor-associated diseases.

Previously, exocytosis and endocytosis were studied separately so that the coupling between them was understood only indirectly. We focused on the coupling of these processes by observing the secretory vesicle marker synaptobrevin and the endocytotic vesicle marker dynamin I tagged with green and red fluorescent proteins under an evanescent wave microscope in pheochromocytoma cells. In control cells, many synaptobrevin-expressing vesicles were found as fluorescent spots near the plasma membrane. Upon electrical stimulation, many of these vesicles showed an exocytotic response as a transient increase in fluorescence intensity followed by their disappearance. In contrast, fluorescent dynamin appeared as clusters increasing slowly in number upon stimulation. The clusters of fluorescent dynamin moved around beneath the plasma membrane for a significant distance. Simultaneous observations of green fluorescent dynamin and red fluorescent synaptobrevin indicated that more than 70% of the exocytotic responses of synaptobrevin had no immediate dynamin counterpart at the same site. From these findings it was concluded that dynamin-mediated recycling is not directly coupled to exocytosis but rather completed by a scanning movement of dynamin for the sites of invaginating membrane destined to endocytosis.

Previous studies focused mainly on the last step of exocytosis and inferred the kinetics of endocytosis only indirectly (2Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat.

In the present study, using the green fluorescent protein (GFP)1 technique, we have focused on the coupling of exocytosis and endocytosis. We observed the vesicle-associated membrane protein, which is also referred to as synaptobrevin (Syb), and the vesicle-producing protein, dynamin, simultaneously under an evanescent field microscope (6Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Tsuboi T. Kikuta T. Warashina A. Terakawa S. Biochem. Biophys.

The fluorescence imaging restricted to the plasma membrane allowed us to capture the exact moment and the site of exocytosis and compare them with the foci of endocytotic activity. In many cases, dynamin clusters appeared in the void space between the sites of exocytotic responses, and then they moved around continuously beneath the membrane, as if they were searching or scanning for the proper site of membrane retrieval. Here, based on these observations, we will propose a novel hypothesis, “sweeping model of dynamin,” for an efficient retrieval of superfluous membranes by endocytosis. A construct of Syb fused with enhanced GFP (EGFP) was produced by subcloning the rat Syb cDNA as a HindIII/BamHI fragment into pEGFP C1 (CLONTECH, Tokyo, Japan). A construct of Syb fused with DsRed was made by shuffling the Syb cDNA from EGFP fusion construct into DsRed C1 (CLONTECH). Constructs of dynamin I-EGFP and dynamin K44A-EGFP (9Obar R.A. Collins C.A.

Cell. 1998; 9 (abstr.): 196Google Scholar) were provided by Dr. Patrizia Okamoto and Dr. Richard Vallee (University of Massachusetts). To transfect pheochromocytoma cells (PC12), an expression vector containing (2 μg/μl) LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) solution was mixed with a culture medium, and the cells were cultured in the mixture for 4 h. Then, the cells were washed with the culture medium and stored in a fresh medium. Under this condition, many cells (>70%) were successfully transfected. The cells were used for experiments in 24–48 h after transfection. The culture medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen). For the fluorescence imaging, a modified Krebs solution containing (in mm) NaCl, 135; KCl, 5.0; CaCl2, 2.0; MgCl2, 1.0; Na-HEPES, 10; glucose, 10 (buffered at pH 7.3 by titration with NaOH) was used. For most fluorescence observations, we employed a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM or evanescent field microscope) described previously by Tsuboi et al. (7Tsuboi T. Kikuta T. Warashina A. Terakawa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The incident light for evanescent illumination was introduced from the objective lens (NA = 1.45, 60× magnification) installed on an inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To observe the EGFP fluorescence image, we used a 473-nm laser (diode-pumped solid state, 30 milliwatts; Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) for the evanescent wave excitation and a long pass filter (515 nm) for barrier. The laser beam was passed through an electromagnetically driven shutter (Uniblitz; Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). The shutter was opened synchronously with camera exposure under control with a personal computer (Endeavor Pro-400, Epson, Tokyo, Japan) running a MetaMorph software package (Universal Imaging Co., West Chester, PA). Fluorescence images were captured with a monochromatic ICCD camera (DAS-512, Imagista, Tokyo, Japan) combined with an image intensifier (VS4–1845, VideoScope, Sterling, VA). The video images were contrast-enhanced with a digital image processor (ARGUS-20, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), then recorded on digital videotape (GV-D900, Sony, Tokyo, Japan) continuously, and stored finally on a computer hard disk. To observe fluorescence images of EGFP and DsRed simultaneously under the evanescent wave illumination, we used a single laser line (473 nm) for excitation and the W-view optical system (A-4313, Hamamatsu Photonics) for emission, as described previously (6Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All images were reproduced from the hard disk or from the digital videotape using a personal computer (Power Macintosh G4/450, Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, CA). The Syb-DsRed expressing PC-12 cells were fixed with 99.5% ethanol for 10 min at 4 °C. After fixation, the cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-synaptophysin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Tokyo, Japan) for about 1 h at room temperature. Then the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) for 12 h at 4 °C. After a final washing, the cells were observed with a confocal microscope equipped with a microlens-attached Nipkow-disc scanner (CSU-10, Yokogawa Electric Co., Tokyo, Japan). To assess the exocytotic response of secretory vesicles, we observed the fluorescence of Syb-EGFP expressed in the vesicles under the evanescent field microscope. Many fluorescent spots of a quite uniform size were distributed all over the bottom area of the cell (Fig.1a). These fluorescent spots showed short linear movements (average velocity: 3.21 ± 0.82 μm/s, n = 10 cells) in various directions in control cells. The average velocity was significantly decreased to 0.12 ± 0.02 μm/s (n = 10 cells, p < 0.05) when colchicine (10 μm, 30 min) was applied to the cells. However, no change was observed when ML-9, a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor (20 μm, 30 min), was applied (average velocity: 2.94 ± 0.64 μm/s, n = 10 cells). When electrical stimulation (1-μA current pulse, 1-ms duration) was applied with a micropipette attached to the cell (11Manivannan S. Terakawa S. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5917-5928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), many of the Syb-EGFP vesicles (76 ± 4%, n = 10 cells) abruptly disappeared after their transient increase in fluorescence intensity (flash) with individual delays. During the flash response for about 30 ms, the image of the vesicle became diffusively larger (Fig.1b, middle panel). After their abrupt disappearance, the fluorescence could no longer be detected on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, d and e). The abrupt disappearance of fluorescent vesicles indicated their exocytotic responses. The flash could be ascribed to a lateral diffusion of the Syb-EGFP from a vesicle membrane to the plasma membrane in the exponentially rising evanescent field (4Schmoranzer J. Goulian M. Axelrod D. Simon S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Toomre D. Steyer J.A. Keller P. Almers W. Simons K. Cell Biol. 2000; 49: 33-40Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 6Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We did not detect a significant increase in fluorescence of the plasma membrane after stimulation. This could be accounted for by lateral diffusion of the Syb-EGFP-carrying vesicles also, because EGFP would be diluted at least 10-fold by the surrounding plasma membranes after the exocytotic fusion. A lack of increase in background fluorescence of the plasma membrane even after many exocytotic responses suggested that Syb-EGFP on the plasma membrane was efficiently internalized after exocytotic membrane fusion. Alternatively, Syb-EGFP transferred to the plasma membrane might be quenched by some unknown mechanism or by enzymatic degradation for recycling. We observed the dynamic activity of dynamin I-EGFP near the plasma membrane of PC12 cells by using the same evanescent wave microscope. Against a faint background, dynamin I-EGFP in control cells was visualized as punctuate fluorescent spots of variable sizes (∼0.4 μm). Hereafter, we will refer to the large fluorescent spots as clusters. Electrical stimulation induced a marked increase in number of these clusters near the plasma membrane (224 ± 5% on average, n = 10 cells; Fig.2a). Stimulation induced a significant increase in background fluorescence of the plasma membrane as well (Fig. 2, a and e). The number of clusters formed was larger in the high background areas. It is possible that dynamin molecules first translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and then they assembled into clusters in an initial stage of the membrane-related activity. Once the clusters appeared, they did not grow later. In contrast to the rapid response of the vesicles expressing Syb-EGFP, the fluorescent clusters of dynamin I-EGFP appeared with a clear delay of 10–60 s after stimulation (Fig.2d). The time course of this endocytotic response estimated with dynamin I-EGFP was consistent with recent observations (12Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 13Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 14Li Z. Murthy V.N. Neuron. 2001; 31: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All clusters and the background fluorescence soon faded to restore the initial fluorescence level in the entire field of cell observed. In individual clusters, the large increase in fluorescence of dynamin I-EGFP was followed by a sharp decrease in fluorescence in 10–20 s (Fig. 2d) without a detectable change in shape. The decrease in fluorescence reflected a movement of clusters away from the evanescent field, possibly showing dynamin activity of pinching endocytotic vesicles from the plasma membrane. There were clusters linked loosely to others, forming a super cluster in the shape of a ribbon (Fig. 2c) or sometimes a quite large ring (Fig.3c).Figure 3Movement of dynamin clusters during the membrane-associated activity. a, sequence of video frames showing random movements of several clusters appearing after electrical stimulation.

Some drifted laterally for final distances longer than 3 μm before they faded (Fig. 3b). Almost the entire area of the cell under observation was covered by traces of some clusters. Some ribbons of dynamin moved sideways for a few micrometers. The ring structures grew in diameter to scan a large area of the plasma membrane (Fig. 3c), enlarging like a wave made by a stone thrown into a pond. More precisely, rings fragmented into several arcs during enlargement, keeping their shape and intensity for a certain traveling distance. These various modes of gliding suggested that dynamin clusters scan the membrane to meet the invaginating pits destined to endocytosis. We observed such responses reproducibly in 5 of 7 cells tested in a series. We also observed the dynamics of mutant type dynamin I-EGFP (Fig.2b). A marked difference between the wild type and mutant dynamin was noticed in the rates of disappearance from the plasma membrane after their stimulation-induced appearance. The mutant dynamin did not disappear for more than 10 min of the observation period (Fig.2e, bottom panel). When compared before stimulation, mutant clusters were always larger in number than wild type clusters. The ribbons or the rings of clusters did not appear after stimulation in mutant cells, although individual clusters of a small size were observed similarly at a high density moving randomly in lateral directions. All these properties of mutant dynamin are probably pertinent to the impeded endocytosis. In normal cells, the appearance of fluorescent clusters of dynamin I-EGFP after electrical stimulation was blocked significantly (to 124 ± 5%, n = 10 cells) by application of an anti-mitotic agent, colchicine (10 μm, 30 min). However, no blockade was observed when an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, ML-9 (20 μm, 30 min), was applied (211 ± 11%, n = 10 cells). A fate of Syb-DsRed-expressing vesicles after the exocytotic event was examined in the cell co-expressing dynamin I-EGFP, using a dual window (W-view) evanescent wave microscope. Syb-DsRed was monitored in the red-filtered window and dynamin I-EGFP in the green-filtered window. In the resting cell, most of vesicular images appeared only in the red window (Fig. 4a, top panels). When a depolarizing pulse was applied to the cell, many of Syb-DsRed-expressing vesicles in this window disappeared in a period of several seconds. Instead, many of the fluorescent spots (clusters) of dynamin I-EGFP appeared in the green window (Fig. 4a,bottom panels). The decrease in fluorescence intensity of Syb-DsRed ended earlier than the onset of the increase in intensity of dynamin I-EGFP fluorescence. We obtained such reproducible results of simultaneous imaging in 7 of 12 cells we tested. Failure was mainly due to a low frequency of responses. We next examined the coincidence of the dynamin I-EGFP response with the Syb-DsRed response by overlaying the two images of pseudocolor representing both responses separately (Fig. 4b). Among all disappearing responses of Syb-DsRed fluorescence, 27 ± 1% (n = 8 cells) had the appearance of dynamin I-EGFP in exactly the same site (Fig. 4b, arrows). The Syb-DsRed vesicles that showed such successive responses were mostly large in diameter (0.43 ± 0.1 μm, n = 8 cells). Many of such large vesicles were also stained with acridine orange (data not shown). These results suggested that large dense core granules are more likely to attract dynamin I at active sites of endocytosis. The dual window evanescent wave microscopy described here will allow one to investigate the modes of different types of secretory vesicles in further detail. Syb-DsRed was present exclusively on secretory vesicles in PC-12 cells as judged by comparison with the distribution of another vesicle protein, synaptophysin (Fig. 4c). Co-localization averaged 81 ± 5% (n = 3 cells), minimizing the possibility that the DsRed-conjugated protein was mistargeted. We calculated the diffusion coefficient of Syb-EGFP- and Syb-DsRed-expressing vesicles to be 2.5 ± 0.5 × 10−10 cm2/s (n = 8 cells) and 2.6 ± 0.2 × 10−10 cm2/s (n = 8 cells), respectively. No significant difference was observed indicating that Syb-EGFP and Syb-DsRed were targeted similarly in a non-aggregated form and that fusion of Syb to DsRed did not alter its targeting. Appearance and disappearance of some dynamin clusters was assessed by measuring the fluorescence intensity at the exact site where an exocytotic response of a Syb-DsRed vesicle occurred (Fig.5a). When the cell was stimulated, the fluorescent cluster of dynamin I appeared with an approximately 30-s delay after an exocytotic response (Fig.5c). After a certain period, the dynamin cluster disappeared in ∼30 s. Because the stable period and disappearing period of dynamin fluorescence were clearly distinguishable, the disappearance was judged not to be a result of photobleaching. An enhanced photobleaching of the dynamin fluorescence with a stronger illumination led to an exponential fading and not to a stepwise fading. The fluorescence intensity of a cluster was more than a dozenfold higher than the background intensity of dynamin fluorescence. These findings suggested that many dynamin molecules were involved in a single cluster. In conclusion, using an evanescent wave microscope, we demonstrated here dynamics of exocytosis and endocytosis of secretory vesicles in PC12 cells. The fluorescent probes, Syb-DsRed and dynamin I-EGFP, made it possible to distinguish the exocytotic process from the endocytotic process and to observe the sequence of two responses in the same cell. Thus the present study provided insight into the recycling process of exocytosis and endocytosis in a neuronal-like cell. The increased fluorescence of dynamin I-EGFP in stimulated cells (Fig.3) suggests a recruitment of dynamin I molecules from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane for promotion of the membrane recycling. The increased number in clusters of dynamin I near the plasma membrane in stimulated cells (Fig. 4) suggests a Ca2+-dependent enhancement of the endocytotic activity. The formation of clusters of dynamin may be a microtubule-related response, as it was affected by colchicine at low concentration. Only a portion (27%) of the exocytotic responses showed a corresponding formation of the dynamin I cluster coupled or targeted directly to the membrane-fusion site. The rest of the exocytotic responses probably are coupled to a membrane retrieval process at some distance. Our important observation is that dynamin I clusters sweep the plasma membrane. Taken together, it is highly likely that the major fraction of clathrin-coated pits are formed away from sites of exocytotic response marked by Syb-DsRed, and the pits are swept up by dynamin clusters. Some secretory vesicles expressing phogrin (phosphatase on the granule of insulinoma cells) remain in a vesicular shape even after a complete exocytotic response (15Pouli A.E. Emmanouilidou E. Zhao C. Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), indicating the “kiss and glide” of vesicles (6Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Such a gliding of empty vesicles together with the sweeping activity of dynamin would bring about a frequent collision, thus facilitating the membrane retrieval process. The present study provides evidence that membrane recycling is mediated by dual activities of dynamin, i.e.“sweeping-up and pinching-out the pits” under the plasma membrane. We thank Drs. P. Okamoto and R. B. Vallee for providing the dynamin I-EGFP construct."
https://openalex.org/W2014197880,"The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family is activated in response to a wide variety of external stress signals such as UV irradiation, heat shock, and many chemotherapeutic drugs and leads to the induction of apoptosis. A novel series of pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepines have been shown to potently induce apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, which are resistant to many chemotherapeutic agents. In this study we have delineated part of the mechanism by which a representative compound known as PBOX-6 induces apoptosis. We have investigated whether PBOX-6 induces activation of MAP kinase signaling pathways in CML cells. Treatment of K562 cells with PBOX-6 resulted in the transient activation of two JNK isoforms, JNK1 and JNK2. In contrast, PBOX-6 did not activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or p38. Apoptosis was found to occur independently of the small GTPases Ras, Rac, and Cdc42 but involved phosphorylation of the JNK substrates, c-Jun and ATF-2. Pretreatment of K562 cells with the JNK inhibitor, dicoumarol, abolished PBOX-6-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 and inhibited the induced apoptosis, suggesting that JNK activation is an essential component of the apoptotic pathway induced by PBOX-6. Consistent with this finding, transfection of K562 cells with the JNK scaffold protein, JIP-1, inhibited JNK activity and apoptosis induced by PBOX-6. JIP-1 specifically scaffolds JNK, MKK7, and members of the mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) family, implicating these kinases upstream of JNK in the apoptotic pathway induced by PBOX-6 in K562 cells."

Ii is a type II transmembrane protein associated with MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Within the cytoplasmic tail of Ii two leucine-based signals have been identified: the membrane-distal sorting signal (Leu-Ile residues at positions 7 and 8) and the membrane-proximal signal (Met-Leu residues at positions 16 and 17). Either signal is independently sufficient for endosomal localization of Ii (7.Bremnes B. Madsen T. Gedde-Dahl M. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Kang S.

The two leucine-based endosomal sorting signals within the cytoplasmic tail of Ii were both individually sufficient for basolateral targeting and internalization of Ii in MDCK cells (9.Simonsen A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that leucine sorting signals (as well as related tyrosine sorting signals) can interact directly with the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complexes AP1, AP2, AP3, and AP4 (11.Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 12.Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin.

It has to be noted that the precise amino acid requirements for the in vivo basolateral targeting and internalization are not always identical for either leucine or tyrosine sorting signals (14.Lehmann L.E.

This indicates that amino acids in the vicinity of the critical residues determine whether the motif functions as a signal for endocytosis, basolateral targeting, or both. The clathrin-associated adaptor protein complexes can promote clathrin cage assembly, link clathrin to the membrane, and interact with membrane proteins that contain leucine and tyrosine signals for sorting into CCV (12.Kirchhausen T.

Each AP contains four polypeptides, called adaptins: two large chains of ∼100 kDa, a medium chain of ∼50 kDa, and a small chain of ∼25 kDa. AP1 complexes are associated with CCVs derived from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), AP-2 complexes are associated with the endocytic CCVs, and the functional localization of AP-3 is less clear; it seems to be involved in direct transport between TGN and melanosomes/vacuoles and mediating sorting on endosomes, whereas functions of AP-4 is less well characterized, but seems to participate in basolateral sorting (13.Robinson M.S.

All APs seem to recognize tyrosine sorting signals via their respective μ-subunit and are associated with specific populations of transport vesicles and confer distinct sorting properties onto these vesicles (13.Robinson M.S.

It is less clear how AP complexes recognize leucine signals; one laboratory has reported interactions between several leucine signals and the β-subunit of AP1 complex using a cross-linking assay (25.Rapoport I. Chen Y.C. Cupers P. Shoelson S.E. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), whereas we have observed interactions between leucine signals and μ chains of AP1 and AP2 using either protein-protein interactions assay on magnetic beads (26.Rodionov D.G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6005-6008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or surface plasmon resonance technique (1.Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is believed that the interactions between sorting signals and the adaptor protein complexes mediates the sequestration of cargo membrane proteins into a specific type of transport vesicle for delivery to its intermediate or final destination. We have previously shown that Ii binds in vitro to AP-1 and AP-2, but not to AP-3 (1.Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of interactions between the leucine signals of Ii and AP-1 and AP-2 adaptor protein complexes, we constructed a set of GST fusion proteins containing the wild-type cytoplasmic tail of Ii and its various mutants. These GST fusion constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli, and AP1/AP2 adaptor binding to these constructs was studied with surface plasmon resonance. This technique has been successfully used previously to detect binding of various adaptor protein complexes to the cytoplasmic tails of a number of proteins containing leucine or tyrosine signals (27.Honing S.

The cytoplasmic tails of the wild-type Ii (Met-1 to Arg-30) and its various mutants (see Table I) were fused in-frame to the C terminus of GST using BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences), practically as described elsewhere (1.Hofmann M.W.

The composition of all constructs was verified by sequencing.Table IIi-GST fusion proteins used for adaptor binding analysis Open table in a new tab Fusion proteins were expressed and purified as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, BL21 cells carrying the constructs of interest were induced with 0.25 misopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galacropyranoside for 3 h and collected by centrifugation. The fusion proteins were released by a series of 15-s sonication steps or by a Bugbuster kit (Novagen) and then purified on GST-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The purity and size of the proteins were verified on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and then the proteins were dialyzed overnight against BIA buffer (20 mm, HEPES pH 7, 150 mm NaCL, 10 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0,2 mmdithiothreitol). The GST protein without a fusion partner was also purified and used as a negative control for the biosensor experiments. AP1 and AP2 were prepared from pig brain essentially as described elsewhere (27.Honing S. Sandoval I.V. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30.Honing S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, clathrin-coated vesicles were purified from brain after homogenization and differential centrifugation. The adaptor proteins were released from clathrin-coated vesicles with 0.5 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, and applied to a Superose-6 column (2.5 × 75 cm, equilibrated in the same buffer) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions containing AP1 and AP2 were identified by SDS-PAGE and separated from each other by subsequent hydroxylapatide chromatography as described elsewhere (32.Manfredi J.J. Bazari W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12182-12188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing either AP1 or AP2 were dialyzed against 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol (BIA buffer), which was used for all experiments using surface plasmon resonance. The interaction between the different Ii constructs and adaptors was analyzed in real time by surface plasmon resonance (33.Jönsson U. Fagerstam L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar) using a BIAcore 3000 biosensor (BIAcore AB). Ii constructs were immobilized via their GST moiety of the GST-Ii chimera to the surface of a CM5 sensor chip coated with anti-GST antibodies. The peptides were coupled to a CM5 sensor chip via their primary amino groups exactly according to the manufacturer's instructions. The subsequent interaction experiments were performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Association was recorded for 2 min during which adaptor proteins at different concentrations were injected and followed by recording dissociation for 2 min during which buffer was perfused. A short pulse injection (15 s) of 20 mm NaOH, 0.5% SDS was used to regenerate the surface after each experimental cycle. The anti-GST surface retained its binding capacity for at least 15 cycles of association, dissociation, and regeneration. AP1 and AP2 were used at concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 nm. The association and dissociation constants k a and k dfor the interactions were calculated by using the evaluation software of the BIAcore 3000. The mathematical models used are described in more detail elsewhere (34.Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 35.O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). In brief, the association was determined after 15–20 s following the switch from buffer solution to adaptor solution to avoid distortions due to injection and mixing. The dissociation rate constants were determined after 5–10 s following the switch to buffer solution. After a rapid (∼30 s) dissociation phase of adaptor from Ii-GST, the dissociation kinetics decreased to a low rate. The association constant k a, the dissociation constant k d and the calculation of the equilibrium constant K D =k d/k a were determined by using the BIA evaluation software version 1.2, assuming a first order kineticA + B = AB. Relative binding values were then calculated from the K D values. To investigate the effect of amino acid residues surrounding the critical leucine residues Leu-7 and Leu-17 on AP1 and AP2 binding, we generated a set of GST-Ii constructs (see Table I). Briefly, we studied the effect of residues surrounding the membrane-proximal (containing the Leu-17 residue) signal in the context of L7A mutation to abolish AP1 and AP2 binding to the membrane-distal signal, and the effect of residues surrounding the membrane-distal signal was likewise studied in the context of L17A mutation. Fig. 1 A illustrates the validity of this approach for AP1 binding; the GST fusion containing the wild-type bound AP1 specifically (K D = 130 nm), whereas no binding was detected for the fusion protein containing double L7A,L17A mutation. This confirms our early results (1.Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and demonstrates that a mutation in the critical leucine residue is enough to knock out binding of AP1 to this signal completely. Likewise, no interactions between pure GST protein and AP1 were detected (not shown). The fusion constructs containing single mutations in ether Leu-7 or Leu-17 retained their ability to bind AP1 complex, confirming earlier data obtained with the full-length Ii constructs (1.Hofmann M.W. Honing S. Rodionov D. Dobberstein B. von Figura K. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36153-36158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AP1 binding to the L17A construct was around 60% higher than its binding to the wild-type Ii fusion construct, whereas AP1 binding to the L7A construct was almost 40% lower than binding to wild-type Ii fusion. This may reflect more favorable steric conformation of the membrane-distal leucine signal in the L17A fusion construct for AP1 binding compared with the wild-type fusion construct. It is not clear whether this is of importance to the in vivointeractions. Fig. 1 B demonstrates that specific AP2 binding to wild-type Ii fusion construct (K D = 234 nm) is likewise abolished in the double L7A,L17A mutant. Both the L7A and the L17A single mutant fusion constructs retained their ability to bind AP2, although at somewhat reduced rate (51 and 65% of the wild-type, respectively). We then studied binding of AP1 and AP2 to a number of constructs that contained a mutation in one or more residues other than the critical leucine residues that have been shown to be important for in vivo internalization of Ii. As explained above, these mutant constructs were made in the context of either L7A or L17A mutation. Fig. 2 A demonstrates binding of AP2 to such constructs. AP2 is found mostly on the plasma membrane, and there is increasing evidence that it mediates internalization of molecules with leucine or tyrosine sorting signal (13.Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 18.Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). From the earlier in vivo studies, it is known that the acidic residues upstream of the leucine residues form a part of the motif required for internalization from the plasma membrane for a number of molecules (36.Sandoval I.

In addition, a number of other residues have been shown to be important for internalization of Ii. Motta et al. (37.Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A. Frank R.W. Saviano G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Simonsen et al. (10.Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Nordeng T.W. Bakke O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that Asp-2, Asp-3, and Gln-4, in addition to Leu-7 and Ile-8 were required for internalization of the Ii chain construct lacking the membrane-proximal signal. However, a study by Pond et al. (38.Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) demonstrated that only Asp-2 and Asp-3 were important for Ii internalization, but not Gln-4. In the case of membrane-proximal signal, available data show that Glu-12 is important for internalization in addition to Met-16 and Leu-17 (37.Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A. Frank R.W. Saviano G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38.Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, Pro-15 was found to be important for internalization of a chimeric construct containing cytoplasmic tail of Ii (39.Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2 A, mutation in acidic residue Asp-3 upstream of the membrane-proximal signal reduced AP2 binding significantly to less than 60% of the L17A level. Interestingly, mutation in Asp-2 reduced AP2 binding only to around 80% of the L17A level; this correlates with the in vivo internalization data as the construct carrying the D2A mutation internalized significantly slower than the wild type but still noticeably faster than the Asp-3 mutant (37.Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A. Frank R.W. Saviano G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38.Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L.

Furthermore, mutations in both Asp-2 and Asp-3 did not decrease AP2 binding compared with mutation in Asp-3 only, and this again correlates with the in vivo internalization data (37.Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A. Frank R.W. Saviano G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,38.Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L.

This suggests that Asp-3 is more important for AP2 bindingin vivo and subsequent internalization from the plasma membrane than Asp-2, possibly due to its proximity to the critical leucine residue in the membrane-distal signal. The membrane-proximal signal contains only one acidic residue Glu-12 upstream of its critical leucine. When this residue was mutated to alanine in the context of L7A mutation, the binding of AP2 to such construct was completely abolished. Mutations in “secondary” residues that form the leucine signal (Ile-8 and Met-16) resulted in greatly decreased binding of AP2 complex, as expected (30–35% of the respective L17A and L7A mutants). Interestingly, these mutations did not abolish such binding completely like mutations in both L7A and L17A did (compare Figs. 1 Aand 2 A), indicating that the leucine residues may be more important for AP2 recognition of the signal than these residues. We also studied AP2 binding to the construct containing Q4A mutation in the context of L17A. The decrease in AP2 binding was not significant (around 95% of AP2 binding to the L17A), supporting the report by Pondet al. (38.Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) that stated that Gln-4 was not important for Ii internalization. Then, we determined AP2 binding to constructs containing D6A or R5A single mutations or R5A,D6A double mutation in the context of L17A. Neither Asp-6, nor Arg-5 has been shown to play a role in the internalization (in fact, the double R5A,D6A mutant has been shown to internalize more rapidly than the wild-type Ii (10.Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Nordeng T.W. Bakke O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37.Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A. Frank R.W. Saviano G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, these mutants served as a control to answer what happens to AP2 binding to Ii tail in vitro if any one or two residues are mutated to alanines. These constructs both retained high AP2 binding (around 85–101% of the L17A construct). We made another control construct for an unspecific mutation in the membrane-proximal signal. This construct contained the L14A mutation in the context of L7A, as it is has been shown that residue Leu-14 does not significantly affect internalization (37.Motta A. Bremnes B. Morelli M.A. Frank R.W. Saviano G. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27165-27171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38.Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This construct also retained high AP2 binding (Fig. 2 A). Finally, we tested the relevance of Pro-15 for AP2 binding, and the mutation to alanine (P15A) resulted in reduced AP2 binding to about 30% of L7A levels (Fig. 2 A), which fits well to the recently obtained reduced levels of internalization of this mutant in vivo (39.Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the next set of experiments, we determined binding of AP1 to the same constructs. Since AP1 is mostly found at the TGN and on some vesicular structures, it is believed to play a role in the clathrin-mediated transport from the TGN to endosomes (18.Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 40.Boehm M. Aguilar R.C. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6265-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It should, however, be noted that recently obtained data suggest an important function of AP1 on endosomes in retrograde transport to the TGN (41.Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Transport from the TGN to the basolateral or apical domain of the plasma membrane in polarized cells such as MDCK appears to be direct, although in other cell lines it may involve an endosomal intermediate (42.Mostov K.E. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the correlation between AP1 binding to Ii fusion constructs and the fate of previously reported corresponding mutants in polarized MDCK cells. Wild-type Ii is found almost exclusively at the basolateral domain of polarized MDCK cells, and both leucine signals in Ii act as independent basolateral sorting signals in addition to the third basolateral signal, the precise structure of which has yet to be determined (10.Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Nordeng T.W. Bakke O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43.Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11757-11762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous results have shown that for the membrane-distal signal, residues Asp-2, Asp-3, Gln-4, and Ile-8 are important for basolateral sorting, but not Arg-5 or Asp-6 (10.Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Nordeng T.W. Bakke O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the membrane-proximal signal, residues Pro-15 and Met-16 were shown to be important for the basolateral sorting (43.Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11757-11762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), whereas the effect of residues Glu-12 and Leu-14 has not been investigated in vivo. Fig. 2 B shows binding of AP1 complex to various Ii fusion constructs. Residues Asp-2, Asp-3, Ile-8, Pro-15, and Met-16 were important for AP1 binding in addition to Leu-7 and Leu-17, as well as for the in vivo basolateral sorting. At the same time, residue Gln-4 that is important for basolateral sorting (10.Simonsen A. Bremnes B. Nordeng T.W. Bakke O. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was not important for AP1 binding (90% binding relative to the control), whereas mutant constructs D6A and R5A,D6A that are sorted basolaterallyin vivo showed significant decrease in AP1 binding (30–45% of the control levels). Interestingly, mutation in the acidic residue Glu-12 had no significant effect on AP1 binding (around 80% of the control), whereas the acidic residues Asp-2 and Asp-3 had an important effect (around 50% of the control levels). There is, however, no data on the importance of residue Glu-12 for basolateral sorting. Residue Leu-14 was apparently important for the AP1 binding, but its importance for basolateral sorting has not been, to our knowledge, investigated. Fig. 3 demonstrates that AP1 and AP2 have different mechanisms of recognition of leucine signals. Indeed, a number of residues around the critical leucine residues were significantly more important for binding to either AP1 or AP2 but not to both of these complexes. Residue Asp-6 was clearly important for AP1 binding (less than 50% of control), but not for AP2 binding (around 90% of control). Oppositely, residue Glu-12 was important for AP2 binding (binding was lost completely when the residue was mutated to alanine), but not for AP1 binding (over 80% of the control). There were also noticeable differences in AP1 and AP2 binding to the secondary residues of the leucine signals, Ile-8 and Met-16. For AP1, no binding was detected to I8A mutant, whereas binding to the M16A mutant was over 60% of the control levels. Binding of AP2 to I8A and M16A was 29 and 37%, respectively. This confirms that AP1 and AP2 have different mechanisms of recognition of Ii primary structure. Our results demonstrate a very strong correlation between residues important for in vivo endocytosis of Ii and those important for the in vitro binding of Ii to AP2, providing further support to the critical role of or AP2 in endocytosis of proteins containing leucine sorting signals. All constructs harboring mutations in the residues important for endocytosis of the invariant chain were also shown to exhibit significantly decreased binding to AP2 in vitro. At the same time, constructs containing mutations in residues that were not important for the invariant chain endocytosis did not show a decrease in AP2 binding. Taken together, these data have demonstrated the significance of ourin vitro approach and illustrated the strong correlation between our data presented here and the in vivointernalization data. Our results demonstrated no convincing correlation between AP1 binding and basolateral sorting of Ii in polarized MDCK cells, despite such correlation for some residues. This indicates that AP1 may be either not involved in direct delivery on freshly synthesized Ii from the TGN to the basolateral or apical domain of the plasma membrane, or AP1 is not the only determining factor in such delivery. It is noteworthy that a study by Ohno et al. (44.Ohno H. Tomemori T. Nakatsu F. Okazaki Y. Aguilar R.C. Foelsch H. Mellman I. Saito T. Shirasawa T. Bonifacino J.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) has identified a second AP-1 medium chain (μ1B) that is only expressed in polarized cells. It was found that this chain reconstituted polarized sorting in a cell line lacking this molecule (45.Fölsch H. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. Cell. 1999; 99: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that there are two distinct subpopulations of AP1 complexes, and only AP1B (containing μ1B) is specifically involved in the sorting from the TGN to basolateral membrane, whereas AP1 is involved in general sorting from the TGN. To complicate the matter further, the AP4 adaptor complex may also play a role in basolateral sorting of molecules containing both tyrosine- and leucine-based sorting signals (20.Simmen T. Honing S. Icking A. Tikkanen R. Hunziker W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This suggests that the interactions between sorting signals of and elements of the intracellular sorting machinery in polarized cells may be complex. Further studies should identify other factors that may participate in the polarized sorting of Ii and potentially other proteins containing leucine signals. It is also of interest that previous studies have identified a stretch of ten cytoplasmic amino acids in the immediate proximity to the trans-membrane domain of Ii that contained an unknown basolateral signal in addition to the two leucine signals, although the precise structure of this signal has not been reported (9.Simonsen A. Stang E. Bremnes B. Roe M. Prydz K. Bakke O. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 597-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11757-11762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ourin vitro binding data show that AP1 binding is completely abolished when both leucine signals are knocked out (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, our results demonstrated no convincing correlation between AP1 binding and basolateral sorting of Ii in polarized MDCK cells, despite such correlation for some residues. Finally, our results demonstrate differential requirements for AP1 and AP2 binding to Ii at the level of residues around the critical leucine residues, suggesting that there are different mechanisms of recognition of leucine signals by AP1 and AP2 complexes, conceivably at the level of the primary structure of the sorting signal. In this context, it is also interesting to note that recent studies have shown that posttranslational the modification of the AP2 μ-subunit by phosphorylation can determine the affinity for sorting signals and is critical for the rate of endocytosis in vivo. Since such modifications might occur that may be adaptor-specific and may be restricted to certain cell types offers another level of complexity in the control of adaptor binding to sorting signals (46.Fingerhut, A., von Figura, K., and Honing, S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275,Google Scholar, 47.Olusanya O. Andrews P.D. Swedlow J.R. Smythe E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 896-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1994265058,"Transcription initiation has been assumed to be a multi-step sequential process, although additional steps could exist. Initiation from the T7A1 promoter, in particular, apparently behavesin vitro in a manner that can be fully explained by the sequential pathway. However, initiation from the λPRAL promoter has been shown to follow a branched pathway from which a part of the enzyme-promoter complex is arrested at the promoter raising the question as to which mechanism is general. We found that a moribund complex, characteristic of the arrested branch, is formed at the T7A1 promoter, especially in low salt condition indicating that the initiation mechanism for this promoter is also branched. The results of DNA footprinting suggested that holoenzyme in the moribund complex is dislocated on DNA from the position of productive complex. However, only a small fraction of the binary complex becomes arrested at this promoter, and the interconversion between subspecies of binary complex is apparently more reversible than at the λPRAL promoter, which explains why the reaction pathway appears to be sequential. These findings suggest a generality of the branched pathway mechanism, which would resolve contradictory observations that have been reported for various promoters.

These findings suggest a generality of the branched pathway mechanism, which would resolve contradictory observations that have been reported for various promoters. Transcription initiation in prokaryotes includes at least four events: 1) the binding of holoenzyme to a promoter; 2) the isomerization of the resulting complex accompanied by strand opening; 3) the iterative synthesis and release of abortive transcripts; and 4) the achievement of continuous elongation accompanied by the escape of the enzyme from the promoter (for review see Ref. 1McClure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Although these events are required for transcription initiation in this order, they do not necessarily represent the complete mechanism of transcription initiation, because additional steps could exist. Nevertheless, it has long been assumed that the events listed above is the complete mechanism, mainly because of the lack of evidence for further complications. This simplest mechanism may be called the sequential pathway (Scheme FS1A). In vitro, the initiation from the bacteriophage T7A1 promoter in particular shows the following two behaviors that are characteristic of the sequential mechanism. Firstly, the promoter-RNA polymerase complex synthesizes a stoichiometric amount of full-length transcript in a single-round transcription (2Wu N. Shimamoto F.Y.-H. Wu C.-H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4745-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Secondly, abortive synthesis does not occur after the synthesis of full-length transcript (3Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the view that the transcription complex engaged in abortive synthesis is a precursor of the complex synthesizing a long RNA. However, these results do not prove that the sequential pathway is applicable to initiation at all promoters or even at the T7A1 promoter in all conditions. The above two behaviors characteristic of the sequential pathway are not observed in single-round transcription from theλPRAL or LacUV5 promoter. The amount of full-length transcript is much less than stoichiometric with the amount of the binary complex (4Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and abortive synthesis at these promoters continues long after the completion of full-length transcription, namely persistent abortive synthesis (5Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of an initiation mechanism other than the sequential pathway. These discrepancies are not attributable to heterogeneity in the preparation of the RNA polymerase used for the following reasons. At theλPRAL promoter, RNA polymerase, which has been isolated from the run-off elongation complex and re-used, displays the same degree of abortive synthesis as the original enzyme, indicating that a fraction of the previously productive enzyme becomes nonproductive (5Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the amount of full-length product in single-round transcription from the λPRAL promoter increases to the same level of the binary complex if GreA, GreB, and a high concentration of the initiation nucleotide are present (6Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that nonproductive enzyme can be converted into a productive one. These observations imply the existence of nonproductive pathway(s) that cause(s) the persistent abortive synthesis and that the mechanism of initiation is branched at some stage before abortive synthesis at these promoters. The most plausible model for initiation from the λPRAL promoter is shown in Scheme FS1B (5Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The moribund complex, which is defined as the ability to synthesize only abortive transcripts, is first generated in the nonproductive branch of initiation, the promoter-arrested pathway. At the λPRAL promoter, the moribund complex is slowly converted into inactive dead-end complex with a time constant of 10 min in the standard condition (7Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10899-10904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the moribund complex decays slower than the productive complex, persistent abortive synthesis is observed. The moribund complex is also identifiable in initiation at themalT promoter (8Tagami H. Aiba H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that the branched pathway may arise in initiation at many promoters. In a test of the generality of the branched pathway, one of the key criteria would be whether or not the initiation at the T7A1 promoter, whose mechanism appears the most sequential, actually follows a branched pathway. Notably, a branched pathway would appear to be sequential if the moribund complex converted into a productive complex before converting into a dead-end complex so that most transcription complexes would finally indulge in productive elongation. In this case, a nearly stoichiometric amount of the full-length transcript should be synthesized in single-round transcription and production of abortive transcripts should cease before the full-length synthesis is completed. Indeed, this situation occurs at the λPRAL promoter in the presence of the Gre factors and a high concentration of initiating nucleotide (6Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we report that the promoter-arrested pathway can be detected in initiation at the T7A1 promoter. We consistently observe that the interconversion among subspecies of binary complex at the T7A1 promoter is simply more reversible than at the λPRAL promoter. These findings suggest a generality of the branched pathway mechanism that can explain the seemingly contradictory characteristics of various promoters. The T7A1 template DNAs used in this study were prepared by PCR using the plasmid pAR1435, which is a derivative of pBR322 with a 102-bp segment of T7 DNA containing the A1 promoter inserted at itsBamHI site (9Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 166: 477-535Google Scholar). The other templates were described previously by Sen et al. (3Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All the transcription assays were carried out as described previously (4Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 5Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in the standard condition (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 m KCl) or the low salt condition (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 7 mm MgCl2). The dissociation of the binary complex was measured by trapping the dissociated enzyme with a 60-fold molar excess of the 190-bp DNA fragment containing the λPRAL promoter or with 40 μg/ml heparin. In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the binary complex was formed at 37 °C for 10 min in the standard or low salt condition in the presence of 13% glycerol. If necessary, transcription was started by adding the substrate mixture containing 5 μm ATP, 100 μm GTP and CTP each UTP, 0.1 mg/ml heparin and then incubated for 20 min. The digestion withHaeIII was carried out by incubation with 3.5 units of the enzyme for an additional 30 min before electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. Exonuclease III-mediated DNA footprinting was performed as described previously (7Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10899-10904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In Fe2+-induced site-specific radical cleavage, 1.2 pmol of immobilized DNA template harboring the T7A1 orλPRAL promoter (10Fujioka M. Hirata T. Shimamoto N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1801-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and 1.0 pmol of RNA polymerase were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the standard or low salt condition for T7A1 and in the standard or standard +100 mm NaCl condition for λPRAL. The immobilized binary complex was washed with buffer lacking MgCl2. A final concentration of 0.1 mmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2 was then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min. Cleavage was terminated by the addition of phenol, and the reaction mixture was analyzed in an 8% sequencing gel. One important line of evidence for the branched pathway at theλPR promoter is the occurrence of persistent abortive synthesis. Because this phenomenon disappears in a high salt condition (3Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), lower salt conditions might favor the formation of the moribund complex at the T7A1 promoter. Although little sign of persistent abortive synthesis at the T7A1 promoter has been detected in the standard salt condition (3Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we decided to test for its occurrence at low salt. Transcription from the T7A1 promoter was carried out using a linear 154-bp DNA (Fig. 1A, template I) and produced full-length transcripts (74 bases or longer) together with abortive transcripts (shorter than 14 bases) in the standard salt condition (Fig. 1B). In the low salt condition, similar amounts of long transcript were synthesized, whereas the average length of abortive products increased slightly. These moderate changes show that no anomalous reactions take place at low salt. The most sensitive method for the detection of persistent abortive synthesis is a pulse-labeling assay (5Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in which transcription is started with unlabeled nucleotides and then the labeled initiating nucleotide [γ-32P]ATP is added at various time points. In this assay, the amounts of the labeled full-length and abortive transcripts indicate the residual proportion of binary complex that can produce the corresponding transcripts at each time point. In the sequential pathway, abortive synthesis should precede the full-length synthesis, and thus the ratio of abortive to full-length transcripts should not increase with the time elapsed prior to addition of labeled ATP. In contrast, this ratio could increase in the branched pathway if the moribund complex has a longer lifetime than the productive one. The observed ratios for the abortive 4-mer or 10-mer transcripts were plotted in Fig. 1, C and D, against the time of addition of [γ-32P]ATP. In the standard salt condition, the ratios increased by a maximum 4-fold for 60 s, and at low salt they showed 5–20-fold increases. These results indicate that persistent abortive synthesis occurs during initiation at the T7A1 promoter and that deviation from the sequential mechanism is more extensive in the low salt condition. Pulse-labeling provides a catalytic assay and thus cannot determine what fraction of binary complex becomes promoter-arrested. Therefore, this fraction was measured by using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Promoter-arrested complexes were formed on the 250-bp T7A1 DNA fragment that harbors a HaeIII site at position +73 (Fig. 1A, template II). To distinguish between promoter-arrested and run-off elongation complexes, we removed the unlabeled downstream region of the fragment, which would carry any of the latter complexes, by digestion with HaeIII. The binary complex was formed in both salt conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 4and 6). The observed amount of binary complex formed decreased slightly in the low salt condition (Fig. 2B, −4NTP) despite the fact that DNA-protein complexes are generally stabilized at low salt. On the other hand, the promoter-arrested complex was almost undetectable under the standard condition (Fig. 2A, lane 7) but clearly existed in low salt (lane 5), indicating that 2–3% of the binary complex was arrested (Fig. 2B, right panel). These results suggest that the fraction of the holoenzyme arrested at the T7A1 promoter is small and that arrest is enhanced at the low salt condition. Therefore, the observed persistent abortive synthesis is a sign of the formation of moribund complex amplified by turnover of this complex. This result explains why nearly stoichiometric amounts of full-length product are obtained at the T7A1 promoter despite the occurrence of arrest at this promoter. An alternative method to detect the arrested complex is DNA footprinting using exonuclease III (7Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10899-10904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which can detect the limits of the region of DNA protected by a bound protein. Thus, we examined the footprints of polymerase bound to the DNA harboring the T7A1 promoter in both conditions. The DNA was footprinted in the absence of holoenzyme or after the formation of the binary complex or 20 min after the addition of 4NTP (Fig. 3). Heparin was added with 4NTP to ensure single-round transcription. No difference between the footprints at the upstream boundary was observed between the two conditions (data not shown). In the standard condition, the footprint on the nontemplate strand of the naked DNA (lane 2) was the same as that after transcription (lane 4). This finding indicates that little RNA polymerase remains at the T7A1 promoter after 20 min, in agreement with the results of the mobility shift assay. However, in the low salt condition, the footprint of the downstream boundary of the binary complex appears as enhanced bands at positions +9 and +18 to +22 as well as reduced bands at +11 and +13 (lane 7). It should be noted that there is a similar footprint after the 20-min transcription in the low salt condition, although the bands are relatively faint (lane 8). This observation indicates that a small fraction of the enzyme is still sitting at the promoter, a conclusion again consistent with the finding from the mobility shift assay. There is a difference between the footprints of the binary complexes in the two conditions. In low salt, the downstream edge of the enzyme footprint is at position +22, whereas in the standard salt condition, it is at +19 (lanes 3 and 7). This difference suggests that the RNA polymerase in the binary complex may be more forward-tracked in the low salt condition than in the standard condition. Alternatively, exonuclease III may push or partially displace holoenzyme further upstream in the latter case so that the observed differences reflect not the true boundaries but rather the elasticity of the downstream edge. Whichever is the case, it is clear that there is a physical difference between the downstream boundaries in the two conditions. Here we will tentatively call the change forward tracking. This possibility could result from a structural difference between moribund and productive binary complexes if the earliest branching point occurs at the stage of binary complex formation as in the case of the λPRAL promoter (6Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). One of the most important functional features of the enzyme complex is the location of the catalytic center relative to DNA. Therefore, we examined whether this location shifts in accord with the putative forward tracking of RNA polymerase that was detected by exonuclease III footprinting. According to Zaychikov et al. (11Zaychikov E. Martin E. Denissova L. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Kashlev M. Heumann H. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Mustaev A. Science. 1996; 273: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), a ferrous ion (Fe2+) is allowed to replace the Mg2+ that normally makes a chelate with the catalytic center. The resultant Fe2+ chelate generates hydroxyl radicals that cleave the template strand DNA nearby, allowing fine mapping of the catalytic center onto the DNA in the two conditions. Fig.4 shows the tracings of the autoradiograms obtained by this mapping. The position of the catalytic center of the RNA polymerase-T7A1 promoter complex in the standard condition maps mainly at the position −2 with a secondary peak at −1 (Fig. 4A, gray line). In contrast, the mapping in the low salt condition indicates significant forward shifting, such that the two major peaks at −2 and −1 have similar strengths (black line). The direction of the movement detected by the Fe2+ cleavage is the same as was suggested by the exonuclease III footprinting. Therefore, the binary complex with the T7A1 promoter involves a subspecies that is positioned further forward in the low salt condition. Because the productive subspecies should maintain the same position of the catalytic center relative to the template strand, the forward-tracked subspecies increasing at low salt presumably represents the moribund complex. This forward tracking of RNA polymerase at the T7A1 promoter in low salt is in sharp contrast to that at the λPRAL promoter, where back-tracking of the binary complexes as a response to reduced salt concentration is observed (Fig. 4B). Thus, at the λPRAL promoter, the direction of the putative shift of moribund binary complex is the same as that of the dead-end complex (7Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10899-10904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the moribund complex is functionally defined as a transcription complex that synthesizes only abortive products, its structure could depend on the specific promoter involved, giving a shift in either direction. The relative shift of the catalytic center from the optimal position may decrease the catalytic activity of the subspecies and thus explains why the moribund complex has a lower affinity for the initiation nucleotide and a smaller elongating activity (5Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have presented two lines of evidence that initiation at the T7A1 promoter follows a branched pathway. The kinetic evidence is the existence of persistent abortive synthesis shown by the pulse-labeling assay, and the biochemical evidence is the existence of arrested complexes detected by mobility shift and exonuclease III-footprinting assays. In both cases, the deviation from the sequential pathway is more distinct in the low salt condition, whereas the pathway in the standard condition appears to be almost sequential. Despite the existence of the moribund complex, almost no dead-end complex is formed in the standard salt condition. This result means that the moribund complex is converted into a productive complex more rapidly than it is inactivated to form a dead-end complex. Therefore, in the standard salt condition, the productive and moribund subspecies formed at the T7A1 promoter are expected to exchange rapidly, whereas those formed at theλPRAL promoter exchange scarcely. It is difficult to measure the conversion rates directly in order to confirm this prediction. However, it is possible to measure the overall rate of dissociation from promoters that involves a combination of the exchange reaction and the breakdown of binary complex. Therefore, in the standard salt condition, the overall rate at the T7A1 promoter is expected to be more rapid than that at theλPRAL promoter. Consistent with this line of reasoning, the reduction of arrest at theλPRAL promoter, which is produced either by replacing σ70 with its region 3 mutant (3Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or by the addition of the Gre factors (6Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), is accompanied by acceleration of the overall dissociation rate. In the case of the mutant σ, biphasic dissociation kinetics was actually observed, presumably one phase because of exchange and the other phase because of breakdown. In the case of the Gre factors, the dissociation kinetics is almost monophasic, suggesting that one of the steps is too rapid to be measured. We confirmed the existence of the expected rapid exchange at the T7A1 promoter in the standard salt condition by using the DNA fragment harboring the λPRAL promoter as a competitor of the test promoter fragment. Holoenzyme was preincubated for 10 min with a 1.5-fold excess of the T7A1 promoter fragment to form binary complex, and then a large excess of the competitor was added. At each time point examined, 3NTP and [γ-32P]ATP were added, and reactions were continued for an additional 20 min. Because the promoter on the competitor DNA encodes a G-start, only the initiation from T7A1 was detected. Fig. 5 shows the amounts of the full-length and abortive (6-mer) transcripts. The kinetics are monophasic for both species, and the rate constants are the same (0.2 min−1). As predicted, this value is much larger than that for initiation at the λPRAL promoter (0.03 min−1 for full-length and 9-mer species (3Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). This rapid and monophasic decay at the T7A1 promoter is consistent with the expected rapid interconversion of the subspecies of binary complex. A similar rapid decay at the T7A1 promoter was observed in the low salt condition, indicating that the interconversion is still rapid at low salt (data not shown). Metzger et al. (12Metzger W. Schickor P. Meier T. Werel W. Heumann H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that the open complex formed at the T7A1 promoter is rapidly inhibited by preincubation with heparin and interpreted this as the result of rapid dissociation of the open complex supposing a competitive role of heparin. Because an allosteric role of heparin was postulated in a transcription study using whole T7 DNA (13Pfeffer S.R. Stahl S.J. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5403-5407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether heparin works as a competitor in our experiment. We substituted heparin for theλPRAL DNA at a concentration sufficient to destroy all of the activity on this template (0.04 mg/ml) when it had been preincubated with holoenzyme. The data for heparin and theλPRAL fragment agreed within 15%, giving almost the same decay curves (Fig. 5). Therefore, heparin is essentially a competitive inhibitor. This finding is consistent with the observation that for an artificial promoter with an extremely strong affinity for RNA polymerase, a much higher concentration of heparin (5 mg/ml) was needed for the inhibition of transcription with no effects of heparin on transcription at concentrations as high as 1 mg/ml. 1T. Gaal, R. L. Gourse, and N. Shimamoto, unpublished result. Among many promoters for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, the A1 promoter of bacteriophage T7 (14Stahl S.J. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 577-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) has been one of the best studied in vitro, because it has a high affinity for holoenzyme (2Wu N. Shimamoto F.Y.-H. Wu C.-H.

The concepts of promoter clearance (16Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2995-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and of initial transcribing complex/initial elongating complex (19Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7829-7842Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) were established by experiments on promoters including T7A1, and the translocational movement of RNA polymerase away from this promoter was systematically studied (20Schickor P. Metzger W. Werel W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Metzger W. Schickor P. Werel W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2745-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to these normal features of transcription, elongation arrest was first discovered in the T7A1 transcription unit (22Arndt K.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 213: 79-108Google Scholar), and hydrolysis of transcripts was also revealed (12Metzger W. Schickor P. Meier T. Werel W. Heumann H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Altmann C.R. Solow-Cordero D.E. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, the T7A1 promoter is the most representative promoter used in kinetic studies of transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase. All of the kinetic results obtained have been interpreted based on the assumption that the mechanism of initiation at this promoter is sequential. However, the new kinetic and structural evidence obtained in this study consistently shows that initiation at the T7A1 promoter occurs by the same branched pathway mechanism, which has recently been established for other promoters such as the λPRAL (5Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and theE. coli malT promoter (8Tagami H. Aiba H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This study also shows why initiation at the T7A1 promoter had appeared to be sequential. If the moribund complex converts more rapidly into productive complex than into dead-end complex, the branched pathway becomes almost equivalent to the sequential pathway. The rapid and monophasic dissociation of binary complex observed at the T7A1 promoter suggests that there is indeed a rapid conversion between subspecies of binary complex in standard salt conditions. A similar rapid and monophasic dissociation was observed at theλPRAL promoter but only in the presence of the Gre factors, which it was concluded introduced reversibility between subspecies of the binary complex (6Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Abortive transcription at the T7A1 promoter was previously investigated by a conventional kinetic assay, which detected persistent abortive synthesis only for a misincorporation product (with A instead of G at the fourth position) at 50 mm NaCl (12Metzger W. Schickor P. Meier T. Werel W. Heumann H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The pulse-labeling assay used in this study is significantly more sensitive and was able to detect persistent synthesis of normal abortive transcripts and did so even in the presence of 0.1 m KCl. Because persistent abortive synthesis has also been observed at theλPRAL and lacUV5 promoters (5Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we conclude that there is no qualitative difference between initiation at the T7A1 promoter and others. The difference is only quantitative. The observed common features suggest that the branched pathway mechanism is general among the promoters for E. coliσ70-holoenzyme. In view of the many common features, we are inclined to hypothesize that the earliest branching point of the reaction pathways exists at the stage of binary complex for the T7A1 promoter as already established for the λPRAL promoter. This hypothesis is substantiated by the results of DNA footprinting with exonuclease III and for Fe2+-induced cleavage at the catalytic center. In the low salt condition, a significant fraction of binary complex is forward-tracked at the T7A1 promoter, and the footprint of the binary complex agrees with that of the promoter-arrested complex obtained after RNA synthesis. This agreement suggests that the forward tracking of the footprint is because of the formation of a significant amount of moribund binary complex. Because the fraction of complex arrested after transcription is only 2–3%, the major fraction of binary complex formed at an early stage is converted into productive complex during RNA synthesis. The footprints of catalytic center on binary complex dislocated in opposite directions at the T7A1 and λPRAL promoters when salt concentration was reduced. Although this difference is hard to be explained at present, speculations are possible. One possible hypothesis on binary complex is that the moribund subspecies is too stable in terms of translocation along DNA to escape from a promoter, whereas the productive subspecies is in quasi-stable states that have unfavorable positioning of DNA so that translocation is possible. If the catalytic center locates near the −1 position in the stable state independently of the promoter DNA and if the center in the quasi-stable state is respectively close to −2 or +1 position at the T7A1 or λPRAL promoter, the observed opposite dislocations are merely a reflection of increased fraction of moribund subspecies induced at low salt. However, other models are equally possible. Irrespective of the models for the moribund complex, the tracking should not be understood as a movement of RNA polymerase molecule but rather as a distortion of the complex, because our footprinting results show that at the T7A1 promoter the upstream boundary of the enzyme does not move irrespective of the movement of downstream boundary. Mutations in region 3 of σ70 are known to increase the ratio of the amount of abortive transcripts to that of the full-length transcript (25Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This alteration can be explained by an increase in reversibility between the subspecies of binary complex (3Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). According to protein footprinting of σ70, this region is protected in holoenzyme as well as in binary complex but exposed in the promoter-arrested complex at the λPRAL promoter (26Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating that the structure of this region changes upon the formation of the moribund complex. The region binds to a core enzyme (26Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Zhou Y.N. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5005-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and lies in close proximity to promoter DNA between the −10 and the −35 boxes and at the transcription start site (+1) (28Owens J.T. Chmura A.J. Murakami K. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7670-7675Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In fact, these features have been confirmed to exist in the crystal structure of the complex of Thermus aquaticusholoenzyme with promoter DNA where the region 3.2 of the σ-subunit binds to the putative exit channel for RNA. 2K. Murakami and S. A. Darst, unpublished result. Therefore, all of these results including those of the footprinting experiments in this study consistently indicate that structural changes in this part of the binary complex determine the fates of subspecies of the binary complex. Despite its widespread use in kinetic studies, the T7A1 promoter is not necessarily a typical one in terms of function. The binary complex at this promoter dissociates rapidly in the presence of heparin (12Metzger W. Schickor P. Meier T. Werel W. Heumann H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas many other such complexes are insensitive to the reagent. The heparin sensitivity of the binary complex at the T7A1 promoter was shown in the present study to be the result of rapid dissociation of the open binary complex and not to some allosteric effect of heparin peculiar to this complex. The same mechanism of heparin sensitivity was reported for the rrnBP1 promoter (24Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), which is one of the strongest promoters in vivo but rather weak under standard test conditions in vitro. Therefore, open binary complexes at these promoters equilibrate reversibly with their free components. These findings provide evidence against the widely held mistaken belief that all open complexes are irreversibly formed and resistant to heparin. The reversibility among subspecies of binary complex formed at the T7A1 promoter is intrinsically high as compared with the complexes formed at other promoters that generate dead-end complexes. Another atypical feature of this promoter is that it directs the synthesis of full-length products far more efficiently than do other promoters. It has been suggested that full-length transcript formation is stoichiometric with the amount of preformed binary complexes at the T7A1 promoter but not at other promoters (4Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In other words, the high efficiency is because of conversion of almost all binary complex into the elongation complex, whereas at other promoters only a fraction of binary complex achieve elongation, the rest being excluded. Indeed the nearly full conversion was confirmed for the T7A1 promoter by the results of DNA footprinting and mobility shift assays in this study. In contrast, only a quarter to half of all binary complex clears theλPRAL promoter (4Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 6Sen R. Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both the branched and sequential pathways could control the level of transcription in the multiple-round transcription that occurs in vivo. However, there are two distinct characteristics that are specific to the branched pathway. The formation of dead-end complex attenuates the level of transcription irrespective of the location of the rate-limiting step in transcription initiation, whereas in the sequential pathway, kinetic control is effective only at the rate-limiting step. Therefore, initiation could be regulated by the branched pathway, even if the rate-limiting step changes according to the physiological environment. The second special characteristic of the branched pathway is that it could amplify the effects of repressors and activators. For example, if a repressor inactivates RNA polymerase-promoter complex in the branched pathway, the inactivation could be maintained long after dissociation of the repressor, and the promoter could remain blocked until the arrest was relieved. Such persistent repression would prevent the formation of a queue of RNA polymerases in a transcription unit, which would be expected if regulation were the result of an arrest in elongation.

https://openalex.org/W1993158240,"The ATP-dependent three-strand exchange activity of the Streptococcus pneumoniae RecA protein (RecA(Sp)), like that of the Escherichia coliRecA protein (RecA(Ec)), is strongly stimulated by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) from either E. coli (SSB(Ec)) or S. pneumoniae (SSB(Sp)). The RecA(Sp) protein differs from the RecA(Ec) protein, however, in that its ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity is completely inhibited by SSB(Ec) or SSB(Sp) protein, apparently because these proteins displace RecA(Sp) protein from ssDNA. These results indicate that in contrast to the mechanism that has been established for the RecA(Ec) protein, SSB protein does not stimulate the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction by facilitating the formation of a presynaptic complex between the RecA(Sp) protein and the ssDNA substrate. In addition to acting presynaptically, however, it has been proposed that SSB(Ec) protein also stimulates the RecA(Ec) protein strand exchange reaction postsynaptically, by binding to the displaced single strand that is generated when the ssDNA substrate invades the homologous linear dsDNA. In the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted reaction, the stimulatory effect of SSB protein may be due entirely to this postsynaptic mechanism. The competing displacement of RecA(Sp) protein from the ssDNA substrate by SSB protein, however, appears to limit the efficiency of the strand exchange reaction (especially at high SSB protein concentrations or when SSB protein is added to the ssDNA before RecA(Sp) protein) relative to that observed under the same conditions with the RecA(Ec) protein.

In the RecA(Ec) protein-promoted three-strand exchange reaction, a circular ssDNA molecule and a homologous linear dsDNA molecule are recombined to form a nicked circular dsDNA molecule and a linear ssDNA molecule. This reaction proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, RecA(Ec) protein polymerizes onto the circular ssDNA (1 RecA monomer/3 nucleotides of ssDNA), forming a helical nucleoprotein filament known as the presynaptic complex. In the second phase, the presynaptic complex interacts with a homologous linear dsDNA molecule, and pairing between the circular ssDNA and the complementary strand from the linear dsDNA is initiated. In the third phase, the complementary linear strand is completely transferred to the circular ssDNA by unidirectional branch migration to yield the nicked circular dsDNA and displaced linear ssDNA products (6.Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three-strand exchange activity of the RecA(Ec) protein is stimulated by the E. coli SSB protein, a homotetrameric, non-sequence-specific, single-stranded DNA-binding protein that is involved in many aspects of DNA biochemistry (8.Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). It is believed thatE. coli SSB protein (SSB(Ec)) stimulates strand exchange, at least in part, by facilitating the binding of RecA(Ec) protein to the circular ssDNA substrate. This facilitated binding is thought to occur in two steps. First, SSB(Ec) protein binds to the circular ssDNA and melts out regions of secondary structure that otherwise impede the binding of RecA(Ec) protein. RecA(Ec) protein then displaces the SSB(Ec) protein from the ssDNA, leading to the formation of a presynaptic complex in which the circular ssDNA is completely covered by a continuous filament of RecA(Ec) protein (9.Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In our initial characterization of the RecA(Sp) protein, we found that its three-strand exchange activity was also strongly stimulated by SSB(Ec) protein (5.Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of transformational recombination, however, we realized that it was essential that we evaluate the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein in the presence of the cognate SSB protein from S. pneumoniae. Since an SSB protein had not been isolated and a gene encoding an SSB protein had not been reported for S. pneumoniae, we conducted a BLAST search for open reading frames in the S. pneumoniae genome with sequences similar to that of the SSB(Ec) protein. This search identified an open reading frame encoding a protein similar in size (157 amino acids) and in sequence (31% identical, 50% similar at the amino acid level) to the SSB(Ec) protein (178 amino acids). We cloned the open reading frame, developed an efficient overexpression system, and purified the corresponding protein to greater than 99% homogeneity. We found that the purified protein binds to ssDNA in a manner similar to that of the SSB(Ec) protein and also stimulates the RecA(Sp) and RecA(Ec) protein-promoted strand exchange reactions. These results established that the protein was an S. pneumoniae analog of the SSB(Ec) protein (10.Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the course of evaluating the S. pneumoniae SSB protein (SSB(Sp)), it became apparent that the effect of this protein (as well as that of the SSB(Ec) protein) on the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein was quite different from that seen with the RecA(Ec) protein. Our investigations into these differences provide insight into the mechanisms by which SSB proteins stimulate the RecA protein-promoted three-strand exchange reaction and are described in this report. S. pneumoniae RecA protein (5.Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar),E. coli RecA protein (11.Cotterill S.M. Satterthwait A.C. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4332-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and S. pneumoniae SSB protein (10.Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. E. coli SSB protein was from Promega. ATP, dATP, [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dATP, and dT200 were from Amersham Biosciences. Circular φX ssDNA(+strand) and circular φX dsDNA were from New England Biolabs. Linear φX dsDNA was prepared from circular φX dsDNA by PstI digestion as described (12.Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Single- and double-stranded φX DNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm using the conversion factors 36 and 50 μg ml−1 A 260−1, respectively. All DNA concentrations are expressed as total nucleotides. ATP and dATP hydrolysis reactions were measured using a thin layer chromatography method as previously described (13.Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The specific conditions that were used for each set of reactions are given in the relevant figure legends. The RecA(Sp) and RecA(Ec) proteins were analyzed for ATP-dependent three-strand exchange activity in the presence and absence of either SSB(Sp) or SSB(Ec) protein. In the three-strand exchange assay, a circular φX ssDNA molecule (5386 nucleotides) and a homologous linear φX dsDNA molecule (5386 base pairs) are recombined by RecA protein to form a nicked circular φX dsDNA molecule and a linear φX ssDNA molecule. The substrates and products of this reaction are readily monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis (12.Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The reaction solutions contained 5 μm circular φX ssDNA, 15 μm linear φX dsDNA (7.5 μm base pairs), 6 μm RecA protein (all RecA protein concentrations are given as monomer concentrations), and either 0 or 0.3 μm SSB protein (all SSB protein concentrations are given as tetramer concentrations). The strand exchange reactions were initiated by the addition of either linear dsDNA alone (with no SSB protein), or linear dsDNA followed by SSB protein. The strand exchange reactions that were promoted by the RecA(Ec) protein are shown in Fig. 1. The RecA(Ec) protein exhibited only a low level of strand exchange activity in the absence of SSB protein, with only a small amount of the circular ssDNA substrate being converted into the fully exchanged circular dsDNA product during the 120-min reaction period (Fig. 1). The reaction was much more efficient, however, in the presence of either SSB(Ec) protein (Fig. 1) or SSB(Sp) protein (gel not shown). In this reaction, partially exchanged DNA intermediates were visible within 4 min, and the fully exchanged circular dsDNA product was apparent within 10 min. Essentially all of the circular ssDNA substrate was converted into the circular dsDNA product by the end of the 120-min reaction period. These results confirm that the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Ec) protein is stimulated by either SSB(Ec) or SSB(Sp) protein. The strand exchange reactions that were promoted by the RecA(Sp) protein are also shown in Fig. 1. The RecA(Sp) protein exhibited no detectable ATP-dependent strand exchange activity in the absence of SSB protein (Fig. 1). The RecA(Sp) protein did promote a strand exchange reaction, however, when either SSB(Sp) protein (Fig. 1) or SSB(Ec) protein (gel not shown) was added to the reaction solution. Although the time required for the initial appearance of the partially exchanged intermediates and the fully exchanged circular dsDNA product was similar to that in the RecA(Ec) protein reaction, the yield of intermediates and fully exchanged product was significantly lower in the RecA(Sp) reaction. These results indicate that although the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein is strongly stimulated by either SSB(Sp) or SSB(Ec) protein, only a fraction of the circular ssDNA molecules are able to undergo strand exchange in the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted reaction. As noted in the Introduction, the SSB(Ec) protein is believed to stimulate the RecA(Ec) protein-promoted three-strand exchange reaction by facilitating the binding of RecA(Ec) protein to the circular ssDNA substrate. An experimental consequence of this SSB(Ec) protein-mediated increase in RecA(Ec) protein binding is that the observed rate of ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis increases when SSB(Ec) protein is added to the reaction solution (9.Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether SSB protein stimulates the strand exchange reaction of the RecA(Sp) protein in a similar manner, the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activities of the RecA(Sp) and RecA(Ec) proteins were measured in the presence and absence of SSB protein. The reaction solutions contained 5 μm φX ssDNA, 6 μm RecA protein, and either 0 or 0.3 μm SSB protein. Under these conditions (which simulate those used for the strand exchange reactions shown in Fig. 1), there is a sufficient amount of both RecA protein and SSB protein to cover all of the ssDNA present; maximal rates of ATP hydrolysis will be observed when the ssDNA is completely covered by RecA protein (linear φX dsDNA was not included in these reaction so that the effect of the SSB proteins on the RecA-φX ssDNA complexes could be monitored in the absence of an ongoing strand exchange reaction). As shown in Fig. 2, the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis by the RecA(Sp) protein in the absence of SSB protein was ∼20 μm min−1. Since the turnover number for ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by the RecA(Sp) protein (determined with ssDNA in excess relative to RecA(Sp) protein) is ∼35 min−1 (5.Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (data not shown), the maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis that would be expected under the conditions of the reaction shown in Fig. 2 (with 5 μm φX ssDNA) would be ∼58 μm min−1 (1.7 μmRecA(Sp) protein bound, assuming a maximum binding stoichiometry of 1 RecA monomer/3 nucleotides of ssDNA (6.Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Therefore, the observed rate of 20 μm min−1indicates that only about one-third of the φX ssDNA was covered with RecA(Sp) protein under the conditions in Fig. 2. Since the concentration of RecA(Sp) protein (6 μm) was ∼4-fold greater than that required to completely cover the ssDNA, the observed rate of ATP hydrolysis suggests that approximately two-thirds of the ssDNA was inaccessible to the RecA(Sp) protein, presumably due to the existence of secondary structure in the ssDNA that impedes RecA(Sp) protein binding (see Ref. 9.Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This conclusion is consistent with the RecA(Sp) protein titration curves shown in Fig. 3. When ATP hydrolysis was measured at a fixed concentration of φX ssDNA (5 μm), the observed rate of hydrolysis increased with increasing RecA(Sp) protein concentration until reaching a maximal value of 20–24 μmmin−1 at RecA(Sp) protein concentrations above 2 μm. By comparison, when a similar titration was performed with a fixed concentration of dT200 (5 μm) as the ssDNA effector (dT200 does not form secondary structure), the observed rate of ATP hydrolysis was much higher and approached values close to the expected maximum of 58 μmmin−1 at RecA(Sp) concentrations above 2 μm(Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the concentration of RecA(Sp) protein (6 μm) that was employed in the experiments shown in Fig. 2 was sufficient to cover all of the accessible binding sites in the φX ssDNA and indicate that the submaximal rate of ATP hydrolysis was due to only a limited amount of the φX ssDNA being available for RecA(Sp) protein binding.Figure 3Dependence of ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis on RecA protein concentration. The reaction solutions contained 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm Mg(acetate)2, 5 mm [α-32P]ATP, 5 μm circular φX ssDNA (open circles) or dT200 (closed circles) and the indicated concentrations of RecA(Sp) protein or RecA(Ec) protein. The final reaction solutions were incubated at 37 °C. The points represent initial rates of ATP hydrolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The initial rate of ATP hydrolysis by the RecA(Ec) protein in the absence of SSB protein was 18 μm min−1 (Fig. 2). Since the turnover number for ATP hydrolysis by the RecA(Ec) protein is ∼22 min−1 (14.Nayak S. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25979-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (data not shown), the maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis that would be expected under the conditions of the reaction shown in Fig. 2 (with 5 μm φX ssDNA) would be ∼37 μm min−1 (1.7 μmRecA(Ec) protein bound). Therefore, the observed rate of 18 μm min−1 indicates that approximately one-half of the φX ssDNA was covered with RecA(Ec) protein under the conditions in Fig. 2. Since the concentration of RecA(Ec) protein (6 μm) was again 4-fold greater than that required to completely cover the ssDNA, the observed rate of hydrolysis suggests that approximately one-half of the ssDNA was inaccessible to the RecA(Ec) protein. This conclusion is consistent with the RecA(Ec) protein titration curves in Fig. 3, which show that when ATP hydrolysis was measured at a fixed concentration of φX ssDNA (5 μm) and increasing concentrations of RecA(Ec) protein, the observed rate of hydrolysis only reached a value of 20–24 μm min−1, whereas when a similar titration was performed with dT200 (5 μm), the rate reached the expected maximum of 37 μmmin−1. The time courses of the ATP hydrolysis reactions that were catalyzed by the RecA(Ec) and RecA(Sp) proteins in the presence of SSB protein are also shown in Fig. 2 (SSB protein was added to the otherwise complete reaction solution at 10 min). The initial rate of ATP hydrolysis by the RecA(Ec) protein increased from 18 to 37 μmmin−1 when either SSB(Ec) protein (Fig. 2) or SSB(Sp) protein (not shown) was added to the reaction solution. This rate is equivalent to the expected maximal value of 37 μmmin−1 and indicates that both SSB proteins are able to facilitate the binding of RecA(Ec) protein to φX ssDNA such that essentially all of the φX ssDNA is covered with RecA(Ec) protein when either SSB protein is added to the reaction solution. In contrast, the ATP hydrolysis activity of the RecA(Sp) protein was completely inhibited as soon as either SSB(Sp) protein (Fig. 2) or SSB(Ec) protein (not shown) was added to the reaction solution. The total elimination of ATP hydrolysis activity suggests that the SSB proteins act not to facilitate the binding of RecA(Sp) protein but rather to displace the RecA(Sp) protein from the φX ssDNA. To test the idea that the RecA(Sp) protein is unable to compete with SSB protein for binding to φX ssDNA, a ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction was carried out in which the φX ssDNA was incubated with SSB(Sp) protein before the RecA(Sp) protein was added to the reaction solution. As shown in Fig. 2, there was no ATP hydrolysis when this order of addition was followed, indicating that the RecA(Sp) protein was unable to displace SSB(Sp) protein from the φX ssDNA. Equivalent results were obtained with the SSB(Ec) protein (not shown). In contrast, the RecA(Ec) protein exhibited ATP hydrolysis activity even when it was added to the reaction solution after the φX ssDNA had been incubated with SSB(Ec) protein (Fig. 2) or SSB(Sp) protein (not shown). There was a delay in ATP hydrolysis with this order of addition, however, presumably reflecting the time-dependent displacement of SSB(Ec) protein from the ssDNA by the RecA(Ec) protein (Fig. 2). The results in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein is strongly stimulated by the SSB(Sp) protein. The results in Fig. 2, however, show that the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the RecA(Sp) protein is completely inhibited by SSB(Sp) protein. In order to clarify the relationship between the ATP hydrolysis and strand exchange activities of the RecA(Sp) protein, the time course of ATP hydrolysis during an ongoing RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction was determined (Fig. 4). The reaction conditions were identical to those described for the strand exchange reactions shown in Fig. 1 (either linear dsDNA alone (no SSB protein) or linear dsDNA followed by SSB protein were added to the otherwise complete reaction solution at 10 min). As shown in Fig. 4, the RecA(Sp) protein-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis reaction proceeded at an observed rate of ∼20 μmmin−1 during the initial 10-min incubation period. When linear dsDNA alone was added to the reaction solution, there was little change in the rate of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 4), and no strand exchange occurred (Fig. 1). In contrast, when the addition of linear dsDNA was followed by SSB(Sp) protein, the rate of ATP hydrolysis began to decrease immediately, resulting in the complete cessation of ATP hydrolysis within 20 min (Fig. 4). A comparison of this ATP hydrolysis time course with the time course of the strand exchange reaction (Fig. 1) shows that the strand exchange products were formed in the 20-min time period following the addition of SSB(Sp) protein. The ATP hydrolysis activity of the RecA(Ec) protein under strand exchange conditions is also shown in Fig. 4. In contrast to the results that were obtained with the RecA(Sp) protein, the initial rate of the RecA(Ec) protein-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis reaction was higher when both linear dsDNA and SSB(Ec) protein were added to the reaction solution (36 μm min−1) than when linear dsDNA alone was added (27 μm min−1). Furthermore, the RecA(Ec) protein-promoted ATP hydrolysis reaction continued for at least 120 min in the presence of SSB(Ec) protein (Fig. 4), although most of the strand exchange products were formed within the first 30 min of the reaction (Fig. 1). A comparison of the results in Figs. 2 and 4 indicates that the SSB(Sp) protein-mediated inhibition of the RecA(Sp) protein-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis reaction that was observed under strand exchange conditions (Fig. 4) was not as immediate as that observed with ssDNA alone (Fig. 2). This indicates that the RecA(Sp) protein may not be as readily displaced from a complex containing both ssDNA and dsDNA as it is from a complex containing only ssDNA. It is apparent that SSB(Sp) protein does effect some change in the RecA(Sp)-ssDNA-dsDNA complex, however, since strand exchange does not occur until SSB(Sp) protein is added to the reaction solution. The eventual cessation of ATP hydrolysis indicates that the RecA(Sp) protein does not bind to the displaced linear ssDNA that is generated during the strand exchange reaction (or remain associated with the circular dsDNA reaction product). Instead, since RecA(Sp) protein is unable to compete with SSB protein for ssDNA binding under these conditions (Fig. 2), it is likely that the displaced linear ssDNA (as well as any unreacted circular ssDNA substrate) will be covered by SSB protein. In the RecA(Ec) protein-promoted reaction, in contrast, the continuing ATP hydrolysis reaction that is observed after the completion of the strand exchange reaction may arise from RecA(Ec) protein bound to the displaced linear ssDNA (since RecA(Ec) protein can compete with SSB protein for ssDNA binding under these conditions) or from RecA(Ec) protein that remains associated with the circular dsDNA reaction product (15.Ullsperger C.J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10859-10866Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To more clearly define the conditions under which the SSB(Sp) protein is able to displace RecA(Sp) protein from the φX ssDNA substrate, a strand exchange reaction was carried out in which SSB(Sp) protein was added to the reaction solution after the φX ssDNA had been incubated with RecA(Sp) protein but before the homologous linear dsDNA had been added to initiate the strand exchange reaction. There was no detectable strand exchange reaction when this order of addition was followed, indicating that the SSB(Sp) protein was able to displace the RecA(Sp) protein from the φX ssDNA during the time period before the linear dsDNA was added to the reaction solution (gel not shown). There also was no detectable strand exchange when the φX ssDNA was incubated with SSB(Sp) protein before the RecA(Sp) protein was added to the reaction solution (Fig. 5), indicating that the RecA(Sp) protein was unable to displace the SSB(Sp) protein from the φX ssDNA. The RecA(Ec) protein, in contrast, exhibited strand exchange activity even when it was added to the reaction solution after the φX ssDNA had been incubated with SSB(Ec) protein (Fig. 5). There was a delay in the formation of the circular dsDNA product, however, when this order of addition was followed (the formation of circular dsDNA was not apparent until 20–30 min, compared with 10 min for the reaction in Fig. 2), presumably reflecting the time-dependent displacement of SSB(Ec) protein from the φX ssDNA by the RecA(Ec) protein prior to the initiation of strand exchange (Fig. 5). The results described above indicate that the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein is both stimulated and inhibited by SSB(Sp) protein. To characterize these competing effects further, a series of strand exchange reactions was carried out in which the concentrations of circular φX ssDNA (5 μm), linear φX dsDNA (15 μm), and RecA protein (6 μm) were kept constant, and the concentration of SSB protein was varied from 0 to 3 μm (the concentration of SSB(Sp) or SSB(Ec) protein required to saturate the φX ssDNA (5 μm) under our reaction conditions was ∼0.3 μm). 2S. E. Steffen and F. R. Bryant, unpublished results. As shown in Fig. 6, the efficiency of the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction increased as the concentration of SSB(Sp) protein was increased from 0 to 0.3 μm (the concentration used in the reaction shown in Fig. 1) and then decreased markedly as the SSB(Sp) protein concentration was increased further from 0.3 to 3.0 μm. These results indicate that the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein is stimulated optimally by moderate concentrations of SSB(Sp) protein (roughly equivalent to that required to saturate the ssDNA substrate) and that higher concentrations of SSB(Sp) protein act to counter this stimulatory effect. By comparison, the maximal level of strand exchange by the RecA(Ec) protein was achieved with 0.05 μm SSB(Ec) protein, and the efficiency of the reaction remained undiminished even at the highest SSB(Ec) protein concentration examined (3 μm) (Fig. 6). The results described above indicate that the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction is stimulated by SSB(Sp) protein only if (i) the SSB(Sp) protein is present at moderate concentrations and (ii) it is added to the reaction solution after the RecA(Sp) protein has been allowed to associate with both the circular φX ssDNA and linear φX dsDNA substrates. Even under optimal conditions, however, the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction does not proceed to the same extent as the RecA(Ec) protein-promoted reaction (Fig. 6), presumably because the SSB(Sp) protein displaces the RecA(Sp) protein from a significant fraction of the circular φX ssDNA molecules, rendering them inactive in strand exchange. We have shown, however, that the RecA(Ec) protein binds more tightly to ssDNA in the presence of dATP than with ATP (16.Katz F.S. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11082-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (also see Refs. 17.Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and 18.Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5871-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and this suggested to us that the RecA(Sp) protein might be able to compete more favorably with SSB protein if dATP were used in place of ATP as the nucleotide cofactor. To test this idea, we examined the ssDNA-dependent NTP hydrolysis and strand exchange activities of the RecA(Sp) protein in the presence of dATP. The RecA(Sp) protein-catalyzed dATP hydrolysis reactions were carried out under the same conditions as the ATP hydrolysis reactions shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 7, the initial rate of dATP hydrolysis by the RecA(Sp) protein in the absence of SSB(Sp) protein was 38 μm min−1. Since the turnover number for dATP hydrolysis by the RecA(Sp) protein is ∼44 min−1 (5.Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the maximal rate of dATP hydrolysis that would be expected under the conditions of the reactions shown in Fig. 7 (with 5 μm φX ssDNA) would be ∼75 μmmin−1 (1.7 μm RecA(Sp) protein bound). Therefore, the observed rate of 38 μm min−1indicates that approximately one-half of the φX ssDNA was covered with RecA(Sp) protein under the conditions in Fig. 7. In contrast to the results that were obtained with ATP, however, the rate of the RecA(Sp) protein-catalyzed dATP hydrolysis reaction increased to 68 μm min−1 when SSB(Sp) protein was added to the reaction solution (Fig. 7). This rate is close to the expected maximal value of 75 μm min−1 and indicates that essentially all of the φX ssDNA was covered with RecA(Sp) protein under these conditions (the decrease in dATP hydrolysis after 60 min is probably due to the accumulation of dADP in the reaction solution). Furthermore, the RecA(Sp) protein exhibited dATP hydrolysis activity even when the φX ssDNA was incubated with SSB(Sp) protein before the RecA(Sp) protein was added to the reaction solution (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the RecA(Sp) protein can displace SSB(Sp) protein from the φX ssDNA when dATP is present in the reaction solution. This conclusion is consistent with the strand exchange reactions shown in Fig. 8. In contrast to the results that were obtained with ATP, the RecA(Sp) protein exhibited dATP-dependent strand exchange activity when it was incubated with the φX ssDNA before SSB(Sp) protein was added to the reaction solution and when it was added to the reaction solution after the φX ssDNA had been incubated with SSB(Sp) protein (there was no detectable dATP-dependent strand exchange activity in the absence of SSB protein (gel not shown)).Figure 8Comparison of ATP and dATP as cofactors for RecA(Sp) protein-promoted three-strand exchange reaction. The reaction solutions contained 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mmMg(acetate)2, 5 μm circular φX ssDNA, 15 μm linear φX dsDNA, 6 μm RecA(Sp) protein, 0.3 μm SSB(Sp) protein, and 5 mm ATP or dATP, as indicated. The reactions were initiated by the addition of RecA protein followed by SSB protein (RecA/SSB) or by the addition of SSB protein followed by RecA protein (SSB/RecA) to the otherwise complete reaction solutions. The final reaction solutions were incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times (min), aliquots (20 μl) were removed from each reaction solution and quenched with SDS (1% final concentration)/EDTA (15 mm final concentration). The quenched aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SSB protein 3Since the effects of the SSB(Ec) and SSB(Sp) proteins on the NTP hydrolysis and strand exchange activities of the RecA(Ec) and RecA(Sp) proteins were experimentally indistinguishable (see “Results”), we will refer to these two proteins collectively as “SSB protein” under “Discussion.” has been shown to stimulate the RecA(Ec) protein-promoted three-strand exchange reaction by removing secondary structure from the circular ssDNA substrate, thereby allowing the ssDNA to be more completely coated by RecA(Ec) protein (9.Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This increase in RecA(Ec) protein binding is reflected by an increase in the observed rate of ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis when SSB protein is added to the reaction solution (9.Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The RecA(Sp) protein differs dramatically from the RecA(Ec) protein, however, in that its ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity is completely inhibited by SSB protein, apparently because SSB protein displaces the RecA(Sp) protein from the ssDNA. Nevertheless, the ATP-dependent three-strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein is strongly stimulated by SSB protein. These results indicate that, in contrast to the mechanism that has been established for the RecA(Ec) protein, SSB protein does not stimulate the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction by increasing the binding of RecA(Sp) protein to the circular ssDNA substrate. In addition to facilitating the formation of the presynaptic RecA(Ec)-ssDNA complex, it has been reported that SSB protein also stimulates the RecA(Ec) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction postsynaptically, by binding to the partially displaced linear single strand that is generated when the circular ssDNA invades the homologous linear dsDNA. The binding of SSB protein is believed to enhance the formation of the initial DNA pairing intermediates, prevent secondary DNA pairing reactions (which may arise from the invasion of the partially displaced strand into a second dsDNA molecule), and drive the reaction forward to the formation of the completely exchanged circular dsDNA product (19.Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Azhderian E. Gonda D.K. Radding C.M. Flory J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20.Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

Since our results clearly indicate that SSB protein will bind to ssDNA in the presence of the RecA(Sp) protein, it is reasonable to propose that the stimulatory effect of SSB protein on the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction may be due to the postsynaptic binding of the displaced single strand of the dsDNA substrate. The SSB protein-stimulated strand exchange reaction of the RecA(Sp) protein is curious inasmuch as the rate of ATP hydrolysis that was measured prior to the addition of SSB protein indicated that only about one-third of the circular φX ssDNA substrate was covered by RecA(Sp) protein (presumably as a result of secondary structure in the ssDNA that impedes RecA(Sp) protein binding; see Ref. 9.Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). If the φX ssDNA substrate was only partially covered by RecA(Sp) protein (and if SSB protein does not facilitate the binding of additional RecA(Sp) protein to the ssDNA), it is not clear how the circular dsDNA and linear ssDNA strand exchange products would be able to form, since it is generally believed that the ssDNA substrate has to be completely covered with a continuous filament of RecA protein before strand exchange can occur (6.Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 570-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possibility is that a distribution of RecA(Sp)-ssDNA complexes exists under our reaction conditions, some of which are much more covered by RecA(Sp) protein and others that are much less covered (with the average coverage being approximately one-third). Those φX ssDNA molecules that are more covered by RecA(Sp) protein would be more likely to interact with the homologous linear dsDNA substrate; SSB protein may then activate these complexes for strand exchange by binding to the displaced strand of the linear dsDNA substrate. Those φX ssDNA molecules that are less covered by RecA(Sp) protein, on the other hand, would not interact effectively with the linear dsDNA substrate; SSB protein may act to displace the RecA(Sp) protein from these φX ssDNA molecules, thereby rendering them inactive for strand exchange. This scenario would account for our results, which showed that although the time required for the initial appearance of partially exchanged intermediates and fully exchanged products was similar to that observed with the RecA(Ec) protein, only a fraction of the φX ssDNA substrate molecules were converted to intermediates and products in the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction. With the RecA(Ec) protein, in contrast, SSB protein would not only enhance the strand exchange reactivity of those φX ssDNA molecules that were initially covered by RecA(Ec) protein (by binding to the displaced strand of the linear dsDNA substrate) but would also facilitate the binding of additional RecA(Ec) protein to those φX ssDNA molecules that were initially less covered by RecA(Ec) protein, thereby activating these ssDNAs for strand exchange as well. As a result, essentially all of the circular φX ssDNA substrate is converted to the fully exchanged dsDNA product in the RecA(Ec) protein-promoted reaction. The competing stimulatory and inhibitory effects of SSB protein that are proposed above are consistent with the pronounced dependence of the RecA(Sp) protein-promoted strand exchange reaction on SSB protein concentration. If the concentration of SSB protein is too low, there will not be enough SSB protein to bind all of the displaced single strands, and only a limited amount of strand exchange will occur. If the SSB protein concentration is too high, however, SSB protein may displace the RecA(Sp) protein from the ssDNA substrate before strand exchange can be initiated. The optimum SSB protein concentration probably represents a concentration high enough to activate most of the RecA(Sp)-ssDNA-dsDNA complexes, while low enough to minimize the rate of the competitive displacement of RecA(Sp) protein from the ssDNA substrate. Even so, no ATP-dependent strand exchange is observed (even at the optimal SSB protein concentration) if (i) the ssDNA substrate is incubated with SSB protein before the RecA(Sp) protein is added to the reaction solution or (ii) the SSB protein is added to the RecA(Sp)-ssDNA complex before linear dsDNA is added to the reaction solution. In these cases, the SSB protein would either prevent the RecA(Sp) protein from binding to the ssDNA (case i), or displace the RecA(Sp) protein from the ssDNA before strand exchange can be initiated (case ii). The RecA(Ec) protein, in contrast, is able to promote strand exchange efficiently in the presence of high concentrations of SSB protein and regardless of the order in which the RecA(Ec) and SSB(Ec) proteins are added to the reaction solution. In contrast to the inhibitory effects that were observed on the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction, SSB protein had a stimulatory effect on the RecA(Sp) protein-catalyzed hydrolysis of dATP. When RecA(Sp) protein was incubated with φX ssDNA in the presence of dATP and SSB protein, the rate of the ensuing dATP hydrolysis reaction was close to that which would be expected if the φX ssDNA was completely covered by RecA(Sp) protein. We recently found that RecA(Ec) protein binds to ssDNA much more tightly in the presence of dATP than with ATP (16.Katz F.S. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11082-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and preliminary experiments indicate that the RecA(Sp) protein behaves in a similar manner. 4F. S. Katz and F. R. Bryant, unpublished results. It is likely that the tighter binding that is induced by dATP allows the RecA(Sp) protein to compete favorably with SSB protein for binding to ssDNA, and as a result, the RecA(Sp) protein is able to completely cover φX ssDNA when SSB protein is added to the reaction solution. Consistent with this conclusion, the RecA(Sp) protein is able to catalyze dATP hydrolysis and to promote dATP-dependent strand exchange, even when the circular ssDNA substrate is incubated with SSB protein before the RecA(Sp) protein is added to the reaction solution. Thus, the RecA(Sp) protein behaves in a manner similar to that of the RecA(Ec) protein, when dATP is provided as the nucleotide cofactor. The biochemical properties of the RecA(Sp) protein are intriguing when considered in the context of the mechanism of transformational recombination. It has been reported that when ssDNA is transported into the S. pneumoniae cell during transformation, it is coated by an SSB-like protein that protects it from degradation by cellular nucleases (21.Morrison D.A. Baker M.F. Nature. 1979; 282: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Presumably, this SSB-like protein (which has not yet been characterized) must be displaced from the ssDNA by RecA(Sp) protein before the ssDNA can be integrated into the S. pneumoniae chromosome. If this SSB-like protein (M r ∼19,500, as estimated by SDS-PAGE mobility (21.Morrison D.A. Baker M.F. Nature. 1979; 282: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) and the SSB(Sp) protein (M r = 17,400 (10.Steffen S.E. Bryant F.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)) are the same protein, however, it is not clear how a RecA(Sp)-ssDNA complex would be able to form, since our results indicate that the RecA(Sp) protein is unable to displace SSB(Sp) protein from ssDNA, at least in the presence of the presumed natural cofactor, ATP. It is possible that either our experimental conditions do not adequately mimic the conditions inside the S. pneumoniae cell, or dATP is somehow able to serve as a cofactor for the RecA(Sp) protein in vivo. It is also conceivable that the inhibition of ssDNA binding by the SSB(Sp) protein may serve as a regulatory mechanism and that the assembly of a RecA(Sp)-ssDNA filament may require other recombinational accessory proteins. Alternatively, an inspection of the S. pneumoniaegenome sequence reveals that in addition to the gene encoding the SSB(Sp) protein described here (designated ssb in the genome sequence), there is a second gene (designated ssbB in the genome sequence) that also appears to encode an SSB-like protein (22.Tettelin H. Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Eisen J.A. Read R.D. Peterson S. Heidelberg J. DeBoy R.T. Haft D.H. Dodson R.J. Durkin A.S. Gwinn M. Kolonay J.F. Nelson W.C.

A recent genetic study indicates that the ssbB gene (referred to as cil A in the study) may be part of a competence-induced operon, suggesting that it may play a role in transformational recombination (24.Campbell E.A. Choi S.Y. Masure R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although the predicted molecular weight of the ssbB protein is only 14,800 (as calculated from the gene sequence), it is conceivable that it is the same protein as the SSB-like protein that was previously identified as being associated with the exogenous ssDNA during transformational recombination (24.Campbell E.A. Choi S.Y. Masure R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It will therefore be of interest to examine the effect of the ssbB protein on the strand exchange activity of the RecA(Sp) protein. The isolation and characterization of the ssbB protein are in progress."

Given that blockade of αv-integrins during angiogenesis induces p53 activity, we utilized p53 null mice to elucidate whether loss of p53 can compensate for αv-integrin function in neovascularization of the retina. Murine retinal vascularization was inhibited by systemic administration of an αv-integrin antagonist. In contrast, mice lacking p53 were refractory to this treatment, indicating that neovascularization in normal mice depends on αv-integrin-mediated suppression of p53. Blockade of αv-integrins during neovascularization resulted in an induction of p21CIP1 in wild type and, surprisingly, in p53 null retinas, indicating that αv-integrin ligation regulates p21CIP1 levels in a p53-independent manner. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time an in vivointracellular mechanism for compensation of integrin function and that p53 and αv-integrins act in concert during retinal neovascularization. αv-Integrin antagonists block neovascularization in various species, whereas 20% of αv-integrin null mice are born with many normal looking blood vessels.

In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time an in vivointracellular mechanism for compensation of integrin function and that p53 and αv-integrins act in concert during retinal neovascularization. We previously found that integrin αvβ3 is preferentially expressed on newly forming blood vessels and is functionally involved in controlling angiogenesis stimulated by basic fibroblast growth factor or tumor necrosis factor-α, whereas another αv-integrin, αvβ5, is functional in vessel formation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor or transforming growth factor-α (1.Brooks P.C.

Importantly, antagonists of αv-integrins block neovascularization in various animal models with or without exogenous angiogenic stimulation, including chick chorioallantois, in mouse retina, and in human skin trans- plants in SCID mice, causing apoptosis of proliferating, angiogenic vascular cells (3.Brooks P.C.

This suggests that during vessel formation, αv-integrins promote signaling events ultimately promoting vascular cell survival, thereby facilitating neovascularization. However, whereas 80% of αv-integrin null mice die in mid-gestation, 20% of these mice survive until 1 day after birth (9.Bader B.L. Rayburn H. Crowley D. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1998; 95: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Similarly, combinatorial gene knockout of integrin β3 and β5 subunits in mice results in enhanced angiogenesis under certain conditions (10.Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This indicates either that mice lacking integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5could compensate for the function of αv-integrins in blood vessel formation or that a function of vascular αv-integrins, once expressed but blocked or unligated, is to inhibit neovascularization. However, at present it is not known whether possible compensatory or redundant mechanisms can mediate blood vessel formation in the absence of functional αv-integrins. p53+/− mice (11.Jacks T. Remington L. Williams B.O. Schmitt E.M. Halachmi S. Bronson R.T. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar) were used to set up p53+/− × p53−/− breeding pairs. Littermates from such matings were used in the neovascularization assay, and genomic DNA from mouse tails was genotyped for p53 by a 3-primer assay as described previously (12.Fotedar R. Brickner H.

Newborn mice were injected subcutaneously twice daily, starting within 8 h after birth with 40 μg of cyclo-RGDfV (αv antagonist peptide 66203) or cyclo-RADfV (control peptide 69601) (lowercase denotes d-amino acids) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The cyclo-RGDfV peptide binds specifically with high affinity to αvβ3- and αvβ5-integrins and blocks their function both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the cyclo-RADfV peptide is non-functional (3.Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 7.Friedlander M. Theesfeld C.L. Sugita M.

After 2–3 days, the eye globes were taken out, fixed in cold methanol for 10 min followed by 6 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, dissected, stained for collagen type IV, and photographed as previously described (7.Friedlander M. Theesfeld C.L. Sugita M. Fruttiger M. Thomas M.A. Chang S. Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9764-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The distance from the head of the optic nerve to the edge of the retinal vasculature at 6–8 different representative points was measured for each retina on the photographs, and the mean vascular radius was calculated. The mean vascular area between the two retinas in each animal was then calculated, assuming a circular shape of the vasculature. Without treatment, no difference in vascular areas was observed between p53 heterozygous and p53 null mice, and therefore, to standardize and compare the results from different litters, the mean retinal vascular area in p53 null mice in each litter was considered to represent a fully developed vasculature. All p53 genotyping and measurements of the retinal vasculature were performed in a double-blind fashion to avoid any bias. For measurements of wild type retinas, the mean vascular area of control treated retinas was considered as fully developed and compared with anti-αv-treated retinas within the same litters. For Western blot analysis, retinas were fixed only in cold methanol and dissected. Retinas were then lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation buffer and analyzed by Western blot as previously described (5.Strömblad S. Becker J.C. Yebra Y. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) using 1 μg/ml anti-p21CIP1WAF-1/CIP-1polyclonal antibodies (ab-5, Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), anti-αv cytoplasmic tail polyclonal antibodies (Chemicon), or anti-actin monoclonal antibody JLA20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Interestingly, inhibition of angiogenesis by blockade of αv-integrins is accompanied by an induction of endothelial cell p53 activity (5.Strömblad S. Becker J.C. Yebra Y. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Based on this, we hypothesized that loss of p53 might compensate for αv-integrin function during neovascularization. To examine this possibility, we analyzed p53 null mice, where the effect of a specific αv-integrin antagonist was studied on retinal neovascularization. Mouse retinal neovascularization occurs during the first days after birth, and therefore, newborn mice were treated with an αv-integrin antagonist as described (7.Friedlander M. Theesfeld C.L. Sugita M. Fruttiger M. Thomas M.A. Chang S. Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9764-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The retinal vasculature in wild type newborn mice treated for 3 days with the αv-antagonist was significantly less developed than retinas from control treated mice (Table I). When accounting for the retinal vascular area already existing when the treatment started, the inhibition was close to 100%, in accordance with our previous observations after 4 days of treatment (7.Friedlander M. Theesfeld C.L. Sugita M. Fruttiger M. Thomas M.A. Chang S. Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9764-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Targeted p53 null males were then mated with p53 heterozygous females. This type of mating was not only necessary for sufficient embryonic survival but also allowed for a comparison of p53 null mice with heterozygous mice within the same litter in a double-blind fashion, including animals of exactly the same age receiving identical treatment. No difference in retinal vascularization could be observed between p53 null and heterozygous mice during the first 3 days (data not shown). In addition, no difference in degree of neovascularization between p53 null and heterozygous mice could be observed after control treatment (Fig. 1B and Table I). This indicates that p53 does not influence normal vascularization of the retina. We then treated entire litters of newborn mice of a mixed genotype (see above) with the αv-integrin antagonist. Interestingly, p53 heterozygous animals had a markedly less developed retinal vasculature compared with p53 null mice when treated with the αv-antagonist (Fig. 1 and Table I). Statistical analysis of measurements performed on the vascular area of these retinas revealed that the vascular development in anti-αv-treated p53 heterozygous was suppressed, a suppression that was found to be statistically significant (p = 5.7 × 10−7) when compared with p53 null animals in the same litters receiving identical treatment (Table I). This result closely resembled the difference seen between retinas from antagonistversus control treated wild type mice (Table I). Taken together, these findings indicate that although p53 expression does not influence normal neovascularization, loss of p53 compensates for the function of αv-integrins in neovascularization.Table IStatistical evaluation of the effect on retinal vascular development by treatment with an αv-integrin antagonistTreatmentp53 genotype% undeveloped vasculature (± S.D.)np value (t-test)Control peptide−/−0 ± 289+/−−5 ± 27130.68αv antagonist peptide−/− +/−0 ± 14 34 ± 1514 175.7 × 10−7Control peptidewt0 ± 7.48αvantagonistwt42 ± 9.481.8 × 10−9Statistical evaluation of measured retinal vascular areas.

All measurements and genotyping were performed in a double-blind fashion. A possible explanation for the lack of response to the αv-integrin antagonist in p53 null mice could be deficient retinal integrin αv expression. To test this possibility, retinal lysates were analyzed for αv protein levels by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, αv-integrin levels in p53 null retinas do not differ from that in p53 heterozygous mice. Another possibility for a lack of response to the αv antagonist in p53 null mice could be that cells lacking p53 are insensitive to this treatment because of alterations in αv-integrin function at the cell surface. To examine this possibility, we examined αv-integrin function of mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53, including their responsiveness to the αv-integrin antagonist and compared them to mouse fibroblasts expressing p53. As shown in Fig. 2B, the responsiveness to the antagonist in inhibiting αv-dependent attachment to vitronectin was virtually identical in p53 null fibroblasts and the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3, demonstrating that lack of p53 does not cause a general insensitivity to αv-integrin antagonists. These findings reveal that loss of p53 does not affect expression levels or general function of αv-integrins. Instead, we conclude that intracellular events involving p53 mediate the inhibition of neovascularization by αv antagonists, events that may be related to the activation of endothelial cell p53 that we previously observed upon αv-integrin blockage during angiogenesis (5.Strömblad S. Becker J.C. Yebra Y. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). p53 is a known activator of the cell cycle suppressor p21CIP1. In fact, in addition to regulating p53, ligation of integrin αvβ3 in endothelial cells also suppresses p21CIP1 protein levels during angiogenesis (5.Strömblad S. Becker J.C. Yebra Y. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In UV-irradiated fibroblasts, p53 exerts its functional effect on cell cycle arrest by transcriptional activation of the Cdk inhibitor p21CIP1 (14.El-Diery W. Harper J.W. O'Connor P.M. Velculescu V.E. Canman C.E. Jackman J. Pietenpol J.A. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Wang Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1169-1174PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, blockade of αv-integrin during neovascularization induces p21CIP1 levels in wild type and in p53 heterozygous retinas. Surprisingly, whereas untreated p53 null mice display no detectable p21CIP1, the numeric increase in p21CIP1 levels by anti-αvtreatment of these mice is similar to what is observed in wild type mice, resulting in a higher relative increase. This indicates that the regulation of p21CIP1 by integrin αv during neovascularization is independent of p53. Furthermore, the fact that p21CIP1 is induced in p53 null retinas upon blockade of αv-integrins while neovascularization is still active suggests that this induction of p21CIP1 is not sufficient to block neovascularization, although we cannot exclude that the somewhat higher total levels of p21CIP1 in heterozygous animals might contribute to this blockade. Studies using targeted gene knockout mice have in some cases revealed surprising results in that expected phenotypes were not found. This is particularly surprising for molecules found to play a role in certain in vivo events by previous loss of function studies, including for integrin αv and the capacity for at least 20% of αv-integrin null mice to form blood vessels (9.Bader B.L. Rayburn H. Crowley D. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1998; 95: 507-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and for the capacity of integrin β3 and β5subunit combinatorial gene knockouts to support enhanced pathological angiogenesis (10.Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In some cases, combinatorial knockout of two or three related genes has demonstrated compensatory mechanisms by displaying phenotypes missing in single gene knockout mice. However, it is unclear as to how the functions of αv-integrins can be compensated for. To this end, although it does not represent the only possible mechanism of αv-integrin compensation, our finding that p53 null mice form blood vessels in the absence of functional αv-integrins that are critical in wild type mice reveals the first in vivo example of an intracellular mechanism that is able to compensate for loss of integrin function. Alternatively, the function of αv-integrins in neovascularization in wild type animals may be to negatively regulate and balance vessel formation in an unfavorable extracellular matrix environment in order to prevent angiogenesis in inappropriate locations. Such a function of αv-integrins would then lead to enhanced angiogenesis when αvβ3 is lacking as suggested by Reynolds et al. (10.Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In support of this model, caspase-8 was activated at the cell surface in other cell types by unligated integrin αvβ3, thereby causing apoptosis (15.Stupack D.G. Puente X.S. Boutsaboualoy S. Storgard C.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This mechanism might be related to p53, because caspase-8 plays a role in certain p53-induced apoptosis (16.Ding H.-F. Lin Y.-L. McGill G. Juo P. Zhu H. Bleni J. Yuan J. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38905-38911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in both alternative models for the function of αv-integrins, our results suggest that p53 may mediate αv-integrin regulation of cell survival during neovascularization. Neovascularization is a critical component of tumor growth, where a tumor is unable to grow beyond a minimal size without new blood vessels (17.Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7153) Google Scholar). In fact, we previously observed that αv-integrin antagonists could block the growth of human tumors in animal models (3.Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar,4.Brooks P.C. Strömblad S. Klemke R. Visscher D. Sarkar F.H. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In addition, uncontrolled ocular neovascularization is a major cause of blindness in various ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, and age-related macular degeneration. Integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 may be involved in the regulation of neovascularization of these diseases as systemic treatment with αv-integrin antagonists block retinal neovascularization (7.Friedlander M. Theesfeld C.L. Sugita M. Fruttiger M. Thomas M.A. Chang S. Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9764-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 8.Hammes H.-P. Brownlee M. Jonczyk A. Sutter A. Preissner K.T. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This suggests that αv-integrin antagonists constitute a potential therapy for ocular diseases and cancer. Our findings indicate that the molecular mechanism for this potential anti-angiogenic treatment actively involves p53, similar to what was recently indicated for angiostatin and TNP-470 (18.Jimenéz B. Volpert O.V. Crawford S.E. Febbraio M. Silverstein R.L. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 19.Zhang Y.E.C. Griffit E.C. Sage J. Jacks T. Liu J.O. Proc.

A. 2000; 97: 12782-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect apoptosis in the retinal vasculature because of an obscuring background with a large number of apoptotic cells in the whole mounts of developing retinas with no apparent differences between the groups (data not shown). However, previous studies in other models clearly demonstrate that blocking of αv-integrins during neovascularization leads to vascular cell apoptosis (3.Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 5.Strömblad S. Becker J.C. Yebra Y. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This suggests that the inhibition of vessel formation by αvantagonists may be caused by induction of apoptosis of the forming vascular cells, and the fact that vascular formation in p53 null mice is refractory to αv antagonist treatment suggests that these vessels do not undergo apoptosis (Fig. 3). Whereas p53 may mediate αv-integrin-regulated apoptosis in vascular cells, induction of p53 by loss of integrin ligation does not constitute a generic mechanism for regulation of cell survival in all cells and by all integrins. For example, ligation of integrin α3β1 in an in vitro model of mammary epithelial cells lead to apoptosis only in the absence of functional p53 (21.Seewaldt V.L. Mrózek K. Sigle R. Dietze E.C. Heine K. Hockenbery D.M. Hobbs K.B. Caldwell L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 471-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a mechanism that appears to be the opposite of our findings on vascular cell integrin αvβ3 and p53 during neovascularization. In future studies, it will be interesting to elucidate whether downstream integrin signaling pathways such as activation of ERKs 1The abbreviations used are: ERKextracellular signal-regulated kinasemight be involved in the regulation of p53, because ERK1/2 signaling was identified as another critical αv-integrin-mediated event during angiogenesis (22.Elicieri B. Klemke R. Strömblad S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition, it remains to be elucidated whether the p53-mediated response to αvantagonist treatment in vascular cells is functionally related to activation of caspase-8 by unligated αvβ3(15.Stupack D.G. Puente X.S. Boutsaboualoy S. Storgard C.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). extracellular signal-regulated kinase In conclusion, we demonstrate that loss of p53 compensates for the function of αv-integrins in retinal neovascularization, possibly by interfering with αv-integrin regulation of vascular cell apoptosis. This indicates a critical function for αv-integrin ligation during neovascularization in suppressing p53 and that p53 constitutes an important part of the control of neovascularization. We thank Dr. Klas Wiman for providing p53 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts."

Receptor-bound IL-6 stimulates glycoprotein 130 homodimerization and ligand-dependent JAK2 activation (9Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar, 10Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Activated JAK2 phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of glycoprotein 130 creating docking sites for dimerization of Stat1 and Stat3. The phosphorylated dimer molecules translocate into the nucleus and bind IL-6-response elements in target promoters. Stat3β is a naturally occurring splice variant of Stat3α with a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 55 amino acid residues including Ser-727, which is important for efficient transcriptional activation (11Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 12Wen Z.

Stat3β efficiently binds to the palindromic IL-6-response element as a homodimer but lacks transcriptional activity alone and is generally considered a dominant negative regulator (15Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.E. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Schaefer et al. (16Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) demonstrated α2-macroglobulin gene activation via Stat3β-c-Jun interactions. Likewise, murine Stat3β has been shown to activate selected promoters in a cell type-specific manner (16Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate abrogation of the IL-6-mediated γ gene repression in K562 cells pretreated with the JAK2 and Stat3/Stat5 inhibitors AG490 and piceatannol (PIC), respectively. Moreover, PIC reversed IL-6-mediated γ gene silencing in primary erythroid cells grown from adult and fetal stage progenitors. Western blot analysis confirmed that IL-6 preferentially activated Stat3β in K562 cells. Subsequent experiments completed in a genetic reporter system demonstrated a concentration-dependent Stat3β-mediated γ gene silencing. Targeted mutagenesis of the cognate Stat3-binding site in the γ promoter reversed the negative effects of Stat3β on γ gene expression. Our studies establish a novel role for STAT proteins in globin gene regulation and a mechanism whereby Stat3 inhibits γ-globin gene activity. K562 erythroleukemia cells were cultured under the following conditions: RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were treated for 48 h with either IL-6 (100 ng/ml) or sodium butyrate (NaB, 2 mm) (Sigma) alone or following pretreatment with the inhibitors PIC (10 μm) for 30 min, AG490 (25 μm) for 16 h, or UO126 (10 μm) for 1 h. All inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. Peripheral and umbilical cord blood samples were obtained from normal individuals after informed consent was obtained in accordance with the University of South Alabama Institutional Review Board guidelines. Mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque-1077, Sigma) and pretreated for 30 min with PIC (10 μm) where indicated. Erythroid progenitors were cultured in methylcellulose as published previously by the authors (17Yang Y. Pace B.S. Kitchens D. Ballas S.K. Shah A. Baliga B.S. Am. J. Hematol. 1997; 56: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and NaB (1 mm) or IL-6 (100 ng/ml) was added on day 0 of culture. BFU-E colonies were counted and harvested on day 14, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) was measured as a percent of total hemoglobin, normalized to total protein, by alkaline denaturation as published previously (17Yang Y. Pace B.S. Kitchens D. Ballas S.K. Shah A. Baliga B.S. Am. J. Hematol. 1997; 56: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Baliga B.S. Pace B.S. Chen H. Shah A.K. Yang Y. Am. J. Hematol. 2001; 65: 227-233Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Total RNA from BFU-E colonies and K562 cells was isolated using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNase protection assay (RPA) was performed with probes designed to yield different size protected fragments for γ-globin (170-bp) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD, 354-bp) mRNA. The level of mRNA transcripts was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (GS-250, Bio-Rad) as described previously (19Pace B.S. Chen Y.R. Thompson A. Goodman S.R. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 28: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar). γ-Globin mRNA was normalized to that of GAPD. K562 cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (75 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 15 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm Na3PO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μg of leupeptin, 200 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of 25 μg were frozen at −70 °C until used to avoid the adverse effects of freeze-thaw cycles on protein function. Cytosolic protein extracts (25 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis using 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% dry milk for 1 h. The membranes were probed for 12 h at 4 °C with total Stat3 antibody diluted 1:250 in TBS-T or phopho-Stat3 antibody diluted 1:500 in TSB-T (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Both antibodies allow simultaneous measurement of Stat3α and Stat3β levels. The membranes were washed and then incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:5000) in TBS-T for chemiluminescent detection. The same membranes were stripped and probed with an actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to control for any variations in the amount of protein loaded per well that may have occurred. The intensity of each band was measured using imaging software (SigmaGel, Jandel Scientific, Chicago, IL). Reporter plasmids were constructed with the pGL3-Basic luciferase plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The γLuc plasmid was established by subcloning an AluI γ promoter fragment (−299 to +36), from a plasmid containing a genomic clone, into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic. HS2γLuc, a kind gift from Dr. Townes, contains the same promoter fragment as γLuc downstream of the 1.9-kb hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) enhancer from the β-globin locus control region. Plasmid DNA was extracted using the alkali lysis method and affinity purification (Qiagen Maxiprep System, Valencia, CA). The AγStat3 site was mutated (mtAγ) using an ExSite PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, a forward primer from nucleotide +9 to +30 in the γ promoter containing the desired mutation 5′-TTTGAGAACGTCTGAGATTATC-3′ and a 5′-phosphorylated reverse primer from −14 to +8, 5′-GCGAGTGTGTGGAACTGCTGAA-3′, were synthesized for the PCR, using the wild-type HS2γLuc plasmid as template. The HS2γLuc plasmid was digested from the PCR product withDpnI, followed by end polishing using Pfu DNA polymerase. The integrity of the PCR product was verified on an agarose gel followed by T4 ligation and transformation into Epicurian Coli® XL1-Blue Supercompetent cells (Stratagene). The mutant carrying the desired base substitution was confirmed by direct sequencing. Two reporter plasmids γLuc and HS2γLuc were analyzed in K562 cells. Each reporter plasmid (10 μg) was added to K562 cells (5 × 106) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min followed by electroporation at 260 V and 975 microfarads (GenePulser, Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were cultured as described above with the addition of IL-6 (100 ng/ml) or NaB (2 mm) alone or in combination with signaling pathway inhibitors followed by chemical inductions. Cells were harvested after 24 h and extracts prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Protein extracts (20 μl) were combined with 100 μl of enzyme reagent, and luciferase activity was measured (TD Luminometer, Promega). Total reporter gene activity was normalized to total protein. The relative luciferase activity was calculated as a ratio to that of untreated controls. The pGL3 control vector was transfected as a control with each experiment to monitor transfection efficiency. Three expression vectors Stat3α (pS3α) and mutant Stat3α (pmS3α) established in the base plasmid pDNA3.1 and Stat3β (pS3β) established in the pSG5 plasmid were tested. Fortrans-activator experiments 30 μg of plasmids was co-transfected with HS2γLuc (10 μg). Competition experiments were also completed by the simultaneous addition of pmS3α and pS3β or pS3α at a concentration of 15 μg each to keep the total plasmid DNA constant at 30 μg. IL-6 (100 ng/ml) exposure for 24 h was used to activate the Stat3 expression vectors via phosphorylation. Experiments were also completed with pS3β or pS3α alone at increasing concentrations from 10–50 μg or pS3β held constant at 15 μg with increasing amounts of pS3α from 10 to 50 μg for competition studies. The pS3α and pmS3α vectors were obtained from our collaborator Dr. Akihiko Yoshimura at the Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Japan. The pS3β vector was a kind gift from Dr. Richard Jove at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL. K562 cells were induced with IL-6 for 48 h alone or after pretreatment with PIC or AG490 at the concentrations described above. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described by Andrews and Faller (20Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). The Biopolymer Core Facility of the University of South Alabama synthesized the oligonucleotides from the respective 5′-untranslated regions for Aγ-globin (AγSTAT3), ɛ-globin (ɛ5U), and β-globin (β5U) that were used as EMSA probes (Fig. 3). The control Stat1 and Stat3 oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Stat1 consensus sequence is 5′-CATGTTATGCATATTCCTGTAAGTG-3′; the Stat3 consensus sequence is 5′-GATCCTTCTGGGAATTCCTAGATC-3′. Underlined are the putative binding sites for the STAT transcription factor. EMSAs were performed as follows. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 DNA kinase and purified on a G-25 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). Binding reactions were performed with 4 μg of nuclear protein incubated with binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with radiolabeled probe for 20 min. For competition experiments 50-fold excess of cold competitor was incubated with the nuclear extract before addition of radiolabeled probes. For confirmatory antibody studies, the probes were incubated with nuclear proteins for 15 min on ice and then STAT antibodies (2 μg) were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight. All binding reactions were performed with 100-fold excess of the nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC) at a concentration of 0.25 μg/ml. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. The data are reported as the means ± S.E. for at least four experiments. Statistical analysis of the raw data was performed by two tailed t tests. Student’s t test was used to measure differences in samples of two groups. Probability of less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered significant. We have demonstrated previously (6Ferry A. Baliga S. Monterio C. Pace B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20030-20037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that IL-6 reduces the steady-state level of γ-globin mRNA in BFU-E colonies and K562 cells. This effect is evident in a concentration-dependent manner and is concomitant with an increased level of glycoprotein IIb mRNA. To gain further insight into the role of other megakaryocytic specific cytokines in γ gene regulation, we treated K562 cells with thrombopoietin (25–300 ng/ml) or IL-11 (25–100 ng/ml) for 72 h and found that neither cytokine had a significant effect on steady-state γ-globin mRNA levels. This suggests that IL-6 is unique among the megakaryocytic specific cytokines in regulating γ globin. To determine the role of signaling proteins in the IL-6-mediated regulation of the γ-globin gene, we analyzed the effect of specific inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway. K562 cells were pretreated with AG490 or PIC prior to induction with IL-6. AG490 inhibits the ability of JAK2 to activate multiple downstream STAT proteins, whereas PIC specifically blocks activation of Stat3 and Stat5 (21Levitzki A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 22Geahlen R.L. McLaughlin J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 214-245Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Steady-state γ-globin mRNA level remained unchanged in IL-6-induced K562 cells pretreated with either inhibitor suggesting that the repressive effect of IL-6 was mediated through the JAK-STAT pathway (Fig. 1, A andB). The effect of AG490 and PIC was similar to that observed with an anti-IL-6 antibody, which blocked the ability of IL-6 to reduce γ-globin mRNA level by 50–60% (Fig. 1B). The concentrations used for AG490 and PIC have been widely applied to inhibit effectively the JAK-STAT pathway (23Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To ensure that the K562 cell line used in these experiments was responsive to γ-globin gene activation, control experiments were performed with NaB, which resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in γ-globin mRNA levels. We conclude from these experiments that JAK2 and Stat3 and/or Stat5 are necessary for the IL-6-mediated repression of the γ-globin gene. To address the physiological relevance of this finding, we extended the studies with PIC to primary erythroid cells. Adult peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells were cultured for 14 days in the presence of IL-6 alone or following pretreatment with PIC. Cellular protein was isolated and HbF determined by alkaline denaturation as a percent of total hemoglobin (18Baliga B.S. Pace B.S. Chen H. Shah A.K. Yang Y. Am. J. Hematol. 2001; 65: 227-233Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous data from our laboratory (17Yang Y. Pace B.S. Kitchens D. Ballas S.K. Shah A. Baliga B.S. Am. J. Hematol. 1997; 56: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Baliga B.S. Pace B.S. Chen H. Shah A.K. Yang Y. Am. J.

Blood. 2001; 97: 3259-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and by others (25Gotze K.S. Keller U. Rose-John S. Peschel C. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 822-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), we observed an increase (1.5-fold) in BFU-E colony growth in adult peripheral blood cultures treated with IL-6 (Fig. 1C). However, steady-state γ-globin mRNA levels were reduced by 6-fold (p < 0.05). The effect on mRNA synthesis was reflected at the protein level by a significant reduction in HbF. In control experiments NaB increased γ mRNA and HbF levels by 2.5- and 4.8-fold (p < 0.05), respectively. Prior treatment of mononuclear cells with PIC on day 0 abrogated the ability of IL-6 to repress HbF synthesis (data not shown). In contrast to promoting BFU-E colony growth from adult stage progenitors, IL-6 restricted the expansion of BFU-E in cultures established with umbilical cord blood. Fig. 1D shows that IL-6 reduced BFU-E colony number by 5-fold and HbF by 6-fold in umbilical cord blood cultures. Interestingly, on this fetal-globin background there was concordance of the IL-6 effect at the cellular and molecular level. It is worth noting that PIC abolished the effect of IL-6 on both cell proliferation and gene expression (Fig. 1D). The observation for gene control corroborates those observed in K562 cells and further implicates STAT transcription factors as negative regulators of γ-globin gene expression. Our recent findings (24Boosalis M.S. Bandyopadhyay R. Bresnick E.H. Pace B.S. Van DeMark K. Faller D.V. Perrine S.P. Blood. 2001; 97: 3259-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) from studying mechanisms for γ-globin activation by short chain fatty acids show that γ-globin induction is associated with increased Stat5 activation. It is therefore likely that the negative regulation of γ-globin reported here involves a variant of Stat3. The potential for Stat3 involvement in γ-globin gene regulation was determined by analyzing the expression of Stat3 proteins in IL-6-treated K562 cells. Cytosolic protein extracts were probed with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both Stat3α and the truncated variant Stat3β (Fig. 2A). Cells treated with IL-6 alone showed an insignificant increase in Stat3α, which was reduced to 50% below base-line values following pretreatment with PIC (Fig. 2B). By contrast the level of Stat3β (80 kDa) increased 5-fold in IL-6-treated K562 cells (p < 0.05). PIC inhibited Stat3β induction by IL-6 and reduced endogenous Stat3β levels to 80% below steady-state values (p < 0.05). AG490 had a less dramatic effect on the levels of Stat3 induced by IL-6 generally. These data demonstrate that IL-6 preferentially enhances Stat3β expression in K562 cells. Furthermore, the level of activated Stat3β (phosphorylated) was greater than activated Stat3α at steady state. In time course experiments we observed a transient deactivation of both Stat3 variants by IL-6 for up to 4 h. This was replaced by a rapid rise in the level of activated Stat3β reaching a maximal value at 24 h, and remaining above base-line values for up to 48 h (data not shown). In contrast, deactivation of Stat3α was progressive throughout the study period. Consequently, the ratio of activated Stat3β/Stat3α at 48 h was higher compared with untreated cells. This indicates that Stat3β is the primary signaling protein mediating the effect of IL-6 in K562 cells. A computer-aided search revealed a Stat3-like binding sequence (TTCTGGAA) in the Aγ and Gγ promoters, in the interval between nucleotides +9 to +16 relative to the cap site, which is similar in structure to the Stat3 consensus sequence TT(N)4–5AA (27Schaefer L.K. Menter D.G. Schaefer T.S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Zhang X. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 76: 33576-33581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (90) Google Scholar). DNA sequence alignment of the β-like globin genes showed that the embryonic (ɛ) globin gene lacked the terminal AA dinucleotide critical for Stat3 binding (Fig.3A). In the two adult globin genes (δ and β) the octamer sequence terminates with a CA dinucleotide (Fig. 3A). We investigated potential DNA-protein interactions in this region for each globin promoter using oligonucleotides probes spanning nucleotides +1 to +22. We observed two complexes of variable intensities with each radiolabeled probe and nuclear extract from K562 cells (Fig. 3B). Competition experiments with self and consensus Stat3 oligonucleotides suggest each promoter, ɛ (lanes 2 and 3), β (lanes 5 and 6), and γ (lanes 7–9), may interact with Stat3. However, the motif in the γ-globin promoter is the most closely related to the Stat3 consensus, and in competition experiments a consensus Stat3 oligonucleotide was most effective against the γ probe (lane 9). DNA-protein interaction with the γ-globin probe (AγSTAT3) was competed by a Stat1 consensus oligonucleotide as well (Fig.4A, lanes 1–3) suggesting that Stat1 and Stat3 might bind as a heterodimeric complex to this region in the γ-globin promoter. Unlabeled AγSTAT3 oligonucleotide successfully competed for binding with consensus Stat3 and Stat1 probes (Fig. 4A, lanes 5–10). The Stat1 probe formed two major and two variable minor complexes (lane 8). AγSTAT3 specifically abolished the Band 2 DNA-protein complexes formed with the Stat3 and Stat1 probes. In addition, we observe a new faster mobility complex in competition experiments between the Stat1 probe and AγSTAT3 cold competitor (Band 3, lane 10). Subsequent experiments to confirm Stat3 binding were performed using untreated K562 nuclear extract and anti-Stat3 or anti-Stat1 antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). In both instances the addition of antibodies reproducibly abolished formation of the Band 2 complex (Fig. 4,lanes 1–3). This confirms that Stat1 and Stat3 bind to the interval +1 to +22 containing a Stat3-like element in the γ-globin gene. To determine whether IL-6 treatment altered STAT protein interactions in the γ-globin promoter, we performed EMSA with nuclear extracts from K562 cells induced with IL-6 alone or following pretreated with AG490 or PIC. Treatment with IL-6 alone produced a consistent increase in binding of nuclear proteins to the Band 2 complex (lanes 1 and 4). This effect was reduced significantly by PIC (lane 6) and AG490 to a lesser degree. Mutation analysis showed a requirement for an intact Stat3-like motif in the AγSTAT3 probe for nuclear protein binding. Formation of the Stat3-specific DNA-protein complex (Band 2) as well as a slower migrating complex was abolished in a mutant AγSTAT3 oligonucleotide containing a CTG → TGA substitution (nucleotides +11 to +13) (Fig.5). An identical modification of the consensus Stat3 oligonucleotide produced an identical result. Collectively, the JAK-STAT pathway inhibitor and DNA-protein binding experiments suggest a role for Stat3β in γ-globin gene regulation. The functional importance of Stat3 to γ-globin gene regulation was directly tested by transient transfection assays. In initial experiments we found that IL-6 reduced the luciferase activity from an enhancerless construct, γLuc, containing the minimum γ-globin promoter (−299 to +36) by 6-fold in transfected K562 cells after 24 h of IL-6 treatment. This effect was abrogated when transfected cells were pretreated with PIC prior to IL-6 treatment (data not shown). To accurately gauge the magnitude of the repressive effect on the γ promoter, subsequent experiments were performed with a construct containing the erythroid-specific enhancer HS2 of the β-globin locus control region upstream of the −299 promoter (HS2γLuc). As expected the luciferase activity from HS2γLuc was 10-fold higher compared with that of the enhancerless construct. IL-6 reduced luciferase activity from the HS2γLuc reporter 8-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig.6B). This result demonstrates that the powerful HS2 enhancer failed to avert the repressive effect of IL-6 on the γ promoter. Inhibition of Stat3 activation in transfected K562 cells with PIC, however, restored luciferase activity to base-line values. In control experiments, UO126, an extracellular receptor kinase pathway inhibitor, showed no effect on IL-6-mediated γ promoter repression. These data provide evidence for the involvement of Stat3 in γ gene regulation. We next sought to inhibit specifically the Stat3 transcription factor with protein inhibitors of activated STAT-3 (PIAS3) antibodies. PIAS are naturally occurring antibodies that directly repress phosphorylated STAT proteins (30Chaturvedi P. Sharma S. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3295-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Wu, Y., Lu B. Han Z. Zhang Z. Int. J. Hematol. 2001; 74: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Transfected K562 cells were pretreated with PIAS1 or PIAS3 antibody (10 ng/ml) for 2 h followed by IL-6 treatment. The reduction in luciferase activity from the HS2γLuc construct in the presence of IL-6 was unaffected by PIAS1 (Fig. 6C). In contrast, PIAS3 abolished the negative effects of IL-6 on the HS2γLuc reporter and restored luciferase activity to base-line levels. This result provides further evidence for the importance of Stat3 in silencing γ-globin gene expression. Interestingly, in control experiments we found that PIAS3 reduced the luciferase activity in cells treated with NaB suggesting a requirement for Stat3 by NaB to augment γ promoter activity (Fig.6D). These diametric effects from general inhibition of Stat3 are plausible given that the α and β variants have opposing outcomes on gene expression. Co-transfection experiments were performed with the HS2γLuc reporter and expression vectors for Stat3α (pS3α) and Statβ (pS3β) to provide a direct analysis of each transcription factor on γ promoter activity. Transfected K562 cells were cultured either in normal medium or in medium supplemented with IL-6 for maximal phosphorylation of Stat3 transcription factors. Stat3β overexpression reduced luciferase activity by 20% in the absence of IL-6 and by a further 50% after activation with IL-6, compared with the levels observed in co-transfection experiments with HS2γLuc and the corresponding empty expression vector (pSG5) (Fig.7). Co-transfection of the reporter vector with pS3β and a mutant Stat3α (pmS3α) vector carrying a Y705F mutation blocked the effects of pS3β and restored luciferase activity to approximately base-line levels. Activation of the wild-type pS3α vector blocked the repressive effect of endogenous Stat3β on γ promoter activity, which was obse"

This transport protein comprises two cytoplasmic domains and one membrane-embedded C domain per monomer, of which the latter provides the dimer contacts. A series of single-cysteine His-tagged C domains present in the native membrane were subjected to Cu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)3-catalyzed disulfide formation or cysteine cross-linking with dimaleimides of different length. The engineered cysteines were at the borders of the predicted membrane-spanning α-helices. Two residues were found to be located in close proximity of each other and capable of forming a disulfide, while four other locations formed cross-links with the longer dimaleimides. Solubilization of the membranes did only influence the cross-linking behavior at one position (Cys73). Mannitol binding only effected the cross-linking of a cysteine at the border of the third transmembrane helix (Cys134), indicating that substrate binding does not lead to large rearrangements in the helix packing or to dissociation of the dimer. Upon mannitol binding, the Cys134 becomes more exposed but the residue is no longer capable of forming a stable disulfide in the dimeric IIC domain. In combination with the recently obtained projection structure of the IIC domain in two-dimensional crystals, a first proposal is made for α-helix packing in the mannitol permease.

In bacteria, the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system is involved in the uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of a wide variety of carbohydrates (1.Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The system consists of two general components EI and HPr and several carbohydrate-specific enzymes II (EII). In a cascade of phosphorylation reactions, the phosphoryl group is transferred from the energy donor phosphoenolpyruvate via EI and HPr to EII, as is illustrated in Fig. 1 for the mannitol-specific phosphotransferase system (reviewed in Ref. 2.Robillard G.T. Broos J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 73-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All EII's have a similar architecture and consist of the cytoplasmic A and B domains and a membrane-embedded C domain.

The evidence for this oligomeric state is manifold, but the strongest indications are from in vitro and in vivocomplementation studies. The formation of heterodimers from inactive subunits with defects in different domains restores the activity of EIImtl (3.van Weeghel R.P. van der Hoek Y.Y. Pas H.H. Elferink M. Keck W.

Moreover, subunits of EIImtlcould be covalently cross-linked to a dimer with bifunctional sulfhydryl-specific reagents, lysine-specific cross-linkers, or by oxidative disulfide bond formation (6.Roossien F.F.

The 5-Å projection structure of the C domain in two-dimensional crystals also strongly points towards a dimeric structure (10.Koning R.I. Keegstra W. Oostergetel G.T. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Robillard G.T. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Six regions with high electron density, probably representing α-helices, are observed in the projection structure of the C domain. The structural information of the C domain, however, is limited to this projection map. A topology model derived from the phoA gene fusion studies predicted 6 membrane-spanning α-helices and two large cytoplasmic loops (Fig. 2), which fits with the projection map (11.Sugiyama J.E. Mahmoodian S. Jacobson G.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9603-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The assignment of densities to particular helices has not been made and, therefore, it is not known which helices reside at the dimer interface. Here, we demonstrate close proximity of engineered cysteines at the borders of predicted membrane-spanning α-helices, using Cu(II)-(1,10-phenathroline)3-induced disulfide bridge formation and cross-linking with dimaleimides of different length. This data, in combination with the electron densities of the projection map, has been used to propose the first α-helix-packing model of a phosphotransferase system transport protein. Decyl-polyethylene glycol (dPEG) was synthesized by B. Kwant (Kwant High Vacuum Oil Recycling and Synthesis, Bedum, The Netherlands). 1,10-Phenanthroline monohydrate was obtained from Merck. The cross-linkers o-PDM and p-PDM were from Aldrich, and BMH was obtained from Pierce. n-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) was from Fluka and 14C-NEM from NEN. All chemicals used were analytical grade. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit. A His-tagged Cys-less IIC domain (IIChis-CL) was generated by replacing Cys110 and Cys320 by serine in PmaMtlIICHis, which carries the gene for the C domain with a C-terminal His-tag (12.Meijberg W.

The gene for IIChis-CL was subsequently used to generate the single-cysteine IIChis variants. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Growth of E. coli LGS322 (F− thi-1, hisG1, argG6, metB1, tonA2, supE44, rpsL104, lacY1, galT6, gatR49, gatR50, Δ(mtlA'p), mtlDc, Δ(gutR'MDBA-recA)), carrying the various plasmids, and procedures to overexpress the mutant proteins were identical to those described for wild type EIImtl (13.Robillard G.T. Boer H. van Weeghel R.P. Wolters G. Dijkstra A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9553-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Inside-out (ISO) membrane vesicles containing the mutant proteins were obtained as described (14.Broos J. ter Veld F. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9798-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The membrane vesicles (25 mg of protein/ml) were solubilized in 1% (w/v) of dPEG. The protein concentration was determined with the DC protein assay from Bio-Rad. The dissociation constants for mannitol binding and concentrations of the C domains were determined with flow dialysis in the presence or absence of 0.25% dPEG (w/v) (15.Lolkema J.S. Dijkstra D.S. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10659-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with some modifications as will be described elsewhere. 2E. Vos, G. K. Schuurman-Wolters, G. T. Robillard, L. Broos, and B. Poolman, unpublished data. The functionality of the IIChis mutants was determined after heterodimer formation with EIImtl-G196D, using 33 μm14C-mannitol following established procedures (16.Boer H. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12901-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Heterodimers between the single-cysteine IIChis and IIChis-CL (added at a 4-fold excess) were formed by mixing two preparations of dPEG (1%)-solubilized ISO membrane vesicles containing the separate IIC proteins. As a control a 4-fold excess of the appropriate single-cysteine IIChis mutant instead of IIChis-CL was added. To promote heterodimer formation, 167 mm Na3PO4 was added from a 1m stock solution adjusted to pH 7.6 with HCl and these mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Na3PO4 lowers the cloudpoint of the dPEG, which results in dissociation of the initially homodimeric proteins and thereby facilitates the mixing of the species (17.Broos J. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3865-3870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To allow formation of the dimers, the Na3PO4 was removed by desalting of the dPEG-solubilized proteins on a Bio Microspin column (see the “Cysteine Cross-linking” procedure). Subsequently, 5 mm DTT was added and these mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and treated further as described under the “Cysteine Cross-linking” procedure. The ISO membrane vesicles or dPEG-solubilized proteins were desalted on a Bio Micro-spin 6 column (Bio-Rad), equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. This buffer was deaerated with helium. The final protein concentration was ∼5 mg/ml, from which 2–5% corresponds to IIChis. If appropriate, 0.01 or 40 mm mannitol or 40 mm glucose were added. Disulfide bridge formation was initiated by oxidation with 0.1 volume of 3 mm Cu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)3(CuPhe) and incubation at 30 °C for 0–60 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 mm EDTA plus 5 mm NEM. Cross-linking with dimaleimides of varying length was initiated by adding 0.05–0.5 mm o-PDM,p-PDM, or BMH from 10 times concentrated stock solutions inN,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction was stopped with 5 mm DTT after incubation at 30 °C for 0–60 min. To generate cross-links between subunits with a single cysteine residue at different positions, heterodimers were formed as described under “Generation of Heterodimers” after mixing of two single Cys mutants in a one to one or one to four ratio. A one to four ratio was used when one of the mutants already formed a cross-link in the homodimeric situation. In that case, the mutant with the selfcross-link was used at a 4-fold lower concentration. The mutants that did not form a selfcross-link were mixed in a one to one ratio. The ISO membrane vesicles containing the His-tagged C domains were treated with p-PDM for 0 or 60 min under the same conditions as described under “Cysteine Cross-linking,” but the reaction was quenched with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Subsequently, the His-tagged C domains were purified as described (12.Meijberg W. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Boer H. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20785-20794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unreacted cysteines were kept reduced with 5 mm DTT, and the reductant was removed with a Micro-spin 6 column (Bio-Rad) just prior to labeling with 100 μm14C-NEM for 0–30 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE denaturation buffer with β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and autoradiograms were made with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) after drying of the gel. The amount of radioactivity in the protein bands was determined with the Imagequant Software (Molecular Dynamics). ISO membrane vesicles with IIChis-S134C were labeled with 0.5 mm NEM or BMH under the same conditions as described under “Cysteine Cross-linking” in the presence or absence of 40 mm mannitol for different periods of time. The reaction was quenched with DTT. The reagents were removed by three consecutive washes with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, using ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 10 min, and resuspension of the pelleted membranes. The activities of the proteins were determined using established procedures (16.Boer H. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12901-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as described under “Mannitol Binding and Phosphorylation Activities” with the following modifications. To 50 μg of ISO membrane vesicles (corresponding to ∼70 nm IIChis-S134C), 10 μm of purified IIAB domain, 9 μm HPr, and 0.3 μm EI were added. The assay was started by the addition of 33 μm [14C]mannitol; dPEG was omitted from the mixture. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done with 10% acrylamide gels as described (18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). A denaturation buffer without β-mercaptoethanol was used. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry electrophoretic blotting. Detection, using the Western-Light™ chemiluminescence detection kit with CSPD™ as the substrate, was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Tropix Inc.). The first antibody was an anti-His antibody from Amersham Bioscience or Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the second antibody was an anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). Cysteines were introduced in a cysteine-less His-tagged C domain, denoted here as IIChis-CL, to identify putative transmembrane α-helices that constitute the dimer interface of EIImtl. Fig. 2 shows the location of the cysteines in the topology model of the C domain. The cysteines, except for position 124, are located at the borders of putative transmembrane α-helices and they are taken as indicators for interhelix proximities. ISO membrane vesicles prepared from LGS322 cells harboring the plasmids were analyzed for mannitol binding before and after solubilization with dPEG. Their ability to complement the mannitol binding-defective EIImtl-G196D was determined in an in vitromannitol phosphorylation assay (16.Boer H. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12901-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Table I shows the dissociation constants (K d) for mannitol. Most proteins exhibited binding affinities comparable with those described for the wild-type C domain generated by tryptic digestion of the complete protein (15.Lolkema J.S. Dijkstra D.S. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10659-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19.Boer H. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Dijkstra A. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17863-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the maximal number of binding sites (B max) did not vary significantly for the various mutants (not shown). A few single-cysteine mutants displayed significantly higher affinities than IIChis. The only mutant that bound mannitol with lower affinity was S134C. Although its binding constant could not be determined accurately with flow dialysis, it was estimated to be in the low micromolar range. All mutants, including S134C, complemented EIImtl-G196D in the in vitro phosphorylation assay (not shown) with an efficiency comparable with that described for the C domain (19.Boer H. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Dijkstra A. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17863-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that all IIChis mutants have more or less wild-type properties.Table IDissociation constants for mannitol binding in the absence and presence of 0.25% dPEGMutantK dK d +dPEGμMIIChis240106IIChis-CL11832IIChis-I24C5518IIChis-T47C10351IIChis-G73C11650IIChis-S124C16572IIChis-S134C>5001-aThe binding constant could not be determined accurately.97IIChis-S158C9018IIChis-L187C12462IIChis-I270C11042IIChis-S299C169541-a The binding constant could not be determined accurately. Open table in a new tab A disulfide bond is a so-called zero-length cross-linker, whereas the dimaleimides o-PDM,p-PDM, and BMH allow linkage of thiol groups at distances of 9.4 ± 0.5, 11.1 ± 0.5, and 10.2 ± 2.4 Å, respectively (20.Green N.S. Reisler E. Houk K.N. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Since an aromatic ring couples the maleimides ino-PDM and p-PDM, the span widths do not vary too much in solution. With BMH, on the other hand, the span width can vary a few Å, due to cis-trans conversions of the spacer chain. Representative immunoblots obtained with IIChis-T47C, IIChis-G73C, IIChis-S134C, and IIChis-S299C are shown in Fig. 3 A. Table II summarizes the results of all mutants. Two mutants, with cysteines at positions 47 or 124, were able to form a disulfide bond and cross-link with all three dimaleimides. This indicates a high degree of flexibility for these cysteine residues since disulfide formation necessitates close proximity, whereas BMH and the rigid dimaleimides o-PDM and p-PDM span a larger distance. The capacity to form a disulfide indicates that these residues can come in very close proximity, since the length of a disulfide bond is ∼2 Å (21.Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22.Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cross-linking with the cysteine at position 124 has been observed previously with native EIImtl and purified IIChis-S124C (9.van Montfort B.A. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Duurkens R.H. Mensen R. Poolman B. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12756-12763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Four other mutants, with cysteines at positions 73, 134, 187, or 270, could only form a cross-link with p-PDM and BMH. This indicates that these locations are in close proximity but more than 10 Å apart. From the reaction with p-PDM and BMH, it can be concluded that the distance is ∼12 Å. The cross-link with IIChis-G73C was formed less rapidly than those with cysteines at the other positions and significant amounts of cross-link product were only observed when the dimaleimide concentration was increased from 0.05 to 0.5 mm. This suggests a lower accessibility of the cysteine at position 73 or a higher pK a of the sulfhydryl group. IIChis, with the native cysteines 110 and 320, and IIChis with cysteines at positions 24, 158, and 199 did not yield cross-links, suggesting that these cysteines are not in close proximity of the dimer interface or not accessible for the cross-linker.Table IICysteine cross-linking of single-cysteine mutants of IIChis with CuPhe or dimaleimides of different lengthMutantCuPheo-PDM (9.4 ± 0.5Å)2-aThe span widths are taken from Ref. 20.p-PDM (11.1 ± 0.5Å)2-aThe span widths are taken from Ref. 20.BMH (11.2 ± 2.4 Å)2-aThe span widths are taken from Ref. 20.IIChis−−−−IIChis CL−−−−IIChis-I24C−−−−IIChis-T47C++++IIChis-G73C2-bThese cross-links were formed with 0.5 mM dimaleimide and were only visible after 60 min of incubation.−/+2-cThe disulfide was only observed after dPEG solubilization of the membranes.−++IIChis-S124C++++IIChis-S134C−−++IIChis-S158C−−−−IIChis-L187C−−++/−2-dUnambiguous cross-link formation with BMH could not be obtained for the cysteine at this position.IIChis-I270C−−++/−2-dUnambiguous cross-link formation with BMH could not be obtained for the cysteine at this position.IIChis-S299C−−−−2-a The span widths are taken from Ref. 20.Green N.S.

Open table in a new tab The accessibility of all single-cysteine IIC mutants was examined by labeling with 14C-NEM after pretreatment withp-PDM for 0 up to 60 min. The experiments showed thatp-PDM protected against labeling with radioactive NEM in all cases (results not shown), demonstrating that each of the cysteines was accessible under the conditions used here. A slightly lower rate of labeling with 14C-NEM was observed with IIChis-G73C and IIChis-I270C, which supports the need for higher concentrations of dimaleimide to obtain cross-links with the G73C mutant. Except for Cys134 (see below), mannitol binding did not alter the accessibility of the cysteines for the maleimides. The effect of dPEG on the cross-linking efficiency was examined for the homodimeric single-cysteine C domains. In most cases, the data were comparable to those reported for the membrane-embedded protein (Fig. 3 A and Table I). Detergent-solubilized G73C, on the other hand, formed stable cross-links in the presence of Cu-Phe andp-PDM (Fig. 3 B), whereas this mutant only (slowly) formed cross-links with p-PDM (and BMH) when the protein was embedded in the membrane. Most likely, an increased flexibility in the presence of detergent allows the Cys73residues to come closer together and form a stable disulfide. Due to the symmetry of the putative IIC dimer, only one helix is expected to be adjacent to the same helix in the other subunit. To increase the possibilities for stable cross-link formation, heterodimeric complexes of the following pairs of single-cysteine IIChis domains were formed: T47C/S158C, T47C/S299C, S158C/S299C, I24C/G73C, I24C/L187C, I24C/I270C, G73C/L187C, and G73C/I270C. The generation of heterodimers was accomplished by mixing dPEG-solubilized ISO membrane vesicles of given mutant pairs in the presence of 167 mm Na3PO4. The addition of sodium phosphate facilitates the heterodimer formation by lowering the cloud point of the detergent (see “Experimental Procedures”). Provided that homo- and heterodimeric complexes are formed randomly upon mixing of two species (A and B) in a one to one ratio, one expects 50% of heterodimers (AB) and 25% of each of the homodimers (AA and BB). A one to one ratio was used for those mutants that did not form a cross-link in the homodimeric complexes. A one to four ratio was used when one of the mutants (A), i.e. T47C, G73C, L187C, and I270C, already formed a selfcross-link. In that case, the other mutant (B) was added at a 4-fold excess and the expected fractions of AA, AB, and BB are 0.04, 0.32, and 0.64, respectively. Under these conditions the fraction of protein (AA) that could form a selfcross-link is only 4%. Cross-linking was tested with CuPhe andp-PDM but neither of the heterodimeric complexes formed significant amounts of cross-links. In some cases (S158C/S299C, I24C/G73C), the fraction of monomeric C domain decreased significantly after cross-linking, but an accompanying increase in dimeric species was not observed. Instead, these mutants seemed to aggregate in the presence of detergent plus Na3PO4 to promote heterodimer formation. From the previous experiments, it was not possible to discriminate between intra- or interdimeric cross-links. The latter would indicate that the particular cysteine is located at the periphery of the protein and not relevant for dimer formation. To discriminate between these possibilities, heterodimers composed of one single-cysteine and one cysteine-less subunit were formed. An intradimer cross-link is then no longer possible. The generation of heterodimers was accomplished by mixing dPEG-solubilized ISO membrane vesicles, containing one of the six single-cysteine C domains that did form a cross-link, with a 4-fold excess of solubilized membranes containing IIChis-CL in the presence of 167 mm Na3PO4. As a control a 4-fold excess of the same single-cysteine mutant was used instead of IIChis-CL. Fig. 4 shows that dPEG solubilization and lowering of the cloud point did not affect the cross-linking efficiency at positions 47, 73, 187, and 270 (lanes 2 and 3). When present in a heterodimer with IIChis-CL, these cysteines no longer form significant amounts of cross-links (lane 4). In the control sample, the cross-linked dimer is still clearly visible (lane 5). This indicates that cysteines 47, 73, 187, and 270 are located at the dimer interface. The two other single-cysteine mutants, with cysteines at position 124 and 134, could not be analyzed with this procedure, since Na3PO4 treatment of the dPEG-solubilized proteins resulted in aggregation. The cross-linking behavior of the S124C mutant has previously been analyzed in EIImtl with cysteines at position 384 and 124 (9.van Montfort B.A. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Duurkens R.H. Mensen R. Poolman B. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12756-12763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When a heterodimer of this double-cysteine protein with IIChis-CL was formed, the Cys124-Cys124 disulfide was no longer observed. This indicates that also the cross-link formed with IIChis-S124C is intradimeric. The cross-linking experiments were repeated in the presence of 0.01 or 40 mmmannitol; both concentrations are above the K d for mannitol binding. As a control, 40 mm glucose was used, which is not a substrate of EIImtl. Representative immunoblots of the effect of mannitol on the formation of cross-links with 0.5 mm BMH are shown in Fig. 5. The addition of mannitol or glucose to IIChis-T47C did not have an effect on the cross-linking efficiency. With IIChis-S134C, on the other hand, cross-links were no longer observed in the presence of 0.01 and 40 mm mannitol, while glucose had no effect. Similar results were obtained withp-PDM as the cross-linker. The cross-linking behavior of the other mutants was not affected (not shown). If high concentrations of substrate would monomerize the dimer, as suggested previously on the basis of SDS extractions of the protein from the membrane in the presence of 40 mm mannitol (23.Roossien F.F. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5682-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24.Stephan M.M. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the amount of cross-link product should also have decreased for Cys47, Cys73, Cys124, Cys187, and Cys270. Since this is not the case, it can be concluded that mannitol does not monomerize the dimer under the conditions used here. The effect of labeling of Cys134 on the activity of the protein was investigated by complementation of IIChis-S134C in ISO membrane vesicles with purified IIAB protein of EIImtl. Upon phosphorylation of IIAB in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate, enzyme, and HPr, the phosphoryl group on the B domain of IIAB can be transferred to mannitol when bound to IIChis-S134C. In the absence of mannitol, NEM or BMH treatment (0.5 mm) resulted in about 25% reduction of the activity after 20 min of incubation (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, in the presence of mannitol, the inhibition by NEM or BMH was much more severe (Fig. 6) and already maximal after 5 min (not shown). The binding of mannitol thus results in a higher accessibility (or reactivity) of Cys134, but also places these residues further apart as cross-linking is no longer observed under these conditions (Fig. 5). The cross-linking experiments with the C domain of the mannitol permease have been primarily performed with the protein in ISO membrane vesicles, which is the environment in which the protein adopts its native conformation. The lipid bilayer environment has the additional advantage that protein motions are restricted. This could be important as cross-links can also be formed upon dynamic collisions, which would not merely reflect proximity of the subunits. With a membrane-embedded protein, the collisions can only occur within the two-dimensional space of the membrane, which increases the specificity of the cross-linking reactions, as was shown for the diacylglycerol kinase (25.Nagy J.K. Lau F.W. Bowie J.U. Sanders C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4154-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A CuPhe-catalyzed disulfide formation study showed that collision rates are highly dependent on proximity (22.Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A comparison of cysteine cross-link formation and distance determination by spin-spin interactions between nitroxide-labeled pairs of cysteines in theE. coli lactose permease also indicates that proximity is the most important parameter (26.Kwaw I. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3134-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This fits with our observations that the cross-link efficiency of mutants is similar for most of the single-cysteine mutants in the native and dPEG-solubilized membrane. For the G73C mutant, however, dPEG solubilization is required for disulfide formation, whereas cross-linking via the dimaleimides is unaffected. This suggests that the two cysteines are brought in somewhat closer proximity upon solubilization of the membrane. The relatively low efficiencies of CuPhe-induced disulfide bond formation or dimaleimide cross-linking are not uncommon (26.Kwaw I. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3134-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27.Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11564-11573Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28.Wu J. Kaback H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and there are several explanations for these observations. (i) The formation of disulfide bonds under oxidative conditions is competitive with terminal oxidation of thiols to sulfonates (22.Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). (ii) A study by Koshland and co-workers (29.Stoddard B.L. Bui J.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that the inefficiency of CuPhe-catalyzed cross-linking can relate to a low stability of the disulfide bond, which is due to the less than ideal geometries and bond lengths of the engineered cysteines. Even disulfide bonds between cysteines, engineered on the basis of a high-resolution crystal structure, can be difficult to form and unstable once formed (30.Villafranca J.E. Howell E.E. Oatley S.J. Xuong N.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2182-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). (iii) Cross-linking of two cysteines with one dimaleimide is competitive with the labeling of the same two cysteines with two different dimaleimide molecules, which obviously does not lead to cross-linking. In addition, cross-linking will not be observed if one of the maleimide moieties is inactivated by hydrolysis. The observed cross-links can be divided into two groups. The first group is composed of residues 47 and 124, which form a disulfide bond upon CuPhe-induced oxidation and cross-links with all three dimaleimides. Since hydrophaty predictions and phoA gene fusion data suggest that residue 124 is not located at the border of a membrane-spanning α-helix, it is not expected to place a particular helix at the dimer interface. Residue 47 is in a loop between helix 1 and 2 and probably located in the center of the projection map close to density B (see Fig. 7). Residues 73, 134, 187, and 270 are in the second group of cross-linking sites. These cysteines, which are on the cytoplasmic side of helices 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, only form cross-links with the reagents with the longer spacers in the native membranes. The cytoplasmic ends of these helices must, therefore, be reasonably close to the dimer interface. Due to the instability of IIChis-S134C in the dPEG-solubilized state in the presence of sodium phosphate, we cannot exclude the possibility that residue 134 forms an interdimeric cross-link. Given the high specificity of cross-link formation with the other cysteine pairs, we favor the suggestion that the Cys134 cross-link is also intradimeric and sensitive to mannitol binding. The observation that mannitol enhances the inactivation of IIChis-S134C by NEM and BMH, whereas the cross-linking by BMH is diminished, indicate that relatively large conformational changes take place at this site upon ligand binding. The Cys134 residues become more exposed, and react more rapidly with the maleimides. At the same time, the conformational changes places the two Cys134 residues within the homodimer further apart, as BMH-dependent cross-linking is no longer observed. With regard to the distance information obtained from the cross-linking studies, it is important to note that the distance between the centers of two densities in the projection map might be larger than the span width of the dimaleimides. The radius of a helix is 5–6 Å and ∼12 Å can thus be added to the span width of the cross-linker used. The maximum distance between the centers of two densities that can be spanned by BMH is, therefore, ∼25 Å. In Fig. 7, a circle with this diameter is drawn in the center of the projection map. Since density E is far out of the circle, it can never represent helices 1, 2, or 5 and most likely also not helix 3. The fact that residues 47 and 73 at either end of helix 2 form a cross-link makes this helix the best candidate for density B. This leaves densities A, C, F, and probably D for helices 1, 3, 4, and 5. Due to the symmetry of the putative IIC dimer different helices of the two subunits could neighbor each other. Helix 1 of one subunit could, for instance, be adjacent to helix 3, 4, or 5 of the other subunit. Unfortunately, neither of the mutant pairs in the heterodimeric complexes yielded significant amounts of cross-links to support these possibilities. Although integral membrane proteins do not readily form three-dimensional crystals, two-dimensional crystals, from which a projection map can be calculated, are much more easily obtained. In fact, two-dimensional crystals of several integral membrane proteins have been produced in recent years (31.Williams K.A. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Kühlbrandt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32.Mindell J.A. Maduke M. Miller C. Grigorieff N.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4408-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These maps reveal the electron densities corresponding to transmembrane α-helices, but assignment of the densities to particular segments of the protein cannot be made. Such information is particularly important for oligomeric proteins, in which the subunit interface(s) are catalytically important or participate in the cooperativity of the system (35.Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H. Poolman B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The approach presented here allows one to generate a helix-packing model of an integral membrane protein. Specific cross-links could be generated between cysteines engineered at the ends of the transmembrane segments of the membrane domain of EIImtl. In combination with the projection map of the C domain of EIImtl, we have obtained the first structural information of the dimer interface. To the best of our knowledge, the two pieces of information, i.e. the electron density map and cross-links, have not been used before to build an α-helix packing model of a membrane (transport) protein."

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the transfer of amino acids to tRNA by a two-step reaction. In the first step, the amino acid substrate reacts with MgATP to form the enzyme-bound aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate. In the second step of the reaction, the aminoacyl moiety is transferred from the aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate to the 3′ end of tRNA. There are two distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family, of which tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is a member, is characterized by an amino-terminal Rossmann-fold and conserved “HIGH” and “KMSKS” signature sequences. In tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, the conserved HIGH and KMSKS signature sequences stabilize the transition state for the first step of the reaction (1.Lowe D.M. Fersht A.R. Wilkinson A.J. Carter P.

Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is a homodimeric enzyme that displays “half-of-the-sites” reactivity with respect to tyrosine binding and tyrosyl-adenylate formation (9.Koch G.L. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10.Koch G.L. Boulanger Y. Hartley B.S.

Site-directed mutagenesis and pre-steady state kinetic analyses have been used to identify 18 active site amino acids that stabilize the transition state for tyrosine activation in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme (reviewed in Refs. 12.Fersht A.R.

Academic Press Limited, Portland, OR1998: 573-607Google Scholar). Four of these amino acids are absent in the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. In the B. stearothermophilus enzyme, replacement of three of these amino acids, Cys-35, His-48, and Lys-233, destabilizes the transition state for tyrosine activation by 1.2, 1.2, and 3.0 kcal/mol, respectively (1.Lowe D.M.

His-48 and Lys-233 are members of the HIGH and KMSKS signature motifs that characterize the Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. These observations suggest that either the specific activity of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is less than that of theB. stearothermophilus enzyme, or alternate functional groups are present in the active site of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase that compensate for the absence of Cys-35, His-48, and Lys-233. Identifying differences in the active sites of the human and bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases will facilitate the development of antibiotics that specifically target the bacterial enzyme. In this paper, we show that a change in the intrinsic fluorescence of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase can be used to monitor the pre-steady state kinetics of tyrosine activation. Pre-steady state kinetic methods are then used to test the hypothesis that the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is less active than the B. stearothermophilusenzyme with respect to tyrosine activation and to demonstrate that the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase requires potassium to stabilize the transition state complex during formation of the tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate (Scheme 1).

Purification of the recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was carried out using a modification of the method described by Kleeman et al. (16.Kleeman T.A. Wei D. Simpson K.L. First E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14420-14425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was expressed with a removable amino-terminal His-tag/S-tag inEscherichia coli BL21DE3 pLysS cells harboring the pHYTS3-wt plasmid (16.Kleeman T.A. Wei D.

The cells were lysed by sonication in Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 8) and the cellular debris removed by centrifugation. The cleared lysate was then loaded onto a Ni-NTA gravity flow column equilibrated with Buffer A and the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was eluted with Buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) plus 0.1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate overnight to remove any bound tyrosyl-adenylate, followed by dialysis against Buffer B. The protein solution was then loaded onto a Bio-Rad UNO Q6 anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography column and eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in Buffer B. The peak eluting at 140 mm NaCl was collected and dialyzed against two buffer changes of Buffer C (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm MgCl2) and finally against Buffer C plus 10% glycerol (v/v). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses (using an antibody directed against the amino-terminal S-tag) were used to assess the purity of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (17.Kim J.S. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The concentration of the enzyme was determined using a filter-based active-site titration assay as described in Ref. 19.Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and fromA 280 measurements in the presence of 6m guanidine hydrochloride (ε = 89,040m−1 cm−1 as determined by the ExPASy ProtParam tool (20.Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar)). The enzyme was stored at −70 °C. The amino-terminal His-tag was removed by enterokinase digestion following the protocol in the Enterokinase Cleavage Capture Kit. Enterokinase digestion yields the wild type protein with no additional amino acids at the amino terminus. Enterokinase digestion was carried out overnight at 4 °C with an enterokinase concentration of 5 units/mg of synthetase. Under these conditions the cleavage efficiency was 100%, with minimal (<20%) cleavage of the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase at secondary sites. Following enterokinase digestion, the His-tag was then separated from the free enzyme with a second Ni-NTA affinity chromatography step followed by ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography using the conditions described above. Steady-state fluorescence emission measurements were performed at 25 °C using a TimeMaster Fluorescence Spectrometer (Photon Technology International). The intrinsic fluorescence of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, in Buffer D (150 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2) plus 1 unit/ml pyrophosphatase, was measured in the absence and presence of substrates (λex = 295 nm, λem = 300–400 nm). For the titration experiments, aliquots of either MgATP or tyrosine were added to the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (4 μm) or the B. stearothermophilus enzyme (2 μm) and 1 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase in either Buffer D alone, Buffer D + 200 μm tyrosine, or Buffer D + 10 mm MgATP, respectively. Inorganic pyrophosphatase was added to the reaction to: 1) help drive the reaction in the direction of tyrosyl-adenylate formation; 2) prevent accumulation of the TyrRS 1The abbreviations used are: TyrRStyrosyl-tRNA synthetasetRNATyrtyrosine tRNA ·Tyr-AMP·PPicomplex; and 3) prevent the reverse reaction from occurring. After allowing the reaction to equilibrate for 2 min at 25 °C, the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme was then excited at 295 nm and the relative intensity of the fluorescence emission determined by integrating the area under the emission curve from 320 to 400 nm. The relative fluorescence intensity was normalized using the emission of the free enzyme as 100%, plotted against the substrate concentration, and fit to a standard linear equation as well as the following equation, which describes the binding of substrates measured by a fluorescence change, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase tyrosine tRNA F=(([L] T(FE−FS))/([L] T+Kd))+FSEquation 1 where F is the fluorescence intensity, [L]T is the total ligand concentration,F E is the fluorescence intensity at saturation,F S is the starting fluorescence signal, andK d is the dissociation constant of the substrate of interest (21.Engel P.C. Enzymology Labfax. 1st Ed. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Equilibrium dialysis was performed using a modification of the method previously described by Fersht (19.Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μm tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in Buffer E (150 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmMgCl2) was placed in one chamber (chamber A) of each cell in an 8-cell equilibrium dialyzer (Hoefer). The other chamber (chamber B) of each cell contained concentrations ofl-[14C]tyrosine ranging from 2 to 200 μm in Buffer E. A dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cut-off of 12,000–14,000 separated the chambers. After overnight dialysis, the l-[14C]tyrosine concentrations in each chamber were determined by removing 40-μl aliquots, adding each aliquot to 5 ml of Cytoscint scintillation mixture, and counting in a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. The concentration of tyrosine in each chamber was calculated from the specific activity of the stockl-[14C]tyrosine (5 μl of the 300 μm stock l-[14C]tyrosine was counted to determine the specific activity). The concentrations of enzyme-bound and free tyrosine were calculated by subtracting the tyrosine concentration in chamber B ([Free]) from that in chamber A ([Bound] + [Free]). The data were analyzed by both nonlinear and linear curve fitting using the following equations, α=n[Free]/([Kd+[Free])Equation 2 [Bound]/[Free]=(−1/Kd)[Free]+n[E] T/KdEquation 3 where α = [Bound Tyrosine]/[E]T,K d is the dissociation constant for tyrosine,n is the number of binding sites, and [E]T is the total enzyme concentration (21.Engel P.C. Enzymology Labfax. 1st Ed. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar,22.Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar). All kinetic analyses were performed in Buffer D at 25 °C unless otherwise indicated. Stopped-flow fluorescence studies were used to monitor the tyrosine and ATP dependence of tyrosine activation and the pyrophosphate dependence of the reverse reaction in the pre-steady-state (11.Fersht A.R. Mulvey R.S. Koch G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In these studies an SX 18.MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics) was used to monitor the decrease in fluorescence of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase associated with the formation of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex and the increase in fluorescence associated with the reverse reaction (λex = 295 nm, λem> 320 nm). In the tyrosine and ATP dependence experiments, one syringe contained the enzyme (0.3–0.5 μm), pyrophosphatase, and saturating concentrations of either tyrosine or MgATP in Buffer D (200 μm tyrosine or 10 mm MgATP). The other syringe contained pyrophosphatase and either 0.1–20 mmMgATP or 2–200 μm tyrosine and the saturating concentration of the other substrate in Buffer D. Upon mixing equal volumes of each syringe, the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein was monitored over a 3-s time period. Pyrophosphatase was added to prevent the reverse reaction from occurring once the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex had formed. For analysis of the reverse reaction, the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex was formed by incubating the enzyme in Buffer D* (Buffer D with 75 mm KCl instead of 150 mm) plus pyrophosphatase with saturating concentrations of tyrosine and MgATP at 25 °C for 30 min (3.Wells T.N. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex was separated from free tyrosine and MgATP by gel filtration on NAP-25 columns (Amersham Bioscience) (3.Wells T.N. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The reverse reaction was monitored by mixing varying concentrations of tetrasodium pyrophosphate (0.1–0.8 mm) with the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex (0.3 μm) in Buffer D* at 25 °C and measuring the increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein (11.Fersht A.R. Mulvey R.S. Koch G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All kinetic data were fit to a single exponential floating end point equation using the Kaleidagraph and Applied Photophysics stopped-flow software packages to determine the observed rate constants (k obs). The Kaleidagraph software was used to plot k obs versus the substrate concentrations and to fit these plots to the following hyperbolic function,kobs=k3 [S] T/(Kd+[S] T)Equation 4 where k 3 is the forward rate constant for the formation of tyrosyl-adenylate, [S]T is the total substrate concentration, and K d is the dissociation constant of the substrate of interest (21.Engel P.C. Enzymology Labfax. 1st Ed. Academic Press, New York1996Google Scholar). For the pyrophosphate dependence, it was not possible to reach saturating pyrophosphate concentrations, preventing k −3from being determined independently of K PPi. Instead, the reverse reaction was monitored under conditions whereK PPi ≫ [PPi], andk −3/K PPi was determined by fitting the data to the resulting linear approximation of a hyperbolic function analogous to Equation 3. Scheme 1 defines the relevant rate and dissociation constants for the tyrosine activation reaction. The relative free energies for each state along the reaction pathway were calculated from the rate and dissociation constants using the following equations, assuming standard states of 1 m for ATP, tyrosine, and pyrophosphate, ΔGTyrRS·Tyr=RTln KTyrEquation 5 ΔGTyrRS·Tyr·ATP=RTln(KTyrKATP′)Equation 6 ΔG[TyrRS·Tyr­ATP]‡=RTln (kBT/h)−RT ln(k3/KATP′KTyr)Equation 7 ΔGTyrRS·Tyr­AMP·PPi=−RTln(k3/k−3KATP′KTyr)Equation 8 ΔGTyrRS·Tyr­AMP=−RTln(k3KPPi/k−3KATP′KTyr)Equation 9 where G is the Gibbs free energy, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature,k B is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck's constant, [TyrRS·Tyr-ATP]‡ is the transition state complex (3.Wells T.N. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), · and − represent noncovalent and covalent bonds, respectively; ‡ denotes the transition state, and PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate. The free energies for each complex in Equations Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9 are calculated relative to the free energy of the unliganded enzyme. The free energy for the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP·PPi complex could not be determined because we were unable to obtain k −3 andK PPi independently of each other. The experimentally determined value fork −3/K PPi was used to calculate the free energy of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex. The Gibbs activation energy for the formation of tyrosyl-adenylate was calculated by taking the difference in free energies between the transition state and the TyrRS·Tyr·ATP complex immediately preceding the transition state. Subtracting Equation 6 from Equation 7 results in the following equation,EA=RTln (kBT/h)−RTlnk3Equation 10 which was used to calculate the Gibbs activation energy. In B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, site-directed mutagenesis and pre-steady state kinetic analyses have been used to identify 18 amino acids that help catalyze the formation of the tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate (reviewed in Refs. 12.Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8031-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar and 13.First E.A. Sinnott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 1. Academic Press Limited, Portland, OR1998: 573-607Google Scholar). Primary sequence alignment of the Rossmann-fold domains for the human andB. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases indicates that four of these 18 active site residues (Cys-35, His-48, Thr-51, and Lys-233) are not conserved in the human enzyme. In the B. stearothermophilus enzyme, three of these four amino acids, Cys-35, His-48, and Thr-51, form hydrogen bonds with the ribose ring of the ATP substrate, while the fourth amino acid, Lys-233, forms a hydrogen bond with the pyrophosphate moiety of ATP on formation of the transition state complex (1.Lowe D.M.

In human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, Cys-35, His-48, Thr-51, and Lys-233 are replaced by Trp-40, Tyr-52, Pro-55, and Ser-225, respectively (Fig. 1). In B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, formation of the enzyme-bound tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate is associated with a decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the enzyme above 320 nm (11.Fersht A.R. Mulvey R.S. Koch G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar fluorescence change also occurs in the human enzyme, the recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase containing an amino-terminal His-tag/S-tag was purified and the fluorescence emission spectra of the enzyme in the presence of tyrosine, MgATP, and tyrosine + MgATP were monitored (17.Kim J.S. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25.Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The steady state emission spectra were determined under irreversible reaction conditions due to the presence of either pyrophosphatase (Fig. 2, panels A andB) or apyrase (an enzyme from potato that has both ATPase and ADPase activity) (Fig. 2, panel C). As a result, there is no equilibrium between the TyrRS·Tyr·ATP and TyrRS·Tyr-AMP·PPi complexes. In the absence of substrates, human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase exhibits a relative fluorescence emission maximum at 350 nm when excited at 295 nm (Fig. 2,panels A and B). The addition of 200 μm tyrosine to the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase causes the relative fluorescence emission spectrum to be blue-shifted by 13 (±1) nm, resulting in an 8% decrease in the fluorescence emission of the enzyme above 320 nm. This decrease is not observed when alanine is used in place of tyrosine (data not shown). Inner-filter effects due to the presence of tyrosine are negligible (Fig. 2, panel A). The addition of 10 mm MgATP to the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase results in a 25% decrease in the total fluorescence emission of the enzyme (Fig. 2, panel B). This observed decrease is due to inner-filter effects (discussed below). The addition of 200 μm tyrosine and 10 mm MgATP together produces a 3 (±1) nm enhancement of the blue-shift observed in the presence of tyrosine alone. After correcting for the inner-filter effect of MgATP, this enhanced blue-shift results in an additional 8% decrease in the relative fluorescence of the enzyme above 320 nm. These changes in the emission spectrum of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase are similar to fluorescence changes previously observed with theB. stearothermophilus enzyme on formation of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex (11.Fersht A.R. Mulvey R.S. Koch G.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The preformed human TyrRS·Tyr-AMP intermediate exhibits a relative fluorescence emission maximum at 337 nm (Fig. 2, panel C). When 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate is added to this complex, the relative fluorescence emission spectrum is red-shifted by 15 (±4) nm, resulting in an increase in the relative fluorescence emission above 320 nm. This is the exact opposite of the fluorescence shift observed when human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is incubated with tyrosine and MgATP, and is consistent with the hypothesis that the increase in fluorescence on addition of pyrophosphate is due to the conversion of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP intermediate to TyrRS + Tyr + ATP. To verify that the decrease in the relative fluorescence of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is due to formation of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex, titration experiments were performed in the presence of pyrophosphatase (Fig. 3). In these experiments, the fluorescence emission of the enzyme was monitored between 320 and 400 nm. In Fig. 3, panel A, human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was preincubated in either the absence or presence of saturating concentrations of MgATP (10 mm). In the absence of MgATP, the addition of tyrosine resulted in an equilibrium between the free enzyme and the TyrRS·Tyr complex. A small decrease (8%) in the relative fluorescence emission was observed. This titration displays saturation binding, giving a dissociation constant for tyrosine (K Tyr) of 25 (±10) μm. This is in excellent agreement with the value for K Tyr obtained from equilibrium dialysis, 34 (±8) μm, and is consistent with the fluorescence decrease corresponding to tyrosine binding. In the presence of 10 mm MgATP, the addition of tyrosine resulted in a much more significant (16%) decrease in the relative fluorescence emission of the enzyme. In this case, there was no equilibrium between TyrRS·MgATP + Tyr and TyrRS·Tyr-AMP·PPi, since the addition of pyrophosphate makes the forward reaction essentially irreversible. In addition, the maximum concentration of pyrophosphate produced in the experiment, 4 μm, is well below its dissociation constant (K PPi > 1 mm), preventing accumulation of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP·PPi intermediate. Since tyrosine is irreversibly converted to tyrosyl-adenylate under these conditions, there is a linear relationship between the amount of tyrosine added and the observed decrease in fluorescence. When all of the free enzyme had been converted to the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex, no additional decrease in fluorescence was observed (Fig. 3, panel A). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the relative fluorescence decrease is due to changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme upon the formation of the TyrRS·Tyr-AMP complex and not due to inner-filter effects. These results are similar to the results of titration experiments done with the B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Fig. 3, panel A, inset). In contrast, when MgATP is added to human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in the presence of saturating concentrations of tyrosine (200 μm), the relative fluorescence does not plateau once the MgATP-binding site is saturated, but instead continues to decrease as the concentration of MgATP increases (Fig. 3, Panel B). In these experiments, the initial concentration of MgATP used was 0.4 mm, which is 100-fold larger that the enzyme concentration in the experiment. As a result, even at the lowest concentration of MgATP used, the enzyme is saturated. For this reason, the MgATP titration data were fit to a single linear equation. The linear relationship between the concentration of MgATP and the relative fluorescence emission indicates that the decrease in fluorescence upon addition of MgATP is due to inner-filter effects. A stopped-flow reaction analyzer was used to determine whether the decrease in relative fluorescence, observed upon mixing tyrosine and MgATP with the enzyme, and the increase in relative fluorescence, observed upon mixing the pre-formed enzyme-bound tyrosyl-adenylate complex with tetrasodium pyrophosphate, could be monitored over time. These experiments were performed in the presence of pyrophosphatase. When MgATP is mixed with human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase that has been pre-incubated with tyrosine, a rapid single exponential decrease in relative fluorescence is observed (Fig. 4, panel A). When tyrosine i"
https://openalex.org/W1990244632,"Stimulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1) triggers both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent signaling activities. The caspase-dependent signaling pathway induces apoptotic cell death in susceptible cells, whereas the caspase-independent signaling cascade leads to activation of nuclear factor κB and induces antiapoptotic signaling activities. Stimulation of nuclear factor κB via TNF-R1 is known to activate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in infected cells. Here we show that the broad range caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (ZVAD) activates HIV replication in the chronically infected T-cell line ACH-2. Virus activation was caused by a sensitization of TNF-R1 toward endogenously produced tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibodies completely abolished the virus-inducing activity of ZVAD. Treatment of cells with TNF-α in the presence of ZVAD caused increased expression of TNF-α and induced enhanced virus replication. Activation of CD95, another member of the TNF receptor family, similarly triggered HIV replication, which was further enhanced in the presence of ZVAD. Our data show that caspase inhibitors sensitize both CD95 and TNF-R1 to mediate activation of HIV in latently infected cells. Activation of HIV replication in latent virus reservoirs is currently discussed as a therapeutic strategy to achieve eradication of HIV in patients treated with antiretroviral therapy. Our results point to a novel role for caspase inhibitors as activators of virus replication <i>in vivo</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2167179552,"Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) pyrophosphatase (Y-PPase) is a tight homodimer with two active sites separated in space from the subunit interface. The present study addresses the effects of mutation of four amino acid residues at the subunit interface on dimer stability and catalytic activity. The W52S variant of Y-PPase is monomeric up to an enzyme concentration of 300 μm, whereas R51S, H87T, and W279S variants produce monomer only in dilute solutions at pH ≥ 8.5, as revealed by sedimentation, gel electrophoresis, and activity measurements. Monomeric Y-PPase is considerably more sensitive to the SH reagentsN-ethylmaleimide andp-hydroxymercurobenzosulfonate than the dimeric protein. Additionally, replacement of a single cysteine residue (Cys83), which is not part of the subunit interface or active site, with Ser resulted in insensitivity of the monomer to SH reagents and stabilization against spontaneous inactivation during storage. Active site ligands (Mg2+ cofactor, Piproduct, and the PPi analog imidodiphosphate) stabilized the W279S dimer versus monomer predominantly by decreasing the rate of dimer to monomer conversion. The monomeric protein exhibited a markedly increased (5–9-fold) Michaelis constant, whereaskcat remained virtually unchanged, compared with dimer. These results indicate that dimerization of Y-PPase improves its substrate binding performance and, conversely, that active site adjustment through cofactor, product, or substrate binding strengthens intersubunit interactions.

Family I PPases are homohexamers of ∼20-kDa subunits in prokaryotes and homodimers of ∼32-kDa subunits in eukaryotes with highly conserved active sites and mechanisms of action (3Cooperman B.S.

All intersubunit interactions involve side chain atoms (Fig.1). Core intersubunit contact is formed by a three-layer stacking of the aromatic rings of Trp52, His87, His87′, and Trp52′, with His87 and His87′ forming the central layer (′ represents residues of the second subunit). Trp279 and Trp279′ pack perpendicular and on the outside of this three-layer stack. Polar contacts between subunits include hydrogen bonds His87—His87′, Arg51 side chain—Asp277′ main chain oxygen, and a symmetrical Arg51′—Asp277 interaction. The interface is essentially conserved in other fungal and animal PPases, except for a His87 to Lys replacement in four of the nine known sequences (5Sivula T. Salminen A. Parfenyev A.N.

Active monomeric Y-PPase was previously obtained upon covalent immobilization on Sepharose beads, followed by denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride and renaturation of the protein (14Plaksina E.A. Sergienko O.V. Sklyankina V.A. Avaeva S.M. Bioorg. Khim. 1981; 7: 357-363Google Scholar). Here we describe the effects of Arg51, Trp52, His87, and Trp279 substitutions on the quaternary structure and activity of Y-PPase. Our results indicate that mutation of Trp52 has the most significant effect on dimerization and that active site ligands enhance dimer stability. The production and purification of wild-type and variant Y-PPase from overproducing Escherichia coliXL2blueb strains transformed with suitable plasmids were performed as described by Heikinheimo et al. (15Heikinheimo P. Pohjanjoki P. Helminen A. Tasanen M. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Baykov A. Lahti R. Eur. J.

Enzyme concentration was calculated on the basis of the subunit molecular mass of 32.0 kDa (16Kolakowski L.F. Schlösser M. Cooperman B.S.

Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5007) Google Scholar). The initial rates of PPi hydrolysis were measured using a continuous Pi assay (19Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The assay medium contained 6 μm PPi, 20 mmMg2+, 0.15 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and 40 μm EGTA, except where specified. The reaction was initiated by adding enzyme and continued for 3–4 min at 25 °C. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was done with a 12.5% gel in a Sigma-Aldrich vertical electrophoresis unit. The gel buffer and the running buffer were 25 mmTris-glycine, pH 9.3, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (20Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 32Google Scholar). Electrophoresis in the presence of 0.55% dodecyl sulfate was performed with a 8–25% gradient gel, using the Phast System (Amersham Biosciences). Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out in a Spinco E instrument (Beckman-Spinco), with scanning at 280 nm. Sedimentation velocity was measured at 48,000 rpm, and the sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, was calculated using standard procedures (21Chervenka C.H. Methods for the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Spinco Division of Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1972: 23-33Google Scholar). A partial specific volume of 0.730 cm3/g at 25 °C was calculated from the amino acid composition. The following pH buffers were used for enzyme incubations: (a) 0.1 m citric acid/NaOH and 50 μm EGTA (pH 4.5); (b) 0.083 mTES/KOH, 0.017 m KCl, and 50 μm EGTA (pH 7.2); (c) 0.09 m TAPS/KOH and 5 μmEGTA (pH 8.5); and (d) 0.052 m TAPS/KOH and 0.048 m CAPS/KOH (pH 9.3). All measurements were performed at 25 °C. Eqs. 1 and 2 (derived from SchemeFSI) describe time-courses of activity (A) resulting from dimer (D) conversion into monomer (M) and the reverse reaction, as well as the equilibrium activity (at t = ∞ and dαD/dt = 0) as a function of enzyme concentration (22Velichko I.S.

AD andAM are the specific activities of the dimer and monomer, respectively; αD is the fraction of the dimer at time t; [E]t is total enzyme subunit concentration; ka and kd are the apparent rate constants for association and dissociation, respectively. Eqs. 1 and 2 were simultaneously fit to data with the SCIENTIST program (MicroMath).A=AD+(AD−AM)αDEquation 1 dαDdt=2kα[E]t(1-αD)2-kdαDEquation 2 The primary goal of this work was to redesign the subunit interface to yield nonassociating and stable monomer. Low probability substitutions (23Overington J. Donnelly D. Johnson M.S. Sali A. Blundell T.J. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) of dimer-forming residues were specifically selected (W/S, H/T, and R/S) to induce structural changes within this region of the protein. Three single variants (W52S, H87T, and W279S) and one double variant (H87T/W279S) were expressed and isolated in amounts ranging from 90 to 200 mg/liter culture medium. However, the R51S variant, as well as the R51G and R51L variants, could not be expressed, possibly as a consequence of replacing the buried and charged Arg51 side chain with uncharged side chains. A more conservative R51K replacement preserving the positive charge on the side chain resulted in yield improvement. Another major problem was the low stability of the W52S variant during short-term incubations in solution or long-term storage as a frozen solution, which ultimately resulted in a large scatter in data for this variant. This behavior was dithiothreitol-dependent, suggesting the involvement of SH groups. The problem was solved by replacement of the single Cys residue in Y-PPase (Cys83) with Ser. All preparations of the variant proteins used in this study were >95% homogeneous, as observed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The first indication of altered quaternary structure in Y-PPase interface variants was evident upon native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which revealed that they migrated faster than the wild-type enzyme and the noninterface variant, C83S (Fig. 2). Direct evidence for changes in the quaternary structure was additionally provided by sedimentation data (TableI). The W52S variant exhibited a lowers20,w value (2.4 S) than wild-type PPase (4.0 S) at both pH 7.2 and pH 9.3, indicating monomeric protein as a result of the mutation. The other single-amino acid-substituted variants were dimers at pH 7.2 and mixtures of monomer and dimer at pH 9.3 and 5 μm enzyme, as indicated by thes20,w values. The W52S substitution had the the most significant effect on the quaternary structure of the protein. A combination of two substitutions (H87T and W279S), each inadequate in yielding monomers at pH 7.2, also resulted in monomeric protein at both pH values.Table ISedimentation coefficientsEnzymes20,wpH 7.2pH 9.3(S)Wild type4.04.0R51K4.23.1W52S2.42.4H87T4.02.8W279S4.03.1W52S/C83S2.62.3H87T/W279S2.42.4Samples contained 5 μm enzyme, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and appropriate buffers.

Open table in a new tab Samples contained 5 μm enzyme, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and appropriate buffers. Before each run, the samples were preincubated for 1–3 h at 25 °C. The s20,w values are accurate to ±0.2 S. Wild-type PPase remained dimeric at pH values as low as 4.5, in both the absence and presence of Mg2+, as indicated by the unchanged s20,w value (4.0 S). Dimer-monomer interconversion was conveniently monitored by activity measurements because activities of the dimer and monomer were different, and they converted into each other slowly on the time scale of the enzyme assay. This approach was used previously in studies on E. coliPPase variants with weakened quaternary structure (22Velichko I.S. Mikalahti K. Kasho V.N. Dudarenkov V.Y. Hyytiä T. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S.

In accordance with the sedimentation data, the specific activity of W279S-PPase (measured with 6 μm substrate) increased with enzyme concentration in a stock solution preincubated at pH 9.3 (Fig.3), as expected for a slow equilibrium between dimer and less active monomer. No such inactivation of W279S-PPase at low enzyme concentrations was observed upon preincubation at pH 7.2. In contrast, the specific activity of wild-type Y-PPase and its W52S/C83S variant remained constant (240 ± 15 and 29 ± 2 s−1, respectively) on preincubation with 1 mm Mg2+ at both pH 7.2 and pH 9.3 at the same range of enzyme concentrations (data not shown). The inactivation of the W279S variant observed at pH 9.3 was completely reversed by decreasing the pH to 7.2 (Fig. 4).Figure 4Reversibility of W279S-PPase inactivation at pH 9.3. Enzyme solution (16 nm) was pre-equilibrated at pH 9.3 in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ as described in the Fig. 3 legend, and the pH was lowered to 7.2 with 0.5m TES at a specific time (indicated by thearrow). Aliquots were withdrawn as a function of time, and PPase activity was assayed at pH 7.2. The line was obtained with Eqs. 1 and 2 using ka value specified in Table II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The shift in the activity versus enzyme concentration profile to the left caused by the active site ligands Mg2+, Pi, and imidodiphosphate (a PPi analog containing N instead of O at the bridge position) (Fig. 3) indicated that the ligands stabilize the dimer rather than the monomer. The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant for dimer (Kd =kd/ka) derived from these profiles with Eqs. 1 and 2 decreased by 4 orders of magnitude in the presence of Mg2+ and imidodiphosphate. The effects of the active site ligands on the rate of W279S-PPase dissociation (Fig.5) paralleled their effects onKd (Table II). Because imidodiphosphate is a tightly bound (Km < 1 μm) and slowly converted (kcat = 0.01 s−1) substrate for Y-PPases (28Smirnova I.N. Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), enzyme concentration was limited to 0.6 μm in the experiments illustrated in Figs. 3 and 5 to ensure that at least 50% of imidodiphosphate remained intact at the end of the incubation.Table IIParameters for dimer-monomer equilibrium in W279S-PPasepHLigandsKdkdka(μm)(min−1)(μm−1min−1)7.21 mmMg2+<0.015.4 ± 0.88.51 mmMg2+0.020 ± 0.0030.016 ± 0.0020.8 ± 0.29.30.01 mmMg2+27 ± 31.40 ± 0.150.05 ± 0.019.31 mmMg2+1.6 ± 0.40.30 ± 0.040.19 ± 0.089.31 mm Mg2+ + 3 mmPi0.23 ± 0.030.057 ± 0.0030.25 ± 0.059.31 mm Mg2+ + 0.1 mM imidodiphosphate0.0044 ± 0.00050.0044 ± 0.00091.0 ± 0.1Values of Kd and kd were estimated with Eqns. 1 and 2 from the dependencies shown in Figs. 3 and5, respectively, and similar dependencies measured at pH 7.2 and pH 8.5; ka values at pH 7.2 were estimated from Fig. 4;ka values at pH 8.5 and pH 9.3 were calculated askd/Kd. Open table in a new tab Values of Kd and kd were estimated with Eqns. 1 and 2 from the dependencies shown in Figs. 3 and5, respectively, and similar dependencies measured at pH 7.2 and pH 8.5; ka values at pH 7.2 were estimated from Fig. 4;ka values at pH 8.5 and pH 9.3 were calculated askd/Kd. Fitting Eqs. 1 and 2 with ka =kd/Kd (Kdvalues specified in Table II) to the time-courses shown in Fig. 5allowed the estimation of kd. The value ofka at pH 7.2 was obtained by fitting Eqs. 1 and 2 to the time-course of the association reaction (Fig. 4), which was essentially irreversible (i.e. kd could be set to 0) because the enzyme was predominantly monomeric at the start of the reaction and dimeric at the end of the reaction. A similar analysis was performed for W279S-PPase at a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations for yielding kdand ka dependences, as shown in Fig.6. The dependence ofkd may be described by SchemeFSII, which implies an effect of two metal ions bound sequentially with dissociation constants of KM(1) and KM(2). The shape of the profile indicates that kd2 is the lowest of the three individual dissociation rate constants shown in Scheme FSII. Fitting the data of Fig. 6 to Eq. 3 allowed the evaluation of all parameters in Scheme FSII: KM(1) = 19 ± 8 μm, KM(2) > 20,000 μm, kd1 = 2.1 ± 0.3 min−1, kd2 = 0.12 ± 0.08 min−1, and kd3 > 1 min−1.kd=kd1+kd2[Mg2+]/KM(1)+kd3+kd2[Mg2+]2/KM(1)KM(2)1+[Mg2+]/KM(1)+[Mg2+]2/KM(1)KM(2)Equation 3 Figure FSIID⇌KM(1)DMg⇌KM(2)DMg2↓kd1↓kd2↓kd3Show full captionDissociation of dimeric W279S-PPase in the presence of metal ions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dissociation of dimeric W279S-PPase in the presence of metal ions.

In dimeric Y-PPase, the single Cys residue/subunit, located at ∼5 Å from the subunit interface, is shielded by C-terminal residues 280–284 (13Heikinheimo P. Tuominen V. Ahonen A.-K. Teplyakov A.

Khim. 1982; 8: 195-199Google Scholar). Consistent with this structure,N-ethylmaleimide had a minimal effect on the activity of wild-type Y-PPase and its dimeric W279S variant at pH 7.2, as confirmed by the s20,w values, but inactivated the monomeric W52S variant (Fig. 7).p-HMBS, a more reactive SH reagent, inactivated the dimeric PPases appreciably, but again, the effect on the monomeric W52S variant was much more significant. The Cys residue was not appreciably modified by N-ethylmaleimide in the dimeric PPases but was nearly completely modified in monomeric W52S-PPase at pH 7.2, as confirmed by a greater inactivating effect of p-HMBS on theN-ethylmaleimide-treated wild-type PPase and W279S-PPase compared with W52S-PPase (Fig. 7). The monomeric double variant (W52S/C83S) lacking Cys was not inactivated byN-ethylmaleimide. At pH 9.3, both p-HMBS and N-ethylmaleimide modified wild-type PPase significantly, causing partial dissociation into monomers, as indicated by the decrease ins20,w (Fig. 7). Again, the W279S variant that is predominantly monomeric at this pH value displayed significantly greater reactivity to these reagents and decreaseds20,w values upon the modification. Only minor changes in kcat and Km values were observed in the dimeric variant PPases, compared with wild-type protein (Table III), indicating no significant alterations in the active site. The monomeric forms of all variant PPases exhibited markedly increased Kmvalues, whereas kcat values decreased significantly in only two variants (W52S and W279S).Table IIIMichaelis-Menten parameters for dimeric and monomeric PPasesEnzymeDimerMonomerkcatKmkcatKm(s−1)(μm)(s−1)(μm)Wild type304 ± 101.3 ± 0.2R51K317 ± 32.4 ± 0.1300 ± 12017 ± 4W52S111 ± 517 ± 3W52S/C83S330 ± 537 ± 3H87T304 ± 42.1 ± 0.1283 ± 310 ± 1W279S274 ± 111.4 ± 0.2197 ± 613 ± 1Monomeric R51K, H87T, and W279S variants were obtained by preincubation at pH 9.3 in the absence of Mg2+ at 0.003, 0.015, and 0.06 μm enzyme, respectively.

X-ray crystallography has led to the identification of four critical residues at the subunit interface of Y-PPase, specifically Arg51, Trp52, His87, and Trp279 (Fig. 1). Sedimentation, gel electrophoresis, and activity measurements reveal that the W52S substitution has a greater effect on dimer stability than the R51K, H87T, and W279S substitutions. Among other factors, the nature of a substitution largely influences the extent of the effects on protein structure and function. With this in mind, one can conclude that Trp52 contributes more to dimer formation than Trp279 (identical substitution) and perhaps His87 (drastic substitution), whereas the role of Arg51 may be underestimated (charge-preserving substitution). The importance of Trp52 may be explained by its participation in the three-layer stacking of aromatic rings with His87′, His87, and Trp52′ (Fig. 1). Our inability to express the R51S, R51G, and R51L variants suggests that the Arg51 residue, whose side chain is charged and buried, is important not only in dimer formation but also in maintaining overall structure. Whereas wild-type Y-PPase exists as dimer in a wide range of conditions, the W279S variant is a mixture of dimer and monomer, facilitating analyses of the effects of various stimuli on the dimer ⇌ monomer equilibrium. The results of these analyses indicated that substrate (imidodiphosphate), product (Pi), and Mg2+ stimulate dimerization (Figs. 3and 6), whereas modification of Cys83 and increasing pH have an opposite effect (Fig. 7). The effects of Mg2+ on dimer stability are mainly a result of its effect on kd (however, it should be taken into account that the kd and kavalues were obtained at different pH conditions) and are reversed at high Mg2+ concentrations (Fig. 6). Four metal binding sites/subunit have been identified in the phosphate complex of dimeric wild-type Y-PPase by x-ray crystallography (11Heikinheimo P. Lehtonen J. Baykov A. Lahti R. Cooperman B. Goldman A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1491-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Three of them bind Mg2+ in the absence of phosphate (30Baykov A.A. Shestakov A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Belogurov G.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Kasho V.N. Lehtihuhta E. Turkina V. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13931-13938Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with dissociation constants of 2.3, 15, and >5000 μm at pH 9.3 (31Belogurov G.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Kasho V.N. Lehtihuhta E. Turkina V. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13931-13938Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A comparison of these values with KM(1) of 19 ± 8 μm and KM(2)of > 20,000 μm in Scheme FSII indicates that the decrease in kd and reversal of this effect with increasing Mg2+ concentrations (Fig. 6) are associated with the binding of the second and third Mg2+ ions, respectively. It should be noted that the destabilizing effect of Mg2+ on the dimer is insignificant at physiological concentrations of the ion (∼1 mm). The Mg2+concentration dependence of ka in Fig. 6 yielded an Mg2+ binding constant of 1600 ± 600 μmfor monomeric Y-PPase at pH 7.2. Our recent kinetic analysis of the activating effect of Mg2+ on monomeric W279S-PPase 2A. N. Parfenyev, unpublished data. suggests that this constant refers to binding of the second Mg2+ ion and thus implies an 80-fold decrease in affinity for monomer, compared with dimer. Accordingly, Mg2+ stimulates dimer formation via tighter binding. Because the active site and subunit interface are separated in space, the effect of Mg2+ implies a conformational difference between monomer and dimer and between dimers with vacant and occupied M2 sites. The same considerations apply to imidodiphosphate and Pi binding. In addition to confirming that the W52S variant is monomeric, Cys83 modification helped to identify the conformational differences between dimer and monomer. The increased reactivity of Cys83 in monomer clearly indicates that the C-terminal segment that normally shields Cys83 in dimer (Fig.8) becomes more mobile or possibly adopts a completely different conformation, making the SH group accessible to modifying agents. This displacement is not a specific effect of the W279S substitution because (a) the SH group is inaccessible to N-ethylmaleimide in both dimeric wild-type PPase and dimeric W279S-PPase at pH 7.2 (Fig. 7), and (b) two different mutations (W279S and W52S) similarly increase the reactivity of the SH group in monomer (Fig. 7). At pH 9.3, the reactivity of dimer to the SH reagents is increased, which may mean that the dimer represents an equilibrium mixture of several conformations (32Ma C.-J. Tsai B. Nussinoff R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9970-9972Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), with the more reactive conformations becoming more populated at increasing pH values or in variants with weakened subunit interactions. The effect of pH on dimer stability (Table II) may be associated with His87. In dimeric Y-PPase, two His87 residues of the different subunits are linked by a hydrogen bond, implying that one of them is protonated. Loss of this proton at a high pH value should destabilize subunit interactions (see Table II for details). The conformational change resulting from monomer to dimer conversion is accompanied by an alteration in the Michaelis-Menten parameters (TableIII). In three variants (R51K, H87T, and W279S) that exist as both dimers and monomers, dimerization only slightly increaseskcat (by a factor of 1.05–1.4) but markedly decreases Km (by a factor of 5–9). The data measured for wild-type Y-PPase and its other variants that exist in only one oligomeric form are in accordance with this trend. The difference in the Km values between dimer and monomer explains the major effect of enzyme concentration on the specific activity of W279S-PPase measured at low (6 μm) substrate concentration (Fig. 3). Consistent with this explanation, a much lower inactivation was observed at low concentrations of W279S-PPase, when activity was assayed with 1000 μmsubstrate (data not shown). Thus, dimerization fine-tunes the active site of Y-PPase, allowing tighter binding of the metal cofactor and substrate (as verified by the Michaelis constant). Conversely, intersubunit interactions increase in strength upon active site adjustment caused by metal cofactor, product, or substrate analog. MgPPi binding is sufficient for complete active site organization, as indicated by similarkcat values for dimer and monomer. In this respect, the family I member, Y-PPase, principally differs from family II PPases with similar subunit size and quaternary structure, which exhibit an ∼40-fold increase in kcat upon dimerization (8Parfenyev A.N.

This may be a consequence of the two-domain structure of family II PPases with active site location at the domain interface (9Merckel M.C. Fabrichniy I.P. Salminen A. Kalkkinen N. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Structure. 2001; 9: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Ahn S. Milner A.J. Futterer K. Konopka M. Ilias M. Young T.W. White S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this case, dissociation into monomers may cause domain flexibility that cannot be overcome by substrate binding. In contrast, Y-PPase is a one-domain protein, like all family I PPases. Another interesting comparison may be made with E. coliPPase, which, like Y-PPase, belongs to family I. The active sites of the two PPases are nearly identical, but the subunit size is much smaller for E. coli PPase (20 versus 32 kDa). Accordingly, the E. coli enzyme is inactive as a monomer but fully functional as a hexamer, similar to other prokaryotic PPases of family I (27Salminen A. Efimova I.S. Parfenyev A.N. Magretova N.N. Mikalahti K. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33898-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For E. coli PPase,kcat values are similar in dimer, trimer, and hexamer, whereas Km values decrease progressively (104-fold) from dimer to hexamer (22Velichko I.S. Mikalahti K. Kasho V.N. Dudarenkov V.Y. Hyytiä T. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Lahti R. Baykov A.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Salminen A. Efimova I.S. Parfenyev A.N.

This comparison suggests that the critical mass required to form a well-ordered active site in homo-oligomeric PPases is inversely proportional to monomer mass, i.e. larger monomers lead to smaller homo-oligomers. This information is crucial in the design of other polypeptides with enzymatic activity de novo. The structure of the subunit interface is highly conserved in other fungal and animal family I PPases (5Sivula T. Salminen A. Parfenyev A.N. Pohjanjoki P. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but is significantly different in prokaryotic PPases of both families (5Sivula T. Salminen A. Parfenyev A.N. Pohjanjoki P. Goldman A. Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Merckel M.C. Fabrichniy I.P. Salminen A. Kalkkinen N. Baykov A.A.

This allows the design of selective inhibitors of PPases of families I and II that would interfere with oligomerization in pathogenic prokaryotes. In this context, it is important to note that subunit contacts are weaker in prokaryotic than in eukaryotic PPases. We thank P. V. Kalmykov, K. Mikalahti, and T. Vehmas for technical help."
