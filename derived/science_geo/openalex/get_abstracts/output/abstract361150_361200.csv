Although Lrp5 is viewed as a Wnt coreceptor, osteoblast-specific disruption of β-Catenin does not affect bone formation. Instead, we show here that Lrp5 inhibits expression of Tph1, the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for serotonin in enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum. Accordingly, decreasing serotonin blood levels normalizes bone formation and bone mass in Lrp5-deficient mice, and gut- but not osteoblast-specific Lrp5 inactivation decreases bone formation in a β-Catenin-independent manner. Moreover, gut-specific activation of Lrp5, or inactivation of Tph1, increases bone mass and prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Serotonin acts on osteoblasts through the Htr1b receptor and CREB to inhibit their proliferation. By identifying duodenum-derived serotonin as a hormone inhibiting bone formation in an Lrp5-dependent manner, this study broadens our understanding of bone remodeling and suggests potential therapies to increase bone mass.

By identifying duodenum-derived serotonin as a hormone inhibiting bone formation in an Lrp5-dependent manner, this study broadens our understanding of bone remodeling and suggests potential therapies to increase bone mass. Bone remodeling, the physiological means whereby vertebrates renew their bones during adulthood, comprises two phases: resorption of preexisting mineralized bone matrix by a specialized cell type, the osteoclast, followed by de novo bone formation by another specialized cell type, the osteoblast. Over the last 15 years, molecular and genetic studies have identified numerous local and systemic regulators of this process and as a result have considerably improved our molecular understanding of both aspects of bone remodeling (Zaidi, 2007Zaidi M. Skeletal remodeling in health and disease.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). One of the most intensively studied regulators of bone remodeling is LDL-receptor related protein 5 (LRP5) (Baron and Rawadi, 2007Baron R. Rawadi G. Targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to regulate bone formation in the adult skeleton.Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This interest stems from the fact that LRP5 loss-of-function mutations cause osteoporosis pseudoglioma (OPPG), a rare disease characterized by severe decreased bone formation and persistence of embryonic eye vascularization leading to low bone mass and blindness (Gong et al., 2001Gong Y. Slee R.B. Fukai N. Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Reginato A.M. Wang H. Cundy T. Glorieux F.H. Lev D. et al.LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) affects bone accrual and eye development.Cell. 2001; 107: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). Other, presumably activating, mutations in LRP5 cause high bone mass syndrome (Boyden et al., 2002Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. High bone density due to a mutation in LDL-receptor-related protein 5.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). That different mutations in this gene cause two bone diseases of opposite nature underscores the critical importance in the regulation of bone formation of the pathway(s) controlled by Lrp5. Lrp5 encodes a broadly expressed cell-surface molecule sharing sequence homology with Arrow, a coreceptor for the growth factor Wingless in Drosophila (Bhanot et al., 1996Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. A new member of the frizzled family from Drosophila functions as a Wingless receptor.Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Based on this sequence homology and, among other evidence, cell-based assays in which Lrp5 and Axin interaction is initiated by Wnt proteins, it is assumed that Lrp5 is a coreceptor for Wnt proteins, the vertebrate homologs of Wingless (Tamai et al., 2004Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. A mechanism for Wnt coreceptor activation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). As a result, OPPG and high bone mass syndrome are viewed as Wnt-related diseases (Krishnan et al., 2006Krishnan V. Bryant H.U. MacDougald O.A. Regulation of bone mass by Wnt signaling.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Three observations, however, challenge this view. First, contrasting with the developmental function of most Wnt proteins, there is no overt skeletal defect in Lrp5−/− embryos. Second, gain-of-function mutations in Lrp5 do not cause bone tumors as activation of Wnt signaling does in other organs (Moon et al., 2004Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. WNT and β-catenin signalling: diseases and therapies.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Third and more importantly, osteoblast-specific loss- and gain-of-function mutations in β-Catenin (β-Cat), the molecular node of canonical Wnt signaling, do not affect either bone formation or expression of genes dysregulated upon Lrp5 inactivation (Glass et al., 2005Glass II, D.A. Bialek P. Ahn J.D. Starbuck M. Patel M.S. Clevers H. Taketo M.M. Long F. McMahon A.P. Lang R.A. et al.Canonical Wnt signaling in differentiated osteoblasts controls osteoclast differentiation.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 751-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Taken individually, none of these observations rules out that Lrp5 functions as a Wnt coreceptor to regulate bone formation. However, when considered together, we viewed them as an incentive to search for additional/other mechanisms of action of this gene in osteoblasts. Serotonin is a bioamine generated in brainstem neurons and enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum that does not cross the blood-brain barrier (Mann et al., 1992Mann J.J. McBride P.A. Brown R.P. Linnoila M. Leon A.C. DeMeo M. Mieczkowski T. Myers J.E. Stanley M. Relationship between central and peripheral serotonin indexes in depressed and suicidal psychiatric inpatients.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1992; 49: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Thus, it is de facto a molecule with two functional identities depending on its site of synthesis. Whereas brain-derived serotonin is implicated in cognitive functions (Heath and Hen, 1995Heath M.J. Hen R. Serotonin receptors. Genetic insights into serotonin function.Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 997-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the function(s) of gut-derived serotonin (GDS), which accounts for 95% of total serotonin, is still a matter of debate (Gershon and Tack, 2007Gershon M.D. Tack J. The serotonin signaling system: from basic understanding to drug development for functional GI disorders.Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 397-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The GDS biosynthetic pathway involves the rate-limiting enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1). GDS is released in the general circulation, where most of it is taken up by platelets through a specific transporter (Gershon and Tack, 2007Gershon M.D. Tack J. The serotonin signaling system: from basic understanding to drug development for functional GI disorders.Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 397-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). A small fraction of it, however, remains free in the serum and may conceivably act as a hormone following its binding to serotonin receptors present on target cells (Rand and Reid, 1951Rand M. Reid G. Source of ‘serotonin’ in serum.Nature. 1951; 168: 385Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Remarkably, patients taking synthetic serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) chronically, a class of drugs increasing extracellular serotonin concentration throughout the body, can have reduced bone mass (Richards et al., 2007Richards J.B. Papaioannou A. Adachi J.D. Joseph L. Whitson H.E. Prior J.C. Goltzman D. Effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the risk of fracture.Arch. Intern. Med. 2007; 167: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). While searching for molecular mechanisms explaining Lrp5 regulation of bone formation, we identified Tph1 as the most highly overexpressed gene in Lrp5−/− bones. Tph1 was also increased in Lrp5−/− duodenal cells, its primary site of expression. Inhibiting serotonin synthesis in Lrp5−/− mice corrects their bone phenotype, and gut- but not osteoblast-specific deletion of Lrp5 recapitulates the bone phenotype of Lrp5−/− mice. The same pathway is affected, in an opposite manner, in the case of Lrp5 gain-of-function mutation, thus providing a simple molecular basis for the two diseases. Serotonin, after binding to the Htr1b receptor, determines the extent of bone formation by controlling osteoblast proliferation through the regulation of CyclinD1 expression by CREB. By revealing that Lrp5 regulates bone mass by inhibiting duodenal synthesis of serotonin, a hormone decreasing bone formation, this study points toward adapted therapies for diseases characterized by an impairment of bone formation. The different nature of the cellular events leading to a low bone mass phenotype in Lrp5−/− (decrease in bone formation) and β-Cat(ex3)osb−/− (decrease in bone resorption) mice suggested that distinct molecular mechanisms were at work in these two models. Thus, in an effort to elucidate how Lrp5 regulates bone formation, we looked for a specific molecular signature of Lrp5 loss-of-function mutation in bone in vivo. For that purpose, we analyzed the expression of genes affecting either cell proliferation (Cyclins), osteoblast differentiation (Runx2, Osx, Atf4), bone matrix deposition (Type I Collagen), or osteoclast differentiation (Osteoprotegerin, RankL) in wild-type, Lrp5−/−, and β-Cat(ex3)osb−/− bones. The only genes whose expression was decreased in Lrp5−/− bones were the regulators of cell proliferation CycD1, D2, and E1 (Figure 1A). Consistent with the fact that osteoblast number is normal in β-Cat(ex3)osb−/− mice, expression of the Cyclin genes was not affected in β-Cat(ex3)osb−/− bones; conversely, genes whose expression was affected in β-Cat(ex3)osb−/− bones were normally expressed in Lrp5−/− bones (Figure 1A). In striking contrast to the paucity of osteoblasts present in Lrp5−/− bones (Kato et al., 2002Kato M. Patel M.S. Levasseur R. Lobov I. Chang B.H. Glass II, D.A. Hartmann C. Li L. Hwang T.H. Brayton C.F. et al.Cbfa1-independent decrease in osteoblast proliferation, osteopenia, and persistent embryonic eye vascularization in mice deficient in Lrp5, a Wnt coreceptor.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), Lrp5−/− osteoblasts proliferated as well as WT cells ex vivo (Figure 1B). We interpreted the discrepancy between the in vivo and ex vivo proliferation abilities of the Lrp5−/− osteoblasts as indicating that Lrp5 loss-of-function mutations affect osteoblast proliferation through extracellular signals that may not originate from osteoblasts, in other words that Lrp5-related bone diseases may not originate from bones. As a first attempt to test the aforementioned hypothesis, we reanalyzed results of a microarray experiment performed earlier (Glass et al., 2005Glass II, D.A. Bialek P. Ahn J.D. Starbuck M. Patel M.S. Clevers H. Taketo M.M. Long F. McMahon A.P. Lang R.A. et al.Canonical Wnt signaling in differentiated osteoblasts controls osteoclast differentiation.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 751-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). The gene most highly expressed in Lrp5−/− compared to WT bones was Tph1, which encodes an enzyme initiating synthesis outside the brain of serotonin, a secreted molecule that may affect bone mass (Warden et al., 2005Warden S.J. Robling A.G. Sanders M.S. Bliziotes M.M. Turner C.H. Inhibition of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) transporter reduces bone accrual during growth.Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Real-time PCR analysis verified that Tph1 was overexpressed in Lrp5−/− osteoblasts and bones (Figure 1D). Tph1 is predominantly expressed in duodenum in WT mice and it was also vastly overexpressed in this organ in Lrp5−/− mice, where its expression was 1500-fold higher than in osteoblasts and 150-fold higher than in any other part of the gastrointestinal tract (Figures 1E and 1F). Tph1 expression was not affected in β-Cat(ex3)osb−/− bones, further differentiating Lrp5 and canonical Wnt signaling regulations of bone mass (see Figure S1A available online). In contrast, neither expression of Tph2, the enzyme initiating serotonin synthesis in the brain, nor brain serotonin content was affected in Lrp5−/− mice (Figures S1B and S1C). This latter observation is consistent with the notion that serotonin does not cross the blood-brain barrier (Mann et al., 1992Mann J.J. McBride P.A. Brown R.P. Linnoila M. Leon A.C. DeMeo M. Mieczkowski T. Myers J.E. Stanley M. Relationship between central and peripheral serotonin indexes in depressed and suicidal psychiatric inpatients.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1992; 49: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Multiple correlative evidence suggested that this increase in Tph1 expression is implicated in the development of the Lrp5−/− mice bone phenotype. First, Tph1 expression was normal in newborn Lrp5−/− mice that do not display overt bone abnormalities but increased steadily thereafter (Figures 1G, S1D, and S1E). A significant increase in Tph1 expression was first detected at 2 weeks of age, that is, 2 weeks before the low bone mass phenotype becomes apparent in Lrp5−/− mice. Consistent with this increase in Tph1 expression, blood serotonin levels increased as a function of time in Lrp5−/− mice (Figure 1H). This large increase in blood serotonin levels was not due to more platelets in Lrp5−/− mice (Figure S1F). Second, Tph1 expression and blood serotonin levels were increased in Lrp5+/− mice that also have a low bone mass (Figures 1G and 1H). Third, there was in three OPPG patients tested (Gong et al., 2001Gong Y. Slee R.B. Fukai N. Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S. Reginato A.M. Wang H. Cundy T. Glorieux F.H. Lev D. et al.LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) affects bone accrual and eye development.Cell. 2001; 107: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar, Toomes et al., 2004Toomes C. Bottomley H.M. Jackson R.M. Towns K.V. Scott S. Mackey D.A. Craig J.E. Jiang L. Yang Z. Trembath R. et al.Mutations in LRP5 or FZD4 underlie the common familial exudative vitreoretinopathy locus on chromosome 11q.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 721-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) a 4- to 5-fold increase in circulating serotonin levels when compared to age-matched controls; moreover, the heterozygous parent of one of these patients also had higher circulating serotonin levels than control individuals (Figures 1I and S1G). Thus, Lrp5 regulates blood serotonin level in both mice and humans. To determine whether the increase in circulating serotonin level induced by the increase in Tph1 expression is a cause of the bone phenotype of the Lrp5−/− mice, we relied on cell-based and in vivo experiments. To elucidate the discrepancy between the paucity of osteoblasts in Lrp5−/− bones but their normal proliferation ability ex vivo, we tested whether serotonin is an inhibitor of osteoblast proliferation. When treated with serotonin for 24 hr, proliferation of WT or Lrp5−/− osteoblasts was decreased to the same extent (Figure 2A); in contrast, Wnt3A-conditioned media did not affect osteoblast proliferation (Figure S2F). Serotonin decreased expression of CycD1, D2, and E1 without affecting expression of Type I Collagen or of other genes characteristic of the osteoblast phenotype (Figures 2B and S2A), a gene expression profile remarkably similar to the one seen in the Lrp5−/− bones (Figure 1A). To further determine whether serotonin inhibits osteoblast proliferation in a Wnt-dependent or -independent manner, we treated ROS17 osteoblastic cells transfected with the TOPFLASH reporter construct with increasing amounts of serotonin or, as a positive control, with lithium chloride (LiCl) (Clement-Lacroix et al., 2005Clement-Lacroix P. Ai M. Morvan F. Roman-Roman S. Vayssiere B. Belleville C. Estrera K. Warman M.L. Baron R. Rawadi G. Lrp5-independent activation of Wnt signaling by lithium chloride increases bone formation and bone mass in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 17406-17411Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Whereas LiCl increased the activity of this reporter vector in all experiments, serotonin always failed to do so, indicating that the serotonin and canonical Wnt signaling pathways are distinct in osteoblasts (Figure 2C). If the increase in blood serotonin level is a cause of the Lrp5−/− mice bone phenotype, then normalizing it should also normalize bone mass in these mice. To test this hypothesis, we performed two in vivo experiments. Because serotonin is a tryptophan derivative, we first fed WT and Lrp5−/− mice from 3 to 12 weeks of age a diet containing 75% less tryptophan than a normal diet. This reduction in tryptophan intake decreased circulating serotonin levels 8- to 10-fold without affecting serotonin brain content (Figures 2D and S2B) and normalized bone formation parameters and bone mass in Lrp5−/− mice (Figure 2E). Second, 4-week-old WT and Lrp5−/− mice were administered para-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), a drug inhibiting serotonin synthesis, for 8 weeks (Kubera et al., 2000Kubera M. Kenis G. Bosmans E. Scharpe S. Maes M. Effects of serotonin and serotonergic agonists and antagonists on the production of interferon-γ and interleukin-10.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). pCPA decreased circulating serotonin levels 5- to 7-fold in Lrp5−/− mice without affecting their serotonin brain content; it also normalized in Lrp5−/− mice bone mass, bone formation parameters, and Cyclin expression in bones (Figures 2F–2H and S2C). That pCPA did not induce regression of the hyaloid vessels in the eyes suggests that the eye phenotype of the Lrp5−/− mice is not caused by this increase in circulating serotonin levels (Figures S2D and S2E). Taken together, results of the cell biology experiments of the low tryptophan diet and the pCPA-induced serotonin depletion in WT and Lrp5−/− mice indicate that higher blood serotonin levels contribute to the decrease in bone formation and bone mass in Lrp5−/− mice. In light of these results, we next asked whether Lrp5 regulates Tph1 expression, serotonin synthesis, and bone formation through its duodenal or its osteoblast expression. To that end, we generated mice harboring a floxed loss-of-function allele of Lrp5 (Figures S3A and S3B) and crossed them with either Villin-Cre transgenic mice to delete Lrp5 from gut cells (Lrp5gut−/−) or with α1(I)Col-Cre transgenic mice to delete it from osteoblasts only (Lrp5osb−/−) (Dacquin et al., 2002Dacquin R. Starbuck M. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Mouse α1(I)-collagen promoter is the best known promoter to drive efficient Cre recombinase expression in osteoblast.Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, el Marjou et al., 2004el Marjou F. Janssen K.P. Chang B.H. Li M. Hindie V. Chan L. Louvard D. Chambon P. Metzger D. Robine S. Tissue-specific and inducible Cre-mediated recombination in the gut epithelium.Genesis. 2004; 39: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that efficient recombination occurred in duodenal cells but not in osteoblasts in the Lrp5gut−/− mice, whereas the opposite was true in the Lrp5osb−/− mice (Figures 3A and S3C). Tph1 expression was high in the gut and normal in osteoblasts in Lrp5gut−/− mice; the opposite was true in the Lrp5osb−/− mice (Figure 3B). Circulating serotonin levels were 5- to 8-fold higher in Lrp5gut−/− than in WT mice but remained normal in Lrp5osb−/− mice (Figure 3C). In both mutant mice, brain serotonin content was normal (data not shown). Histomorphometric analyses showed a decrease in bone mass in Lrp5gut−/− but not in Lrp5osb−/− mice (Figure 3D). This low bone mass was secondary to a decrease in osteoblast numbers and bone formation whereas osteoclast numbers were not affected (Figure 3D). Expression of CycD1, D2, and E1 was decreased in the bones of Lrp5gut−/− mice but was unaffected in Lrp5osb−/− bones, and BrdU incorporation assays showed that osteoblast proliferation was decreased in Lrp5gut−/− but not in Lrp5osb−/− mice (Figures 3E and 3F). Thus, gut- but not osteoblast-specific deletion of Lrp5 recapitulates the low bone mass and the molecular abnormalities observed in the Lrp5−/− mice. As is the case for Lrp5+/− mice, Lrp5gut+/− mice displayed a low bone formation/low bone mass phenotype (Figure S3D). These data suggest that Lrp5 regulates bone formation through its duodenal expression. In contrast, histological examination failed to detect any persistence of hyaloid vessels of the eyes in either Lrp5gut−/− or Lrp5osb−/− mice (Figure S3E). This latter result, along with the inability of pCPA to prevent appearance of the eye phenotype in the Lrp5−/− mice, demonstrates that Lrp5 uses different mechanisms to regulate bone formation and eye vascularization. The demonstration that Lrp5 loss of function affects bone mass by enhancing serotonin synthesis in the enterochromaffin cells raised the prospect that, conversely, Lrp5 gain-of-function mutations might affect bone mass by decreasing serotonin synthesis in these cells. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice harboring a floxed allele of Lrp5 that included the mutation causing high bone mass in humans (Boyden et al., 2002Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. High bone density due to a mutation in LDL-receptor-related protein 5.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar) (Figures S3F and S3G). These mice were crossed with either Villin-Cre or α1(I)Col-Cre transgenic mice to generate mice expressing this Lrp5 gain-of-function mutation in gut cells (Lrp5KIgut+/−) or in osteoblasts (Lrp5KIosb+/−). We studied heterozygous mutant mice because high bone mass syndrome is observed in patients heterozygous for the mutation (Boyden et al., 2002Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. High bone density due to a mutation in LDL-receptor-related protein 5.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Lrp5KIgut+/− mice expressed the mutated protein in gut but not in osteoblasts; the opposite was true for Lrp5KIosb+/− mice (Figure 3G, S3H, and S3I). Tph1 expression in gut and circulating serotonin levels were low in Lrp5KIgut+/− mice (Figures 3H and 3I) whereas serotonin content in the brain was not affected (data not shown). Histomorphometric analyses showed that bone formation parameters and bone mass were high in Lrp5KIgut+/− but normal in Lrp5KIosb+/− mice (Figure 3D). Expression of Cyclins and in vivo osteoblast proliferation were increased in Lrp5KIgut+/− bones; none of these parameters were modified in Lrp5KIosb+/− mice (Figures 3J, 3K, and S3J). To validate our findings obtained in mice, we studied two patients with high bone mass caused by the same activating mutation (G171V) in LRP5 (Boyden et al., 2002Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. High bone density due to a mutation in LDL-receptor-related protein 5.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar) and observed a 50% decrease in circulating serotonin levels (Figure 3L). In summary, based on the analyses of cell-specific loss- and gain-of-function mutations of Lrp5 models, it appears that this gene regulates bone formation through its duodenal but not its bone expression. To further demonstrate that it is duodenal-derived serotonin that regulates bone formation, we generated mice harboring a floxed loss-of-function allele of Tph1 and crossed them with Villin-Cre or α1(I)Col-Cre mice to generate Tph1gut−/− or Tph1osb−/− mice (Figures S4A–S4C). Because Tph1 is overexpressed in Lrp5−/− mice, its deletion in the appropriate cell type should result in a bone phenotype opposite the one of the Lrp5−/− mice (i.e., high bone mass). Tph1gut−/− mice had a 10-fold reduction in Tph1 expression in gut, whereas Tph1 expression in bone and osteoblasts was not affected; conversely, Tph1osb−/− mice had a 10-fold reduction in Tph1 expression in bones and osteoblasts but a normal Tph1 expression in gut (Figures 4A and 4B). Circulating serotonin levels were low in Tph1gut−/− but normal in Tph1osb−/− mice (Figure 4C). As anticipated, mice lacking Tph1 in the gut developed a severe high bone mass phenotype secondary to an increase in osteoblast number and bone formation rate; bone resorption parameters were not affected (Figure 4D). This phenotype, that is the mirror image of the one seen in the Lrp5−/− mice, was present in 4-, 6-, and 12-week-old Tph1gut−/− mice (Figures 4D and S4D). In contrast, mice lacking Tph1 in osteoblasts had only a marginal, nonsignificant increase in bone mass (Figure 4E). Expression of CycD1, D2, and E1, which was decreased in the absence of Lrp5, was increased in Tph1gut−/− but normal in Tph1osb−/− bones, and BrdU incorporation assays showed that osteoblast proliferation was increased in Tph1gut−/− but not in Tph1osb−/− mice (Figures 4F and 4G). If circulating serotonin is a hormone inhibiting bone formation, it must act through a specific receptor(s) present on osteoblasts whose inactivation should lead to an increase in bone formation and high bone mass. Among the 14 known serotonin receptors, only 3 are expressed in osteoblasts: Htr1b, the most highly expressed, Htr2b, and Htr2a (Figure 5A). Htr1b is preferentially expressed in bone and osteoblasts outside the brain, whereas Htr2b and Htr2a have a broader pattern of expression (Figures 5B and S5A). Analysis of Htr2a−/− mice failed to detect any abnormalities in osteoblast number, bone formation, bone resorption, and bone mass at 1 or 3 months of age (Figures 5C and S5B), two time points at which Lrp5−/− mice already display a severe bone phenotype. The same was true for mice lacking in osteoblasts only, Htr2b (Figures 5D and S5B–S5E). In contrast, mice lacking either one or the two Htr1b alleles displayed a similar increase in osteoblast number, bone formation rate, and bone mass at those ages (Figures 5E and S5B). That haploinsufficiency at Htr1b has consequences as severe as the homozygous deletion, at least at 6 weeks of age, is consistent with the fact that heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in Tph1 or heterozygous gain-of-function mutation in Lrp5 also have consequences as severe on bone mass as homozygous mutations. Furthermore, it is also in accord with the observation that patients with high bone mass are only heterozygous for Lrp5 mutations. Altogether, it demonstrates that loss of serotonin signaling exerts a dominant function on bone remodeling. Molecularly, expression of CycD1, D2, and E1 that is downregulated in Lrp5−/− bones was upregulated in Htr1b−/− but not in Htr2a−/− or Htr2bosb−/− bones, and serotonin treatment decreased CycD1 expression in WT, Htr2a−/−, and Htr2bosb−/− but not in Htr1b−/− osteoblasts (Figures 5F and 5G). BrdU incorporation assays confirmed that osteoblast proliferation was increased in Htr1b−/− but not in Htr2a−/− and Htr2bosb−/− bones (Figure 5H). Other osteoblast-specific genes such as Osteoprotegerin, a Wnt target gene (Glass et al., 2005Glass II, D.A. Bialek P. Ahn J.D. Starbuck M. Patel M.S. Clevers H. Taketo M.M. Long F. McMahon A.P. Lang R.A. et al.Canonical Wnt signaling in differentiated osteoblasts controls osteoclast differentiation.Dev.

To ascertain that Htr1b regulates bone formation through its expression in osteoblasts, we generated mice lacking Htr1b only in osteoblasts (Htr1bosb-deficient mice; Figures S5G and S5H). As shown in Figure 5I, Htr1bosb+/− mice display the same high bone formation/high bone mass phenotype as the one observed in the Htr1b+/− mice. Taken together, these results indicate that serotonin uses one predominant receptor, Htr1b, to affect osteoblast biology. We next searched for the transcriptional mediator(s) of serotonin signaling in osteoblasts. To address this question, because loss-of-function mutations in most of the key transcription facto"
https://openalex.org/W2060768223,"Genomic instability and alterations in gene expression are hallmarks of eukaryotic aging. The yeast histone deacetylase Sir2 silences transcription and stabilizes repetitive DNA, but during aging or in response to a DNA break, the Sir complex relocalizes to sites of genomic instability, resulting in the desilencing of genes that cause sterility, a characteristic of yeast aging. Using embryonic stem cells, we show that mammalian Sir2, SIRT1, represses repetitive DNA and a functionally diverse set of genes across the mouse genome. In response to DNA damage, SIRT1 dissociates from these loci and relocalizes to DNA breaks to promote repair, resulting in transcriptional changes that parallel those in the aging mouse brain. Increased SIRT1 expression promotes survival in a mouse model of genomic instability and suppresses age-dependent transcriptional changes. Thus, DNA damage-induced redistribution of SIRT1 and other chromatin-modifying proteins may be a conserved mechanism of aging in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2068711892,"In plants and mammals, small RNAs indirectly mediate epigenetic inheritance by specifying cytosine methylation. We found that small RNAs themselves serve as vectors for epigenetic information. Crosses between Drosophila strains that differ in the presence of a particular transposon can produce sterile progeny, a phenomenon called hybrid dysgenesis. This phenotype manifests itself only if the transposon is paternally inherited, suggesting maternal transmission of a factor that maintains fertility. In both P - and I -element–mediated hybrid dysgenesis models, daughters show a markedly different content of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) targeting each element, depending on their parents of origin. Such differences persist from fertilization through adulthood. This indicates that maternally deposited piRNAs are important for mounting an effective silencing response and that a lack of maternal piRNA inheritance underlies hybrid dysgenesis."

The first site of mammalian intraembryonic hematopoiesis consists of the dorsal aorta during a developmental period when it is flanked by the gonado-mesonephric columns (the AGM region) (Godin et al., 1995Godin I.

Within the AGM at E10.5–11.5, hematopoietic cells can be seen attached to the aorta and have been referred to as “budding” from this region (Garcia-Porrero et al., 1995Garcia-Porrero J.A. Godin I.E.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the two regions, from a technical standpoint, are not amenable to physical separation, and both are noted to express signaling molecules and transcription factors critical for hematopoiesis (North et al., 2002North T.E. de Bruijn M.F.

In addition, while the AGM is a site of HSC emergence, it is unable to support hematopoietic differentiation (Godin et al., 1999Godin I. Garcia-Porrero J.A. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Cumano A. Stem cell emergence and hemopoietic activity are incompatible in mouse intraembryonic sites.J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 43-52Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), an attractive feature that may enable its application in vitro, once the specific cell type and mechanisms of HSC emergence are delineated. The AGM region has been shown through numerous assays to generate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are capable of multilineage long-term reconstitution of irradiated hosts (Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996Medvinsky A.

The complexity of investigating HSC emergence in vivo is that once circulation is established, it is difficult to determine which embryonic sites contribute to later hematopoiesis and which cell types are necessary and sufficient for the ontogeny of HSCs. VE-cadherin, a cell-adhesion molecule with restricted endothelial expression (Breier et al., 1996Breier G. Breviario F. Caveda L. Berthier R. Schnurch H. Gotsch U. Vestweber D. Risau W. Dejana E.

As many cell-surface markers are shared between hematopoietic cells and endothelium, it has been suggested that AGM HSCs are endothelial derived (Jaffredo et al., 1998Jaffredo T. Gautier R.

VE-cadherin protein was also shown to identify HSC populations within the circulation and fetal liver (Kim et al., 2005Kim I. Yilmaz O.H. Morrison S.J. CD144 (VE-cadherin) is transiently expressed by fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 2005; 106: 903-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Taoudi et al., 2005Taoudi S. Morrison A.M.

Progressive divergence of definitive haematopoietic stem cells from the endothelial compartment does not depend on contact with the foetal liver.Development. 2005; 132: 4179-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Whether this protein expression is a result of a “carryover” effect from potential endothelial progenitors or the outcome of active VE-cadherin gene expression remains to be clarified. The HSCs of the AGM have been demonstrated to be incapable of in situ hematopoietic differentiation (Godin et al., 1999Godin I. Garcia-Porrero J.A. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Cumano A. Stem cell emergence and hemopoietic activity are incompatible in mouse intraembryonic sites.J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 43-52Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been postulated that AGM cells migrate to the fetal liver for terminal differentiation, with final residence in the adult bone marrow (Delassus and Cumano, 1996Delassus S. Cumano A. Circulation of hematopoietic progenitors in the mouse embryo.Immunity. 1996; 4: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The proof of migration from one particular site to another has been, up to this point, difficult to establish. The goal of this study was to utilize inducible Cre/lox technology to label particular populations, during a narrow developmental window, and lineage trace AGM endothelial and mesenchymal progeny to their intermediate and final destinations as well as to determine the cell type responsible for HSC emergence. As studies have demonstrated the expression of VE-cadherin within the endothelium and HSCs of the AGM (North et al., 2002North T.E. de Bruijn M.F. Stacy T. Talebian L. Lind E. Robin C. Binder M.

Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). As noted in Figure 1A, the constitutive VE-cadherin Cre/R26R line exhibits β-galactosidase (β-gal) labeling of the developing vascular system at E10.5–11. At this time, the AGM region (Figures 1B and 1C) reveals preferential labeling of the ventral wall of the dorsal aortic endothelium, an area noted for HSC emergence (de Bruijn et al., 2002de Bruijn M.F. Ma X. Robin C. Ottersbach K. Sanchez M.J. Dzierzak E.

USA. 2007; 104: 9399-9403Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, cells similar to the previously described “budding” HSCs are also labeled (Figure 1C, arrows). During peak fetal liver hematopoietic capacity, there exists a stark contrast of VE-cadherin protein expression, which appears predominantly vascular (Figure 1D), to the β-gal-labeled (VE-cadherin lineage) populations of both hematopoietic and endothelial cells (Figure 1E). This discrepancy between VE-cadherin protein expression and β-gal labeling is due to the latter depicting a historical population of hematopoietic progeny, which were traced from a VE-cadherin+ cell type. The progeny can also be detected in the adult bone marrow, as demonstrated in Figure 1F. When quantified by FACS analysis of β-gal expression, the VE-cadherin progeny constitute approximately 20%–40% of the fetal liver population and average 52% (±5% SEM) of the adult bone marrow (Figure 1G). The demonstration of labeled cells within definitive hematopoietic sites, in excess of reported VE-cadherin protein expression at these sites (Quirici et al., 2001Quirici N. Soligo D. Caneva L. Servida F. Bossolasco P. Deliliers G.L. Differentiation and expansion of endothelial cells from human bone marrow CD133(+) cells.Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 115: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2005Kim I. Yilmaz O.H. Morrison S.J.

Progressive divergence of definitive haematopoietic stem cells from the endothelial compartment does not depend on contact with the foetal liver.Development. 2005; 132: 4179-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), points to the ability of earlier VE-cadherin+ cells to give rise to definitive hematopoietic progeny. Additional support for this conclusion is the fact that VE-cadherin progeny in the fetal liver population express stem markers typical of this developmental time point, while the adult bone marrow population expresses markers of all hematopoietic lineages, including stem markers (Figure 1H). While the aforementioned data suggest that the VE-cadherin AGM population is capable of definitive adult hematopoiesis, it cannot exclude the potential contribution of extraembryonic, yolk sac-derived cells. In fact, it has been demonstrated in the VE-cadherin Cre mouse (Alva et al., 2006Alva J.A. Zovein A.C. Monvoisin A. Murphy T. Salazar A. Harvey N.L. Carmeliet P. Iruela-Arispe M.L.

Okada H. et al.Characterization of GATA-1(+) hemangioblastic cells in the mouse embryo.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), that the early yolk sac hematopoietic population includes a significant subset of VE-cadherin progeny (see Figure S1A available online). In addition, while there has been longstanding debate as to whether early yolk sac cells are capable of definitive adult hematopoiesis, recent data support this possibility (Samokhvalov et al., 2007Samokhvalov I.M. Samokhvalova N.I. Nishikawa S. Cell tracing shows the contribution of the yolk sac to adult haematopoiesis.Nature. 2007; 446: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Thus, to avoid labeling early yolk sac populations and investigate the VE-cadherin AGM population, an inducible fate map with time-restricted labeling was utilized. Notably, VE-cadherin Cre does not label all hematopoietic cells, as demonstrated in the fetal liver and adult bone marrow (Figures 1E and 1F). While AGM hematopoietic cells are labeled in this Cre line, later hematopoietic sites clearly contain an unlabeled population, which may suggest a nonvascular/non-VE-cadherin+ hematopoietic source. The VE-cadherin null mouse exhibits lethality by E9.5–10, with absence of intraembryonic hematopoiesis (Carmeliet et al., 1999Carmeliet P. Lampugnani M.G. Moons L. Breviario F. Compernolle V. Bono F. Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Oostuyse B.

Role of vascular endothelial-cadherin in vascular morphogenesis.Development. 1999; 126: 2093-2102PubMed Google Scholar), but with preservation of some yolk sac hematopoiesis (Rampon and Huber, 2003Rampon C. Huber P. Multilineage hematopoietic progenitor activity generated autonomously in the mouse yolk sac: analysis using angiogenesis-defective embryos.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2003; 47: 273-280Google Scholar). Examination of the VE-cadherin null yolk sac demonstrates disorganized vasculature and accumulation of hematopoietic cells within underdeveloped vascular lumens (Figure S1B). It is unclear whether the yolk sac cells in the VE-cadherin null mouse represent progeny from primitive or disorganized VE-cadherin null vasculature or rather that the cells do not require VE-cadherin. If the latter is true, it may account for the unlabeled population in the VE-cadherin Cre fetal liver and adult bone marrow. Another possibility is that while upstream intronic sequences of the VE-cadherin promoter are known to enhance endothelial expression of VE-cadherin (Hisatsune et al., 2005Hisatsune H. Matsumura K. Ogawa M. Uemura A. Kondo N. Yamashita J.K. Katsuta H. Nishikawa S. Chiba T. Nishikawa S.

To obtain restricted labeling of VE-cadherin progeny in the AGM from E10–11.5, when most hematopoietic budding is observed (Garcia-Porrero et al., 1995Garcia-Porrero J.A. Godin I.E. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Potential intraembryonic hemogenic sites at pre-liver stages in the mouse.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1995; 192: 425-435Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar), a tamoxifen-inducible VE-cadherin Cre line (Monvoisin et al., 2006Monvoisin A. Alva J.A. Hofmann J.J. Zovein A.C. Lane T.F. Iruela-Arispe M.L. VE-cadherin-CreERT2 transgenic mouse: a model for inducible recombination in the endothelium.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 3413-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was crossed to the R26R line (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen is thought to be available for Cre activation throughout the first 48 hr after injection (Nakamura et al., 2006Nakamura E. Nguyen M.T. Mackem S. Kinetics of tamoxifen-regulated Cre activity in mice using a cartilage-specific CreER(T) to assay temporal activity windows along the proximodistal limb skeleton.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 2603-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, assessment of tamoxifen metabolites in serum indicates that minimally active levels remain up to 72 hr postdose (Figure S2, Supplemental Text and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Therefore, tamoxifen induction of Cre expression was investigated during two separate time points to reveal the optimal period for AGM induction (Figure 2). In addition to the dorsal aortic endothelium, the vitelline and umbilical arteries also exhibit clusters of hematopoietic cells, prior to the AGM (Garcia-Porrero et al., 1995Garcia-Porrero J.A. Godin I.E. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Potential intraembryonic hemogenic sites at pre-liver stages in the mouse.Anat. Embryol.

Definitive hematopoietic stem cells first develop within the major arterial regions of the mouse embryo.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These arteries are preferentially labeled when induction is triggered by tamoxifen injection at E8.5 (Figure 2A). The lag in aortic labeling is also seen in the constitutive VE-cadherin Cre line where the dorsal aortic endothelium is only partially labeled by E9.5 (Alva et al., 2006Alva J.A. Zovein A.C. Monvoisin A. Murphy T. Salazar A. Harvey N.L. Carmeliet P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. VE-cadherin-Cre-recombinase transgenic mouse: a tool for lineage analysis and gene deletion in endothelial cells.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Induction at E9.5 demonstrates significantly reduced labeling of the vitelline and umbilical artery during their period of hematopoiesis and instead primarily labels the AGM endothelium and its associated hematopoietic cells (Figure 2B). However, the umbilical and vitelline vessels are eventually labeled at E11.5 as the endothelial population expands (data not shown). The increased vascular labeling at E11.5 after E9.5 induction, as compared to E8.5 (Figures 2A and 2B, middle panels), is likely due to a developmental increase in vascular VE-cadherin Cre expression during this period. Thus, timed induction of Cre expression was carried out at E9.5, allowing the tamoxifen “window” to span from E9.5 to E12.5, encompassing the period of AGM hematopoietic activity (Figure 3A), while bypassing the period of VE-cadherin expression in early yolk sac progenitors. A single dose of tamoxifen (1 mg) was administered via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) into pregnant mothers at E9.5, and embryos were evaluated at E10.5, E11.5, and E14.5, as well as at adult stages. At E10.5, very little recombination was noted, as evidenced by β-gal labeling (Figure 2B). By E11.5, the inducible system labeled the dorsal aortic endothelium and “budding” hematopoietic cells, as shown in Figure 3Ca. Although the level of recombination did not match that of the constitutive system (Figure 3B), it was sufficient to allow lineage tracing to the fetal liver at E14.5 (Figure 3Cb). Thus, from the one dose of tamoxifen we were able to demonstrate recombination (via reporter activity) in the AGM endothelium by E11.5, with subsequent reporter expression in attached hematopoietic cells (Figure 3Ca) and later expansion and migration of the progeny to the fetal liver (Figure 3Cb). The definition of a HSC includes its capacity to self-renew, to give rise to all hematopoietic lineages, and to reconstitute irradiated adult host bone marrow for more than 8 months. The inducible system allows HSC tracking in vivo and thus avoids the removal of cells from their milieu. A small cell population was labeled during a finite embryonic window (single embryonic injection at E9.5) and followed, in vivo, into adulthood (up to 13 months postnatal age). The bone marrow from this cohort demonstrated reporter-labeled bone marrow cells constituting anywhere from 2%–24% of total bone marrow cells (Figure 4A). The wide range is likely due to inherent tamoxifen dose variation among littermates (Figure S2D). Nonetheless, a large number of offspring (12 out of 13) demonstrated labeled bone marrow cells exhibiting cell-surface markers of all hematopoietic lineages as well as stem cell markers (Figure 4B, Figure S3). In addition, a subset of animals (n = 4), were evaluated for the presence of VE-cadherin progenitors in the spleen and thymus, where labeled cells were also noted (Figure 4, panels). Endothelial cells that were labeled in the embryo also demonstrate progeny in adult vessels (Figure 4, bottom panels). The fact that cells genetically marked at midgestation have progeny detected as late as 1 year postnatally strongly suggests a stem population. Furthermore, the expression of stem markers Sca-1+/c-kit+ within this late population, as well as markers identifying all hematopoietic lineages, demonstrates that the induced VE-cadherin endothelial population is autonomously capable of definitive hematopoiesis. In contrast to earlier studies, these data physiologically demonstrate, in vivo, that a restricted VE-cadherin population from the endothelium and its associated hematopoietic cells produce progeny that give rise to adult hematopoiesis. Recent studies have indicated that fetal liver HSCs express VE-cadherin protein (Kim et al., 2005Kim I. Yilmaz O.H. Morrison S.J. CD144 (VE-cadherin) is transiently expressed by fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 2005; 106: 903-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Taoudi et al., 2005Taoudi S. Morrison A.M.

Progressive divergence of definitive haematopoietic stem cells from the endothelial compartment does not depend on contact with the foetal liver.Development. 2005; 132: 4179-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the inducible system inadvertently labels the fetal liver VE-cadherin population during the active tamoxifen window (E9.5–12.5). To address this question, fetal liver cells were induced ex vivo for 24 hr as organ cultures at E10.5, E11.5, and E12.5. Following 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) induction, a subset of fetal livers was cultured in methylcellulose hematopoietic colony assays for 1 week (Figure 5A). Cre recombinase induction was measured by both β-gal activity and FACS analysis of the CD45+ population using a R26R EYFP line (Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M.

We have identified a highly conserved small RNA of 61 nucleotides originating from the MALAT1 locus that is broadly expressed in human tissues. Although the long MALAT1 transcript localizes to nuclear speckles, the small RNA is found exclusively in the cytoplasm. RNase P cleaves the nascent MALAT1 transcript downstream of a genomically encoded poly(A)-rich tract to simultaneously generate the 3' end of the mature MALAT1 transcript and the 5' end of the small RNA. Enzymes involved in tRNA biogenesis then further process the small RNA, consistent with its adoption of a tRNA-like structure. Our findings reveal a 3' end processing mechanism by which a single gene locus can yield both a stable nuclear-retained noncoding RNA with a short poly(A) tail-like moiety and a small tRNA-like cytoplasmic RNA."

These prodrugs require intracellular activation for their biological function. We found that Rv3547 is a deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase (Ddn) that converts PA-824 into three primary metabolites; the major one is the corresponding des-nitroimidazole (des-nitro). When derivatives of PA-824 were used, the amount of des-nitro metabolite formed was highly correlated with anaerobic killing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Des-nitro metabolite formation generated reactive nitrogen species, including nitric oxide (NO), which are the major effectors of the anaerobic activity of these compounds. Furthermore, NO scavengers protected the bacilli from the lethal effects of the drug. Thus, these compounds may act as intracellular NO donors and could augment a killing mechanism intrinsic to the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1964196268,"An action may lead to either a reward or a punishment. Therefore, an appropriate action needs to be chosen on the basis of the values of both expected rewards and expected punishments. To understand the underlying neural mechanisms, we conditioned monkeys using a Pavlovian procedure with two distinct contexts: one in which rewards were available and another in which punishments were feared. We found that the population of lateral habenula neurons was most strongly excited by a conditioned stimulus associated with the most unpleasant event in each context: the absence of the reward or the presence of the punishment. The population of lateral habenula neurons was also excited by the punishment itself and inhibited by the reward itself, especially when they were less predictable. These results suggest that the lateral habenula has the potential to adaptively control both reward-seeking and punishment-avoidance behaviors, presumably through its projections to dopaminergic and serotonergic systems."

Although methods for differentiating embryonic stem cells into specific cell types have become increasingly sophisticated, the utility of the resulting cells for modeling disease has not been determined. We have asked whether specific neuronal subtypes produced from human embryonic stem cells can be used to investigate the mechanisms leading to neural degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We show that human spinal motor neurons, but not interneurons, are selectively sensitive to the toxic effect of glial cells carrying an ALS-causing mutation in the SOD1 gene.

In agreement with in vivo observations, cocultures of mouse-derived, mutant SOD1-expressing astrocytes and mouse motor neurons have demonstrated that mutant astrocytes reduced motor neuron survival over a 2 week period (Di Giorgio et al., 2007Di Giorgio F.P.

ALS: a disease of motor neurons and their nonneuronal neighbors.Neuron. 2006; 52: 39-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Misfolded SOD1 can increase oxidative stress and secretion of proinflammatory toxic factors by glial cells such as nitric oxide (NO), amplifying the disease symptoms (Barbeito et al., 2004Barbeito L.H.

Rev. 2004; 47: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the increase in the production of reactive species of oxygen (ROS) in an ALS mouse model is partially caused by elevated levels of NADPH oxidase (NOX) (Harraz et al., 2008Harraz M.M.

Moreover, deletion of one of the catalytic subunits of the NOX gene (NOX2/gp91phox), as well as treatment with a specific NOX inhibitor, significantly increased life span and improved survival in SOD1-mutated transgenic mouse models (Harraz et al., 2008Harraz M.M.

USA. 2006; 103: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We consistently generated a population of human neurons in vitro that expressed postmitotic motor neuron markers, made neuromuscular junctions, and fired action potentials. Subsequently, we cocultured the human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived motor neurons with human primary astrocytes expressing either the wild-type or the mutated form of SOD1 protein (SOD1WT or SOD1G37R, respectively). In our cocultures, we detected a specific decrease in the number of motor neuron markers in the presence of SOD1-mutated astrocytes, with no detectable effect on other subtypes of neurons. Furthermore, we showed that the toxicity conferred by the SOD1-mutated astrocytes was generated in part by an increase in astrocyte activation and production of ROS. The physiological changes observed in SOD1G37R human astrocytes were well correlated with intensification of the proinflammatory activity of the induced nitric oxide synthase enzyme (iNOS or NOS2A), neurosecretory protein Chromogranin A (CHGA), secretory cofactor cystatin C (CC or CST3), and NADPH oxidase (NOX2/gp91phox or CYBB) overexpression. Activation of NOX2 and production of oxygen radicals had already been demonstrated to be mediators of microglial toxicity in familial ALS mouse models (Barbeito et al., 2004Barbeito L.H. Pehar M. Cassina P. Vargas M.R. Peluffo H. Viera L. Estevez A.G. Beckman J.S. A role for astrocytes in motor neuron loss in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Brain Res. Brain Res.

USA. 2006; 103: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that human astrocytes overexpressing mutated SOD1 can activate NOX2 to produce oxygen radicals, and the addition of antioxidants can reverse this process. Moreover, by treating the cells with one of the prescreened antioxidant compounds, we were able to prevent the loss of motor neurons caused by coculture with SOD1-mutated astrocytes. Key elements of our findings are (1) the development of a human model of disease using hESCs, providing an important proof of principle toward developing high throughput drug discovery assays for ALS; and (2) the identification of a class of compounds to consider for future clinical investigation. hESC-derived rosettes expressed motor neuron progenitor markers such as Pax6, Nestin, Olig2, and Islet1 after 2–3 weeks of differentiation (Figures 1A–1D). After 4 weeks under differentiation conditions, the cells started to express panneuronal markers such as TuJ1, and after 6–8 weeks, the cells exhibited motor neuron postmitotic lineage-specific markers, such as homeobox gene Hb9, HoxC8, and choline acetyltransferase neurotransmitter, ChAT (Figures 1E–1G). Motor neuron identity was also confirmed at the transcription level by RT-PCR. Accordingly, we detected downregulation of the hESC undifferentiated marker Nanog and upregulation of the postmitotic motor neuron markers Hb9 and ChAT (Figure 1H). At the 8 week differentiation stage, cells were also positive for synapsin and could incorporate α-bungarotoxin when cocultured with C2C12 myoblasts, indicating that the cells could form functional neuromuscular junctions (Figures 1I and 1J). Live postmitotic human motor neurons could be visualized after transduction with a lentivirus expressing the green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) under the control of the Hb9 promoter (Lee et al., 2004Lee S.K. Jurata L.W. Funahashi J. Ruiz E.C. Pfaff S.L. Analysis of embryonic motoneuron gene regulation: derepression of general activators function in concert with enhancer factors.Development. 2004; 131: 3295-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Lenti Hb9::GFP). We confirmed the promoter specificity by costaining the Hb9::GFP-positive cells with the endogenous Hb9 protein in hESC-derived neurons as well as in rat purified spinal cord motor neurons (Figure 1K and see Figures S2A–S2C available online). We preformed RT-PCR for the endogenous human Hb9 transcript in sorted Hb9::GFP-positive versus Hb9::GFP-negative cells and only detected endogenous Hb9 expression in Hb9::GFP-positive cells (Figure S2D). The Hb9::GFP-positive neurons also colocalized with ChAT marker (Figure 1L). We determined the functional maturation of the hESC-derived neurons using electrophysiology. Whole-cell perforated patch recordings were performed from cultured HB9-expressing cells that had differentiated for at least 8 weeks in culture (Figures 1M–1R). We then examined the effects of astrocytes expressing either a wild-type (SOD1WT) or mutated (SOD1G37R) form of the human SOD1 protein on the survival of hESC-derived motor neurons upon coculture. Primary human astrocytes were transduced with a lentivirus vector expressing either SOD1WT or SOD1G37R (Figures S1A and S1B). We then cocultured the Hb9::GFP motor neurons with SODWT- or SOD1G37R-expressing astrocytes (Figure 2A). After coculture for 4 weeks, cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for Hb9::GFP quantification (Figure 2B). We detected a decrease of 49% of Hb9::GFP-positive cells when cocultured with SOD1G37R astrocytes. For comparison, we included noninfected human astrocytes and did not detect significant differences in the number of Hb9::GFP-positive cells when compared to SOD1WT cocultures (see graph in Figure 2B). To further confirm our findings, we counted the number of cholinergic neurons in cocultures with SODWT or SOD1G37R astrocytes (Figure 2C). We detected a similar decrease (52%) in ChAT-positive cells when cocultured with SOD1G37R astrocytes. Moreover, the toxic or detrimental effect was specific to the motor neuron population, since other subtypes of neurons concomitantly present in the differentiated cultures, such as GABAergic neurons, were not affected (Figure 2D). We also determined that the toxic effect of mutated astrocytes was specific for glial cell type and was not present in human primary fibroblasts overexpressing SOD1WT or SOD1G37R that were cocultured with hESC-derived motor neurons (Figures S3A–S3C). Next we investigated the possible causes of the astrocytic toxicity conferred by the mutated SOD1 to hESC-derived motor neurons by analyzing the behavior of the mutated astrocytes in culture. Primary astrocytes usually respond to inflammation by activation. Activated astrocytes increase the assembly of their intermediate filaments (produced by glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and the number and size of the processes extended from the cell body. Furthermore, activated astrocytes intensify their oxidation levels and the production of proinflammatory factors (Barbeito et al., 2004Barbeito L.H. Pehar M. Cassina P. Vargas M.R. Peluffo H. Viera L. Estevez A.G. Beckman J.S. A role for astrocytes in motor neuron loss in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 47: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We detected a significant increase in the number of activated (GFAP-positive) astrocytes when SOD1G37R was present in comparison to control astrocytes (Figure 3A). We also confirmed that the population of astrocytes was still homogeneous after SOD1 overexpression by staining the cells with A2B5, a general astrocyte marker (Figure 3A). Moreover, we did a cell-death analysis for both SOD1G37R and SOD1WT astrocytes, and both had similar amounts of propidium iodide (PI) staining (Figure S1C), so we concluded that the viability of astrocyte SODG37R is similar to SODWT. In parallel, we measured an increase in the number of cells producing ROS by the astrocytes expressing the mutated SOD1 (Figure 3B), a hallmark of ALS pathology (Barber et al., 2006Barber S.C. Mead R.J. Shaw P.J. Oxidative stress in ALS: a mechanism of neurodegeneration and a therapeutic target.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1762: 1051-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We also calculated the intensity of fluorescence present in the oxidation experiments but did not detect significant changes between groups (Figure 3B). In addition, we observed an increase in the expression of proinflammatory factors such as iNOS, an overexpression of the neurosecretory protein known to interact specifically with mutated SOD1, CHGA (Urushitani et al., 2006Urushitani M. Sik A. Sakurai T. Nukina N. Takahashi R. Julien J.P. Chromogranin-mediated secretion of mutant superoxide dismutase proteins linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), induction of a superoxide producer enzyme NOX2 (gp91phox subunit), and an increase of cystein protease inhibitor CC expression (Figure 3C). Curiously, we did not observe a clear decrease in EAAT2 glutamate transporter protein or mRNA in the mutated astrocytes (data not shown). The increment in iNOS enzyme was accompanied by a rise in the NO levels in the SOD1G37R astrocyte-conditioned media, indirectly measured by nitrite concentration (Figure 3D). A total of five compounds and their respective vehicles (EtOH or DMSO) were tested in SODG37R-mutated astrocyte cultures to address their antioxidant potential (Figure 4A). Treatment with both NOX2 inhibitor apocynin and antioxidant α-lipoic acid for 48 hr decreased the percentage of cells that were able to produce ROS (percentage of oxidation) in comparison to treatment with vehicle only (EtOH) (Figure 4B). Likewise, treatment with the antioxidant flavonoid epicatechin decreased the oxidation levels of SOD1G37R astrocytes when compared to vehicle (DMSO). The drugs resveratrol and luteolin, on the other hand, did not seem to have a detectable effect on the number of SOD1G37R astrocytes that are producing ROS. We then chose the compound apocynin for further verification in a coculture assay using hESC-derived motor neurons and either SDO1WT or SODG37R astrocytes. Apocynin treatment rescued the motor neuron survival in the presence of SOD1G37R (Figure 5), confirming previous observation in SOD1-mutated transgenic mice treated with the same drug (Harraz et al., 2008Harraz M.M.

We successfully differentiated hESCs in electrophysiologically active Hb9-expressing human motor neurons to establish a system for modeling ALS using human cells. Our model consists of coculturing healthy human motor neurons with human astrocytes carrying either the wild-type or mutated SOD1 cDNA. Under these conditions, we could confirm the role of astrocytes in ALS disease, as motor neuron numbers decreased about 50% in the presence of mutant SOD1-expressing astrocytes. Moreover, the toxicity seemed to be restricted to the motor neuron subpopulation, with no effects on other neuronal subtypes. Other groups have proposed a similar astrocyte-dependent damage in mouse systems using in vitro assays (Di Giorgio et al., 2007Di Giorgio F.P. Carrasco M.A. Siao M.C. Maniatis T. Eggan K.

We have evidence that the mechanism of astrocyte-specific motor neuron toxicity involves both secretory and inflammatory pathways.

The role of CC in ALS pathology has yet to be elucidated, and research has demonstrated no obvious mutation in the CC gene in either familial or sporadic patients (Watanabe et al., 2006Watanabe M. Jackson M. Ikeda M. Mizushima K. Amari M. Takatama M. Hirai S. Ikeda Y. Shizuka-Ikeda M. Okamoto K. Genetic analysis of the cystatin C gene in familial and sporadic ALS patients.Brain Res. 2006; 1073–1074: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, CC is one of the two proteins that immunostain the so-called Bunina bodies, small intraneuronal inclusions that are the only specific pathological ALS hallmark (Okamoto et al., 1993Okamoto K. Hirai S. Amari M. Watanabe M. Sakurai A. Bunina bodies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis immunostained with rabbit anti-cystatin C serum.Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 162: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our findings are consistent with a previous report that activated astrocytes increase expression of the neurosecretory protein CHGA, and suggest that the secretion of mutant SOD1 may represent one of the neurotoxic pathways for the non-cell-autonomous nature of ALS (Urushitani et al., 2006Urushitani M. Sik A. Sakurai T. Nukina N. Takahashi R. Julien J.P. Chromogranin-mediated secretion of mutant superoxide dismutase proteins linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CHGA induction in SOD1G37R-mutated astrocytes is accompanied by an increase in ROS production, likely mediated by NOX2, which is also upregulated in human ALS astrocytes. The induction of proinflammatory iNOS has been shown to be caused by release of ROS via the NOX pathway in rat astrocytes activated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Pawate et al., 2004Pawate S. Shen Q. Fan F. Bhat N.R. Redox regulation of glial inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide and interferongamma.J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 540-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Consistently, attenuated induction of iNOS was observed in primary astrocytes derived from NOX2-deficient mouse (Pawate et al., 2004Pawate S. Shen Q. Fan F. Bhat N.R. Redox regulation of glial inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide and interferongamma.J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 540-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In ALS patients, damaged motor neurons are typically surrounded by a strong activation of iNOS-expressing glia in the ventral horn of both familial and sporadic forms of the disease (Almer et al., 1999Almer G. Vukosavic S. Romero N. Przedborski S. Inducible nitric oxide synthase up-regulation in a transgenic mouse model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2415-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, Anneser, 2000Anneser J. Molecular basis of treatment in motor neurone disease.Neurol. Sci. 2000; 21: S913-S918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, we did not detect a significant decrease in glutamate transporter (EAAT2) expression in astrocytes containing the mutated SOD1, so we conclude that, in our system, the motor neuron toxicity is independent of glutamate excitotoxicity. We cannot rule out the possibility that EAAT2 protein levels would decrease after longer periods of culture (in our system, we cultured the SOD1G37R astrocytes for no more than 6 weeks). In accordance with our observations, recent data have also shown that EAAT2 expression in astrocytes is not responsible for the recovery of motor function in the loxSOD1G37R/GFAP-Cre+ mouse model (Yamanaka et al., 2008Yamanaka K. Chun S.J. Boillee S. Fujimori-Tonou N. Yamashita H. Gutmann D.H. Takahashi R. Misawa H. Cleveland D.W. Astrocytes as determinants of disease progression in inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Importantly, our data show that antioxidant apocynin decreased the ROS production in SOD1 mutant-expressing astrocytes, likely by inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX2), and in turn restored motor neuron survival. We believe that we can use SOD1 mutant astrocytes as a rapid drug screening test for oxidative damage to identify the best candidates for a following long-term coculture experiment (Figure 6). Our findings support the idea that astroglia can contribute to ALS symptoms, promoting extrinsic toxicity to motor neurons. Further investigation should elucidate whether the motor neuron toxicity is a result of a specific toxic factor produced by mutated astrocytes or via the lack of a surviving factor (maybe a combination of both events). Nonetheless, the data we present here show for the first time that an antioxidant agent can improve the survival of motor neurons in a completely humanized model. The use of human coculture models will have an increasing impact on developing drug discovery and screening assays for both familial and sporadic ALS. Mouse and rat ALS models still have a critical impact in unveiling the complexity of the metabolic pathways involved in the disease. Nevertheless, a variety of drugs that had demonstrated significant efficacy in murine models showed inefficacy in both preclinical and clinical human trials (DiBernardo and Cudkowicz, 2006DiBernardo A.B.

Currently, there is only one FDA-approved treatment for ALS, namely riluzole (Doble, 1996Doble A. The pharmacology and mechanism of action of riluzole.Neurology. 1996; 47: S233-S241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it only extends the course of the disease for 2 months (Miller and Moore, 2004Miller R.G. Moore D.H. ALS trial design: expectation and reality.Amyotroph. Lateral Scler. Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2004; 5: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). There is an urgent need for new ALS models that have the potential to be translated into clinical trials and could, at a minimum, be used in conjunction with the murine models to verify targets and drugs. We propose that a human ALS model based on hESC-derived motor neurons in coculture with human astrocytes is a robust and invaluable model to study ALS disease and to initiate species-specific drug development assays. The cells lines used in this study were HUES9 (Douglas Melton-WiCell) and Cythera 203 (Novocell Inc., San Diego, CA). The hESCs were differentiated in vitro in motor neurons, adapting the protocol previously described elsewhere (Li et al., 2005Li X.J. Du Z.W. Zarnowska E.D. Pankratz M. Hansen L.O. Pearce R.A. Zhang S.C. Specification of motoneurons from human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were manually dissociated to form embryoid bodies (EBs) and cultured in suspension for 5–6 days. The EBs were then plated in laminin/poliornithin-coated plates in the presence of a neural induction medium consisting of F12/DMEM (Invitrogene, Carlsbad, CA), N2 supplement, and 1 μM retinoic acid (RA). The cells started to organize into neural tube-like rosettes and, after 7–8 days in culture, sonic hedgehog (SHH, 500 ng/ml, R&D Systems) and cAMP (1 μM) were added to the culture media for one more week. The rosettes were then manually selected using a 10× magnifier (Zeiss) and gently dissociated (by pipetting up and down in a Hanks' enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer, Invitrogene). After dissociation, rosettes were pelleted at 1000 rpm and replated either on laminin/poliornithine-coated coverslips (for direct differentiation) or on top of astrocyte feeder layers for the coculture experiments. The media was changed for a differentiation medium that consisted of neurobasal medium (Invitrogene), N2 supplement, RA (1 μM), SHH (50 ng/ml), cAMP (1 μM), BDN"

In contrast with the well-known interactions of the minus ends with the centrosome, little is known about the termination site of the noncentrosomal minus ends. Here we show that a population of MT minus ends is anchored at the zonula adherens (ZA), the apical-most part of the cadherin-based adherens junction, via a protein that we have termed Nezha. We initially identified PLEKHA7 as a ZA component and subsequently detected Nezha as a partner for PLEKHA7. Nezha bound MTs at their minus ends and tethered them to the ZA. Furthermore, we found that a minus end-directed motor, KIFC3, was concentrated at the ZA in a PLEKHA7/Nezha/MT-dependent manner; and depletion of any of these proteins resulted in disorganization of the ZA. We propose that the PLEKHA7/Nezha/MT complex regulates the ZA integrity by recruiting KIFC3 to this junctional site.

We propose that the PLEKHA7/Nezha/MT complex regulates the ZA integrity by recruiting KIFC3 to this junctional site. Microtubules (MTs) are a major component of the cytoskeleton, and they play important roles in various cellular processes. In many cell types, MTs are organized in a radial array with their minus ends anchored at the centrosome and their plus ends extending toward the cell periphery where they play a number of biological roles (Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2005Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C.C. Microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins: mechanisms and functions.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many types of terminally differentiated cells contain a substantial number of noncentrosomal MTs, in addition to the centrosomal ones (Bartolini and Gundersen, 2006Bartolini F. Gundersen G.G. Generation of noncentrosomal microtubule arrays.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4155-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial cells, the former are arranged along the apicobasal axis of the cell with their minus ends oriented apically and their plus ends basally (Bacallao et al., 1989Bacallao R. Antony C. Dotti C. Karsenti E. Stelzer E.H. Simons K. The subcellular organization of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells during the formation of a polarized epithelium.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2817-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Where these minus ends terminate and what cellular processes are regulated by the noncentrosomal minus ends are, however, largely unknown (Dammermann et al., 2003Dammermann A. Desai A. Oegema K. The minus end in sight.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R614-R624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). MTs are known to interact with the cell-cell adhesion machinery. Cell junctions of epithelial cells comprise the tight junction, adherens junction (AJ), and desmosome, which together form the junctional complex at the apical end of the lateral cell-cell contacts of these cells (Vogelmann and Nelson, 2005Vogelmann R. Nelson W.J. Fractionation of the epithelial apical junctional complex: reassessment of protein distributions in different substructures.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The AJs are organized by cadherins and associated cytoplasmic proteins, including β-catenin and p120-catenin; and these AJs form the “zonula adherens” (ZA) or “adhesion belt,” which enclose the polarized epithelial cells at their near-apical end, together with the underlying actin fibers. Recent studies showed that MT plus ends terminated at the AJs of mammary tumor cells and that MT depolymerization caused disorganized accumulation of E-cadherin in these cells (Stehbens et al., 2006Stehbens S.J. Paterson A.D. Crampton M.S. Shewan A.M. Ferguson C. Akhmanova A. Parton R.G. Yap A.S. Dynamic microtubules regulate the local concentration of E-cadherin at cell-cell contacts.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1801-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), as observed earlier with other cells (Waterman-Storer et al., 2000Waterman-Storer C.M. Salmon W.C. Salmon E.D. Feedback interactions between cell-cell adherens junctions and cytoskeletal dynamics in newt lung epithelial cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2471-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that MTs are required for AJ assembly. In addition, N-cadherin was found to be transported to the plasma membrane, dependent on MT networks as well as MT-based motors (Mary et al., 2002Mary S. Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Travo P. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Biogenesis of N-cadherin-dependent cell-cell contacts in living fibroblasts is a microtubule-dependent kinesin-driven mechanism.Mol. Biol.

The KIF3 motor transports N-cadherin and organizes the developing neuroepithelium.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The M-cadherin-catenin complex was also shown to interact with MTs (Kaufmann et al., 1999Kaufmann U. Kirsch J. Irintchev A. Wernig A. Starzinski-Powitz A. The M-cadherin catenin complex interacts with microtubules in skeletal muscle cells: implications for the fusion of myoblasts.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 55-68PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies showed that β-catenin bound dynein, which may play a role in tethering MTs at the AJs (Ligon et al., 2001Ligon L.A. Karki S. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L. Dynein binds to beta-catenin and may tether microtubules at adherens junctions.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and that this tethering of MT plus ends at the AJs promoted the delivery of connexin hemichannels to the cell-cell border (Shaw et al., 2007Shaw R.M. Fay A.J. Puthenveedu M.A. von Zastrow M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins target gap junctions directly from the cell interior to adherens junctions.Cell. 2007; 128: 547-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although most of these studies suggest that MT plus ends interact with cell junctions, another study reported that N-cadherin-mediated adhesion stabilized the minus ends (Chausovsky et al., 2000Chausovsky A. Bershadsky A.D. Borisy G.G. Cadherin-mediated regulation of microtubule dynamics.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To further explore the functional and structural relationships between the AJ and MTs, we paid particular attention to p120-catenin (p120) because we and others earlier found that p120 had the ability to associate with MTs (Chen et al., 2003Chen X. Kojima S. Borisy G.G. Green K.J. p120 catenin associates with kinesin and facilitates the transport of cadherin-catenin complexes to intercellular junctions.J.

Kaverina I.N. Wang A. Fujita Y. Reynolds A.B. Anastasiadis P.Z. A novel interaction between kinesin and p120 modulates p120 localization and function.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9512-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For example, when p120-GFP was overexpressed in cells, this construct became associated with MTs in an N-terminal region-dependent manner (Ichii and Takeichi, 2007Ichii T. Takeichi M. p120-catenin regulates microtubule dynamics and cell migration in a cadherin-independent manner.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that, in the natural setting, p120 coupled with cadherin might also interact with MTs, presumably with this interaction being mediated by other proteins. To test this possibility, in this present study we searched for proteins interacting with the p120 N-terminal region and identified a novel molecule, PLEKHA7 (pleckstrin homology domain-containing, family A member 7) (Gerhard et al., 2004Gerhard D.S. Wagner L. Feingold E.A. Shenmen C.M. Grouse L.H. Schuler G. Klein S.L. Old S. Rasooly R.

Altschul S.F. et al.Generation and initial analysis of more than 15,000 full-length human and mouse cDNA sequences.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 16899-16903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). We subsequently identified another novel protein, which we designated as Nezha (a deity in Chinese mythology), as a binding partner for PLEKHA7. These two proteins were localized along the ZA but not at the other parts of the AJ. Unexpectedly, we found Nezha to be associated with the minus ends of MTs, supporting the idea that the cadherin-p120 complex or AJ is linked with MTs, but via their minus ends rather than via their plus ones. The above form of MT-ZA association prompted us to hypothesize that minus end-directed motors may utilize these MTs as a track for reaching the ZA. In fact, we found that one of the kinesin-14 family members, KIFC3, was concentrated in the ZA and that its junctional localization was abolished by RNAi-mediated depletion of PLEKHA7 or Nezha. Depletion of PLEKHA7, Nezha, or KIFC3 also resulted in disorganization of the ZA. Thus, we found a novel MT minus-end-anchoring mechanism, as well as one of its functions, which was important to maintain the integrity of the ZA. To search for proteins interacting with the N-terminal region of p120-catenin (p120), we generated a GST fusion protein for this domain (N-GST) or an N-terminus-deleted p120 (ΔN-GST; Figure 1A) and incubated them with lysates of human colon carcinoma Caco2 cells. Mass spectrometric analysis of the materials pulled down with these fusion proteins showed that an isoform of PLEKHA7 specifically cosedimented with the p120 N-terminal domain. PLEKHA7 is a protein that has WW, PH (pleckstrin homology), and CC (coiled-coil) domains (Figure 1B), but its biological function has not been characterized yet. To confirm the binding of PLEKHA7 with the p120 N-terminal domain, we constructed a Flag-tagged PLEKHA7 (PLEKHA7-Flag) and transfected Caco2 cells with this construct. The lysates of these transfectants were then incubated with N-GST, ΔN-GST, or GST. The results of this pull-down assay showed that PLEKHA7-Flag was precipitated only with the N-GST (Figure 1C). Next, we used a lysate of the above PLEKHA7-Flag or control transfectants to examine whether this PLEKHA7-Flag could be coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous p120, and we found that anti-Flag antibodies could cosediment p120 only from the PLEKHA7-Flag transfectants (Figure 1D). The immunoprecipitates from the PLEKHA7-Flag transfectants also contained E-cadherin (Figure 1D), as well as α- and β-catenin (data not shown), suggesting that PLEKHA7 was associated with the E-cadherin-catenin complex via p120. Further analysis determined that a portion from aa 538 to 696 of PLEKHA7 was required for its binding to p120 (Figure S1 available online). Next, we generated antibodies against human PLEKHA7. These antibodies recognized two bands with molecular masses of 135 kDa and 145 kDa in western blots (Figure S2A), of which the 135 kDa band was the dominant one. Immunofluorescence staining of Caco2 cells showed that PLEKHA7 was localized along cell-cell junctions (Figure 1E). In Caco2 cell-cell junctions, an earlier study showed that there are two populations of E-cadherin: one is linearly localized along the apical-most portion of the junction, corresponding to the ZA, and the other is distributed as a meshwork or puncta at the lower portions of the junction (Otani et al., 2006Otani T. Ichii T. Aono S. Takeichi M. Cdc42 GEF Tuba regulates the junctional configuration of simple epithelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Double-immunostaining for PLEKHA7 and E-cadherin revealed that PLEKHA7 was localized only along the ZA (Figure 1E). A similar localization of PLEKHA7 was observed in other epithelial cell lines, as well as in embryonic epithelial and neural tissues (data not shown). PLEKHA7 was also detected in the centrosomes (Figure S2B). To confirm whether the above PLEKHA7 distribution was mediated by p120, we examined the effect of p120 depletion. At the junctions of p120 siRNA-treated Caco2 cells, PLEKHA7 was reduced in simple proportion to the reduction of p120 level (Figure S3A). E-cadherin localization was also affected in these cells, as expected from earlier observations (Reynolds, 2007Reynolds A.B. p120-catenin: Past and present.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, E-cadherin level declined in a fashion less sensitive to the p120 reduction than that of PLEKHA7 (Figure S3A), suggesting that only the latter was proportional to the p120 level. To further corroborate the involvement of p120, we used cadherin-deficient Neuro-2a cells (Ichii and Takeichi, 2007Ichii T. Takeichi M. p120-catenin regulates microtubule dynamics and cell migration in a cadherin-independent manner.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These cells were transfected with a normal cadherin, or its mutant cN/JM(-), in which the p120-binding region had been deleted (Aono et al., 1999Aono S. Nakagawa S. Reynolds A.B. Takeichi M. p120(ctn) acts as an inhibitory regulator of cadherin function in colon carcinoma cells.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In the normal cadherin transfectants, PLEKHA7 was recruited to the cell-cell contact sites, whereas this did not occur in the mutant transfectants (Figure S3B). These observations support the idea of the p120-dependent recruitment of PLEKHA7 to the junctions. To explore the functions of PLEKHA7, we first exogenously expressed PLEKHA7-GFP in Caco2 cells and found that this construct was also selectively localized along the ZA. Intriguingly, the overexpressed PLEKHA7 molecules upregulated the level of E-cadherin accumulating at the ZA while concomitantly downregulating its level at the lower portions of the junction (Figure 1F). The junctional localization of p120 and other catenins responded to the PLEKHA7 overexpression in a similar fashion (data not shown), suggesting that excess PLEKHA7 redistributed the E-cadherin-catenin complex to the ZA, removing it from the lower portions of the cell junction. Next, we knocked down the expression of PLEKHA7 in Caco2 cells by using siRNAs specific for this molecule. The overall level of PLEKHA7 in the culture was significantly reduced by the siRNA treatment (Figure S2C). After depletion of PLEKHA7, the intensity of E-cadherin signals distributed along the ZA was strongly reduced; whereas the lower lateral components of E-cadherin were not much affected (Figure 1G). p120 and α- and β-catenin were also eliminated from the ZA (data not shown). The circumferential actin belts remained intact along the ZA after PLEKHA7 depletion, although disassembled actin fibers were more frequently observed (Figure S2D); and the accumulation of ZO-1 and desmoplakin, markers for tight junction and desmosome, respectively, was not particularly altered by PLEKHA7 depletion (Figure S2E). These observations suggest that PLEKHA7 was specifically important for the cadherin-catenin accumulation at the ZA. In order to investigate the mechanisms for the PLEKHA7-dependent regulation of cadherin assembly, we conducted pulldown assays using PLEKHA7-GST fusion proteins to screen for proteins that interact with PLEKHA7. One construct comprising GST and a PLEKHA7 fragment (from aa 680 to 821) corresponding to its CC domain (Figure S4A) interacted with an as yet uncharacterized 150 kDa protein (KIAA1543), and we termed this protein Nezha. Nezha comprises one calponin homology (CH) and two coiled-coil (CC1 and 2) domains, as well as one DUF1781 (DUF) domain of unknown function (Figure 2A). We generated antibodies against Nezha. Western blot analysis of Caco2 cell lysates with these antibodies detected two bands, a major one with a molecular mass of 150 kDa and a minor one of 160 kDa (Figure 2A); and these bands became undetectable after RNAi-mediated depletion of Nezha, assuring the specificity of the antibodies (see Figure 2E). Next, we examined, by using a lysate of Caco2 cells doubly transfected with PLEKHA7-Flag and EGFP-tagged Nezha (Nezha-GFP) or control EGFP, whether Nezha could be coimmunoprecipitated with PLEKHA7 and found that anti-GFP antibodies precipitated PLEKHA7-Flag only from the Nezha-GFP transfectants (Figure 2B). We further found that anti-Nezha antibodies not only precipitated endogenous Nezha itself but also coprecipitated endogenous PLEKHA7 (Figure 2C). Deletion analysis of Nezha showed that the C-terminal region from aa 943 to 1225 contained the site required for its association with PLEKHA7 (Figure S4B). In immunofluorescence staining of Caco2 cells, Nezha was detected as punctate signals scattered in the cytoplasm, but this protein was also localized along the ZA together with PLEKHA7 (Figure 2D). This junctional localization of Nezha became detectable only at mature cell-cell contacts, e.g., at 3 days under the present culture conditions (see Experimental Procedures), whereas PLEKHA7 appeared by 1 day. To examine whether the distribution of Nezha could be regulated by PLEKHA7, we depleted PLEKHA7 by treating Caco2 cells with specific siRNAs and found that the Nezha signals disappeared from the cell junctions, but not from the cytoplasm (Figure 2D), suggesting that the junctional localization of Nezha, but not the cytoplasmic one, was dependent on PLEKHA7. Reciprocally, when Nezha had been depleted by siRNAs specific for this protein, the PLEKHA7 distribution pattern became irregular; and the ZA-associated E-cadherin became reduced and discontinuous (Figures 2E and 2F). These observations suggest that Nezha, once associated with PLEKHA7, serves to maintain the integrity of the ZA. As found for PLEKHA7, Nezha depletion did not affect ZO-1 accumulation (see Figure S11). To explore the biological functions of Nezha, we constructed a series of Nezha deletion mutants tagged with EGFP and transfected Caco2 cells with their cDNAs (Figure S5A). Immunostaining for EGFP and α-tubulin suggested that overexpressed Nezha was associated with MTs, inducing their bundling, and that this MT-bundling ability of Nezha required the C-terminal region (Figure S5A), which also contained the PLEKHA7-binding site, as mentioned already (Figure S4). For biochemical confirmation of the Nezha-MT interaction, we prepared an extract of Caco2 cells and added carrier tubulins and then Taxol (pacilitaxel) to the solution, according to a method previously described (Vallee, 1982Vallee R.B. A taxol-dependent procedure for the isolation of microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs).J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The MT pellets collected from this extract contained Nezha (Figure S5B). When a recombinant Nezha-Flag was mixed with purified tubulins, these proteins also coprecipitated (Figure S5C), strongly suggesting that Nezha could directly bind MTs. These observations prompted us to analyze the cytological relationship between endogenous Nezha and MTs. We double-immunostained for these two molecules in Caco2 cells and found that the Nezha signals were mostly localized at one end of noncentrosomal MTs (Figure 3A). To characterize this localization, we triple-immunostained for MTs, Nezha, and EB1, a protein known to bind exclusively to the MT plus end (Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2000Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. The dynamic behavior of the APC-binding protein EB1 on the distal ends of microtubules.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 865-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, Su et al., 1995Su L.K. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Gyuris J. Brent R. Wiltshire R. Trent J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. APC binds to the novel protein EB1.Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2972-2977PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, Nezha and EB1 were distributed differently (Figure 3B), and high-magnification images showed that these two proteins were localized at the opposite ends of noncentrosomal MTs (Figure 3C). These results suggest that Nezha bound to the minus end of noncentrosomal MTs. On the other hand, Nezha was not detected at the centrosomes marked by γ-tubulin staining (Figures S6A and S6B), except that overexpressed Nezha recruited γ-tubulin onto Nezha-induced MT bundles (Figure S6C). It is known that ninein, a centrosomal minus-end capping protein, is released from the centrosomes and redistributed to the apical cortex of cells (Mogensen et al., 2000Mogensen M.M. Malik A. Piel M. Bouckson-Castaing V. Bornens M. Microtubule minus-end anchorage at centrosomal and non-centrosomal sites: the role of ninein.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3013-3023PubMed Google Scholar) or desmosomes (Lechler and Fuchs, 2007Lechler T. Fuchs E. Desmoplakin: an unexpected regulator of microtubule organization in the epidermis.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and that these ninein molecules anchor MTs at these respective sites, like Nezha. However, double-immunostaining for ninein and Nezha showed that their distributions did not overlap (Figure S7). Desmoplakin depletion also did not affect the junctional localization of Nezha (data not shown). To further characterize the minus-end-specific binding nature of Nezha, we performed an in vitro MT-capping experiment (Wiese and Zheng, 2000Wiese C. Zheng Y. A new function for the gamma-tubulin ring complex as a microtubule minus-end cap.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For this assay, we chose a C-terminal-half fragment of Nezha (Nezha-CC1F), whose MT-bundling ability was cytochemically indistinguishable from that of the full-length Nezha (Figure S5A), and constructed an Alexa 488-labeled, His-tagged Nezha-CC1F recombinant protein (Figure 3D). To a solution of this protein, rhodamine-labeled and unlabeled tubulins were sequentially added. This protocol led to the production of chimeric MTs with high and low rhodamine intensities, in which the portion with brighter rhodamine signals corresponded to the minus-end side (Wiese and Zheng, 2000Wiese C. Zheng Y. A new function for the gamma-tubulin ring complex as a microtubule minus-end cap.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We found that Nezha-CC1F was consistently localized at the brighter end of the chimeric MTs (Figure 3D). Thus, we could biochemically confirm that Nezha bound the MT minus end. To observe Nezha and associated MTs in living cells, we doubly transfected Caco2 cells with kusabira orange-labeled Nezha (Nezha-KOR) and GFP-α-tubulin and recorded their behavior by time-lapse movies, choosing thin peripheries of cells, which allowed us to obtain high-resolution imaging. These movies showed intriguing dynamics of these molecules: Individual Nezha puncta were located at an almost fixed position, and from each punctum, a single MT emerged, which showed repeated extension and retraction (Figure 4A and Movie S1). These results suggest that Nezha provided an anchoring point for the minus ends of MTs, allowing their dynamic elongation and shortening. We also observed the dynamics of MT plus ends in relation to Nezha by doubly introducing EB1- or EB3-GFP and Nezha-KOR into Caco2 cells. The movie showed that a novel EB1 signal appeared directly from a Nezha-positive site and moved away, and this process was repeated (Figure 4B and Movie S2). These results confirmed that Nezha or Nezha-bearing structures sustained the repetitive plus-end growth of MTs. In this imaging, on the other hand, we did not distinguish whether the observed Nezha signals were derived from the ones localized in the cell junctions or not. To analyze the interactions between Nezha and MTs at cell junctions, we triple-immunostained for Nezha, PLEKHA7, and MTs and found that the Nezha-MT complexes were localized in the PLEKHA7-positive zones (Figure 4C), supporting the model that these complexes were associated with PLEKHA7. We also purposely chose Nezha signals located at cell-cell boundaries for time-lapse recording and found a similar movement of EB1 or EB3 away from these Nezha puncta (Figure 4D). It was previously shown that dynein, a minus end-directed motor, was localized in cell junctions (Ligon et al., 2001Ligon L.A. Karki S. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L. Dynein binds to beta-catenin and may tether microtubules at adherens junctions.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This led us to consider the possibility that a function of the MTs tethered to the PLEKHA7-Nezha complex at the minus end is to provide a track for dynein or other minus end-directed motors to reach the AJs. We therefore tested this possibility and actually found that KIFC3 (Yang et al., 1997Yang Z. Hanlon D.W. Marszalek J.R. Goldstein L.S. Identification, partial characterization, and genetic mapping of kinesin-like protein genes in mouse.Genomics. 1997; 45: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a minus end-directed motor, was localized along the ZA of Caco2 cells (Figure 5A), as well as in the centrosomes (Figure S8A). This junctional localization of KIFC3 was evident only at mature cell junctions, as in the case of Nezha. When PLEKHA7 or Nezha had been deleted, KIFC3 was diminished at cell junctions but not at the centrosomes (Figure 5B). In addition, overexpressed PLEKHA7 enhanced the recruitment of KIFC3 to the ZA in early cultures, where its accumulation to cell junctions was still incomplete; likewise, overexpression of Nezha, which induced MT bundling, recruited KIFC3 to the Nezha-positive sites (Figure S8B). All these observations suggest that KIFC3 was transported to cell junctions in a manner dependent on the PLEKHA7-Nezha complex. Next, we attempted to visualize the KIFC3 recruitment to cell junctions by live-cell imaging: We doubly transfected Caco2 cells with EGFP-tagged KIFC3 (KIFC3-GFP) and kusabira orange-tagged E-cadherin (Ecad-KOR) and observed their behavior by time-lapse recording. The movies showed that, although exogenous KIFC3 tended to form static aggregates, there was a population of small KIFC3 clusters that actively moved from the cytoplasmic zones to the E-cadherin-positive junction and then settled there (Figure 5C and Movie S3). When the KIFC3 clusters below 0.27 μm in diameter were chosen for measurement, 36% of them showed such movement with a speed of 216 ± 81.9 nm/s (mean ± standard deviation [SD], n = 20). Such translocation of cytoplasmic KIFC3 to the cell junction was, however, not observed in nocodazole-treated transfectants (see below). We also observed that KIFC3 signals were associated with MTs oriented toward cell junctions in fixed samples (Figure 5D). To examine the function of KIFC3, we knocked down its expression in Caco2 cells by using KIFC3-specific siRNA. After the KIFC3 depletion, E-cadherin signals at the ZA were disorganized (Figure 5E), as observed in PLEKHA7- or Nezha-depleted cells, suggesting that PLEKHA7, Nezha, and KIFC3 work together for the regulation of cadherin assembly at the ZA. We examined how MTs themselves were involved in the above systems. We treated Caco2 cells with 10 to 20 μM nocodazole for 30 min to 6 hr and observed the junctional distributions of the proteins studied above. MT depolymerization began within 30 min, progressively affecting the distribution of Nezha, KIFC3, and PLEKHA7/E-cadherin in this sequence: Nezha signals disappeared from cell-cell boundaries by 30 min (Figure S9A), indicating that the junctional localization of Nezha depended on its binding to MTs. KIFC3 signals began to be disorganized at 1 hr and disappeared by 2 hr from the junctions (Figure S9B); concomitantly, their movement toward the junction ceased, as mentioned above. During these incubation times, the localization of PLEKHA7 and E-cadherin appeared to be unchanged. At 6 hr, however, PLEKHA7 signals became zigzag or fragmented, and E-cadherin delineating the ZA became reduced and discontinuous (Figures S9C and S9D). These results confirmed the specific requirement of MTs for the ZA assembly but simultaneously indicated th"
https://openalex.org/W2055531511,"A phosphatidylserine-binding protein, MG53, is shown to participate in membrane repair. MG53 recruits vesicles to the repair site in an oxidation dependent manner and MG53-null mice develop progressive myopathy associated with defective membrane repair. Dynamic membrane repair and remodelling is an elemental process that maintains cell integrity and mediates efficient cellular function. Here we report that MG53, a muscle-specific tripartite motif family protein (TRIM72), is a component of the sarcolemmal membrane-repair machinery. MG53 interacts with phosphatidylserine to associate with intracellular vesicles that traffic to and fuse with sarcolemmal membranes. Mice null for MG53 show progressive myopathy and reduced exercise capability, associated with defective membrane-repair capacity. Injury of the sarcolemmal membrane leads to entry of the extracellular oxidative environment and MG53 oligomerization, resulting in recruitment of MG53-containing vesicles to the injury site. After vesicle translocation, entry of extracellular Ca2+ facilitates vesicle fusion to reseal the membrane. Our data indicate that intracellular vesicle translocation and Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion are distinct steps involved in the repair of membrane damage and that MG53 may initiate the assembly of the membrane repair machinery in an oxidation-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2086609648,"Loss of cell polarity proteins such as Scribble induces neoplasia in Drosophila by promoting uncontrolled proliferation. In mammals, the role that polarity proteins play during tumorigenesis is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of Scribble in mammary epithelia disrupts cell polarity, blocks three-dimensional morphogenesis, inhibits apoptosis, and induces dysplasia in vivo that progress to tumors after long latency. Loss of Scribble cooperates with oncogenes such as c-myc to transform epithelial cells and induce tumors in vivo by blocking activation of an apoptosis pathway. Like depletion, mislocalization of Scribble from cell-cell junction was sufficient to promote cell transformation. Interestingly, spontaneous mammary tumors in mice and humans possess both downregulated and mislocalized Scribble. Thus, we demonstrate that scribble inhibits breast cancer formation and that deregulation of polarity pathways promotes dysplastic and neoplastic growth in mammals by disrupting morphogenesis and inhibiting cell death."

We show that yeast cells deleted of MYO1, encoding the only myosin II normally required for cytokinesis, rapidly evolved divergent pathways to restore growth and cytokinesis. The evolved cytokinesis phenotypes correlated with specific changes in the transcriptome. Polyploidy and aneuploidy were common genetic alterations in the best evolved strains, and aneuploidy could account for gene expression changes due directly to altered chromosome stoichiometry as well as to downstream effects. The phenotypic effect of aneuploidy could be recapitulated with increased copy numbers of specific regulatory genes in myo1Δ cells. These results demonstrate the evolvability of even a well-conserved process and suggest that changes in chromosome stoichiometry provide a source of heritable variation driving the emergence of adaptive phenotypes when the cell division machinery is strongly perturbed.

Evolution is the creative force that shapes life on earth (Darwin, 1859Darwin C. On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, 1 edn. John Murray, London1859Google Scholar). As such, evolvability, the ability to generate heritable variation to adjust to internal and external changes, should be a fundamental property of all living systems. It has been hypothesized that evolvability may be linked to the robustness and flexibility that characterize complex biological systems (Kirschner and Gerhart, 1998Kirschner M. Gerhart J. Evolvability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 8420-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, Wagner and Altenberg, 1996Wagner G.P. Altenberg L. Perspective: complex adaptations and the evolution of evolvability.Evolution Int. J. Org. Evolution. 1996; 50: 967-976Crossref Google Scholar). Whereas recent studies have shed light on the generation of robustness from complexity and redundancy in molecular pathways (Kitano, 2004Kitano H. Biological robustness.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 826-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, Wagner, 2005Wagner A. 1 edn. Robustness and Evolvability in Living Systems. Volume 1. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ2005Google Scholar), it remains poorly understood how evolvability is related to these properties and, in turn, affects the dynamics of biological systems under varying physiological or pathological conditions. Experimental exploration into this relationship may bring fundamental insights into the design principles underlying biological systems and ultimately improve our ability to manipulate these systems for research and therapeutic goals. Another important question in the understanding of cellular evolvability is the source of the heritable variation that could drive rapid phenotypic changes. At the molecular level, genetic changes can be generated through at least four different mechanisms: (1) point mutations in the nucleotide sequence of coding or noncoding regions; (2) amplification or deletion of chromosomal segments; (3) chromosomal translocation, inversion, and nonhomologous end joining; and (4) whole-chromosome aneuploidy. It is presently unclear how the different types of genetic changes may be particularly advantageous in evolutionary processes with different timescales, population sizes, and the degrees of the phenotypic leap under specific selective conditions. Another genomic change implicated in evolution is polyploidization, which is thought to facilitate evolution through increased gene dosage, the capacity to mask deleterious mutations, and elevated genomic instability (Otto, 2007Otto S.P. The evolutionary consequences of polyploidy.Cell. 2007; 131: 452-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In this study we have used cytokinesis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to gain insights into cellular evolvability. Successful cytokinesis is accomplished through a fully integrated process of cell-cycle regulation, spatial patterning, cytoskeletal rearrangements, force production, and membrane trafficking (Balasubramanian et al., 2004Balasubramanian M.K.

Animal cytokinesis: From parts list to mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 543-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In yeast and animal cells, cytokinesis relies on membrane constriction along an equatorial furrow, driven by a ring structure consisting of actin filaments, the nonmuscle myosin II, and a number of other cytoskeleton-associated proteins. In budding yeast, Myo1, the only myosin II, is required for ingression of the bud neck membrane and guides the production of a single primary septum by the transmembrane chitin synthase, Chs2 (Schmidt et al., 2002Schmidt M. Bowers B. Varma A. Roh D.H. Cabib E. In budding yeast, contraction of the actomyosin ring and formation of the primary septum at cytokinesis depend on each other.J.

Despite a high level of conservation, accumulating observations in yeast and other cell types suggest that the cytokinetic machinery may be highly adaptable (Kanada et al., 2005Kanada M. Nagasaki A.

Cell. 2003; 14: 798-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we took a systematic approach to investigate the evolvability of myo1Δ yeast cells. Forty-five lines of freshly isolated myo1Δ colonies, which initially divided poorly, were evolved independently over up to 20 passages. Through cell biological analyses, transcriptome profiling, and genome analyses we inquired into the divergent mechanisms that the cells evolved to restore cytokinesis in the absence of myosin II and into the molecular basis of their emergence. Our results suggest that even conserved core processes can be highly evolvable, and aneuploidy can be a source of heritable variation driving the observed phenotypic evolution. Furthermore, we present evidence that polyploidy serves as a catalyst for this pathway of adaptive evolution. At the start of the evolution experiment (Figure 1A), we dissected 24 tetrads sporulated from a MYO1/myo1Δ heterozygous diploid strain to isolate fresh myo1Δ haploid spores. After 3 days of growth, the tetrads exhibited the expected 2:2 segregation for growth between wild-type (MYO1) and mutant (myo1Δ) spores (Figure 1B). After 7 more days of incubation, 15 out of the 48 myo1Δ spores (31%) gave rise to small colonies, whereas 100% of the MYO1 spores grew to large colonies. Each of the 15 myo1Δ survivor colonies was streaked onto a new plate for growth into isolated colonies (P2 in Figures 1A and 1D). After 3 days, the three largest colonies from each plate were selected and streaked onto a new plate. Subsequently, the 45 myo1Δ strains were evolved separately by a repeated process of manually selecting the largest colony, which was then streaked onto a new plate for propagation (Figure 1A). At each passage, we compared size and number of viable colonies and cytokinesis efficiency (see Figure 1C for an example) with those of a wild-type strain propagated in parallel. A strain was deemed to have evolved to a steady state when colony growth remained constant for at least four consecutive passages. This experiment ceased after the 20th passage (corresponding to ∼400 generations for wild-type) and resulted in 29 stably evolved strains (e-strains) with different evolutionary history and a variety of terminal phenotypes (Figure 1D). To obtain a quantitative phenotypic classification of the 29 myo1Δ e-strains, we determined their cytokinesis index (CI), rates of biomass and cell number increase, cell viability, and DNA content over a time course of 10 hr. This dataset was subjected to a principal components analysis (PCA). Projection of the phenotypic data in the space defined by the first two principal components, describing >80% of the total variance in the dataset, discriminated all wild-type controls (Figure 1E, diamonds) from all the e-strains by a higher cell mortality in the latter. PCA further separated the 29 analyzed e-strains into distinct phenotypic classes. A cluster of ten strains was characterized by higher cytokinesis indexes, biomass increase rates, and cell division rates in comparison to the remaining e-strains and were thus referred to as the “ten fittest e-strains” throughout this study (Figure 1E, large dark circles and Figure S1 available online). Even though these strains divide and grow well under optimal conditions, competition experiments and growth assays under a variety of conditions showed that they were still less fit than wild-type cells (Figures S2). As a first step to characterize the evolved cytokinesis in the e-strains, we analyzed the localization of actin and Chs2, known partners of Myo1 during normal cytokinesis. Both proteins join Myo1 in the cytokinetic ring at the bud neck in late anaphase (Balasubramanian et al., 2004Balasubramanian M.K. Bi E. Glotzer M. Comparative analysis of cytokinesis in budding yeast, fission yeast and animal cells.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R806-R818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Compared to wild-type cells, the actin ring and Chs2-GFP ring were observed at drastically reduced frequencies in all ten fittest e-strains (Figure S3). In those cells that did show Chs2 localization the intensity of the signal was often dim and time-lapse microscopy data further showed that these rings often faded without evidence of constriction (Figure S3). Since these e-strains exhibited cytokinesis efficiencies comparable to wild-type (Figure S1), these data indicated that it was unlikely that the evolved cytokinesis in the myo1Δ e-strains relied on formation of an actin- or Chs2-containing cytokinetic ring. We further tested if the e-strains retained the ability to assemble a myosin ring at the bud neck by reintroducing Myo1-GFP, carried on a centromeric plasmid under the control of its own promoter, into the wild-type and the ten fittest e-strains. Consistent with published observations, Myo1-GFP localizes at the bud neck in all budded wild-type cells, but most e-strains, with the exception of 12d-1 and 12d-2, exhibited drastically reduced ability to correctly localize Myo1 (Figures 2A–2C), further suggesting that the e-strains were unlikely to perform cytokinesis through restoration of the previous cytokinetic apparatus. To gain further insights into how cytokinesis is achieved in the absence of MYO1, we carried out thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine septum morphologies of the ten fittest e-strains. Wild-type cells formed a single, straight primary septum, which developed behind the cleavage furrow intruding symmetrically from opposite sides of the bud neck (Figure 2D). A secondary septum was then deposited along both sides of the primary septum. Four different septum morphologies were observed in dividing cells of myo1Δ e-strains: (I) a primary and secondary septum that appeared morphologically similar to those in wild-type cells, with only subtle differences such as occasional unilateral formation of a wavy primary septum; (II) a single but slightly aberrant primary septum, frequently characterized by cytoplasmic entrapment; (III) multiple randomly oriented septa, some of which emanated even from regions distant from the bud neck; (IV) thickening of the cell wall around the bud neck without the formation of a primary septum (Figure 2D). Though none of the e-strains homogeneously displayed any single septum morphology, quantification of TEM images showed that one of three morphologies (I, III, or IV) was predominant in each e-strain (Figure 2E). Serial sectioning TEM confirmed that the different septum morphologies observed were not simply due to sectioning through different planes of the bud neck (Figure S4). We next used three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging to visualize plasma membrane dynamics during cytokinesis in e-strains representative of all septum morphologies. These e-strains expressed RAS2-GFP, used as a plasma membrane marker (Whistler and Rine, 1997Whistler J.L. Rine J. Ras2 and Ras1 protein phosphorylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18790-18800Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and GFP-TUB1, to visualize the mitotic spindle and mark cell-cycle progression. In wild-type cells, closure of the mother-bud junction is achieved through bilateral invagination of the plasma membrane at the bud neck 4–6 min after spindle breakdown (Figure 2F and Movie S1). Seven time-lapse movies made of 12d-1 strain all showed behaviors consistent with septum morphology I; four of the movies showed formation of monolateral and three bilateral invaginations that extended across the bud neck to complete cytokinesis within 4–8.5 min after spindle breakdown (Figure 2F and Movie S2). Similar membrane closure dynamics were also observed in 7a-2 (Movie S3) and 24d-3 e-strains (Movie S4). Five of nine movies of 13c-2 (representing morphology III) revealed formation of multiple, unstable invaginations from both sides of (and also far away from) the bud neck (Figure 2F and Movie S5). Cytoplasm separation was accomplished more slowly (6–30 min) than in the wild-type. Movies of e-strains 7a-1 and 23a-1 (representing morphology IV) showed that in the majority of cells recorded (3/5 for 7a-1 and 5/6 for 23a-1), there was no evidence of furrowing, but membrane closure was achieved by a slow (19–33 min) inward pushing of the plasma membrane (Figure 2F and Movies S6–S7), consistent with the idea that cytokinesis is achieved through gradual thickening of the cell wall around the bud neck. These results revealed the presence of three distinct physical mechanisms of membrane closure among the ten fittest e-strains, each consistent with one of the three major septum morphologies observed by TEM. To identify molecular pathways underlying the evolved cytokinesis mechanisms, we performed a microarray-based mRNA profiling of the ten fittest e-strains (Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Spreadsheet S1). After filtering the data to remove nonchanging genes, a statistical approach was applied to detect gene expression changes that significantly correlated with each of the four septum morphologies (Figure 3A). Gene expression changes detected by microarray analysis were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on 12 genes across all ten fittest e-strains (Figure S5). FatiScan analysis (Al-Shahrour et al., 2006Al-Shahrour F. Minguez P. Tarraga J. Montaner D. Alloza E. Vaquerizas J.M. Conde L. Blaschke C. Vera J. Dopazo J. BABELOMICS: a systems biology perspective in the functional annotation of genome-scale experiments.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W472-W476Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) was applied to determine enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations among genes correlated with each of the septum morphologies (Figures 3B and S6). While several GO Biological Process annotation terms that positively correlated with septum morphologies I and II included ribosomal biogenesis, septum morphology IV was positively associated with cell wall biogenesis. Few biological processes were found to associate with septum morphology III possibly due to a small number of genes found to correlate with this morphology (data not shown). In addition, manual inspection of the microarray data revealed that both Hsp90 genes (HSP82 and HSC82) were more upregulated in the e-strains that preferentially divided through morphology I (Figure 3C). Specific correlation of above pathways with septum morphologies I and IV was further corroborated by a second analysis applied to the gene expression data of strains 7a-1, 7a-2, and 7a-3, which descended from the same spore but showed divergent septum morphologies (Figure S7). Functional validation of pathways revealed by microarray analyses through genetic manipulation was challenging due to various genomic changes in the e-strains (see below) and their propensity to undergo adaptive evolution when perturbed. Chemical inhibitors were therefore used to acutely inhibit specific cellular pathways in the e-strains. We first used radicicol, an Hsp90 inhibitor (Roe et al., 1999Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Structural basis for inhibition of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone by the antitumor antibiotics radicicol and geldanamycin.J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), to test the requirement for Hsp90 in the growth of the e-strains. Consistent with the correlation of Hsp90 expression with septum morphology I, the five e-strains that displayed predominantly this morphology were hypersensitive to radicicol compared to wild-type and the other five e-strains favoring morphologies III or IV (Figure 3D). Liquid-culture experiments found that radicicol inhibited cytokinesis in the five e-strains that predominantly showed septum morphology I (Figure 3E). This provides a functional validation of a specific involvement of Hsp90 in the evolved cytokinesis represented by septum morphology I. Hypersensitivity to cycloheximide, an inhibitor of ribosome function, was also observed among the same group of e-strains (Figure 3F), consistent with a higher requirement for ribosome function in those e-strains. Since cycloheximide strongly inhibited budding and cell-cycle progression of these e-strains (data not shown), we were unable to test specifically its effect on cytokinesis. Taken together, above results suggest that distinct cytokinesis mechanisms arose from expression changes of genes defining specific cellular functions. To identify the genetic changes that led to heritable phenotypic variation in the e-strains, we first used flow cytometry to determine the cellular DNA content of the 29 stably evolved myo1Δ e-strains (Figure S8). Twenty of the twenty-nine e-strains, including the ten fittest e-strains, had increased their ploidy from the haploid state to a state ranging from diploid to tetraploid, and the rest remained haploid (Figure 4A). Cytokinesis failure in budding yeast normally results in multiple-budded, multinucleate cells, which could account for a ploidy increase. However, ∼90% of budded cells in each of the ten fittest e-strain population were mononucleate (Figure S9), thus these myo1Δ e-strains had undergone mononucleate polyploidization (referred to hereafter as polyploidization). In contrast, 7 of 8 e-strains that were still defective in cytokinesis at the end of the evolution experiment were still haploid, showing that polyploidization was not an obligatory outcome of the cytokinesis defect. Instead, this analysis revealed a strong correlation between polyploidization and restoration of cytokinesis at the end of the evolution (Figure 4B and Table S3). The above observation raised the possibility that polyploidization facilitates adaptive evolution of myo1Δ cells. To test this, a MYO1/MYO1/myo1Δ/myo1Δ tetraploid strain was used to generate fresh myo1Δ/myo1Δ diploid cells through sporulation. The adaptive evolution experiment was then repeated, comparing the rate of cytokinesis improvement between 7 myo1Δ/myo1Δ diploid spores and 22 myo1Δ haploid spores. Both haploid and diploid myo1Δ spores initially exhibited 100% cytokinesis defect (Figure 4C), but diploid strains showed significantly faster evolution during early passages (Figures 4C–4D). Interestingly, the cytokinesis efficiency of myo1Δ haploid strains did reach that of diploid strains in later passages (Figure 4C), consistent with polyploidization in the haploids during earlier passages. Flow cytometry data indicated that the DNA content of some e-strains was between that of a pure diploid and that of a pure tetraploid, suggesting the possibility of aneuploidy (Figure S8). Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) indicated that all ten fittest e-strains, but not the wild-type strain propagated in parallel, carried at least one chromosome in aneuploidy (Figure 4E). The frequency at which individual chromosomes were observed in aneuploidy was not evenly distributed: some chromosomes (e.g., II, III, XIII, and XVI) were in aneuploidy across the majority of the e-strains, while others (i.e., V, VII, and XIV) were always found in euploid number. The karyotype of the e-strains was stable during the timeframe of this work, as shown by replicate aCGH on three independent cultures of strain 7a-1 and on two independent cultures of strain 7a-2 (data not shown). The spontaneous rate of chromosome missegregation is related to chromosome size in both yeast (Murray et al., 1986Murray A.W. Schultes N.P. Szostak J.W. Chromosome length controls mitotic chromosome segregation in yeast.Cell. 1986; 45: 529-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and vertebrate cells (Spence et al., 2006Spence J.M. Mills W. Mann K. Huxley C. Farr C.J. Increased missegregation and chromosome loss with decreasing chromosome size in vertebrate cells.Chromosoma. 2006; 115: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, aneuploidization frequencies in the e-strains were uncorrelated with either chromosome length or chromosomal gene content (Figure S10). In contrast, shared aneuploid chromosomes can be found among e-strains that preferentially divided with a given septum morphology (Figure 4F). To further determine the correlation between karyotype and evolved phenotypes, aCGH was carried out on four additional e-strains, each sharing an ancestral spore with one or more of the ten fittest e-strains but resulting in less fit evolved phenotypes. In every case, the poorly evolved e-strains exhibited a drastically different aneuploidy pattern from their well-evolved relatives (Figure S11). Besides the expected deletion of the MYO1 locus and the presence of the TRP1 marker used for generating the deletion, close inspection of the aCGH data across all the chromosomes indicated absence of subchromosomal amplifications or deletions in all ten fittest myo1Δ e-strains (Figure 4E). The only local changes in hybridization intensity mapped exclusively to highly repetitive sequences, such as transposons and telomeric repeats (Figure 4E), for which aCGH data cannot be interpreted (Pinkel and Albertson, 2005Pinkel D. Albertson D.G. Comparative genomic hybridization.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2005; 6: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed no gross chromosomal rearrangements or nonhomologous end joining (Figure S12). Phenotypic adaptation during experimental evolution can often be attributed to point mutations in DNA sequences that result in changes in protein activities or expression levels (Elena and Lenski, 2003Elena S.F. Lenski R.E. Evolution experiments with microorganisms: the dynamics and genetic bases of adaptation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). However, given the fact that all of the e-strains have become polyploid and aneuploid, it would be difficult to identify mutations in these strains by commonly used genetic mapping techniques. We therefore used the Illumina sequencing system to obtain full genomic sequences from five strains: the parental MYO1/myo1Δ diploid, the wild-type strain at passage 1 and at passage 20, and two e-strains, 7a-1 and 7a-2, which exhibited the same basal ploidy, similar but nonidentical karyotypes, and different predominant septum morphologies. For all five strains we obtained high genome coverage and high sequencing depth and quality, within or above the expected performance of this technology (Tables S4 and S5). Within the nonrepetitive genome, 820 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called as homozygous mutations in the parental diploid strain, compared to the published yeast genome sequence (Spreadsheet S2). Eight hundred and three (∼98%) of these SNPs were also identified in three of the four remaining strains and were therefore likely to be true mutations present in the parental genetic background. Of the 33 SNPs predicted in the parental diploid strain as heterozygous, 23 (∼70%) were also detected in either the wild-type haploid strains or the 7a e-strains or both (Spreadsheet S2). Six of these predicted heterozygous mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing (data not shown), further confirming the ability of this technology to identify heterozygous mutations. Nine and twelve mutations were predicted to be unique to 7a-1 and 7a-2, respectively. These SNPs, if confirmed, could contribute to phenotypic evolution; however, SNPs predicted by a high-throughput sequencing technology to be unique to a single strain are more prone to bear false positives compared to SNPs consistently identified across several strains. Indeed, Sanger sequencing showed that all nine mutations predicted to be unique to e-strain 7a-1 were false positives, whereas only a single mutation was confirmed in e-strain 7a-2. This mutation mapped to the coding sequence of YGR130C, encoding a protein of unknown function, and caused a lysine to asparagine change that was predicted by the SIFT software (Ng and Henikoff, 2001Ng P.C. Henikoff S. Predicting deleterious amino acid substitutions.Genome Res. 2001; 11: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar) not to affect protein function (Spreadsheet S2). Taken together, within the limitation of available technology, current evidence has not indicated point mutations to be the primary genetic changes accounting for the divergent cytokinesis mechanisms observed in myo1Δ e-strains. Above findings left us with the unexpected possibility that aneuploidy, observed in all e-strains, was the primary genetic change that could account for the heritable phenotypic variation. To test this, we first asked whether aneuploidy could account for the global transcriptome changes that occurred in the myo1Δ e-strains. Consistent with a global effect of aneuploidy on transcriptome, the two pairs of e-strains with identical karyotypes (i.e., 7a-2/7a-3 and 23a-1/23b-1) displayed the highest overall transcriptome similarity: the microarray data of these pairs were in fact as similar to each other as any two biological replicates of a same strain (Figure S13). Previous studies showed that genes encoded on extranumerary chromosomes tend to be more highly expressed than genes on euploid chromosomes (Hughes et al., 2000Hughes T.R. Roberts C.J. Dai H. Jones A.R. Meyer M.R. Slade D. Burchard J. Dow S. Ward T.R. Kidd M.J. et al.Widespread aneuploidy revealed by DNA microarray expression profiling.Nat.

Above observation was confirmed by directly comparing our aCGH data with our microarray gene expression data in the myo1Δ e-strains (Figure 5A). In addition, there was a direct proportionality between chromosome average gene expression change and the chromosome copy number stoichiometry (Figure 5B): (1) gaining two extra copies of a given chromosome produced a chromosomal average expression change roughly"
https://openalex.org/W2048768497,"Myc activity is emerging as a key element in acquisition and maintenance of stem cell properties. We have previously shown that c-Myc deficiency results in accumulation of defective hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) due to niche-dependent differentiation defects. Here we report that immature HSCs coexpress c-myc and N-myc mRNA at similar levels. Although conditional deletion of N-myc in the bone marrow does not affect hematopoiesis, combined deficiency of c-Myc and N-Myc (dKO) results in pancytopenia and rapid lethality. Interestingly, proliferation of HSCs depends on both myc genes during homeostasis, but is c-Myc/N-Myc independent during bone marrow repair after injury. Strikingly, while most dKO hematopoietic cells undergo apoptosis, only self-renewing HSCs accumulate the cytotoxic molecule Granzyme B, normally employed by the innate immune system, thereby revealing an unexpected mechanism of stem cell apoptosis. Collectively, Myc activity (c-Myc and N-Myc) controls crucial aspects of HSC function including proliferation, differentiation, and survival."
https://openalex.org/W1996875120,"Distinguishing self from non-self is a fundamental biological challenge. Many pathogens exploit the challenge of self discrimination by employing mimicry to subvert key cellular processes including the cell cycle, apoptosis and cytoskeletal dynamics. Other mimics interfere with immunity. Poxviruses encode K3L, a mimic of eIF2alpha, which is the substrate of protein kinase R (PKR), an important component of innate immunity in vertebrates. The PKR-K3L interaction exemplifies the conundrum imposed by viral mimicry. To be effective, PKR must recognize a conserved substrate (eIF2alpha) while avoiding rapidly evolving substrate mimics such as K3L. Using the PKR-K3L system and a combination of phylogenetic and functional analyses, we uncover evolutionary strategies by which host proteins can overcome mimicry. We find that PKR has evolved under intense episodes of positive selection in primates. The ability of PKR to evade viral mimics is partly due to positive selection at sites most intimately involved in eIF2alpha recognition. We also find that adaptive changes on multiple surfaces of PKR produce combinations of substitutions that increase the odds of defeating mimicry. Thus, although it can seem that pathogens gain insurmountable advantages by mimicking cellular components, host factors such as PKR can compete in molecular 'arms races' with mimics because of evolutionary flexibility at protein interaction interfaces challenged by mimicry."
https://openalex.org/W2065150051,"The metabolic cost associated with locomotion represents a significant part of an animal's metabolic energy budget. Therefore understanding the ways in which animals manage the energy required for locomotion by controlling muscular effort is critical to understanding limb design and the evolution of locomotor behavior. The assumption that energetic economy is the most important target of natural selection underlies many analyses of steady animal locomotion, leading to the prediction that animals will choose gaits and postures that maximize energetic efficiency. Many quadrupedal animals, particularly those that specialize in long distance steady locomotion, do in fact reduce the muscular contribution required for walking by adopting pendulum-like center of mass movements that facilitate exchange between kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE) [1]–[4]. However, animals that are not specialized for long distance steady locomotion may face a more complex set of requirements, some of which may conflict with the efficient exchange of mechanical energy. For example, the “stealthy” walking style of cats may demand slow movements performed with the center of mass close to the ground. Force plate and video data show that domestic cats (Felis catus, Linnaeus, 1758) have lower mechanical energy recovery than mammals specialized for distance. A strong negative correlation was found between mechanical energy recovery and diagonality in the footfalls and there was also a negative correlation between limb compression and diagonality of footfalls such that more crouched postures tended to have greater diagonality. These data show a previously unrecognized mechanical relationship in which crouched postures are associated with changes in footfall pattern which are in turn related to reduced mechanical energy recovery. Low energy recovery was not associated with decreased vertical oscillations of the center of mass as theoretically predicted, but rather with posture and footfall pattern on the phase relationship between potential and kinetic energy. An important implication of these results is the possibility of a tradeoff between stealthy walking and economy of locomotion. This potential tradeoff highlights the complex and conflicting pressures that may govern the locomotor choices that animals make."
https://openalex.org/W2018884267,"Background Previous reports indicate an association between autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and disorders of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. One study suggested that children with both diagnoses are clinically indistinguishable from children with idiopathic autism. There are, however, no detailed analyses of the clinical and laboratory findings in a large cohort of these children. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive review of patients with ASD and a mitochondrial disorder. Methodology/Principal Findings We reviewed medical records of 25 patients with a primary diagnosis of ASD by DSM-IV-TR criteria, later determined to have enzyme- or mutation-defined mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) dysfunction. Twenty-four of 25 patients had one or more major clinical abnormalities uncommon in idiopathic autism. Twenty-one patients had histories of significant non-neurological medical problems. Nineteen patients exhibited constitutional symptoms, especially excessive fatigability. Fifteen patients had abnormal neurological findings. Unusual developmental phenotypes included marked delay in early gross motor milestones (32%) and unusual patterns of regression (40%). Levels of blood lactate, plasma alanine, and serum ALT and/or AST were increased at least once in 76%, 36%, and 52% of patients, respectively. The most common ETC disorders were deficiencies of complex I (64%) and complex III (20%). Two patients had rare mtDNA mutations of likely pathogenicity. Conclusions/Significance Although all patients' initial diagnosis was idiopathic autism, careful clinical and biochemical assessment identified clinical findings that differentiated them from children with idiopathic autism. These and prior data suggest a disturbance of mitochondrial energy production as an underlying pathophysiological mechanism in a subset of individuals with autism."

GABAergic neurotransmitter systems are important for many cognitive processes, including learning and memory. We identified a single neuron in each hemisphere of the Drosophila brain, the anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron, as a GABAergic neuron that broadly innervated the mushroom bodies. Reducing GABA synthesis in the APL neuron enhanced olfactory learning, suggesting that the APL neuron suppressed learning by releasing the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Functional optical-imaging experiments revealed that the APL neuron responded to both odor and electric-shock stimuli that was presented to the fly with increases of intracellular calcium and released neurotransmitter. Notably, a memory trace formed in the APL neuron by pairing odor with electric shock. This trace was detected as a reduced calcium response in the APL neuron after conditioning specifically to the trained odor. These results demonstrate a mutual suppression between the GABAergic APL neuron and olfactory learning, and emphasize the functional neuroplasticity of the GABAergic system as a result of learning."
https://openalex.org/W2155693781,"Reticular dysgenesis is an autosomal recessive form of human severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by an early differentiation arrest in the myeloid lineage and impaired lymphoid maturation. In addition, affected newborns have bilateral sensorineural deafness. Here we identify biallelic mutations in AK2 (adenylate kinase 2) in seven individuals affected with reticular dysgenesis. These mutations result in absent or strongly decreased protein expression. We then demonstrate that restoration of AK2 expression in the bone marrow cells of individuals with reticular dysgenesis overcomes the neutrophil differentiation arrest, underlining its specific requirement in the development of a restricted set of hematopoietic lineages. Last, we establish that AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis region of the inner ear, which provides an explanation of the sensorineural deafness in these individuals. These results identify a previously unknown mechanism involved in regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation and in one of the most severe human immunodeficiency syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2050340611,"Disruption of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) channel results in the neurodegenerative disorder mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), a lysosomal storage disease with severe motor impairments. The mechanisms underlying MLIV are poorly understood and there is no treatment. Here, we report a Drosophila MLIV model, which recapitulates the key disease features, including abnormal intracellular accumulation of macromolecules, motor defects, and neurodegeneration. The basis for the buildup of macromolecules was defective autophagy, which resulted in oxidative stress and impaired synaptic transmission. Late-apoptotic cells accumulated in trpml mutant brains, suggesting diminished cell clearance. The accumulation of late-apoptotic cells and motor deficits were suppressed by expression of trpml(+) in neurons, glia, or hematopoietic cells. We conclude that the neurodegeneration and motor defects result primarily from decreased clearance of apoptotic cells. Since hematopoietic cells in humans are involved in clearance of apoptotic cells, our results raise the possibility that bone marrow transplantation may limit the progression of MLIV."
https://openalex.org/W2054984177,"The systems that refine actomyosin forces during motility remain poorly understood. Septins assemble on the T-cell cortex and are enriched at the mid-zone in filaments. Septin knockdown causes membrane blebbing, excess leading-edge protrusions and lengthening of the trailing-edge uropod. The associated loss of rigidity permits motility, but cells become uncoordinated and poorly persistent. This also relieves a previously unrecognized restriction to migration through small pores. Pharmacologically rigidifying cells counteracts this effect, and relieving cytoskeletal rigidity synergizes with septin depletion. These data suggest that septins tune actomyosin forces during motility and probably regulate lymphocyte trafficking in confined tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2122111428,"During mitosis, sister chromatids congress to the spindle equator and are subsequently segregated via attachment to dynamic kinetochore microtubule (kMT) plus ends. A major question is how kMT plus-end assembly is spatially regulated to achieve chromosome congression. Here we find in budding yeast that the widely conserved kinesin-5 sliding motor proteins, Cin8p and Kip1p, mediate chromosome congression by suppressing kMT plus-end assembly of longer kMTs. Of the two, Cin8p is the major effector and its activity requires a functional motor domain. In contrast, the depolymerizing kinesin-8 motor Kip3p plays a minor role in spatial regulation of yeast kMT assembly. Our analysis identified a model where kinesin-5 motors bind to kMTs, move to kMT plus ends, and upon arrival at a growing plus end promote net kMT plus-end disassembly. In conclusion, we find that length-dependent control of net kMT assembly by kinesin-5 motors yields a simple and stable self-organizing mechanism for chromosome congression."
https://openalex.org/W2089735989,"Hepatic glucose production is critical for basal brain function and survival when dietary glucose is unavailable. Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) is an essential, rate-limiting enzyme that serves as a terminal gatekeeper for hepatic glucose release into the plasma. Mutations in G6Pase result in Von Gierke's disease (glycogen storage disease–1a), a potentially fatal genetic disorder. We have identified the transcriptional coactivator SRC-2 as a regulator of fasting hepatic glucose release, a function that SRC-2 performs by controlling the expression of hepatic G6Pase . SRC-2 modulates G6Pase expression directly by acting as a coactivator with the orphan nuclear receptor RORα. In addition, SRC-2 ablation, in both a whole-body and liver-specific manner, resulted in a Von Gierke's disease phenotype in mice. Our results position SRC-2 as a critical regulator of mammalian glucose production."

Under normal conditions, appetite is regulated largely by the gut-brain-adipocyte axis, an intricate circuit that balances energy intake with energy expenditure to promote the maintenance of energy reserves (Abizaid et al., 2006Abizaid A.

Hormones, nutrients and vagal afferents interact with targets in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and midbrain to modify the activity of neuronal populations that regulate food intake and energy expenditure in both short- and long-term contexts (Cone et al., 2001Cone R.D. Cowley M.A. Butler A.A. Fan W. Marks D.L. Low M.J. The arcuate nucleus as a conduit for diverse signals relevant to energy homeostasis.Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: S63-S67Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Due to its fenestrated capillaries, the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) is well-suited to detect endocrine and nutrient factors that regulate food intake (Fry and Ferguson, 2007Fry M. Ferguson A.V. The sensory circumventricular organs: Brain targets for circulating signals controlling ingestive behavior.Physiol. Behav. 2007; 91: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Orexigenic NPY and anorexigenic POMC ARC neurons respond by communicating with second-order regulatory neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and lateral hypothalamus (LH) to mediate the appropriate feeding behavior (Schwartz et al., 2000Schwartz M.W.

In addition to integrating the effects of leptin, ghrelin, insulin, and gastrointestinal peptides including CCK, PYY3-36, and GLP-1, cells of the ARC regulate food intake by directly sensing nutrients (Obici et al., 2002Obici S.

Peripheral or central infusions of glucose suppress food intake, and disruption of glucose transport or its intracellular metabolism elicit hyperphagia in experimental animals (Miselis and Epstein, 1975Miselis R.R.

Neuronal sensing of fatty acids (FAs) has also been implicated in the regulation of feeding behavior by studies demonstrating that food intake can be reduced through inhibition of fatty acid synthase (Loftus et al., 2000Loftus T.M. Jaworsky D.E. Frehywot G.L. Townsend C.A. Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. Kuhajda F.P. Reduced food intake and body weight in mice treated with fatty acid synthase inhibitors.Science. 2000; 288: 2379-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) or intrathecal oleic acid infusion (Obici et al., 2002Obici S. Feng Z. Morgan K. Stein D. Karkanias G. Rossetti L. Central administration of oleic acid inhibits glucose production and food intake.Diabetes. 2002; 51: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to plasma concentrations of glucose and amino acids, which increase after meals, concentrations of plasma FAs typically decrease with feeding and rise with fasting, contrary to what is expected of a negative regulator of appetite (Dole, 1956Dole V.P. A relation between non-esterified fatty acids in plasma and the metabolism of glucose.J. Clin. Invest. 1956; 35: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intravenous infusions of lipid do not affect food intake, and thus it remains unclear how either circulating triglyceride (TG) or FAs signal lipid surfeit to the CNS under physiological conditions (Little et al., 2007Little T.J. Horowitz M. Feinle-Bisset C. Modulation by high-fat diets of gastrointestinal function and hormones associated with the regulation of energy intake: Implications for the pathophysiology of obesity.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2007; 86: 531-541PubMed Google Scholar). Given that other types of macronutrients communicate directly with cells in the hypothalamus, we hypothesized that food intake could be modified by circulating nutrient signals reflective of meal fat content. To examine this hypothesis, we undertook a screen of lipid derivatives that increased in plasma after high-fat feeding using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Among these increased metabolites was a class of phospholipids, the N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), of previously unknown physiologic function in plasma, whose hydrolysis products, the N-acylethanolamines, have been implicated in the peripheral control of food intake (Rodriguez de Fonseca et al., 2001Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gomez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodriguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. et al.An anorexic lipid mediator regulated by feeding.Nature. 2001; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, Fu et al., 2003Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez De Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. et al.Oleylethanolamide regulates feeding and body weight through activation of the nuclear receptor PPAR-alpha.Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). We found that intraperitoneal and intravenous injection of the most abundant plasma NAPE, at physiologic doses, reduced food intake. When fasted rats were fed a high-fat diet, we observed a 60% increase in total plasma NAPE concentrations (Figure 1A). In order to confirm that dietary lipids were responsible for this increase, we subjected rats to intraduodenal infusions of lipid (Liposyn II), a glucose polymer (dextrin), or protein (casein) and monitored NAPE changes in lymph. Within 60 min of initiating the lipid infusion, we found that lymph NAPE increased by more than 50% and remained elevated for the duration of the 6 hr experiment (Figures 1B and 1C). In contrast, there were no significant increases in lymph NAPE concentrations after dextrin or protein administration in an identical infusion protocol (Figure 1B). We next examined the effects of lipid or dextrin infusion on NAPE concentrations in plasma. Consistent with the results from the lymph studies, we found that lipid, but not dextrin, infusion increased plasma NAPE levels by approximately 40% within 1 hr of the start of the lipid infusion and maintained them at elevated levels for the duration of the experiment (Figure 1D). In order to determine which acyl species of NAPE increased after lipid infusion, we analyzed plasma samples from fasted and lipid-infused rats with LC/MS/MS. We found that 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, and 18:2 NAPEs all increased by more than 50% in plasma, whereas levels of the endocannabinoid precursor 20:4 NAPE remained unchanged (Figure 1E). Because C16:0 is the most abundant circulating NAPE and the most increased by fat infusion, it was chosen for subsequent studies. Since the fatty acid components of NAPE that appeared in the plasma and lymph after lipid infusion were similar to the fatty acid composition of the infused lipid, we reasoned that the plasma and lymphatic NAPE was derived from the infused lipid and synthesized in the gut. In order to test this hypothesis and determine where in the gastrointestinal tract NAPE might be synthesized, we examined NAPE content in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine in rats that had either been fasted or refed with a high-fat diet. We found that NAPE content increased in the small intestine after fat feeding (Figure 1F) but did not change in the stomach or colon (Figure S1 available online). These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating NAPE synthesis in small intestinal gut segments with feeding (Petersen et al., 2006Petersen G. Sorensen C. Schmid P.C. Artmann A. Tang-Christensen M. Hansen S.H. Larsen P.J. Schmid H.H.O. Hansen H.S. Intestinal levels of anandamide and oleoylethanolamide in food-deprived rats are regulated through their precursors.Biochim.

Food intake regulates oleoylethanolamide formation and degradation in the proximal small intestine.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1518-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We next examined whether exogenous administration of NAPE could alter food intake. We injected rats and mice intraperitoneally with varying doses of C16:0 NAPE and monitored food intake and activity in metabolic cages. We found that NAPE treatment reduced food intake in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an isovolumetric dose of lipid had no such effect (Figure 2A). Furthermore, food intake was almost completely suppressed at the highest dose of NAPE, and its anorexigenic effects at this dose persist for 12 hr (Figure 2B). In rats, C16:0 NAPE (100 mg/kg i.p.) given immediately before the onset of the dark cycle, the interval during which rats consume the bulk of their daily calories, significantly reduced food intake (Figure 2C). Importantly, this dose of NAPE, as well as a higher dose of NAPE (250 mg/kg i.p.) and intracerebroventricular infusion of NAPE (80 nmol) did not cause conditioned taste aversion (CTA), unlike the noxious agent lithium chloride (Figure 2D and Figure S2). Because many compounds of endogenous origin affect feeding behavior when administered in sufficient quantities, we sought to test the physiological significance of NAPE as a regulator of food intake. Measurement and comparison of plasma NAPE levels after 100 mg/kg i.p. injection of C16:0 NAPE or intraduodenal bolus of Liposyn II at t = 0 (Figures 2E and 2F) indicate that both the absolute increase in circulating NAPE and the time course of that increase are similar between the lipid-fed and NAPE-injected groups. Changes observed in mice treated with NAPE (100 mg/kg i.p.) were similar, increasing from 3.8 ± 0.3 μM at baseline to a peak of 12 ± 2.6 μM at 3 hr after injection (n = 5 per group, data not shown). To investigate the possibility that the actions of NAPE may exert its effects through leptin signaling, we tested its effects on leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Surprisingly, we found that the ob/ob mice were actually more sensitive than wild-type controls to the satiating effects of exogenously administered NAPE (Figure 2G). Considering NAPE's structural similarity to identified endogenous CB1 agonists, we also examined whether the effects of NAPE require the CB1 receptor by studying NAPE treatment in CB1−/− mice. We found that NAPE treatment was still effective in suppressing overnight food intake in CB1−/− mice, suggesting that NAPE reduces food intake independently of the CB1 receptor (Figure 2H). Because the vast majority of appetite-regulatory factors have targets in the CNS, we tested the hypothesis that NAPE effects on food intake are centrally mediated. To do this, we injected C16:0 NAPE (80 nmol) into the lateral ventricle of chronically cannulated (ICV) mice and recorded overnight food intake relative to ICV lipid-treated (Liposyn II) control mice in metabolic cages. We found that ICV injection of C16:0 NAPE reduced food intake by 56% at 12 hr relative to lipid-treated animals (Figure 3A). In a second control experiment, we found that central infusion of an isomolar quantity of another phospholipid, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), had no effect on food intake (Figure 3B). Although the above investigation indicated central activity, we sought to exclude the possibility that vagal afferents were responsible for NAPE-induced hypophagia by examining the effects of systemic NAPE injection in rats that were either subjected to a bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy or a sham procedure in which the vagus nerve was exposed but not severed. When given identical doses of C16:0 NAPE (100 mg/kg), the two groups were found to have similar NAPE-induced reductions in food intake (Figure 3C, sham group, data not shown). The surgical procedure itself caused no differences in long term food intake or body weight (Figure S3). To examine whether plasma C16:0 NAPE is able to enter the central nervous system, we infused catheterized rats with a bolus of 14C-NAPE and measured 14C counts in the brain and hypothalamus 4 hr after treatment. After 14C-NAPE infusions, we found significant increases in 14C counts in the brain and more importantly a more than 5-fold increase in 14C counts in the hypothalamus. This suggests that at minimum, the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) head group of NAPE is capable of entering the CNS from peripheral circulation and that it preferentially accumulates in the hypothalamus (Figure 3D). Because NAPEs are precursors of NAEs, which have been shown to influence food intake, we also infused the hydrolysis product of C16:0 NAPE, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) directly into the lateral ventricle of cannulated mice. In contrast to NAPE, PEA did not suppress food intake overnight when administered in this manner (Figure 3E). Moreover, treatment of mice (i.p.) with an inhibitor of NAE hydrolysis, URB579, at a dose sufficient to quadruple NAE concentrations in the CNS, did not affect overnight food intake in fasted mice (Figure 3F). Taken together, these data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating no effect of intrathecal administration of the NAE oleoylethanolamide (OEA) on food intake (Rodriguez de Fonseca et al., 2001Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gomez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodriguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. et al.An anorexic lipid mediator regulated by feeding.Nature. 2001; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In addition to the dose-dependent effect of NAPE to reduce food intake, we also found that NAPE administration caused a dose-dependent reduction in activity (Figure 4A) reminiscent of the rodent behavioral satiety sequence characterized by postprandial grooming and rest (Halford et al., 1998Halford J.C. Wanninayake S.C. Blundell J.E. Behavioral satiety sequence (BSS) for the diagnosis of drug action on food intake.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1998; 61: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that this reduction in activity may have physically prevented animals from gaining access to food, we examined the effect of NAPE treatment on mouse performance on an accelerating rotarod, a well-validated measure of motor performance (Carter et al., 1999Carter R.J. Lione L.A. Humby T. Mangiarini L. Mahal A. Bates G.P. Dunnett S.B. Morton A.J. Characterization of progressive motor deficits in mice transgenic for the human Huntington's disease mutation.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3248-3257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pretrained mice treated with the highest tested dose of C16:0 NAPE performed as well as mice that received vehicle, suggesting that the reduction in movement elicited by NAPE treatment is voluntary (Figure 4B). We next examined whether ICV administration of C16:0 NAPE in mice had similar effects on locomotor activity as did peripheral treatments, and we found that very small quantities of ICV administered NAPE were sufficient to reproduce the behavioral effects obtained from much larger doses of NAPE given by intraperitoneal injection (Figure 4C). Neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates feeding and increases behavioral arousal (Stanley and Leibowitz, 1985Stanley B.G. Leibowitz S.F.

USA. 1985; 82: 3940-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, Sahu et al., 1988Sahu A. Kalra P.S. Kalra S.P.

Rev. 1999; 20: 68-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Because NAPE treatment decreased food intake and activity, we hypothesized that its effects might be mediated by NPY neurons in the hypothalamic ARC. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying immediate early gene cFOS expression in fasted transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in NPY neurons with and without NAPE treatment. Fasting increases NPY activity in the ARC, compared to the fed state, as reflected by a 4-fold increase in cFOS expression in these cells (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5G). With intraperitoneal NAPE treatment, however, cFOS activity in NPY neurons was suppressed by 64%, to a level comparable to that observed in the free-feeding ARC (Figures 5C, 5G, and 5H). In addition, we found that the canonical fasting-induced cFOS expression throughout the ARC was decreased by NAPE treatment, suggesting that increases in systemic NAPE may also suppress fasting-elicited transcriptional activity in other neural networks in the hypothalamus (Figures 5D–5F and 5I). cFOS staining performed in brain slices obtained from other areas demonstrated rapid and dramatic activation of neurons in the PVN (Figures 5J–5L) and supraoptic nucleus (SO) (Figure S4) in response to NAPE treatment relative to fasting. In order to examine whether alterations in NAPE production, or perturbed NAPE signaling, may play a role in diet induced obesity, we fed rats either a high-fat diet (HFD) or a regular chow (RC) diet for 1 month, implanted jugular venous catheters, allowed for postoperative recovery, and then measured NAPE secretion in plasma after a high-fat meal after an overnight fast. As we have shown, animals maintained on RC showed a marked increase in plasma NAPE concentrations after the high-fat meal. Surprisingly, animals fed with HFD for 35 days prior to the experiment, although exhibiting high to normal NAPE concentrations at baseline, were unable to induce secretion postprandially and even showed a significant reduction in circulating NAPE during the postmeal interval (Figure 6A). Despite this derangement in NAPE synthesis and/or secretion after fat feeding, the chronically high fat-fed animals remained responsive to the anorectic effects of C16:0 NAPE in separate feeding studies (Figure 6B). Finally, we examined whether chronic C16:0 NAPE administration would have an effect on energy balance and food intake in a multiday experiment. We infused vehicle or C16:0 NAPE (0.07 mg/kg/min) intravenously in chronically catheterized free-ranging rats while recording daily food intake and body weight. After 5 days of treatment, we found that cumulative food intake in the NAPE-treated rats was reduced by approximately 30% compared to the vehicle infused rats (Figures 7A and 7C) and that the consequence of this hypophagia was significant weight loss in the NAPE group without any other behavioral changes (Figure 7B). Because dietary fat is the most obesity-promoting macronutrient, it has been identified as an important causal factor in the obesity epidemic (Donahoo et al., 2008Donahoo W. Wyatt H.R. Kriehn J. Stuht J. Dong F. Hosokawa P. Grunwald G.K. Johnson S.L. Peters J.C. Hill J.O. Dietary fat increases energy intake across the range of typical consumption in the United States.Obesity (Silver Spring). 2008; 16: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the processes by which dietary fat intake is regulated and how these mechanisms malfunction in our modern environment may lead to new therapeutic options for the treatment of obesity. In this paper, we present data suggesting that circulating NAPEs may be involved in the physiologic regulation of dietary fat intake. In contrast to peptide mediators of satiety or satiation like CCK and GLP-1 that are released by endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract in response to multiple types of ingested of macronutrients (Little et al., 2007Little T.J. Horowitz M. Feinle-Bisset C. Modulation by high-fat diets of gastrointestinal function and hormones associated with the regulation of energy intake: Implications for the pathophysiology of obesity.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2007; 86: 531-541PubMed Google Scholar), we found that secretion of NAPEs into plasma and lymph requires the consumption of dietary lipid. Because NAPE levels are unchanged in the stomach and large intestine with nutrient intake, and because studies using labeled precursors have shown that intestinal tissues readily synthesize NAPE (Rodriguez de Fonseca et al., 2001Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gomez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodriguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. et al.An anorexic lipid mediator regulated by feeding.Nature. 2001; 414: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, Petersen et al., 2006Petersen G. Sorensen C. Schmid P.C. Artmann A. Tang-Christensen M. Hansen S.H. Larsen P.J. Schmid H.H.O. Hansen H.S. Intestinal levels of anandamide and oleoylethanolamide in food-deprived rats are regulated through their precursors.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 143-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these data suggest that the small intestine is the major source for the increase in lymph and plasma NAPEs seen under these conditions of fat feeding. When administered systemically to rats and mice, C16:0 NAPE reduced food intake in a dose-responsive fashion. Importantly, a 100 mg/kg i.p. dose of C16:0 NAPE caused significant reduction in food intake while increasing plasma NAPE levels to a similar extent as that observed after intraduodenal lipid infusion. This suggests that the reduction in food intake at this dose is physiologic and that NAPE generation and secretion into circulation may be one means by which the gut conveys information about lipid availability in the digestive tract to the central nervous system, likely in concert with increased NAE signaling in the small intestine (Fu et al., 2007Fu J. Astarita G. Gaetani S. Kim J. Cravatt B.F. Mackie K. Piomelli D. Food intake regulates oleoylethanolamide formation and degradation in the proximal small intestine.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1518-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our finding that NAPEs circulate in plasma at much higher concentrations than NAEs (low μM versus low nM range) may explain why many of the targets activated by NAEs, including the anorexigenic G protein-coupled receptor GPR119, require apparently supraphysiological concentrations of NAE ligand to respond (Overton et al., 2006Overton H.A. Babbs A.J. Doel S.M. Fyfe M.C. Gardner L.S. Griffin G. Jackson H.C. Procter M.J. Rasamison C.M. Tang-Christensen M. et al.Deorphanization of a G protein-coupled receptor for oleoylethanolamide and its use in the discovery of small-molecule hypophagic agents.Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 167-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). If NAPEs can also activate these receptors, then this apparent paradox might be resolved. It is also important to note that at 100 mg/kg or 250 mg/kg, C16:0 NAPE did not cause conditioned taste aversion, a behavioral response elicited in experimental animals by compounds that cause nausea or general malaise, supporting the possibility that NAPE is a physiologic regulator of food intake. However, because intraperitoneal, but not intravenous, NAPE treatment can produce transient, nonaversive postural changes in rats, but not mice, during the immediate postinjection period, the latter mode of administration is preferable and most physiologic. Regardless, both routes of administration had the same net effect on food intake and energy balance. An unexpected result of this study was that ob/ob mice were more sensitive than wild-type animals to the anorectic effects of C16:0 NAPE. Although no definitive explanation for this effect yet exists, one might speculate that leptin may be a permissive signal for NAPE generation or that, similar to our chronically high-fat fed rats, NAPE secretion in response to dietary lipid may be blunted in these mice, thus augmenting their sensitivity to exogenous C16:0 NAPE administration. Because 20:4 NAPE is the precursor of the NAE anandamide (AEA), a CB1 receptor agonist, we tested C16:0 NAPE in the CB1−/− mouse and found that its overnight food intake was reduced to a similar extent to that of wild-type mice treated with an equivalent dose of NAPE, indicating that the anorectic effects of NAPE are independent of the CB1 receptor. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that CB-type signaling mediates some of NAPE's effects in light of the recent report that GPR55, an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, is potently activated by both PEA, the hydrolysis product of C16:0 NAPE, and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Ryberg et al., 2007Ryberg E. Larsson N. Sjogren S. Hjorth S. Hermansson N.O. Leonova J. Elebring T. Nilsson K. Drmota T. Greasley P.J. The orphan receptor GPR55 is a novel cannabinoid receptor.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 152: 1092-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). This potential overlap with cannabinoid signaling raises interesting questions about the possible involvement of NAPE, or NAPE metabolites, in mediating the rewarding properties of dietary lipid. However, neither direct infusion of PEA into the lateral ventricle nor the pharmacologic elevation of all NAEs in the CNS by inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), their catabolic enzyme, affected food intake. Several of our observations suggest that NAPE may reduce food intake by direct interaction with uncharacterized targets in the central nervous system. First, we found that C16:0 NAPE infusion into the lateral ventricle of cannulated mice, at far lower doses than used in the periphery (75 μg i.c.v. versus 100 to 1000 mg/kg i.p.), significantly reduced food intake relative to i.c.v. injections of an isovolumetric bolus of Liposyn II or an isomolar quantity of phosphatidylethanolamine. Second, elimination of nervous afferents to the brain from the gastrointestinal tract by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy did not block the anorectic effects of NAPE. And, finally, intravenous 14C-labeled C16:0 NAPE entered the brain and preferentially accumulated in the hypothalamus. In the ARC, we found that NAPE treatment reduced fasting-dependent induction of the immediate-early gene cFOS, which is commonly used as an indirect marker of neuronal activity. A simple interpretation of these data is that NAPE treatment blocks the stimulatory effect t"

https://openalex.org/W2017068376,"In zebrafish — as in humans and other vertebrates — hearing and balance are mediated by mechanical sensors in the inner ear. These sensors consist of biomineralized composite crystals, called otoliths. Colantonio et al. use in vivo video microscopy of zebrafish embryos to show that fluid flow generated by cilia influences the number, growth and localization of otoliths, as well as their mineralization during development. Gene-knockdown with 'morpholino' antisense oligonucleotides shows that the dynein regulatory complex is required for cilium motility. Thus cilia-driven flow appears to be a key epigenetic factor in controlling otolith biomineralization, and dynein regulatory complex subunits emerge as candidates for disease genes for ciliopathies in humans. In teleosts, proper balance and hearing depend on mechanical sensors in the inner ear. These sensors include actin-based microvilli and microtubule-based cilia that extend from the surface of sensory hair cells and attach to biomineralized 'ear stones', orotoliths. This paper show that in zebra fish, fluid flow generated by cilia influences the number, growth and localization of otoliths, as well as their mineralization during development. In teleosts, proper balance and hearing depend on mechanical sensors in the inner ear. These sensors include actin-based microvilli and microtubule-based cilia that extend from the surface of sensory hair cells and attach to biomineralized ‘ear stones’ (or otoliths)1. Otolith number, size and placement are under strict developmental control, but the mechanisms that ensure otolith assembly atop specific cells of the sensory epithelium are unclear. Here we demonstrate that cilia motility is required for normal otolith assembly and localization. Using in vivo video microscopy, we show that motile tether cilia at opposite poles of the otic vesicle create fluid vortices that attract otolith precursor particles, thereby biasing an otherwise random distribution to direct localized otolith seeding on tether cilia. Independent knockdown of subunits for the dynein regulatory complex and outer-arm dynein disrupt cilia motility, leading to defective otolith biogenesis. These results demonstrate a requirement for the dynein regulatory complex in vertebrates and show that cilia-driven flow is a key epigenetic factor in controlling otolith biomineralization."

To achieve this goal, we developed a real-time imaging system that captures the transitions in fate, generating neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes from single CNS stem cells in vitro. In the presence of bFGF, tripotent cells normally produce specified progenitors through a bipotent intermediate cell type. Surprisingly, the tripotent state is reset at each passage. The cytokine CNTF is thought to instruct multipotent cells to an astrocytic fate. We demonstrate that CNTF both directs astrogliogenesis from tripotent cells, bypassing two of the three normal bipotent intermediates, and later promotes the expansion of specified astrocytic progenitors. These results show how discrete cell types emerge from a multipotent cell and provide a strong basis for future studies to determine the molecular basis of fate specification.

In spite of the great interest in the developmental potential of mammalian stem cells, there are very few studies where the precise logic and timing of fate choice has been defined. The presence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) was first suggested by the ability of stem cells to form clonal colonies in the spleen and to reconstitute the murine hematopoietic system (Till et al., 1964Till J.E. McCulloch E.A. Siminovitch L. A Stochastic Model of Stem Cell Proliferation, Based on the Growth of Spleen Colony-Forming Cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1964; 51: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Immunosorting and functional reconstitution supports a developmental hierarchy in which stem cells generate terminal fates through discrete intermediate progenitors (Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M.

However, many fundamental aspects of how HSCs generate terminal fates are still unresolved. These include the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic factors and the precise timing of the events in the commitment of HSCs to different fates (Ogawa, 1993Ogawa M. Differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 1993; 81: 2844-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A complete stem cell lineage remains to be determined for the hematopoietic system or any other mammalian tissue. In vitro cultures of telencephalic cortical neural stem cells give rise to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Davis and Temple, 1994Davis A.A. Temple S.

Single factors direct the differentiation of stem cells from the fetal and adult central nervous system.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3129-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Maintenance of the undifferentiated stem/progenitor cell is a significant unresolved issue in developmental biology and medicine. Lineage analysis of cells from the developing mouse telencephalon suggests that a cell-intrinsic asymmetric process regulates self-renewal and the production of discrete neuronal classes (Qian et al., 2000Qian X. Shen Q. Goderie S.K. He W. Capela A. Davis A.A. Temple S.

The timing of cortical neurogenesis is encoded within lineages of individual progenitor cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The lineage path from a single neural stem/progenitor cell to the production of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes has never been established. The aim of this work is to define the discrete steps in producing a complex cell population from a single cultured cell. The technical challenges of long-term imaging in vivo prohibit the acquisition of complete lineages. The advantage of working on in vitro cultured samples is that direct access to each cell in a lineage may be possible. Further, the wide use of cultured CNS stem cells in research requires the accurate definition of changes in cell state through time. Most cell-based therapeutic applications will require expansion of primary cells in culture before grafting. For these reasons, it is critical to define the progression in cell state for cultured primary neural stem cells. We developed an in vitro system that allows analysis of the transitions in fate from multipotent CNS stem cells to differentiated neurons and glia. The system includes a novel live-cell chamber, a method to restrict migration to the visual field and a methodology to determine the points of fate specification. In this work, we refer to cells that produce only one cell type as specified rather than committed (Slack, 1991Slack J.M.W. From Egg To Embryo.Second Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1991Crossref Google Scholar). We find that multipotent precursor (stem) cells are normally specified into discrete fates through the three possible bipotent intermediates that give rise to neurons+astrocytes (NA), neurons+oligodendrocytes (NO), and astrocytes+oligodendrocytes (AO). Using CNTF, a ligand widely used to produce astrocytes from neural stem cells, we show that instructive and selective effects regulate discrete intermediate cell types in astrogliogenesis. CNTF instructs tripotent cells to the astrocytic fate directly, bypassing the NA and AO bipotent intermediates, and later, CNTF promotes selective expansion of astrocytic precursors. These results demonstrate that through complete lineage analysis, discrete cell types and transitions can be measured. The response of multipotent cells to environmental variables indicates that the mechanisms that specify distinct fates within the same cell are differentially sensitive. To obtain control cell lineages, we followed the development of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes from single primary neural stem/progenitor cells derived from the embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) rat telencephalon using time-lapse imaging. The rationale for developing a system around the E14.5 rat telencephalon is that significant numbers of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes can be derived from single cells in clonal assays from this developmental stage (Johe et al., 1996Johe K.K. Hazel T.G. Muller T. Dugich-Djordjevic M.M. McKay R.D. Single factors direct the differentiation of stem cells from the fetal and adult central nervous system.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3129-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). In the few previous studies that derive functional neurons from CNS stem cells, most required an astrocytic support cell (Blondel et al., 2000Blondel O. Collin C. McCarran W.J. Zhu S. Zamostiano R.

Neurotrophins induce formation of functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses between cultured hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7256-7271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the production of functional neurons, we used a strategy where CNS stem cells were plated and expanded in DMEM/F12 with the N2 supplement (hereafter referred to as N2) in the presence of bFGF for 3 days. Cell-cycle withdrawal was initiated by removing bFGF and culturing cells for 2 days in the absence of bFGF. Neuronal maturation was stimulated by growing cells for 3 days in Neurobasal media with the B-27 supplement, neurotrophin 3 (NT3), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Using voltage-clamp recording (Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we showed that this condition promotes excitable currents in 87% of the cells with neuronal morphology without the need for exogenous astrocytes or serum (Figure S1 and Table S1). These conditions that support functional neuronal differentiation are used as control conditions throughout this work. To image the specification of progenitor cell types, we developed a culture chamber that controls media and gas exchange over the microscope stage, emulating the environment in a tissue-culture incubator (Figure S2 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures; U.S. Patent Number 7,091,035). Imaging every 2 minutes with a 40× oil immersion objective gave sufficient time and space resolution for complete lineage analysis. In total, this work is based upon the complete lineages from 326 founder cells. Manual tracking of these founders produced lineages for a total of 7269 cells after expansion and differentiation. Figure 1A shows single frames taken from 4,860 images (Movie S1). The low frequency of cell loss due to migration out of the visual field was achieved by restricted growth areas (Figure S3; U.S. Patent Number 7,276,367). Epifluorescence from conjugated fibronectin shows this area in the first panel that is outlined at day 4. This area contains 4 cells at the beginning of the recording (12 hr after plating) and 43 cells 7 days later when cell identity was established using immunoreactivity and morphology (last panel in Figure 1A). Cells with unambiguous oligodendrocytic morphology that die before fixation are labeled as oligodendrocytes. The lineage dendrogram in Figure 1B is derived from analysis of Movie S1. By marking the terminal leaves on the lineage tree with colors that represent discrete fates, one observes a clustering of common fate among closely related cells (Figure 1B). The observation that terminal cells derived from a common ancestor share the same fate could reflect early specification of the ancestor or a random series of coincident events. To address these competing hypotheses, we developed a statistical hypothesis testing procedure that uses terminal cell fates and mitosis times to calculate the probability that the distribution of same-fate siblings is random or nonrandom throughout the entire period of culture. Applying this test to the last time point in the experiment, we found that the occurrence of same-fate siblings is not random. Testing earlier time points, we identified the time at which the average probability of same-fate siblings becomes nonrandom (p > 0.05). This point is marked with an asterisk in Figure 1B (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). This early specification of fate was validated by multiple approaches described below. Based on this statistical evidence, we retrospectively labeled cells as specified if they give rise to only one cell type. Parent cells are labeled with the fate of their daughters if both daughter cells share the same fate (Figure 1C). If siblings do not share the same fate, then the parent cell is labeled as unspecified. Lost and unstained cells are treated as alternative known fates. If two siblings die, then the parent is specified as a dying cell. However, if a single daughter cell dies, then the parent is specified by the fate of the surviving daughter. This decision is justified because the majority of dying cells in control lineages occur in later generations when sibling cells normally share the same fate (shown later in Figure 4A). Figure 1D is derived from Figure 1B using retrospective annotation. A consequence of annotating lineages with this rule is that the point of specification can be identified by the transition from black to color (Figure 1D). This point correlates well with the time when sibling cell fates become statistically nonrandom (asterisk in Figure 1D). In Figure 1D, Cell 1 is annotated as a specified oligodendroglial progenitor since it produces four generations of cells which, beside two early deaths, are all identified as oligodendrocytes. Cells 2 and 3 each produce three cell types, and cell 4 produces two terminal cell types within three generations. This typical example of four cells from one experiment demonstrates the high degree of heterogeneity in CNS stem cell cultures. The emergence of specified (colored) cells and their positions are depicted in Figure 1E. The time-lapse representation in Movie S2 shows again the spatial and temporal appearance of specified cells. The control group contains lineages from 35 founders that produced 897 terminal cells. The fate distribution was 34% neurons, 28% astrocytes, and 19% oligodendrocytes. Five percent did not express detectable levels of lineage specific antigens, 6% were lost, and 8% died. If cells are classified as unspecified or specified, three discrete temporal phases of cell division emerge (Figure S4A). At early times, unspecified cells divide to produce more unspecified cells. Later, divisions occur where one daughter is specified and the other is not. Subsequently, the culture is dominated by the expansion of specified cells. By plotting the cumulative number of cells of each fate through generations, the onset of specification of the neuronal, astroglial, and oligodendroglial lineages is seen to be early and synchronous (Figure S4B). Note that the cells were maintained in the presence of bFGF up to generation four, demonstrating that specification to the unipotent state occurs while cells are dividing in the presence of mitogen. Day 2 in Figure S4C is equivalent to generation 4 in Figure S4B. Fate specification begins by generation 3 to 4 (day 2). Most cells express fate-specific epitopes only after several days of differentiation (day 5 for neurons and day 6 for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, Figure S4C). Thus, the time of specification precedes the appearance of fate-specific epitopes by 2 to 3 days. To assess the potency of unspecified cells, each was assigned a potency reflecting the terminal descendants it generates (Figure 2A). This representation is shown in Figure 2A for the same lineage as in Figure 1. A summary of all this control data demonstrates that at the beginning of imaging, 57% of the cells are tripotent (black diamonds), 31% are bipotent (open circles), and 11% are already unipotent (open triangles; Figure 2B). Within three generations, the proportion of tripotent cells falls to less than 10%. These data show, in a statistically robust manner, that rapid loss of tripotency is concurrent with a transient increase in the bipotent population. Later, a stable increase in the unipotent population dominates. Withdrawal of the mitogen bFGF is thought to induce fate choice (Cattaneo and McKay, 1990Cattaneo E. McKay R. Proliferation and differentiation of neuronal stem cells regulated by nerve growth factor.Nature. 1990; 347: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). However, at this point (generation 4), 80% of the cells are already specified into a single fate. These data demonstrate that cell-fate specification occurs in dividing cells in the presence of bFGF. To confirm the conclusion that cultured CNS stem cells are specified in the presence of bFGF, we cultured cells in the presence of bFGF for an additional 2 days. We achieved the additional days of culture by reducing cell density through random laser ablation at the normal time of bFGF withdrawal (Figure 2C; Figure S5; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). According to control lineage data at the time of bFGF withdrawal (control generation 3), the population is estimated to have 6% tripotent cells, 49% bipotent cells, and 42% unipotent cells. Lineages for 43 founder cells after ablation show that the surviving cells were 5% tripotent, 44% bipotent, and 51% unipotent at the first time point (Figure 2C). The potency distribution immediately after ablation almost perfectly overlaps with the potency distribution at the relevant point in the control population in Figure 2B, despite continued cell division in the ablation experiment in the presence of bFGF. These data demonstrate that cells are specified with the same kinetics whether cultured for 2 1/2 days or 4 1/2 days in the presence of bFGF. The apparent potency of a cell is related to the number of progeny produced by the cell; a true tripotent cell that divides only once to produce two specified cells would, at most, appear as a bipotent cell. If apparent bipotent cells were given the opportunity to make additional cell divisions in the presence of bFGF, their actual potency might be revealed. The laser ablation results demonstrate that apparent potency is not a consequence of limited cell divisions and that cell-fate specification occurs in the presence of bFGF. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that most neural progenitors remain multipotent through passage (Johe et al., 1996Johe K.K. Hazel T.G. Muller T. Dugich-Djordjevic M.M. McKay R.D. Single factors direct the differentiation of stem cells from the fetal and adult central nervous system.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3129-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Lineages established after the third passage show that after passage 3, 42% of the population is tripotent (Figure 2D). Although the kinetics of fate restriction differ slightly in passage 3 compared to passage 1, the two populations resemble one another both in proportion and progression of fate restriction. The frequency of tripotent cells is less than 2% after four generations in the presence of bFGF (Figure 2B). As cells are normally passaged every 2 to 3 days (equivalent to 4–6 generations), the size of the tripotent population is expected to be near zero at this time. The high frequency of tripotent cells at passage 3 (Figure 2D) could be a consequence of selection for multipotent rather than specified cells through passage. To determine the feasibility of the selection hypothesis, we calculated passage efficiency by directly counting cells before, during, and 2 hr after passage from passage 1 through passage 3. The plating efficiency at each passage is 0.8. If there was strong selection in favor of the tripotent cell at passage, then the maximum proportion of tripotent cells after the third passage would be 2% × 1/0.8 = 2.5%. After passage three, the tripotent population is 42%, showing that selection at passage cannot explain the persistence of the multipotent state through time. These data suggest that passage resets cells to a more primitive state. To more precisely define changes as multipotent cells become specified, we measured the types of transitions between parent cells and their progeny. Using results from 20 tripotent founder cells and eight bipotent founder cells, we tabulated the number of events generating new tripotent, bipotent, and unipotent cells at each generation in 50 tripotent cells, 174 bipotent cells, and 244 unipotent cells represented across seven generations (Figure 2E). Self-renewal of a tripotent cell is common early but diminishes rapidly through generation. After the first division, the most common product of a tripotent cell is a bipotent cell. Likewise, bipotent cells show a short phase of self renewal and rapidly switch to the production of unipotent cells. This network of changing states shows that tripotent cells almost always become specified through bipotent intermediates. Statistical analysis of observed and expected numbers of tripotent, bipotent, and unipotent cells supports the nonrandom transition from tripotent to bipotent and bipotent to unipotent cell types (Figure S6). The expression of CD15 has been proposed as a tool for prospective isolation of stem cells from the adult and fetal brain (Capela and Temple, 2002Capela A. Temple S.

CD15 is coexpressed with CD133, and both epitopes have been used to perform fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) isolation of multipotent neural progenitors (Capela and Temple, 2002Capela A.

USA. 2000; 97: 14720-14725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). We found a weak correlation between CD15 expression and loss of potency at the population level; however, no correlation was seen between CD15 expression and founder cell potency or the number of progeny derived from individual cells (Supplemental Data and Figure S7). The lack of correlation between early CD15 expression and potency or proliferative capacity in single lineages prompts cautious interpretation of the expression of surface epitopes without a precise lineage analysis. To determine when fate choice can be modified by exogenous signals, cells were exposed to CNTF. This ligand has been widely used to study astrocytic fate choice and differentiation (Barnabe-Heider et al., 2005Barnabe-Heider F. Wasylnka J.A. Fernandes K.J. Porsche C. Sendtner M. Kaplan D.R.

Figure 3A outlines the experimental design for CNTF treatment. To determine the change in plasticity through time, control media was supplemented continuously with CNTF either 3 hr before (CNTF−3; 32 founder cells) or 24 hr after initiating imaging (CNTF+24; 43 founder cells). Exposure to CNTF promotes the production of astrocytes that express high levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Figure 3B). This endpoint image demonstrates that the field is dominated by GFAP-positive astrocytes but also contains several neurons. Figure 3C shows a representative lineage of rat CNS stem cells treated continuously with CNTF. The most striking change in the CNTF-treated lineage is seen in the late expansion of specified astrocytes (compare Figures 3C and 1D). To quantify the response of different cell populations to CNTF, we calculated the number of tripotent and type of bipotent and unipotent cells at each generation with and without CNTF treatment. All values shown were normalized to the 35 founder cells lineaged in the control population. CNTF treatment increased the number of dying progenitors (Figure 4A). In control cultures, every neuron and astrocyte was unambiguously classified by marker expression and morphology. In CNTF+24 cultures, low numbers of cells coexpressed both astrocytic and neuronal markers with an ambiguous morphology. In CNTF−3 treated cells, there was a significant increase in the number of double-stained cells accounting for 3% of the total cells from CNTF−3 lineages (Figure 4B). This new cell population was scored as a separate fate. Lineage analysis showed that the tripotent population was slightly reduced in CNTF+24 and significantly reduced in CNTF−3 lineages (Figure 4C). This might be expected from the larger number of tripotent cells available to respond at −3 hr. Notice that a significant difference from the control occurs in the CNTF+24 lineage only after generation 3, consistent with the later addition of CNTF. These data show that CNTF treatment clearly reduces the number of tripotent cells (Figure 4C). The number of NA and AO cells was also reduced, but there was a lesser effect on the NO populations (Figures 4D, 4E, and 4F). The analysis of unipotent cell types shows reduced numbers of neurons and oligodendrocytes (Figures 4G and 4H). In contrast, the production of astrocytes was enhanced (Figure 4I). One explanation for the reduced NAO, NA, and AO populations and increase in the astrocytic population would be that tripotent cells are directly specified as astrocytes, bypassing the normal bipotent intermediates. Increased astrocytic output from NA and AO cells might provide an alternative explanation for increased astrocyte numbers. To resolve these possibilities, a database was constructed that reports every transition from tri-, bi-, and unipotent parent to tri-, bi-, and unipotent daughter cell at each generation. These data were used to define the frequency of each possible cell-fate transition. The number of transitions from one generation to the next is plotted and, as we are comparing different experiments, the data were normalized to the number of cells in the control. The CNTF+24 and CNTF−3 treatments reduce the number of transitions from NAO to NA and AO (the bipotent cells that give rise to astrocytes) (Figures 5A and 5B). In contrast, the transition from NAO parent to NO daughter was unaffected by either CNTF treatment (Figure 5C). The production of astrocytes from NA and AO cells was reduced by CNTF treatment (Figure 5D). Therefore, the increased numbers of astrocytes must be caused by events that occur prior to establishing the bipotent state. The same analysis demonstrates that NAO to A transitions are significantly increased by CNTF treatment (Figure 5E). The late proliferative effect of CNTF contributes most of the increased numbers of astrocytes seen at the end of the differentiation period (Figure 5F). These data summarized in Figure 5G show that the increase in astrocytes induced by CNTF is caused by two distinct cellular mechanisms: an early instructive and a later selective effect. The early positive proastrocytic effect on tripotent NAO cells is a remarkable feature of these data. The probability of transitions from the NAO to bipotent states was modified in an interesting way by CNTF treatment. The number of NO progeny was unaffected, but fewer NA and AO cells were generated when increased numbers of A cells were produced. In the CNTF-treated condition, the probability that bipotent cells produce astrocytes was also altered. Surprisingly, the probability of astrocyte production from bipotent cells was reduced. These data show that CNTF exerts both positive and negative instructive effects on astrocytic fates. There is a strong positive effect on the tripotent, and a negative effect on bipo"
https://openalex.org/W2068182875,"A defining feature of basal-like breast cancer, a breast cancer subtype with poor clinical prognosis, is the high expression of ‘proliferation signature’ genes. We identified B-Myb, a MYB family transcription factor that is often amplified and overexpressed in many tumor types, as being highly expressed in the proliferation signature. However, the roles of B-Myb in disease progression, and its mammary-specific transcriptional targets, are poorly understood. Here, we showed that B-Myb expression is a significant predictor of survival and pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. We also identified a significant association between the G/G genotype of a nonsynonymous B-Myb germline variant (rs2070235, S427G) and an increased risk of basal-like breast cancer [OR 2.0, 95% CI (1.1–3.8)]. In immortalized, human mammary epithelial cell lines, but not in basal-like tumor lines, cells ectopically expressing wild-type B-Myb or the S427G variant showed increased sensitivity to two DNA topoisomerase IIα inhibitors, but not to other chemotherapeutics. In addition, microarray analyses identified many G2/M genes as being induced in B-Myb overexpressing cells. These results confirm that B-Myb is involved in cell cycle control, and that its dysregulation may contribute to increased sensitivity to a specific class of chemotherapeutic agents. These data provide insight into the influence of B-Myb in human breast cancer, which is of potential clinical importance for determining disease risk and for guiding treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1971490023,"To explore how gene products, required for the initiation of synaptic growth, move from the cell body of the sensory neuron to its presynaptic terminals, and from the cell body of the motor neuron to its postsynaptic dendritic spines, we have investigated the anterograde transport machinery in both the sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia. We found that the induction of long-term facilitation (LTF) by repeated applications of serotonin, a modulatory transmitter released during learning in Aplysia, requires upregulation of kinesin heavy chain (KHC) in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Indeed, upregulation of KHC in the presynaptic neurons alone is sufficient for the induction of LTF. However, KHC is not required for the persistence of LTF. Thus, in addition to transcriptional activation in the nucleus and local protein synthesis at the synapse, our studies have identified a third component critical for long-term learning-related plasticity: the coordinated upregulation of kinesin-mediated transport."
https://openalex.org/W2088141795,"Analysing the pathogenic mechanisms of a bacterium requires an understanding of the composition of the bacterial cell surface. The bacterial surface provides the first barrier against innate immune mechanisms as well as mediating attachment to cells/surfaces to resist clearance. We utilised a series of Klebsiella pneumoniae mutants in which the two major polysaccharide layers, capsule and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were absent or truncated, to investigate the ability of these layers to protect against innate immune mechanisms and to associate with eukaryotic cells. The capsule alone was found to be essential for resistance to complement mediated killing while both capsule and LPS were involved in cell-association, albeit through different mechanisms. The capsule impeded cell-association while the LPS saccharides increased cell-association in a non-specific manner. The electrohydrodynamic characteristics of the strains suggested the differing interaction of each bacterial strain with eukaryotic cells could be partly explained by the charge density displayed by the outermost polysaccharide layer. This highlights the importance of considering not only specific adhesin:ligand interactions commonly studied in adherence assays but also the initial non-specific interactions governed largely by the electrostatic interaction forces."
https://openalex.org/W2017871741,"Most, perhaps all cells in epithelial sheets are polarized in the plane of the sheet. This type of polarity, referred to as planar cell polarity (PCP), can be expressed in the orientation of cilia and stereocilia, in oriented outgrowths such as hairs, in the plane of cell division, in directed cell movement and possibly in the orientation of axon extension1,2. Another popular area in current research is growth: there is an attempt to find systems that fix the shape and size of organs. Although both polarity and growth are subject to overall control by morphogen gradients3, the mechanisms of this control are almost completely unknown. Here we discuss recent evidence for a 'steepness hypothesis' that links these two apparently disconnected features of animal development."
https://openalex.org/W2074338643,"Background The ubiquitous bacterial trans-translation is one of the most studied quality control mechanisms. Trans-translation requires two specific factors, a small RNA SsrA (tmRNA) and a protein co-factor SmpB, to promote the release of ribosomes stalled on defective mRNAs and to add a specific tag sequence to aberrant polypeptides to direct them to degradation pathways. Helicobacter pylori is a pathogen persistently colonizing a hostile niche, the stomach of humans. Principal Findings We investigated the role of trans-translation in this bacterium well fitted to resist stressful conditions and found that both smpB and ssrA were essential genes. Five mutant versions of ssrA were generated in H. pylori in order to investigate the function of trans-translation in this organism. Mutation of the resume codon that allows the switch of template of the ribosome required for its release was essential in vivo, however a mutant in which this codon was followed by stop codons interrupting the tag sequence was viable. Therefore one round of translation is sufficient to promote the rescue of stalled ribosomes. A mutant expressing a truncated SsrA tag was viable in H. pylori, but affected in competence and tolerance to both oxidative and antibiotic stresses. This demonstrates that control of protein degradation through trans-translation is by itself central in the management of stress conditions and of competence and supports a regulatory role of trans-translation-dependent protein tagging. In addition, the expression of smpB and ssrA was found to be induced upon acid exposure of H. pylori. Conclusions We conclude to a central role of trans-translation in H. pylori both for ribosome rescue possibly due to more severe stalling and for protein degradation to recover from stress conditions frequently encountered in the gastric environment. Finally, the essential trans-translation machinery of H. pylori is an excellent specific target for the development of novel antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1986277343,"Background Although the lymphatic system arises as an extension of venous vessels in the embryo, little is known about the role of circulating progenitors in the maintenance or development of lymphatic endothelium. Here, we investigated whether hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the potential to give rise to lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). Methodology/Principal Findings Following the transfer of marked HSCs into irradiated recipients, donor-derived LEC that co-express the lymphatic endothelial markers Lyve-1 and VEGFR-3 were identified in several tissues. HSC-derived LEC persisted for more than 12 months and contributed to ∼3–4% of lymphatic vessels. Donor-derived LECs were not detected in mice transplanted with common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors, suggesting that myeloid lineage commitment is not a requisite step in HSC contribution to lymphatic endothelium. Analysis of parabiotic mice revealed direct evidence for the existence of functional, circulating lymphatic progenitors in the absence of acute injury. Furthermore, the transplantation of HSCs into ApcMin/+ mice resulted in the incorporation of donor-derived LEC into the lymphatic vessels of spontaneously arising intestinal tumors. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that HSCs can contribute to normal and tumor associated lymphatic endothelium. These findings suggest that the modification of HSCs may be a novel approach for targeting tumor metastasis and attenuating diseases of the lymphatic system."
https://openalex.org/W2058397964,"Archaeal methane formation from methylamines is initiated by distinct methyltransferases with specificity for monomethylamine, dimethylamine, or trimethylamine. Each methylamine methyltransferase methylates a cognate corrinoid protein, which is subsequently demethylated by a second methyltransferase to form methyl-coenzyme M, the direct methane precursor. Methylation of the corrinoid protein requires reduction of the central cobalt to the highly reducing and nucleophilic Co(I) state. RamA, a 60-kDa monomeric iron-sulfur protein, was isolated from Methanosarcina barkeri and is required for in vitro ATP-dependent reductive activation of methylamine:CoM methyl transfer from all three methylamines. In the absence of the methyltransferases, highly purified RamA was shown to mediate the ATP-dependent reductive activation of Co(II) corrinoid to the Co(I) state for the monomethylamine corrinoid protein, MtmC. The ramA gene is located near a cluster of genes required for monomethylamine methyltransferase activity, including MtbA, the methylamine-specific CoM methylase and the pyl operon required for co-translational insertion of pyrrolysine into the active site of methylamine methyltransferases. RamA possesses a C-terminal ferredoxin-like domain capable of binding two tetranuclear iron-sulfur proteins. Mutliple ramA homologs were identified in genomes of methanogenic Archaea, often encoded near methyltrophic methyltransferase genes. RamA homologs are also encoded in a diverse selection of bacterial genomes, often located near genes for corrinoid-dependent methyltransferases. These results suggest that RamA mediates reductive activation of corrinoid proteins and that it is the first functional archetype of COG3894, a family of redox proteins of unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W2062613275,"Aurora B kinase plays essential roles in mitosis and cytokinesis in eukaryotes. In the procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei, the Aurora B homolog TbAUK1 regulates mitosis and cytokinesis, phosphorylates the Tousled-like kinase TbTLK1, interacts with two mitotic kinesins TbKIN-A and TbKIN-B and forms a novel chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) with two novel proteins TbCPC1 and TbCPC2. Here we show with time-lapse video microscopy the time course of CPC trans-localization from the spindle midzone in late anaphase to the dorsal side of the cell where the anterior end of daughter cell is tethered, and followed by a glide toward the posterior end to divide the cell, representing a novel mode of cytokinesis in eukaryotes. The three subunits of CPC, TbKIN-B and TbTLK1 interact with one another suggesting a close association among the five proteins. An ablation of TbTLK1 inhibited the subsequent trans-localization of CPC and TbKIN-B, whereas a knockdown of CPC or TbKIN-B disrupted the spindle pole localization of TbTLK1 during mitosis. In the bloodstream form of T. brucei, the five proteins also play essential roles in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis and display subcellular localization patterns similar to that in the procyclic form. The CPC in bloodstream form also undergoes a trans-localization during cytokinesis similar to that in the procyclic form. All together, our results indicate that the five-protein complex CPC-TbTLK1-TbKIN-B plays key roles in regulating chromosome segregation in the early phase of mitosis and that the highly unusual mode of cytokinesis mediated by CPC occurs in both forms of trypanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2008547371,"Helicobacter pylori persistently colonizes the gastric mucosa of half the human population. It is one of the most genetically diverse bacterial organisms and subvariants are continuously emerging within an H. pylori population. In this study we characterized a number of single-colony isolates from H. pylori communities in various environmental settings, namely persistent human gastric infection, in vitro bacterial subcultures on agar medium, and experimental in vivo infection in mice. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen chain revealed considerable phenotypic diversity between individual cells in the studied bacterial communities, as demonstrated by size variable O-antigen chains and different levels of Lewis glycosylation. Absence of high-molecular-weight O-antigen chains was notable in a number of experimentally passaged isolates in vitro and in vivo. This phenotype was not evident in bacteria obtained from a human gastric biopsy, where all cells expressed high-molecular-weight O-antigen chains, which thus may be the preferred phenotype for H. pylori colonizing human gastric mucosa. Genotypic variability was monitored in the two genes encoding alpha1,3-fucosyltransferases, futA and futB, that are involved in Lewis antigen expression. Genetic modifications that could be attributable to recombination events within and between the two genes were commonly detected and created a diversity, which together with phase variation, contributed to divergent LPS expression. Our data suggest that the surrounding environment imposes a selective pressure on H. pylori to express certain LPS phenotypes. Thus, the milieu in a host will select for bacterial variants with particular characteristics that facilitate adaptation and survival in the gastric mucosa of that individual, and will shape the bacterial community structure."
https://openalex.org/W2151685743,"Recent studies have demonstrated essential functions for KIF3, a microtubule-directed protein motor, in subcellular transport of several cancer-related proteins, including the β-catenin–cadherin(s) complex. In this study, we report identification of the protein-phosphatase Dusp26 as a novel regulator of the KIF3 motor. Here we undertake yeast two-hybrid screening and identify Kif3a, a motor subunit of the KIF3 heterotrimeric complex, as a novel Dusp26-binding protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments revealed that Dusp26 associates not only with Kif3a, but also with Kap3, another subunit of the KIF3 complex. Dephosphorylation experiments in vitro and analysis using mutant forms of Dusp26 in intact cells strongly suggested that Dusp26 is recruited to the KIF3 motor mainly by interaction with Kif3a, and thereby dephosphorylates Kap3. Forced expression of Dusp26, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, promoted distribution of β-catenin/N-cadherin, an established KIF3 cargo, to cell–cell junction sites, resulting in increased cell–cell adhesiveness. We also showed that Dusp26 mRNA expression was downregulated in human glioblastoma samples. These results suggest previously unidentified functions of Dusp26 in intracellular transport and cell–cell adhesion. Downregulation of Dusp26 may contribute to malignant phenotypes of glioma."

Schwann cells are peripheral nerve glia derived from the neural crest, a multipotent cell population that delaminates from the dorsal neural tube at E9 in the mouse. In addition to Schwann cells, rodent trunk level crest cells in vivo give rise to neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), including those of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), melanocytes, and endoneurial fibroblasts, in vitro and in vivo (Baroffio et al., 1988Baroffio A.

The roles of most growth factors have not been analyzed in the developing PNS, especially in the neural crest-Schwann cell precursor transition. The most common PNS tumor is the neurofibroma, hallmark of the inherited disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) (Rasmussen and Friedman, 2000Rasmussen S.A. Friedman J.M.

How does the Schwann cell lineage form tumors in NF1?.Glia. 2008; 56: 1590-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Biallelic NF1 mutations have been detected in neurofibroma Schwann cells, implying that the Schwann cell lineage drives neurofibroma formation (Serra et al., 2001Serra E. Ars E. Ravella A. Sanchez A. Puig S. Rosenbaum T. Estivill X. Lazaro C. Somatic NF1 mutational spectrum in benign neurofibromas: mRNA splice defects are common among point mutations.Hum.

Those that cause in vivo GEM-neurofibroma formation share expression at the Schwann cell precursor or boundary cap stages of Schwann cell development, placing the neurofibroma cell of origin subsequent to the neural crest stage (Joseph et al., 2008Joseph N.M.

It is debated whether the neurofibroma initiating cell is a committed glial cell, a dedifferentiated Schwann cell, or a postcrest progenitor cell. Failure of cellular differentiation and subsequent augmentation of a progenitor population may provide a basis for tumorigenesis (Jordan et al., 2006Jordan C.T. Guzman M.L. Noble M. Cancer stem cells.N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Here we tested the hypothesis that the expression of EGFR defines a normal peripheral nerve glial progenitor population susceptible to Nf1 mutation, because 1%–2% of cells in neurofibromas express the Schwann cell marker S100β and the EGFR, which is not expressed by Schwann cells (DeClue et al., 2000DeClue J.E. Heffelfinger S. Benvenuto G. Ling B. Li S. Rui W. Vass W.C. Viskochil D. Ratner N. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in neurofibromatosis type 1-related tumors and NF1 animal models.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Also, some cells in neurofibroma tissue sections express the stem cell marker CD34 (Khalifa et al., 2000Khalifa M.A. Montgomery E.A. Ismiil N. Azumi N. What are the CD34+ cells in benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors? Double immunostaining study of CD34 and S-100 protein.Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2000; 114: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, E12.5 Nf1−/− DRG cultures are abnormally abundant in EGFR+ cells expressing the Schwann cell precursor marker Blbp/Fabp7 (DeClue et al., 2000DeClue J.E. Heffelfinger S. Benvenuto G. Ling B. Li S. Rui W. Vass W.C. Viskochil D. Ratner N. Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in neurofibromatosis type 1-related tumors and NF1 animal models.J. Clin.

We show that Nf1 loss in mouse expands numbers of EGFR-dependent peripheral progenitor cells and confers tumorigenic capacity. Additionally, neurofibromas in the DhhCre;Nf1fl/fl model contain multipotent progenitors. Finally, EGFR expression defines and allows isolation of tumorigenic progenitors from primary human neurofibromas. Studies of various neural progenitors have demonstrated the utility of the in vitro sphere assay to assess self-renewal capability of a cell population (Fernandes et al., 2004Fernandes K.J.

Generation of neurons and astrocytes from isolated cells of the adult mammalian central nervous system.Science. 1992; 255: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4369) Google Scholar). We dissociated E12.5 DRG of wild-type, Nf1+/−, and Nf1−/− embryos and cultured the suspension under sphere conditions defined for crest-derived progenitors (Fernandes et al., 2004Fernandes K.J. McKenzie I.A. Mill P. Smith K.M. Akhavan M. Barnabe-Heider F. Biernaskie J. Junek A. Kobayashi N.R. Toma J.G. et al.A dermal niche for multipotent adult skin-derived precursor cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Nf1−/− DRG cell preparations gave rise to spheres in the presence of EGF and bFGF at a rate of about 1:700 by 14 days, significantly higher than wild-type and Nf1+/− DRG cell suspensions (approximately 1:3000; p < 0.05, Figure 1A). Postnatal day 2 (P2) and 120 (P120) sciatic nerves were dissociated and plated in sphere-forming conditions. Nf1+/− P2 nerve cells generated primary spheres, but wild-type cells did not; at P120, cells from neither genotype yielded spheres (Figure 1B). E12.5 DRG-derived spheres were dissociated to single-cell suspension and replated. Cells of all genotypes formed secondary spheres, and the frequency of formation was not statistically different among genotypes (Figure 1C). Cells from spheres derived from embryonic DRG from all genotypes could be passaged for at least ten generations. P2 Nf1+/− spheres, in contrast, failed to give rise to secondary spheres (Figure 1D). Early postnatal Nf1+/− nerves contain EGFR+;P75+ cells (Wu et al., 2006Wu J. Crimmins J.T. Monk K.R. Williams J.P. Fitzgerald M.E. Tedesco S. Ratner N. Perinatal epidermal growth factor receptor blockade prevents peripheral nerve disruption in a mouse model reminiscent of benign world health organization grade I neurofibroma.Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 1686-1696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and may be the primary sphere-forming cells at P2. The data imply that the number of progenitors is increased in Nf1−/− embryonic DRG but that the self-renewal capacity of mutant cells is unaltered. A widely accepted measure of cell self-renewal is testing capability of sustained clonal expansion. To test whether clonal growth accounts for sphere formation, purified tertiary spheres from wild-type and Nf1−/− embryos were transduced with lentiviral eGFP, dissociated, and plated at limiting densities with equal numbers of unlabeled cells. All spheres were clonal, as cells were either fluorescent (green) or nonfluorescent (white) when plated at densities of 250 cells/cm2 or lower (Figures 1E–1H and 1O). Higher plating densities yielded colonies that contained both fluorescent and nonfluorescent cells (data not shown). Nuclear counterstain with DAPI (false-colored red) confirmed that all nuclei in newly forming spheres at clonal density were exclusively eGFP+ or negative at low density (Figures 1I–1N). Clonal spheres from both genotypes could be dissociated and replated, giving rise to secondary low-density spheres (data not shown), indicating that spheres form by expansion of single-cell clones, not by cell aggregation. In conjunction with our ability to passage spheres for at least ten passages in vitro, the data indicate that embryonic spheres contain clonogenic self-renewing cells. To correlate the phenotype of sphere cells with the stages of development relevant to the embryonic DRG, we examined expression of a panel of crest and glial lineage markers using RT-PCR. Wild-type and Nf1−/− spheres express the neural crest markers Twist, Nestin, Wnt5a, P75, and Sox9 (Figure 2A). Spheres from both genotypes expressed the glial markers Sox10, Mpz, Blbp (Fabp7), Dhh, and Gfap (Figure 2B). This may reflect that spheres contain cells representative of neural crest and/or immature glia, or an intermediate cell. Sphere formation medium contains EGF and bFGF, implying that receptors for one or both of these factors are present on cells. We plated single spheres derived from wild-type, Nf1+/−, and Nf1−/− DRG and assayed EGFR and P75 (a neural crest lineage marker) immunoreactivity. Spheres from all genotypes contained cells that coexpressed EGFR and P75 (Figures 2C–2E). All spheres analyzed contained EGFR+;P75+ cells (n = 8 spheres from each of three embryos per genotype). To further characterize the external signals required for progenitor expansion, we plated dissociated cells from purified spheres in various doses of EGF, bFGF, or both. Both wild-type and Nf1−/− sphere formation were significantly increased when cultured with both factors versus either factor alone (Figure 2F). Additionally, Nf1−/− sphere-forming cells expanded (7.7-fold increase) when cultured in EGF and bFGF at low concentration (0.2 ng/ml) as compared to wild-type (2.3% sphere formation versus 0.3%), suggesting higher sensitivity to growth factor-induced progenitor expansion. Spheres were maintained at saturating concentrations of growth factors (20 ng/ml) for subsequent experiments. Sphere formation was impaired when cells from dissociated primary spheres were subjected to 3 μM erlotinib (Figure 2G), which blocks EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (Norman, 2001Norman P. OSI-774 OSI Pharmaceuticals.Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 2: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed the action of erlotinib on EGFR activity by western blot (Figure 2H). We also used a genetic approach to assess the degree to which EGFR activity drives sphere formation in the embryonic DRG. We generated spheres from E12.5 DRG from mice heterozygous for the EGFR mutation Waved-2 (Wa2/+) and their wild-type littermate controls. Cells from the DRG of these mutants showed a 3-fold reduction in sphere formation versus wild-type, which was maintained even when spheres were passaged, as secondary sphere formation is quantified in Figure 2I. Thus, EGFR function is necessary for normal sphere formation. The elevated response to low concentrations of EGF in Nf1−/− cells suggested that they may release additional EGFR ligands, which could act in an autocrine fashion. We examined whether EGFR ligands were being synthesized by sphere cells by RT-PCR. Cells from both wild-type and mutant spheres express mRNA transcripts for Amphiregulin, Betacellulin, Tgf-α, HB-Egf, and Epiregulin (Figure 2J). The relevance of these factors remains to be determined. As a defining characteristic of stem cells and progenitor cells is their ability to differentiate along multiple lineages, we tested whether cells in spheres from wild-type or Nf1−/− embryonic DRG showed multilineage differentiation. Cells from clonally derived spheres were plated in serum in the absence of supplemental EGF and bFGF. Lineage differentiation markers were not expressed in growing spheres or directly after plating (see Figures S1A, S1C, and S1E, left panels, available online). In some experiments, we monitored spontaneous differentiation. In other experiments, we directed differentiation according to previous reports (see the Experimental Procedures) by exposing cells from spheres to lineage-specific growth factors after plating in neurogenic, smooth muscle/fibroblastic, or gliogenic conditions. Both wild-type and Nf1 mutant spheres formed Schwann cells with cytoplasmic S100β expression, bipolar morphology, and elongated nuclei (Figures S1A, right panels, and S1B). Cells from both genotypes differentiated into SM/Fb-like cells, as assayed by smooth muscle actin (SMA) immunoreactivity and large round nuclei with a flattened, fibroblastic morphology (Figure S1C, right panels, and S1D). When placed into neurogenic conditions, wild-type cells very rarely expressed neuron-specific β-tubulin (β-Tub). Cells from Nf1−/− sphere cultures generated many β-Tub+ cells with large cell bodies and long neurites (Figure S1E, right panels). Of spheres that contained positive cells, there was a 10-fold increase in the number of β-Tub+ cell in Nf1−/− spheres versus wild-type spheres (2.9% versus 0.27%, respectively, Figure S1F) in the spontaneous format. The cued paradigm also showed a neurogenic bias for the Nf1−/− spheres (2.1% versus 0.7%, respectively, Figure S1F). Neurons also expressed neurofilament (NF-M, inset, Figure S1E). We were unable to stimulate pigmentation by cells from either genotype, although neural crest cells from mouse E9.5 showed robust pigmentation under the same conditions (data not shown). We conclude that wild-type cells from embryonic DRG-derived spheres differentiate into Schwann cells and smooth muscle fibroblasts and infrequently into neurons. In contrast, Nf1 mutant cells appear less restricted. To provide additional evidence supporting the ability of sphere cells to differentiate into neurons and glia, we used an avian xenograft assay of neural crest cell differentiation. Sphere cells, wild-type and Nf1−/−, migrated to the DRG and peripheral nerve. After in ovo differentiation, most cells express the Schwann cell marker myelin basic protein (MBP), with some cells expressing the neuronal marker NeuN within the DRG (Figure S2). To assess the tumorigenic capacity of cells within spheres, we injected dissociated sphere culture cells subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice. No lesions formed after injection of wild-type cells (n = 11, 1.0 − 5.0 × 105 cells per injection) even after 18 weeks. Nf1 mutant spheres were dissociated and injected (1 − 1.5 × 105 cells per injection) and formed neurofibroma-like lesions in 11 of 21 injections (Figures 3A–3C). We observed regions reminiscent of neurofibroma following hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue sections (Figure 3D), containing occasional mast cells and cells with elongated nuclei (presumptive Schwann cells or fibroblasts). No features of malignancy (hypercellularity, failure to differentiate), necrosis, or edema were observed. Tumor areas were close to nerve fibers, as evident by neurofilament (Figure 3E) and S100β (Figure 3F) staining. Some cells were S100β+, bipolar Schwann-like cells (Figure 3G). The mouse data demonstrate that the loss of Nf1 leads to an increase in EGFR+ progenitors that can be isolated, expanded as spheres, and are tumorigenic in nude mice. To test if human neurofibromas contain similar cells, we plated primary neurofibroma cells in medium containing EGF (20 ng/ml) and bFGF (40 ng/ml) on low-binding plastic dishes and observed selective expansion of cells that grew as floating spheres (Figure 4A). When grown on tissue culture plastic dishes, spheres formed as attached colonies, allowing for accurate quantification of growth (Table S1). We stained cells from colonies replated on chamber slides. As shown in Figures 4B–4E, we identified EGFR+;P75+ cells (n = 3 experiments, less than 2% total cells were double positive). To test for EGF dependence of colony formation, we plated 4 × 104 primary neurofibroma cells per well in triplicate using a 24-well plate cells in human sphere medium in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml EGF. In this case, cells were plated onto tissue culture plastic so that cells attached to the uncoated plastic for quantification. Fourteen days later, colony (attached sphere) formation was scored. In three experiments in triplicate wells from two different patient tumors, in the presence of EGF, an average of 43 colonies per well formed, 8-fold higher than in the absence of EGF (Figures 4F–4I). When cells were plated in EGF together with the EGFR function-blocking antibody Cetuximab, an average of only four colonies per well appeared (Figures 4H and 4I). Similarly, when plated in EGF with the EGFR antagonist erlotinib (Tarceva; OSI-774), an average of four colonies per well formed (data not shown). Thus, human neurofibroma cell colony (sphere) formation is responsive to EGF and dependent on EGFR activity. We tested whether EGFR+ cells could be prospectively isolated from human neurofibroma. We analyzed the coexpression of EGFR and P"
https://openalex.org/W1993956804,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) assess correlation between traits and DNA sequence variation using large numbers of genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the genome. A GWAS produces many trait-SNP associations with low p-values, but few are replicated in subsequent studies. We sought to determine if characteristics of the genomic loci associated with a trait could be used to identify initial associations with a higher chance of replication in a second cohort. Data from the age-related eye disease study (AREDS) of 100,000 SNPs on 395 subjects with and 198 without age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were employed. Loci highly associated with AMD were characterized based on the distribution of genotypes, level of significance, and clustering of adjacent SNPs also associated with AMD suggesting linkage disequilibrium or multiple effects. Forty nine loci were highly associated with AMD, including 3 loci (CFH, C2/BF, LOC387715/HTRA1) already known to contain important genetic risks for AMD. One additional locus (C3) reported during the course of this study was identified and replicated in an additional study group. Tag-SNPs and haplotypes for each locus were evaluated for association with AMD in additional cohorts to account for population differences between discovery and replication subjects, but no additional clearly significant associations were identified. Relying on a significant genotype tests using a log-additive model would have excluded 57% of the non-replicated and none of the replicated loci, while use of other SNP features and clustering might have missed true associations."

Using reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, H1t from rat and mouse testes was isolated, subjected to enzymatic digestion, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. We observed different phosphorylated states of H1t (mono-, di-, and triphosphorylated) as well as the unphosphorylated protein. Tandem mass spectrometry and immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography experiments with MS/MS/MS and multistage activation were utilized to identify five phosphorylation sites on H1t from rats. Phosphorylation occurs on both serine and threonine residues, whereas only two of these sites were located on peptides containing the CDK consensus motif (S/T)PXZ. Rat H1t phosphorylation starts first by phosphorylation of the nonconsensus motif SPKS in the COOH-terminal domain, namely at Ser-140 and to a smaller degree at a further nonconsensus motif at Ser-186. This is followed by phosphorylation of Ser-177 and Thr-155, both located in CDK consensus motifs. A single phosphorylation site at Ser-8 in the NH2-terminal tail was also found. Mouse H1t lacks Ser-186 and is phosphorylated at up to four sites. In contrast to somatic linker histones, no strict order of increasing phosphorylation could be detected in H1t. Thus, it appears that not the order of up-phosphorylation but the number of the phosphate groups is necessary for regulated chromatin decondensation, thus facilitating the substitution of H1t by transition proteins and protamines.

Mammalian spermatogenesis is a complex, strictly organized process, including proliferation and differentiation. After several mitotic divisions of spermatogonia, germ cells differentiate into spermatocytes and pass through two consecutive meiotic divisions, resulting in haploid round cells termed spermatids. These spermatids then evolve into highly condensed and transcriptionally inert sperm through a process known as spermiogenesis (for a review, see Ref. 1Hofmann M.C. Hess R.A. Goldberg E. Millan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1994; 91: 5533-5537Google Scholar). In rats, 19 developmental steps have been defined by morphological criteria (2Leblond C.P. Clermont Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.. 1952; 55: 548-573Google Scholar, 33. Meistrich, M. L. (1989) in Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins (Hnilica, L. S., ed) CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FLGoogle Scholar). During the early stages, comprising steps 1–8, round spermatids are transcriptionally active and contain nucleosomal chromatin. The later stages can be roughly devided into three phases. In the elongating phase (step 9 to early step 12) the transcriptional activity of the genome decreases to undetectable levels. The second phase, from late step 12 to step 15, includes the substitution of histones by transition proteins TP1, TP2, and TP4. Steps 16–19 compose the third phase when transition proteins are replaced by protamines Prm1 and Prm2 (4Sassone-Corsi P. Science.. 2002; 296: 2176-2178Google Scholar).The underlying mechanisms that lead to this apparently dramatic reorganization and packaging of the nucleosomal chromatin to a highly condensed chromatin during spermiogenesis are not well understood up to now. The changing histone gene expression pattern seems to play a considerable role (5Lennox R.W. Cohen L.H. Dev. Biol.. 1984; 103: 80-84Google Scholar). In spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes, the linker histones H1a and H1b are expressed (6Doenecke D. Albig W. Bode C. Drabent B. Franke K. Gavenis K. Witt O. Histochem. Cell Biol.. 1997; 107: 1-10Google Scholar). When cells enter the meiotic prophase, somatic histones are partially replaced by testis-specific core histone variants, including TH2B, TH2A, and tH3 (6Doenecke D. Albig W. Bode C. Drabent B.

A.. 2003; 100: 10546-10551Google Scholar).H1t expression starts in pachytene spermatocytes, constituting as much as 55% of the linker histone associated with chromatin in these cell types and persists until the stage of elongating spermatids. Although H1t has the usual tripartite structure typical of metazoan linker histones, its amino acid sequence is highly divergent from that of other mammalian H1s. De Lucia et al. (17De Lucia F. Faraone-Mennella M.R. D'Erme M. Quesada P. Caiafa P. Farina B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1994; 198: 32-39Google Scholar) reported that H1t exerts the lowest condensing effect on rat testis oligonucleosomes of all somatic H1 variants. The high levels of H1t during the pachytene phase could suggest a role in keeping chromatin in a relatively decondensed state, enabling nuclear events during this spermatogenic stage. It persists until it is almost completely replaced by transition proteins in elongated spermatids. Very little is known of the mechanisms controlling the process of histone replacement. Govin et al. (18Govin J. Caron C. Lestrat C. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2004; 271: 3459-3469Google Scholar) proposed a new testis-specific “histone code,” since it appears that before histone replacement a massive chromatin alteration occurs due to extensive incorporation of histone variants as well as to globally specific histone modifications.Posttranslational histone modifications during spermatogenesis encompass acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation (for a review, see Refs. 19Kimmins S. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature.. 2005; 434: 583-589Google Scholar and 20Rousseaux S. Caron C. Govin J. Lestrat C. Faure A.K. Khochbin S. Gene (Amst.).. 2005; 345: 139-153Google Scholar). Histone H4 was found to be hyperacetylated at Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-12 during replacement of H1t (21Meistrich M.L. Trostle-Weige P.K. Lin R. Bhatnagar Y.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Reprod.

Cell Biol.. 2007; 176: 283-294Google Scholar). Monoubiquitinylation at Lys-119 of H2A and hyperacetylation of histone H4 occur a short time before histones disappear in Drosophila (23Rathke C. Baarends W.M. Jayaramaiah-Raja S. Bartkuhn M. Renkawitz R. Renkawitz-Pohl R. J. Cell Sci.. 2007; 120: 1689-1700Google Scholar). Histone ubiquitinylation and methylation are involved in meiotic DNA recombination and middle gene expression in yeast (24Robzyk K. Recht J.

Temporarily mono-, di-, and trimethylated histone H3 at Lys-4 was identified (27Godmann M. Auger V. Ferraroni-Aguiar V. Sauro A.D. Sette C. Behr R. Kimmins S. Biol. Reprod.. 2007; 77: 754-764Google Scholar) in elongating spermatids of mice and marmoset. Mono-, di-, and trimethylated histone H3 was detected from leptotene to diplotene spermatocytes in mice (28Greaves I.K. Rangasamy D. Devoy M. Marshall Graves J.A. Tremethick D.J. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2006; 26: 5394-5405Google Scholar).Phosphorylated H2B and H3 at Ser-10 correlate with meiotic chromosome condensation in yeast, whereas histone H4 is phosphorylated later during sporulation (29Krishnamoorthy T. Chen X. Govin J. Cheung W.L. Dorsey J. Schindler K. Winter E. Allis C.D. Guacci V. Khochbin S. Fuller M.T. Berger S.L. Genes Dev.. 2006; 20: 2580-2592Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of histone H3 starts in rodents at the end of the prophase at the centromeric heterochromatin in the diplotene stage. As experiments with kinase inhibitors demonstrate, this event can be uncoupled from meiotic chromosome condensation (30Cobb J. Miyaike M. Kikuchi A. Handel M.A. Chromosoma.. 1999; 108: 412-425Google Scholar). Moreover, several specific phosphorylation sites of TP1 and TP2 (31Chirat F. Martinage A. Briand G. Kouach M. Van Dorsselaer A. Loir M. Sautiere P. Eur. J. Biochem.. 1991; 198: 13-20Google Scholar, 32Ullas K.S. Rao M.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 52673-52680Google Scholar) and human protamines 1 and 2 (33Chirat F. Arkhis A. Martinage A. Jaquinod M. Chevaillier P. Sautiere P. Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, the prime objective of this investigation was to use HILIC 2The abbreviations used are: HILIC, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography; EGME, ethylene glycol methyl ether; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; HPCE, high performance capillary electrophoresis; RPC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; TEA, triethylamine; RP-HPLC, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography; IMAC, immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: HILIC, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography; EGME, ethylene glycol methyl ether; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; HPCE, high performance capillary electrophoresis; RPC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; TEA, triethylamine; RP-HPLC, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography; IMAC, immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. in combination with MS/MS and MS3 proteomic techniques to identify H1t phosphorylation sites. The present paper demonstrates that phosphorylation occurs mainly on serine residues. Moreover, a single modified threonine was detected. We found five phosphorylation sites in rat H1t, four located in the COOH-terminal tail and one in the NH2-terminal tail. Despite the fact that only two of them are located in the consensus sequences (S/T)PXZ, the distribution of the phosphate groups on the protein molecule strongly resembles that of somatic H1s. A strict order occurring during up-phosphorylation, however, as described for human H1 variants (34Sarg B. Helliger W. Talasz H. Forg B. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 6573-6580Google Scholar), was not found.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Acetonitrile, sodium perchlorate (NaClO4), trifluoroacetic acid, and triethylamine (TEA) were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland); EGME was obtained from Aldrich; and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (4000 centipoises) was obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from Merck if not otherwise indicated.Preparation of H1 Histones—Rats (Sprague-Dawley) aged 10, 30, and 60 days and mice (Swiss) aged 60 days were killed; their testes were removed and either used directly or stored at -80 °C. H1 histones were extracted with perchloric acid (5%, w/v) according to the procedure of Lindner et al. (35Lindner H. Sarg B. Hoertnagl B. Helliger W. J. Biol.

The effluent was monitored at 210 nm, and the peaks were recorded using a Beckman System Gold software.RP-HPLC—The separation of whole linker histones was performed according to Lindner et al.

The lyophilized proteins were dissolved in water containing 200 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and samples of ∼400 μg were injected onto the column. The histone H1 sample was chromatographed within 40 min at a constant flow of 1.5 ml/min with a two-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (65:35) (solvent A: water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 15% EGME; solvent B: 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 15% EGME). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 35 to 58% B during 35 min, held for 5 min at 58% B, and increased from 58 to 100% B for 8 min.Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography—The histone fraction H1t (∼200 μg) isolated from rat and mouse testis by RP-HPLC was analyzed on a PolyCAT A column (100 × 4.6 mm inner diameter; 3 μm particle size; 150 nm pore size; PolyLC) at 18 °C and at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min using a two-step gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (100:0) (solvent A: 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 m TEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0; solvent B: 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 m TEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0, and 0.68 m NaClO4). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 60% B for 5 min, from 60 to 100% for 35 min, and then maintained at 100% for 30 min.Capillary Electrophoresis—High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) was performed on a Beckman system P/ACE 2100. An untreated capillary (fused silica, 57 cm total length × 75 μm inner diameter) was used, protein samples were injected by pressure, and detection was performed by measuring UV absorption at 200 nm. Runs were carried out in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 2.0) containing 0.02% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose at a constant voltage (12 kV) and at a capillary temperature of 25 °C (40Lindner H.

Electrophoresis.. 1993; 14: 480-485Google Scholar).Enzymatic Cleavage—Histone H1t subfractions (∼100 μg) obtained by HILIC fractionation were digested either with α-chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) (Sigma type I-S; 1:150, w/w) in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 30 min at room temperature or with endoproteinase Arg-C (EC 3.4.21.1) (sequencing grade, 1:20, w/w; Roche Applied Science) in 100 μl of 90 mm Tris-HCl, 8.5 mm CaCl2 buffer (pH 7.6) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA activator for 20 min at room temperature. The digests were subjected to liquid chromatography-MS.Incubation of H1 Histones with Alkaline Phosphatase—About 100 μg of whole linker histones from rat testis were dissolved in 47 μl of 0.01 m Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.001 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and mixed with 280 μg of alkaline phosphatase (60 units/mg; Sigma).Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Arg-C digests of the fractions H1tp0-p3 were analyzed using nano-HPLC consisting of an UltiMate 3000 system (Dionex Corp.) connected online to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Finnigan LTQ) equipped with a nanospray ionization source. The nanospray voltage was set at 1.6 kV, and the heated capillary was held at 200 °C. Data-dependent neutral loss MS3 and multistage activation were used for precise localization of phosphorylation. MS/MS and MS3 spectra were searched against a histone data base using SEQUEST (LCQ BioWorks; ThermoFinnigan) and validated manually. The identified peptides were further evaluated using charge state versus cross-correlation number (Xcorr). The criteria for positive identification of peptides were Xcorr > 1.5 for singly charged ions, Xcorr > 2.0 for doubly charge ions, and Xcorr > 2.5 for triply charge ions. Only best matches were considered. MS/MS tolerances of +1 Da were allowed. IMAC was performed using the SigmaPrep Spin column kit and the PHOS-Select iron affinity gel from Sigma.Determination of the chymotryptic peptide masses of the histone H1t subfractions obtained by HILIC was carried out by RP-HPLC coupled online to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Samples (5–10 μg) were analyzed on a Nucleosil 300-5 C18 column (150 × 2 mm inner diameter; 5 μm particle pore size; end-capped; Macherey-Nagel) using solvent A (water containing 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (85% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid). Chromatography was performed within 55 min at a constant flow of 0.1 ml/min. The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 5 to 25% during 20 min and from 25 to 80% during 30 min.RESULTSThe mammalian testis consists of numerous cell types, but previous work has shown that the testis-specific histone H1t protein occurs in midpachytene primary spermatocytes and in early haploid spermatids (steps 1–8), where it is the most enriched H1 variant in these cell types. Fig. 1 reveals the HPCE analysis of linker histones from whole testis of rats aged 10, 30, and 60 days. The H1 pattern obtained reflects the H1 changes from sexually immature (Fig. 1A; 10 days) to pubertal (Fig. 1B; 30 days) and mature (Fig. 1C; 60 days) male rats. Assignment of the peaks in the electropherogram is according to Lindner et al. (43Lindner H. Wurm M. Dirschlmayer A. Sarg B. Helliger W. Electrophoresis.. 1993; 14: 480-485Google Scholar). In 10-day-old rats, the testis consists principally of somatic cells, and the H1 pattern strongly resembles that seen in several somatic tissues (data not shown). It is evident from Fig. 1A that at this age, not even traces of H1t can be detected. The increasing amount of H1t in Fig. 1, B and C, is consistent with the progressive differentiation of germ cells during spermatogenesis, whereas the developmental stage of the spermatids evolves from steps 1 and 2 (10 days) to 6 and 7 (30 days) and 8 (60 days). H1t is found to already be mono- and diphosphorylated in 30-day-old rats. Fig. 1 also shows an increase in the histone variant H1a, which is known to be enriched in testis (44Meistrich M.L. Bucci L.R. Trostle-Weige P.K. Brock W.A. Dev. Biol.. 1985; 112: 230-240Google Scholar), and in H1.0, an H1-like protein found mainly in mammalian tissues with little or no cellular proliferation. The two H1.0 peaks represent the NH2-terminally unacetylated (ac0) and acetylated form (ac1) (35Lindner H. Sarg B. Hoertnagl B. Helliger W. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 13324-13330Google Scholar).To identify the phosphorylation sites of H1t, whole linker histones of testis from rats aged 60 days were fractionated using RP-HPLC (Fig. 2A). The H1t fraction eluting at about 40 min was collected and further analyzed by HPCE (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions, H1t was further separated into its un-, mono-, and diphosphorylated forms, and moreover, even a triphosphorylated peak was obtained due to the purity of the H1t fraction and the rather large amount of sample applied onto the capillary. To prove the existence of phosphorylated H1t forms, whole linker histones were incubated with alkaline phosphatase. After treatment with the enzyme, the sample was chromatographed according to Fig. 2A (data not shown), and the H1t subfraction was subjected to HPCE (Fig. 3). In contrast to Fig. 2B, only a single peak was detectable with a migration time corresponding to the unphosphorylated H1t protein.FIGURE 2Separation of whole linker histones from rat testis by RPC. A, perchloric acid extracted linker histones (400 μg) isolated from rat testis were injected onto a Nucleosil 300-5 C4 column (250 × 8 mm). Histones H1 were fractionated by RPC at a constant flow of 1.5 ml/min using a two-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (65:35) (solvent A: water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 15% EGME; solvent B: 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 15% EGME). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 35 to 58% B for 35 min, held for 5 min at 58% B, and increased from 58 to 100% B for 8 min. B, the H1t histone fraction isolated by RPC was subjected to HPCE. Conditions were as described for Fig. 1.

H1tp0, unphosphorylated H1t histone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For determination of phosphorylation sites, tandem mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool. However, proteolytic digests examined by MS are often likely to fail to detect phosphopeptides, because ionization of phosphorylated peptides in positive ion mode MS is generally less efficient than ionization of their nonphosphorylated counterparts, resulting in ion suppression effects. As can be seen from Fig. 2B, the main fraction of H1t is unphosphorylated (50.8% of whole H1t), followed by p1 (32.0%), p2 (12.2%), and very little p3 (5.0%). To avoid these unwanted suppression effects, the distinctly phosphorylated forms of H1t were separated from each other and from the unphosphorylated form by means of HILIC.

As shown in Fig. 4A, three major and some minor peaks of H1t were found by using a PolyCAT A column with a triethylammonium phosphate buffer system (pH 3.0) in the presence of 70% acetonitrile. To characterize the HILIC fractions in terms of their phosphorylation state, each peak was digested with chymotrypsin and analyzed by LC-ESI-MS. Under the conditions used, two main peptide fragments were obtained (data not shown), an NH2-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–106) with a calculated mass of 11,005.9 Da and a COOH-terminal fragment (amino acids 107–207) with a calculated mass of 10606.5 Da. In each case, an NH2-terminal peptide mass of 11,048 ± 2 Da was detected by LC-ESI-MS for fractions p0–p3, indicating acetylation of the NH2 terminus (+42 Da) but no substantial phosphorylation. The masses of the COOH-terminal peptide fragments amino acids 107–207 of p0, p1, p2, and p3 differed by 80 Da each and correspond to the presence of one (p1), two (p2), and three (p3) phosphate groups (depicted in Fig. 4B). The minor peaks eluting between the labeled peaks in Fig. 4A were identified as oxidized forms of H1t. The NH2-terminal fragments of these peaks were found to contain one oxidized methionine (16 Da), and the COOH-terminal fragment was found to contain up to two oxidized methionines. The finding that phosphorylation of H1t takes place in the COOH-terminal part of the protein was not unexpected, since this fragment contains two typical phosphorylation motifs, namely T155PTK and S177PAK (Table 1).FIGURE 4HILIC separation of phosphorylated H1t histones. A, histone H1t fraction (∼200 μg) isolated by RPC was separated on a PolyCAT A column (100 × 4.6 mm inner diameter; 3 μm particle size; 150 nm pore size; PolyLC) at 18 °C and at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min using a two-step gradient starting at solvent A/solvent B (100:0) (solvent A: 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 m TEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0; solvent B: 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 m TEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0, and 0.68 m NaClO4). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 60% B for 5 min and from 60 to 100% for 35 min and then maintained at 100% for 30 min. Histone fractions obtained were used for chymotryptic as well as for Arg-C digestions. p0, p1, p2, and p3, un-, mono-, di-, and triphosphorylated H1t histones. B, LC-ESI-MS data of the COOH-terminal fragment of histone H1t. Determination of the chymotryptic peptide masses of the histone H1t subfractions obtained by HILIC was carried out by RP-HPLC coupled online to ESI-MS. The mass for the unphosphorylated COOH-terminal peptide 107–207 of rat H1t was calculated to be 10,606.5 Da. Mass differences found correlate with the molecular mass of additional phosphate groups (+0, +1, +2, and +3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Sequence alignment of rat and mouse histone variant H1t Residues conserved in both members are marked by asterisks and highlighted in gray.

Due to the high lysine content of H1t, enzymes like trypsin and Lys-C were found to be suitable only to a limited extent, because the resulting small, hydrophilic phosphopeptides from H1t were either not at all retained or were hardly retained in RP chromatography (data not shown). Therefore, endoproteinase Arg-C was used to digest H1t HILIC fractions p1, p2, and p3. It cleaves predominantly COOH-terminally of arginine, yielding fewer small peptide fragments. In this case, sequence coverage of 88.41% for p0, 84.06% for p1, and 93.94% for p2 was found, comprising 94.90, 89.7, and 97.4% of total Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues and including all potential SP and TP phosphorylation motifs. Combining data from both, Arg-C and Lys-C digest experiments, did not significantly improve sequence"

Our functional models of this domain identify both lipid binding and trafficking activities. In this study, we reveal: (i) a novel structural determinant of ion channel sensitivity to lipids, (ii) a molecular mechanism for the difference between diacylglycerol (DAG)-sensitive and DAG-insensitive TRPC subfamilies, and (iii) evidence that TRPC3 can comprise part of the vesicle fusion machinery. Indeed, the TRPC3 TRP_2 domain mediates channel trafficking to the plasma membrane and binds to plasma membrane lipids. Further, mutations in TRP_2, which alter lipid binding, also disrupt the DAG-mediated fusion of TRPC3-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane without disrupting SNARE interactions.

TRP channels comprise a cellular Ca2+ entry pathway that responds to stimulation with Ca2+-mobilizing agonists (15Ramsey I.S. Delling M. Clapham D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Their channel activation can be influenced by phosphorylation, nitrosylation, glycosylation, protein-protein interactions, protein-lipid interactions, mechanosensation, temperature, Ca2+ store-depletion, and exocytosis (14Venkatachalam K. Montell C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 387-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 16Soboloff, J., Spassova, M., Hewavitharana, T., He, L. P., Luncsford, P., Xu, W., Venkatachalam, K., van, R. D., Patterson, R. L., and Gill, D. L. (2007) Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 575–591Google Scholar). This polymodal activation scheme is complex and underscores the reason why it is difficult to study the role of TRP channels within biological processes. This is compounded by the fact that: (i) TRP channels can form multimers with other TRP isoforms, and (ii) there is, in general, a lack of domain annotation for TRP channels. Therefore, reconciling the results obtained with an exogenously expressed channel to those observed with endogenous channels is challenging as is predicting protein regions underlying specific functionalities. The canonical TRP (TRPC) channels are so named because they are closest to the prototypical Drosophila TRP channel, which mediates photoreception in the fly eye (17Montell C. Jones K. Hafen E. Rubin G. Science. 1985; 230: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Importantly, TRPC channels have been directly linked to brain development (14Venkatachalam K. Montell C. Annu. Rev.

Through a yet unknown mechanism, TRPC channels are activated in response to the receptor second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and DAG (reviewed in Refs. 14Venkatachalam K. Montell C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 387-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 16Soboloff, J., Spassova, M., Hewavitharana, T., He, L. P., Luncsford, P., Xu, W., Venkatachalam, K., van, R. D., Patterson, R. L., and Gill, D. L. (2007) Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 575–591Google Scholar). Importantly, TRPC channels can be subdivided into two subfamilies: the DAG-sensitive TRPC channels (C3/6/7) and the DAG-insensitive TRPC channels (C1/4/5). Multiple binding and regulatory activities have been empirically identified for TRPC channels. For example, two lipid binding sites have been identified in the DAG-sensitive TRPCs (24Kwon Y. Hofmann T. Montell C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 491-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Sharma S. Barrow R.K. Kornberg M. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Specifically, the extreme N-terminal lipid binding domain binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and regulates TRPC3 plasma membrane surface expression. Similarly in TRPC6, a the C-terminal lipid binding domain exists that binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), mediating calmodulin binding (24Kwon Y. Hofmann T. Montell C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 491-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This domain is conserved in all DAG-sensitive TRPCs, suggesting that they too share this functional domain. Conversely, formal queries of TRPC protein sequences using popular domain detection algorithms (e.g. Pfam, SMART, NCBI-CDD, InterProScan), yield no information about the nature or location of lipid binding domains. In general, these programs predict that TRPC channels contain only one functional domain (ion channel), and two domains whose function is unknown (ankyrin, TRP_2), thus leaving the majority of the protein without functional annotation. We present here a comparative and physiological analysis of the TRP_2 domain within TRPC3. Our in silico (1Ko K.D. Hong Y. Chang G.S. Bhardwaj G. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Physics Arch. Quant. Methods. 2008; arXiv: 2394Google Scholar), in vitro, and cellular assays reveal that the TRP_2 domain in TRPC channels is a lipid binding/trafficking domain, which, when mutated, alters the fusion of DAG-sensitive TRPC3-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. Further, these results suggest that like TRPM7 (26Krapivinsky G. Mochida S. Krapivinsky L. Cibulsky S.M. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2006; 52: 485-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), TRPC channels also have a “SNARE-like” activity and are directly involved in vesicle fusion. PIP-strip—These assays were performed per the manufacturer's instructions using 500-1000 ng of purified protein (25van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Sharma S. Barrow R.K. Kornberg M. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Lipid Binding Liposomes—These assays were performed as previously described (27Cozier G.E. Lockyer P.J.

Briefly, lipid mixtures phosphatidylethanolamine (29.2%), phosphatidylcholine (29.2%), phosphatidylserine (29.2%), and phosphatidyl-inositol (12.5%) (all in CHCl3) were dried down to form a thin film in a 0.5-ml minifuge tube (Beckmann) and then bath-sonicated in 0.2 m sucrose, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.01% azide to yield a 10× dense lipid stock. This was diluted 1:10 in dilution buffer (0.12 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2 (free Ca2+ concentration of ∼50 nm), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 500-1000 ng of recombinant protein. Protein complexes were allowed to form by incubation at 30 °C for 5 min prior to centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min). After spinning, supernatants were carefully removed, and the pellets retrieved by addition of an equal volume of 60 °C SDS sample buffer and subsequent bath sonication. Both PIP-strip and liposomal assays were visualized via Western analysis. Films were scanned and analyzed using the Bio-Rad Gel-dock system (p values from Student's t test). HeLa cells and HEK293 cells were from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% streptomycin (all from Atlanta Biologicals, Altanta, GA). HEK cells were transfected by electroporation, or, like HeLa cells, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PC12 cells were cultured as previously described (28Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Ford D.L. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S. Suh P.G. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Gill D.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For standard fluorescence recording experiments, cells grown on coverslips were loaded with 2 ;m Fura-2AM in the standard solution, that contained (in mm) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, pH adjusted to 7.2 with 10 mm HEPES. Following 30 min of incubation at 37 °C and a wash, the coverslips were placed in the perfusion chamber that allows rapid exchange of bath solutions. The solutions were applied by bath perfusion with ten volumes of the perfusion chamber. Fura-2 was excited by alternating 340/380 nm of light, and the resulting 510 nm fluorescence was recorded through a CCD-cooled camera and analyzed using Metafluor software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All data in supplemental Fig. S1, a and b are averages of ∼30 cells from three independent experiments. The quantification of the calcium imaging in Fig. 2b reflects the area under the curves for OAG and carbachol, respectively (% of WT, p values from Student's t test). For conventional whole cell recording, cells grown on coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber that was secured on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped with a fluorescent illuminator and filters designed to identify GFP-expressing cells. Transmembrane currents were recorded using an HEKA EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Instruments, Southboro, MA), stored in a PC and analyzed using Patchmaster and Origin software. Currents were digitized at 1 kHz and filtered through low-bandpass filter set at 5 kHz cutoff frequency. In whole cell mode, the pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 Cs-aspartate (to cancel endogenous K+ and Cl- conductances), 5 NaCl, 5 Mg-ATP, 10 HEPES, 2 EGTA, or 10 BAPTA, pH 7.2. The standard bath solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.5. In some experiments, NaCl was replaced with NMDG-glutamate and 0 or 10 mm divalent metals were included in the bath solutions. The experiments were performed at room temperature. The solutions were applied by bath perfusion with ten volumes of the perfusion chamber. Pipette resistance was in the 2-4 MOhm range, and seal resistance was always over 1 GOhm. Series resistance and capacitance were compensated using the proprietary protocol included with Patchmaster. For experiments with fixed cells, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed and permeabilized by 10 min of incubation at -20 °C with 100% methanol, or were fixed by a 5-min incubation with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized by incubation with 0.01% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 5 min. After fixation, nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation in 5% goat serum. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies in blocking solution. Following wash-out of the primary antibodies with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were stained with fluorescent secondary antibodies and analyzed as above. The slides were placed on the stage of a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope, and fluorescence was recorded and analyzed offline using ImageJ software. Fibroblasts transfected with TRPC3 constructs were loaded with 5 mg/ml 10 kDa Texas Red-tagged dextran (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). Following a 3-h load, cells were fixed and processed for confocal immunocytochemistry as discussed above. HeLa cells were fixed by 30 min of incubation with a solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Na-cacodilate, washed with 0.1 m Na-cacodilate, and with freeze-thaw permeabilization of the membranes, cells were incubated overnight with ;-Myc antibodies, rinsed, and biotinylated secondary antibodies were added. After an extensive wash, the samples were incubated with avidin-peroxidase and washed. Next, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine was added for 10 min and, after another wash, the samples were post-fixed with a solution containing 1% OsO4, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained en block for 30 min with 2% uranyl acetate. Following dehydration by immersion in 30-100% ethanol, the samples were embedded in resin by immersion in 30-100% resin/propylene oxide mixtures. Fixed samples were mounted on grids and analyzed with a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope. C-terminally tagged YFP-TRPC3 was engineered and cloned into the peYFP vector from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). These vectors were transfected into HEK-293 cells, using Lipofectamine2000 per the manufacturer's instructions. 24-h post-transfection, cells were passed at low density into 96-well plates and grown in 500 ;g/ml G418. Wells that formed colonies were subcultured and assayed for stability by YFP-TRPC3 expression. These cells were expanded and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Stable cell lines were only used for 10 passages to ensure reproducibility. Stably transfected WT or SS YFP-TRPC3 cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips 24 h before use. Cells were treated with 10 ;g/ml cyclohexamide for 1 h before use to block new protein synthesis. All experiments were performed on the Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY). This was performed with an inverted Olympus IX-81 microscope using a blue argon laser anda60× oil immersion (1.42 NA) PlanApo lens. FV10-ASW software was used for the analysis. All experiments were performed at room temperature. FRAP—Cells were bleached at 100% laser power for 5 s over a series of 3 different (oval, rectangle, square) standardized ROI sizes. Recovery from bleaching was then measured for 90 s at 3-s intervals. FLIP—Cells were bleached at 100% laser power for 10 s and then given 20 s for recovery (12 total bleaches). Three standardized (total pixel volume) ROI's (oval, rectangle, square) were measured at the beginning of each bleach. Each ROI was further measured using the following method. Three standardized circles were placed either in the area under the membrane or on the plasma membrane. These circles were then quantified and averaged, and p values determined by Student's t test. This allowed us to separate cytosolic TRPC3 movement from TRPC3 movement at the plasma membrane. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy measurements were obtained using an enclosed Nikon 2000U epi-microscope maintained at 37 °C. The microscope is outfitted with a TIRF module, a Nikon 60× Apo 1.6N/A oil-immersion lens, Prior stage, and Roper512 CCD camera. Excitation was performed at 488 nm. Cells were incubated in Krebs buffer and allowed to equilibrate 5 min before measurements. Z-position was standardized using the Prior stage controls. Cells were imaged without stimulation for 180 cycles, followed by 180 cycles of measurement in the presence of 100 ;m carbachol. Analysis was performed using MetaFluor software. TRPC3 fragments were cloned into Pet28c HIS-tagged vectors and transformed into BL21 bacteria. Protein production was induced by 100 ;m isopropyl-1-thio-;-d-galactopyranoside for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and complete protease inhibitor mixture). After lysis, debris was pelleted by a 5-min 10,000 × g centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated on Talon beads for 30 min, washed 10 times with TBST, and eluted with 500 ;l of 10 mm EDTA in TBS, pH 8. Proteins were then dialyzed 2× with 4 liters of TBS, pH 7.4 to remove detergent and EDTA. This was performed as previously described (25van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Sharma S. Barrow R.K.

Antibodies were used per the manufacturer's instructions. Peripheral Lipid Binding and Activity—TRPC3 has two known lipid binding domains that are not predicted by conventional domain detection algorithms (24Kwon Y. Hofmann T. Montell C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 491-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,25van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Sharma S. Barrow R.K. Kornberg M. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Using GDDA-BLAST, we observed multiple putative lipid binding regions in TRPC channels, including predictions for both regions of TRPC3 that have been experimentally validated to bind lipid (1Ko K.D. Hong Y. Chang G.S. Bhardwaj G. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Physics Arch. Quant. Methods. 2008; arXiv: 2394Google Scholar). We also predicted lipid binding activity in the domain of unknown function, TRP_2. We observed that most of the conserved residues from GDDA-BLAST analysis occur between Gly-197 and Asp-233 in TRPC3 (1Ko K.D. Hong Y. Chang G.S. Bhardwaj G. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Physics Arch. Quant. Methods. 2008; arXiv: 2394Google Scholar). We performed multiple sequence alignments between all of the human TRPC channels in this region and observed that DAG-sensitive TRPC3/6/7 have a non-synonymous substitution (Ser-209) when compared with DAG-insensitive TRPC1/4/5 (Fig. 1a). Additionally, Ser-213 in TRPC3 is a phenylalanine in TRPC1. Based on these data, we mutated TRPC3 to mirror TRPC1 (S209R/S213F, herein referred to as SS mutant). We tested the prediction that TRP_2 binds peripheral lipids in the physiologically relevant liposomal assay constructed to mimic plasma membrane lipid composition. We observed that SS TRPC3 significantly increased lipid binding versus WT or a K202A/R204A (KR) mutant (Fig. 1b). We were unable to test whether DAG is capable of binding to this peptide as DAG disrupts liposomal formation; however, we did not observe WT or SS binding to PIP-strips containing immobilized DAG (data not shown). Next, we tested whether the SS mutation alters channel activity of overexpressed TRPC3 in response to the G-protein receptor agonist carbachol (which increases endogenous IP3 and DAG) or the cell permeant DAG analogue 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG). In HEK293 cells transiently transfected with either Myc-tagged WT or SS TRPC3, the SS mutation reduces overall channel activity in response to either carbachol or OAG as measured by Fura-2 AM and whole cell electrophysiological recordings (Fig. 2, a-c and supplemental Fig. S1, a and b). We observed small but reproducible SS activity in a subpopulation of cells (data not shown). Localization—The above observations suggest that the SS mutation alters either channel activity and/or levels of TRPC3 in the plasma membrane (i.e. trafficking). This agrees with predictions derived by GDDA-BLAST for trafficking activity with the TRP_2 domain of TRPC3 (1Ko K.D. Hong Y. Chang G.S. Bhardwaj G. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Physics Arch. Quant. Methods. 2008; arXiv: 2394Google Scholar). Therefore, we conducted a series of experiments to determine if the SS mutation alters TRPC3 trafficking. We performed confocal microscopy on HeLa cells transfected with full-length WT or SS TRPC3 (Fig. 3a and supplemental Fig. S1c). We observed no overt differences in localization of SS compared with WT expression. Further, co-expressed WT and SS TRPC3 colocalize within the same cellular regions (Fig. 3a). To address whether vesicle trafficking near the plasma membrane was altered, we performed TIRF on WT or SS TRPC3 stably expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3b and supplemental Fig. S1d, and supplemental movies), which assays vesicle movement within ∼100 nm of the plasma membrane. We found that SS-positive vesicles are indistinguishable from WT in both size and movement. We next performed transmission electron microscopy on HeLa cells overexpressing Myc-tagged TRPC3 stained with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 4a). We do not observe any gross changes between WT and SS localization, although irregular blebbing can be observed near the plasma membrane in the SS preparations. These results show either there is no abnormality in SS mutant localization or that such abnormalities manifest at a stage immediately preceding the mutant interaction with the plasma membrane.FIGURE 4Electron microscopy and quantification of vesicle mobility at the plasma membrane. a, transmission electron microscopy of HeLa cells transfected with either full-length Myc-tagged WT or SS TRPC3.

For b and c, see“Materials and Methods,” and supplemental Fig. S1e.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Trafficking—As obtaining precise measurements of vesicle mobility using TIRF is challenging, we sought a more quantifiable method. Thus we utilized FRAP, and FLIP experiments to more accurately quantify the mobility of vesicles containing WT and mutant channels (Fig. 4, b and c and supplemental Fig. S1e). We used FRAP to test forward trafficking and FLIP to assay endocytosis and plasma membrane mobility (see “Materials and Methods”). In the FRAP experiments, we observed recovery of WT TRPC3 fluorescence, an effect which is significantly decreased in SS preparations (Fig. 4b). This result suggests that the sites occupied by SS TRPC3 are not subject to normal recycling. Thus, the plasma membrane cannot be repopulated with unbleached SS TRPC3. Our FLIP experiments demonstrated that WT TRPC3 is depleted from the unbleached area in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4c). This represents vesicle endocytosis and diffusion of WT in the plasma membrane. Conversely, SS TRPC3 is rapidly depleted from areas subjacent to the plasma membrane as WT (Fig. 4c, Cytosolic ROI), yet has significantly increased retention time with the plasma membrane (Fig. 4c, Membrane ROI). With respect to the Membrane ROI, we observed a biphasic response whereby WT and SS are indistinguishable at early time points but differ significantly at later time points. The lack of effect in early time points could be due to multimerization of SS TRPC3 with endogenous TRPC channels or TRPC channels within the ROI, which have yet to dock. Nevertheless, the reduced mobility of SS at the plasma membrane is consistent with our finding that this mutant has increased affinity for plasma membrane lipids (see Fig. 1b). The decreased activity of the SS mutant could be due to altered vesicle insertion, endocytosis, and/or channel gating. To more rigorously evaluate whether endocytosis of the SS mutant is disrupted, we performed fluorescent"

These effects are largely exerted by oxidatively fragmented phospholipids, which are highly exchangeable between cells, tissues, and lipoproteins (1Leitinger N. Tyner T.R. Oslund L. Rizza C.

In particular, 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC) has been identified in minimally modified LDL and has been reported to elicit a wide range of pathophysiological responses in vascular cells, e.g. the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways (6Loidl A. Claus R. Ingolic E. Deigner H.-P. Hermetter A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2004; 1690: 150-158Google Scholar). Fast uptake of synthetic PGPC analogues to the perinuclear region of vascular smooth muscle cells has been reported (7Moumtzi A. Trenker M. Flicker K. Zenzmaier E. Saf R. Hermetter A. J. Lipid Res.. 2007; 48: 565-582Google Scholar) and discussed in view of its ability to activate acid sphingomyelinase (8Loidl A. Sevcsik E. Riesenhuber G. Deigner H.P. Hermetter A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 32921-32928Google Scholar). The uptake mechanism and sites of action, however, still remain enigmatic. PGPC carries an acyl fragment in the sn-2 position, which represents the oxidation product of an unsaturated acyl chain. This hydrophilic side chain is expected to be folded to the polar region of the membrane, yielding a structure best described by a lysolipid-like inverted cone (7Moumtzi A. Trenker M. Flicker K. Zenzmaier E. Saf R. Hermetter A. J. Lipid Res.. 2007; 48: 565-582Google Scholar). Addition of such nonbilayer lipids to model membranes is known to bend lipid monolayers, and it may well assist in the formation of highly curved structures also in cell membranes (9McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L. Nature.. 2005; 438: 590-596Google Scholar). In turn, such lipids are expected to become energetically trapped and thereby enriched in bent membrane regions (9McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L.

It can therefore be expected that local enrichment of PGPC may exert dramatic changes onto the structure of the plasma membrane, whereas low amounts of PGPC may be a proper tool to sense highly curved plasma membrane regions. In this study, we investigated the uptake mechanism of oxidized phospholipids in living cells at the single molecule level. The movement of individual fluorescent phospholipids could be readily imaged using ultra-sensitive fluorescence microscopy (13Schütz G.J. Kada G. Pastushenko V.P. Schindler H. EMBO J.. 2000; 19: 892-901Google Scholar), yielding trajectories characteristic for free Brownian motion, which were frequently interrupted by transient halts. We provide evidence that the observed halts correspond to the unspecific trapping of the molecules in endocytotic structures such as caveolae and clathrin-coated pits; the association and dissociation kinetics were determined and related to the mobility of the diffusing probe in the plasma membrane.

Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, lacking LDL receptor activity (ldlA7 cells) and ldlA7 cells expressing high levels of recombinant SR-BI (ldlA7-SRBI), were the kind gift of M. Krieger, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Cells were maintained in medium A (1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria), supplemented with 5% FCS Gold (PAA Laboratories) and 0.25 mg/ml G418 (PAA Laboratories)). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK), kindly provided by K. Groschner, Karl-Franzens-University Graz, Austria, were maintained in DMEM (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% FCS Gold, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HEK cells stably transfected with CaveolinYFP were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS Gold, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Sigma), and 0.8% G418. Fluorescence Labeling of Cells—Cells were incubated at 37 °C with PGPE-Alexa647 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 nm directly from buffer solution (PBS: 170 nm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) on the microscope stage. Experiments were performed immediately after incubation. For colocalization studies with transferrin, HEK cells were incubated with 4 nm PGPE-Alexa647 at 4 °C for 30 min, rinsed with PBS before the measurement, mounted on the microscope stage, incubated with 0.05 μg/ml transferrin-Alexa555, and then imaged in two colors. To measure colocalization with CaveolinYFP, HEK-CaveolinYFP cells were incubated with 4 nm PGPE-Alexa647 at 37 °C for 30 min. Microscopy and Image Processing—Single molecule experiments were performed as described in detail elsewhere (13Schütz G.J. Kada G. Pastushenko V.P. Schindler H. EMBO J.. 2000; 19: 892-901Google Scholar). In brief, samples were mounted on a modified epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200 TV, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) placed inside a home-built temperature-controlled incubator (T = 37 °C). The 647 nm line of a krypton laser (Innova 300, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) was used for excitation of Alexa647, the 514 nm line of an argon laser (2020 series, Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) for excitation of YFP or Alexa555. Samples were illuminated with excitation intensities up to 15 kilowatts/cm2 for illumination times till ranging from 1 to 5 ms. Precise timing of till and the delay between two consecutive illuminations tdelay was achieved using acousto-optical modulators (Isomet 1205C). Emitted fluorescence was collected using a ×100 oil-immersion objective (Plan-Apochromat NA = 1.4 or α-Plan Fluar NA = 1.45 for HILO microscopy, Zeiss). Emitted signals were split into two-color channels using a custom-made dichroic wedge (Chroma) and imaged on a back-illuminated, liquid-nitrogen cooled CCD-camera (Micro Max 1300-PB, Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Dichroic emission filters and the wedge coating were optimized for simultaneous Alexa555 and Alexa647 imaging. Excitation via HILO was set up as described (14Tokunaga M. Imamoto N. Sakata-Sogawa K. Nat. Meth.. 2008; 5: 159-161Google Scholar). Starting from TIR excitation, the inclination of the excitation beam was reduced slightly below the critical angle, so that penetration into the measurement chamber became observable. A field stop was used to confine the range of the excitation light sheet. We used the HILO approach in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, A and C, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6B.FIGURE 4PGPE-Alexa647 immobilization and uptake. A, white trajectory shows the immobilization of a single PGPE-Alexa647 molecule in a CaveolinYFP-positive structure inside the plasma membrane of HEK-CaveolinYFP cells.

A, time duration for periods of transient immobilization toff is plotted as a cumulative density function (cdf). The offset in toff originates from the threshold criterion for mobility classification and is taken into account by fitting with the function cdf = 1 - exp((-(toff +Δtoff))/τapp), with Δtoff = 0.3 s. For control CHO cells (circles) and SR-BI overexpressing CHO cells (diamonds), we find time constants τapp = 0.52 s and τapp = 0.24 s, respectively. After correction for photobleaching, we can specify τoff = 0.90 s for control cells and τoff = 0.85 s for the SR-BI-overexpressing cells. B, mobility of PGPE-Alexa647 in CHO cells. Periods of free diffusion were subjected to mobility analysis. The MSD was plotted versus the time lag for single PGPE-Alexa647 molecules in control cells (circles) and SR-BI-overexpressing cells (diamonds). Data were fitted according to MSD = 4Dtlag + 4σ2xy, with σxy specifying the localization precision. The fit yielded D = 1.76 ± 0.05 μm2/s for control cells (dashed line) and D = 2.45 ± 0.11 μm2/s for the SR-BI-overexpressing cells (solid line). A localization precision of 40 nm was found.

After incubation with 10 μm PGPC, we observed a dramatically enhanced mobility characterized by a 2.5-fold increased diffusion constant of D = 3.30 ± 0.33 μm2/s (diamonds and full line). The inset shows data recorded at 12-fold higher frame rate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To facilitate spectroscopic separation for the identification of two different dyes in colocalization experiments, we used a timing protocol as described previously (15Moertelmaier M.A. Kögler E.J. Hesse J. Sonnleitner M. Huber L.A. Schütz G.J. Single Mol.. 2002; 3: 225-231Google Scholar). In brief, we toggled the illumination between 514 and 647 nm excitation with a delay of 1 ms, so that vesicles essentially did not move between the two excitation pulses. Images were further split in emission using the dichroic wedge described above. By this, we measure four images corresponding to each time point on a macroscopic time scale. A sequence of such image quadruples was recorded with a time delay of typically 1 s. All images were analyzed and processed using MATLAB algorithms. Probability density functions were generated using the built-in MATLAB function ksdensity (kernel “epanechnikov”). For determination of colocalization, images were corrected for autofluorescence as described previously (15Moertelmaier M.A. Kögler E.J. Hesse J. Sonnleitner M. Huber L.A. Schütz G.J. Single Mol.. 2002; 3: 225-231Google Scholar). To correct for image distortions in two-color microscopy, TetraSpeck™ fluorescent microspheres (100 nm diameter, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used as fiducials to calculate an image correction matrix (16Koyama-Honda I. Ritchie K. Fujiwara T. Iino R. Murakoshi H. Kasai R.S. Kusumi A. Biophys. J.. 2005; 88: 2126-2136Google Scholar); all two-color images were corrected accordingly. For vesicle colocalization (Fig. 1), we identified endocytosed and mobile PGPE-Alexa647 positive structures. Only those vesicles were counted as being colocalized, where co-movement over multiple frames was observed in the green and red color channel. Single Molecule Analysis—Images were analyzed using in-house algorithms implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks). Individual diffraction limited signals were selected and fitted with a Gaussian intensity profile, yielding the single molecule position r→(t) with accuracy σ. Single molecule trajectories were reconstructed according to previous studies (13Schütz G.J. Kada G. Pastushenko V.P. Schindler H. EMBO J.. 2000; 19: 892-901Google Scholar), and the mean square displacement shown in Equation 1, MSD(tlag)=〈(r→(t+tlag)−r→(t))2〉(Eq. 1) was calculated as a function of the time lag tlag = till + tdelay. Lateral diffusion constants D were determined according to MSD = 4Dtlag + 4σ2xy (17Schütz G.J. Schindler H. Schmidt T. Biophys. J.. 1997; 73: 1073-1080Google Scholar), with σxy specifying the localization precision of ∼40 nm. Periods of transient immobilization were identified based on a threshold criterion for the observed step-length l; two consecutive observations of l < I<4⋅0.03μm2/s⋅tlag were classified as immobile and the rest as mobile. With this criterion, erroneous classifications of less than 0.1% are expected. Photobleaching limits the total length of single molecule trajectories, thereby introducing a bias toward shorter lifetimes of the individual modes of motion. To correct for this effect, we derived an analytical description of the respective probability distribution of the measured immobilization times. Let us assume that the duration of the two modes of motion, toff for periods of immobilization and ton for free diffusion, can be described by a Poisson process, i.e. the probability density functions are given by Equation 2, poff,on(toff,on)=1τoff,onexp(−toff,onτoff,on)(Eq. 2) with τoff,on the respective expectation values. Photobleaching is introduced by an exponential distribution (18Füreder-Kitzmüller E. Hesse J. Ebner A. Gruber H.J. Schütz G.J. Chem. Phys. Lett.. 2005; 404: 13-18Google Scholar) with a characteristic bleaching time τbl according to Equation 3, pbl(tbl)=1τblexp(tblτbl)(Eq. 3) which limits the total length of individual trajectories irrespective of the mode of motion. We can therefore expect the observation of trajectories of the following types: (i) no transition, i.e. one mode of motion for the whole observation period; (ii) one transition, i.e. different modes of motion in the beginning and in the end; (iii) two transitions, i.e. the same mode of motion in the beginning and in the end, interrupted by the second mode. If more than two transitions were observed, only the first two transitions were taken into account. Note that only case iii allows for the measurement of a duration τoff or τon. The probability distribution for measuring transient immobilization within the time window (toff, toff + dtoff) according to case iii is given by Equation 4, pall(toff)dtoff=τonτoff+τonpoff(toff)⋅pbl(tbl>toff+ton|toff)dtoff(Eq. 4) It is the product of the probability for an observation starting with free diffusion, τon/(τoff + τon), for the occurrence of τoff, poff(toff), and the probability that the bleaching time is long enough to enable such an observation as shown in Equation 5, pbl(tbl>toff+ton|toff)=τblτon+τblexp(−toffτbl)(Eq. 5) In total, we find Equation 6, palldtoff=τonτoff+τon⋅τblτon+τbl⋅1τoffexpdtoff,τapp=τoffτblτoff+τbl(Eq. 6) The measured values for toff yield the apparent expectation value τapp as observable, which depends solely on the “true” lifetime, τoff, and the photobleaching time τbl. To obtain an independent measure of τbl, we compared the probabilities for the occurrence of the trajectory classes. The probability for observing two transitions, one for immobilization and the second for release, in a trajectory starting with free Brownian motion provides the second observable value, which is given by Equation 7, Ptype iii=∫0∞p(toff)dtoff=1τoffτblτon+τblτapp=τblτoff+τblτblτon+τbl(Eq. 7) with Equation 8, p(toff)dtoff=1τoff⋅τblτon+τblexp(−toffτapp)dtoff(Eq. 8) Finally, the ratio α between the length of the mobile segments (τon) and immobile segments (τoff) is equal to the ratio of the number of trajectories starting with a mobile segment and trajectories starting with an immobile segment, yielding the third observable value shown in Equation 9, α=τonτoff(Eq. 9) From Equations 6, 7, and 9, the three unknowns τoff, τon, and τbl were calculated. Endocytosis of Oxidized Phospholipids via Caveolae and Clathrin-coated Pits—To investigate the uptake of oxidized phospholipids (oxPL), we used a fluorescent analogue of PGPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-N-Alexa647-ethanolamine (PGPE-Alexa647), which has been recently described to mimic closely the behavior of unlabeled PGPC (7Moumtzi A. Trenker M. Flicker K. Zenzmaier E. Saf R. Hermetter A. J. Lipid Res.. 2007; 48: 565-582Google Scholar). Cells were incubated directly on the microscope with the fluorescent compound at 37 °C. Immediately upon incubation, we found accumulation in sites along the plasma membrane, internalization, and active transport to perinuclear regions (Fig. 1 and supplemental Movie 1, Movie 2, and Movie 4). Similar observations were made in HEK cells and CHO cells. To identify the uptake pathway, we measured the colocalization with markers for the clathrin-coated pit and caveolar pathway. In HEK cells, 42% of all endocytosed PGPE-Alexa647 positive structures were found to colocalize with transferrin-Alexa555, which labels the clathrin-coated pit pathway (19Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol.. 2000; 149: 901-914Google Scholar). Active cotransport along cytoskeletal elements was observed using video microscopy (supplemental Movie 1 and Movie 2). Uptake via the caveolar pathway was addressed in a stably transfected CaveolinYFP HEK cell line; 57% of PGPE-Alexa647 positive structures colocalized with CaveolinYFP. We conclude that PGPE-Alexa647 is endocytosed via at least two independent uptake pathways. Scavenger Receptor SR-BI Modulates Endocytotic Uptake of PGPE-Alexa647—Because cells in blood vessels may be exposed to oxPL via lipoproteins, we tested the influence of the well characterized lipoprotein SR-BI (20Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science.. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar, 21Stangl H. Hyatt M. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 32692-32698Google Scholar, 22Swarnakar S. Temel R.E. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 29733-29739Google Scholar) on the uptake efficiency of PGPE-Alexa647. SR-BI is known to facilitate cholesterol and phospholipid uptake directly by its ability to bind lipoproteins and to transfer lipids but also indirectly by altering the ultra-structure of the plasma membrane (23Parathath S. Connelly M.A. Rieger R.A. Klein S.M. Abumrad N.A. de la Llera-Moya M. Iden C.R. Rothblat G.H. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 41310-41318Google Scholar, 24Williams D.L. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. J. Lipid Res.. 2002; 43: 544-549Google Scholar). Indeed, when we applied PGPE-Alexa647 to CHO cells overexpressing SR-BI, we found a 3.4-fold increase in the average brightness of endocytosed structures when compared with control CHO cells (Fig. 2); the intracellular trafficking and subcellular location, however, was not affected. Apparently, SR-BI expression leads to an enrichment of oxPL at endocytotic sites. Such enrichment may be due to an increase in plasma membrane insertion of oxPL, an increase in association to endocytotic sites, or a decrease in efflux from these sites. To discriminate the individual contributions, we investigated the behavior of PGPE-Alexa647 in the plasma membrane at the single molecule level. Movement of Single PGPE-Alexa647 Molecules in the Plasma Membrane of Living Cells—For detection of single PGPE-Alexa647 molecules, we reduced the loading concentration by a factor of 50. Typically, the surface density was smaller than 1 molecule per μm2. Because PGPE-Alexa647 unspecifically adhered to the glass surface, we performed all experiments on the top membrane of the cells. To reduce background signal arising from the glass surface, from endocytosed PGPE-Alexa647 or from cellular autofluorescence, we illuminated the cells with a HILO; by this wide field illumination configuration, the excitation volume can be confined to a narrow sheet roughly perpendicular to the optical axis (14Tokunaga M. Imamoto N. Sakata-Sogawa K. Nat. Meth.. 2008; 5: 159-161Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Time-resolved imaging enabled us to follow single PGPE-Alexa647 molecules moving in the plasma membrane of living cells. Fig. 3, B and C, show a typical example of a single molecule trajectory. After 450 ms of rapid Brownian motion (Fig. 3, B and C, green) the molecule was transiently immobilized for 1.2s (red) and got released again (see supplemental Movie 3). The distinct transitions between two different modes of motion were used later for quantitative dwell time analysis. It is tempting to speculate that locations of immobilization are equivalent to sites of endocytosis; in this view, an equilibrium accumulation of PGPE-Alexa647 would precede its endocytotic uptake. Indeed, we frequently observed the immobilization of single PGPE-Alexa647 molecules at CaveolinYFP-positive regions in the plasma membrane of HEK cells (Fig. 4A). Consistently, fluctuations in the fluorescence signals at such sites correspond to the characteristic brightness of single PGPE-Alexa647 molecules as shown in Fig. 4C. Occasionally, co-uptake of PGPE-Alexa647 and CaveolinYFP with subsequent intracellular co-transport has been observed (Fig. 4B and supplemental Movie 4). Single Molecule Dwell Time and Mobility Analysis—We next determined the mean residence time and association rate constant of single PGPE-Alexa647 molecules with sites of immobilization. For this purpose, every trajectory was fragmented into periods of free diffusion and transient immobilization, and the respective time durations ton and toff were analyzed. The dwell time distribution for periods of immobilization is in good agreement with an exponential function, yielding a characteristic time constant τapp = 0.52 s (Fig. 5A, circles) in control CHO cells. It has to be noted that time durations shorter than 300 ms (equivalent to two subsequent frames) have been disregarded in the fragmentation procedure; still, they are taken implicitly into account by including an offset Δtoff in the exponential fit. Because of photobleaching of the dye molecules, the measured dwell time distribution is biased toward shorter values. We corrected for this effect based on an analytical description of the respective probability distribution (see “Experimental Procedures”), yielding the lifetime of PGPE-Alexa647 in endocytotic sites of CHO cells of τoff = 0.90 s. The kinetic on-rate of the molecules kon = τon–1 is fully described by τoff and the equilibrium dissociation constant defined as the ratio of mobile and immobile molecules at a given instant of time, α = τon/τoff. For determination of α, only the first five images of a recording sequence were taken into account. This ensures that the data are not biased because of photobleaching. α was calculated as the ratio of the number of trajectories starting with a mobile segment to trajectories starting with an immobile segment, yielding α = 2.2 and τon = α·τoff = 1.98 s. The mobile segments of each trajectory were further used for mobility analysis. We plotted the mean square displacement as a function of the time lag tlag, yielding a linear increase according to MSD = 4Dtlag + 4σ2xy; a lateral diffusion constant D = 1.76 ± 0.05 μm2/s was obtained (Fig. 5B, circles). Effect of SR-BI Expression on Single Molecule Properties—To identify the mechanism of SRBI-mediated uptake enhancement, we studied the influence of SR-BI overexpression on the movement of single PGPE-Alexa647 molecules. The probe inserted rapidly into the plasma membrane of CHO cells overexpressing SR-BI, with a slightly increased surface density compared with the control cells by a factor of ∼1.4. Analysis of single molecule trajectories in SR-BI-overexpressing cells revealed a duration of immobilization τoff = 0.85 s (Fig. 5A, diamonds). This value is similar to the respective value determined for the control cells. However, we found a 1.6-fold decreased equilibrium dissociation constant α (α = 1.37), concomitant with a decreased time period of free Brownian motion τon = 1.16 s. See Table 1 for a list of all determined parameters obtained from single molecule trajectories.TABLE 1Dissociation constant α, dwell times τon, τoff, diffusion constant D, and number of analyzed trajectories n for single PGPE-Alexa647 molecules recorded in the indicated cell lines Cav means caveolin.CHO controlCHO-SRBIHEK-CavYFPHEK-CavYFP + PGPCα2.21.373.52.9τon (s)1.981.163.11.34τoff (s)"

As transforming as the first atomic resolution view of myoglobin in the late 1950s, scientists can now use a suite of single molecule technologies to watch protein macromolecular machines executing their functions “in real time.” This Essay highlights applications and challenges of single molecule studies in structural biology, cell biology, and biotechnology. Valuable information is often lost when data from a large population are examined in aggregate. To illustrate this, let us consider the recent and historic presidential election, where the popular vote favored Barack Obama (53%) over John McCain (46%). These numbers convey the outcome, but little more. However, progressively greater insight into American sociology and culture can be derived from the voting records of each of the 50 states, from individual counties within these states, and finally from exit polls of individual voters. In biology, measurements of individuals also can reveal new information that would otherwise be lost in ensemble averages. Biochemists and biophysicists have traditionally used fluorimeters or spectrophotometers in their trade, which at best detect the activity of 50 million proteins (∼a femptomole). However, many are now turning toward microscopes that can measure outputs from single molecules. In addition to enabling researchers to study vanishingly small amounts of material, single molecule technologies permit analysis of heterogeneous molecular populations or complex kinetics and dynamics of chemically identical molecules. Furthermore, single molecule measurements have allowed the study of protein outputs that previously were very difficult to explore (e.g., forces and steps of molecular motors). Applying a similar logic on a larger scale, cell biologists are uncovering new information about how cells make decisions and integrate information from their environment by measuring outputs from individual cells. The broad impact of single molecule technologies also illustrates how rapid advances can be made through physicists, biologists, and chemists working together to solve important problems in the biological sciences. Physicists and biophysicists have contributed by developing new microscopes that can measure outputs of single molecules with stunning accuracy. Biologists and chemists have participated in this partnership by engineering molecules and developing fluorescent dyes for single molecule assays. As pioneers continue to push the limits of what can be measured at the single molecule level, they have left behind a “wake” of mature and readily accessible technologies and methods. Indeed, many single molecule measurements have become relatively easy to perform. One goal of this Essay is to encourage more laboratories to incorporate these techniques into their routine toolkit for studying macromolecules both in vitro and in vivo. A brief history of single molecule measurements in biology illuminates the trajectory of the field and the diverse methodologies that have emerged. The development of patch clamp recordings by Neher and Sakmann in 1976 represented the birth of single molecule measurements. This revolutionary technique, capable of measuring the 10−12 amps of current flowing through a single ion channel, enabled researchers to measure individual opening and closing events, reflecting the underlying conformational changes in the pore of the ion channel. Despite the enormous benefit of patch clamp measurements to neurophysiology and the biophysical understanding of ion channels (and awarding of the Nobel Prize to Neher and Sakmann in 1991), it took many years before single molecule measurements spread to other biological disciplines. Perhaps ion channels were viewed as a “special case,” given that the signal (current) from a single molecule could be greatly amplified. However, outputs of single molecules can be measured with clever assays that do not require sophisticated technologies. Probably more likely, biochemists in the 1970s and 1980s did not yet envisage a compelling reason to invest their energies in making single molecule measurements. The spectrofluorimeter still ruled the kingdom. One of the first “single molecule” experiments to follow ion channels was the measurement of individual microtubules (Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). The polymerization of tubulin into cylindrical 25 nm diameter microtubules was routinely measured by detecting the scattered light using a spectrophotometer. When the polymerization reaction reached a steady state (polymer mass remaining constant), little change in microtubule length was expected, as the rates of subunit addition and dissociation should be equal. By looking at individual microtubules by immunofluorescence and measuring their length at steady state, Mitchison and Kirschner discovered surprisingly that some of the microtubules in the population were growing longer, whereas others were becoming shorter. From these single microtubule observations, the investigators correctly postulated that this unexpected “dynamic instability” was due to hydrolysis of GTP by tubulin after it became incorporated into the microtubule. At about the same time, the relatively new technology of video microscopy (acquiring images with a camera rather than by eye) allowed Horio and Hotani, 1986Horio T. Hotani H. Nature. 1986; 321: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar to watch and record the “live” growth and shrinkage of single microtubules by dark field video microscopy, illustrating the power of observing individual macromolecules over time (Movie S1 available online). Today, dynamic instability is easily appreciated by watching single GFP-tagged microtubules grow and shrink in living cells using time-lapse microscopy. These experiments on single microtubules provide marvelous examples of how new mechanistic insights can emerge from studying individuals rather than populations. Single microtubule observations continue to yield new surprises and discoveries. For example, differences in the growth and shrinkage kinetics of single microtubules in living cells versus that measured for pure tubulin in vitro are leading to discoveries of how microtubule-associated proteins modulate dynamic instability. The tale of microtubule dynamics provides a paradigm in which the biochemistry of a molecular machine is dissected in vitro and then the regulation of this process is understood in the context of living cells, with the observations of single macromolecules contributing prominently to both levels of investigation. The next round of single molecule measurements centered around cytoskeletal motor proteins. Early observations of organelle transport in reconstituted assays suggested that few or possibly one kinesin motor might suffice to transport cargo. By systematically varying the density of purified kinesin adsorbed onto a glass slide surface, a single kinesin molecule was indeed shown to be capable of moving processively along a microtubule for several microns (Howard et al., 1989Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Here, a relatively large object (a microtubule) that could be easily imaged by conventional microscopy provided a means for measuring the output of a much smaller, “invisible” molecule (a kinesin motor). Using a similar general strategy, the rotation of the central γ-polypeptide subunit in the F1-ATPase was observed using an attached fluorescently labeled actin filament (easily visualized by conventional microscopy) (Movie S2) (Noji et al., 1997Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). This experiment elegantly proved, beyond any doubt, the Nobel Prize winning hypothesis of rotating catalysis championed by Boyer and Walker. Thus, very successful single molecule experiments have been and still can be performed with simple, conventional types of microscopy, provided that one has the right type of assay. With the realization that purified enzymes could be assayed at the single molecule level, researchers began to measure more challenging outputs, such as the steps and forces produced by molecular motors. Huxley and Simmons, 1971Huxley A.F. Simmons R.M. Nature. 1971; 233: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar first tackled this problem, not by measuring single molecules but by attempting to synchronize the power strokes of the thousands of myosins in a muscle fiber. By quickly releasing the tension in an isometrically contracting muscle fiber, they measured the force recovery in the ensuing few milliseconds, a time during which attached, “primed” myosin motors could complete a force-producing conformational change but too fast for new motors to engage and go through another round of ATP hydrolysis. The Huxley and Simmons estimates of the force and step size of single myosins were remarkably close to currently accepted values, but this heroic measurement was difficult to perform and could not be extended to other force-generating systems that could not be studied with a tensiometer. Two decades passed before technologies and assays enabled the direct measurement of forces and steps from single motors. The first studies used thin microneedles with attached actin filaments that were cast onto awaiting myosin filaments. Like a fishing rod being bent by a powerful fish, the deflections of the microneedle reported the forces exerted by myosin upon the filament (Kishino and Yanagida, 1988Kishino A. Yanagida T. Nature. 1988; 334: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). A few years later, optical traps (which exploit forces generated as a result of focusing a powerful laser beam upon a small ∼1 μm bead) were used to measure the pN forces and nanometer steps taken by single kinesin and myosin motors (Svoboda et al., 1993Svoboda K. Schmidt C.F. Schnapp B.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, Finer et al., 1994Finer J.T. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of optical trapping microscopes is amazing, given that the forces produced by single motors (usually ∼5 pN) are several orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational attraction occurring between the reader and this issue of Cell (assuming that you are one of the rare individuals who is actually reading a hard copy of the journal). Optical trapping has proven to be a powerful and versatile technology for understanding the forces produced by proteins as well as how these machines respond to an applied force. Other single molecule nanomanipulation methods such as atomic force microscopy and magnetic tweezers also are now widely used for such purposes. Single molecule measurements were originally restricted to laboratories that had the expertise to build their own optical bench microscopes. For most biologists, these experiments appeared sufficiently daunting that they did not consider such work. However, this situation is changing. Consider the trajectory of single molecule fluorescence measurements. Detection of single fluorescent dye molecules was first achieved in 1989, and their imaging was advanced a few years later using near-field scanning microscopes. These pioneering experiments were influential for photophysics and illustrated what was possible to achieve, but the early technology was complex and not applicable to biological samples (performed under a vacuum, often at very low temperatures). Only a few years later, new methods brought single molecule fluorescence experiments into the realm of biology. In particular, Yanagida and colleagues realized that recently developed cameras were sufficiently sensitive to detect the photons emitted from a single fluorophore and that the key to their detection was to eliminate background from autofluorescence and out-of-focus fluorescence dyes, which swamped the signal from the single fluorophore (just as stars cannot be discerned amidst the “background” light of the noontime sun). These investigators showed that single molecule detection was achievable by confocal imaging with some effort, but they also discovered that the less widely used method of total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illumination was a particularly effective and simple method for imaging single fluorophores (Funatsu et al., 1995Funatsu T. Harada Y. Tokunaga M. Saito K. Yanagida Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Moreover, this wide-field imaging method could be performed in aqueous buffer and with rapid (e.g., 30 frame/s) acquisition, conditions that were familiar and friendly for biological experimentation. Now, single molecule fluorescence imaging can be readily achieved in virtually any laboratory, provided that one has ∼$200,000 in financial resources. Several commercial vendors package laser-based TIRF systems with outstanding objectives (1.49 N.A.) that optimize photon collection and make alignment of total internal reflection illumination relatively easy. Improved dichroic mirrors and new high-sensitivity cameras (particularly the new EM-CCD cameras) offer exceptionally high sensitivity and very low noise. In the Woods Hole Physiology Course, it is possible to set up a commercial single molecule TIRF system during the day and have students make movies of single molecules in vitro or in vivo by dinner time (Movie S3). In addition, new fluorescent dyes (e.g., Cy3) and quantum dots produce brighter signals with less photobleaching than earlier dyes. Optical traps also are becoming easier to build and commercial microscopes with optical trapping microscopes recently have entered the market. One can dispel the myth that single molecule imaging is “too hard” for most biology laboratories to undertake. This is not to say that all single molecule experiments are easy! As some experiments have become easier, researchers are constantly pushing single molecule technologies. As an example, Block and colleagues (Abbondanzieri et al., 2005Abbondanzieri E.A. Greenleaf W.J. Shaevitz J.W. Landick R. Block S.M. Nature. 2005; 438: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) have refined their optical trap so that it can measure polymerase stepping at the level of individual DNA bases (3.4 Angstroms; approximately 3-fold the diameter of a hydrogen atom). However, achieving this resolution required a high degree of vibration isolation, including enclosing part of the microscope in an atmosphere of helium. The codon-by-codon movement of a ribosome along an mRNA also has been measured, providing the first dynamic picture of protein translation (Wen et al., 2008Wen J.D. Lancaster L. Hodges C. Zeri A.C. Yoshimura S.H. Noller H.F. Bustamante C. Tinoco I. Nature. 2008; 452: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These are just two examples of many remarkable experimental efforts to extract fine details of how molecular machines work. Although such initial breakthroughs often involve complex instruments and assays, a natural progression is to make these measurements easier for the next generation of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows within a lab and subsequently have the techniques disseminated to other laboratories (sometimes through commercialization). Single molecule measurements have made their biggest impact in studying the mechanisms and properties of biological macromolecules in vitro. Steady-state measurements of large numbers of molecules can obscure interesting behavior (e.g., the example of microtubules discussed above). Pre-steady-state kinetics measurements tend to be more informative, but rather difficult synchronization methods (e.g., millisecond mixing of a ligand with an enzyme or the mechanical release of muscle fibers) are required to tease out time-dependent reactions in large populations. Measuring single molecules removes these constraints, as one can follow time-dependent changes directly with very small amounts of material and without confounding signals of “out-of-step” molecules. Moreover, one can build up statistics from measurements on many molecules, allowing determination of rate constants that have been measured by population pre-steady-state kinetics. Biochemical kinetics can now be performed with a microscope instead of a spectrofluorimeter. But single molecule measurements are not just a new way of performing traditional biochemistry, they are providing insights into macromolecules that simply were not accessible by earlier methods. Using optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers, glass needles, or atomic force microscopy, it is possible to poke, bend, twist, pull, or otherwise torture single molecules with infinite variation and creativity. In addition to the inherent joy of being able to master something so small, these techniques are opening up entire new fields, allowing biophysicists to understand how proteins generate and respond to force and how physical interactions hold macromolecules together (e.g., protein and nucleic acid folding). A great deal of information, however, is still missing from most single molecule measurements, namely the precise structural changes that occur as a protein moves, catalyzes a reaction, or responds to force. In contrast, X-ray crystallography provides the necessary atomic resolution information that one seeks, but alas, the atomic model is an average of large numbers of “nondynamic” proteins in a crystal. Perhaps the biggest challenge is to bridge the information gap between high-resolution models derived from crystallographic techniques and the lower resolution, dynamic measurements made by single molecule microscopes (Figure 1). It would be wonderful to watch a “movie” of a single protein executing its activities at near atomic resolution or see how its structure deforms under tension. But the “premier showing” of such a movie is a long way off, largely due to the inherent limitations in pushing spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously. However, single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (to measure nanometer-scale changes in protein structure; Figure 1) and fluorescence anisotropy (to measure orientation changes in protein domains) provide windows into protein structure, albeit a fuzzy and partial view. These experiments are still quite laborious, usually limited by one's ability to label molecules with fluorescent dyes in specific locations. A very productive hour on a single molecule microscope might represent the culmination of a year's effort of protein engineering and chemical labeling. Thus, improving methods for obtaining readouts of structure and conformational changes represents an important challenge for the single molecule field. Would such a technological push be worth the effort? The answer is likely “yes,” as we still have much to learn about the dynamics of protein machines that cannot be gained from X-ray crystallography. For example, tension sensing is becoming increasingly interesting to cell biologists and biophysicists. By combining “nano manipulations” (e.g., optical and magnetic traps, and atomic force microscopes that apply tension to individual proteins or larger complexes such as ribosomes or focal adhesions) with conformational FRET sensors or readouts of chemical states (e.g., the nucleotide state of an enzyme; Adachi et al., 2007Adachi K. Oiwa K. Nishizaka T. Furuike S. Noji H. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Cell. 2007; 130: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, Sakamoto et al., 2008Sakamoto T. Webb M.R. Forgacs E. White H. Sellers J.R. Nature. 2008; 455: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), new insights might be gained about how proteins respond to tension. Single molecule measurements also might revise our standard textbook portrayal of protein “machines” as invariant robots that proceed through a series of stereotypical chemical and structural states. A few studies with single molecule probes have found that proteins can rapidly fluctuate between conformations (even with the same chemical intermediate in the active site) or can show slower time-dependent variations in output. For example, work by Xie and colleagues reveals that a single cholesterol oxidase enzyme fluctuates between bursts of fast turnovers and then a series of slower turnovers, which they attribute to the enzyme shifting between different conformational states (Lu et al., 1998Lu H.P. Xun L. Xie X.S. Science. 1998; 282: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Time-dependent changes in dynein's step size also have been observed, which might reflect different conformational states (Gennerich et al., 2007Gennerich A. Carter A.P. Reck-Peterson S.L. Vale R.D. Cell. 2007; 131: 952-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Variations between single molecules in, for example, the velocity of one motor protein compared with another may reflect different posttranslational modifications or perhaps even long-lived structural states (loosely analogous to distinct conformational states of a prion protein). To address such questions, improved tools are needed for connecting single molecule output to an understanding of protein structure. We also need to train a new generation of investigators who can think and work fluidly with classical structural methods and single molecule techniques. Single molecule studies in vitro have stimulated a new frontier of single molecule measurements within cells, mainly using fluorescence techniques. However, living cells pose several additional challenges compared with in vitro observations, such as higher intrinsic background fluorescence and greater difficulty in fluorescently tagging macromolecules. For eliminating background fluorescence and achieving single molecule detection, total internal reflection illumination provides a powerful means of imaging single fluorescently tagged proteins at or near the plasma membranes of living cells. Such methods have allowed, for example, the diffusional motion of plasma membrane proteins and protein-protein interactions within membrane microdomains (Douglass and Vale, 2005Douglass A.D. Vale R.D. Cell. 2005; 121: 937-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), the turnover and stoichiometry of protein complexes (e.g., bacterial flagella; Leake et al., 2006Leake M.C. Chandler J.H. Wadhams G.H. Bai F. Berry R.M. Armitage J.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and the dynamics of actin filaments (Watanabe and Mitchison, 2002Watanabe N. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2002; 295: 1083-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). TIRF is effective for imaging single molecules near the plasma membrane but cannot be used to probe deeper structures. However, other strategies have allowed researchers to image the actions of single molecules in the interstices of the cell. One recent method, called highly inclined thin illumination (which can be readily implemented by most TIRF microscopes), has been used to image single green fluorescent protein (GFP) molecules at the nuclear envelope (Tokunaga et al., 2008Tokunaga M. Imamoto N. Sakata-Sogawa K. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Another strategy is to use quantum dots, which shine above the background fluorescence of the cytoplasm. But delivery of quantum dots to the inside of cells is problematic, unless they are taken up by the cell through endocytosis. An alternative strategy is to increase signal by attaching several fluorophores to one molecule. As an example, tracking of single ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles within the nucleus was achieved by targeting several GFP fluorophores to a single mRNA (Shav-Tal et al., 2004Shav-Tal Y. Darzacq X. Shenoy S.M. Fusco D. Janicki S.M. Spector D.L. Singer R.H. Science. 2004; 304: 1797-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In some cases, one can amplify the output of a single molecule. For example, Cai et al., 2006Cai L. Friedman N. Xie X.S. Nature. 2006; 440: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar could detect bursts of gene expression leading to the production of one or a few β-galactosidase molecules using enzymatic activity to produce fluorescent molecules from a nonfluorescent substrate. Single molecule fluorescence detection also has been used to “beat” the diffraction-limited resolution barrier of the light microscope. When the light emitted from a single molecule is collected by an objective lens, the energy spreads into a Gaussian-shaped “point spread function” (psf). When the broadened images of two fluorophores begin to overlap on a detector, they merge into a single profile and are no longer discernable as two molecules, thus limiting resolution. However, the central position of the psf can be determined with the precision of a few nanometers, provided that sufficient numbers of photons are collected. Such “centroid” determination of psf has been used to track the motion of fluorescently labeled motor proteins in vitro and in vivo, enabling observation of individual motor-driven steps (Yildiz et al., 2003Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R. Science. 2003; 300: 2061-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Now, new methods such as PALM (PhotoActivated Light Microscopy; Betzig et al., 2006Betzig E. Patterson G.H. Sougrat R. Lindwasser O.W. Olenych S. Bonifacino J.S. Davidson M.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hess H.F. Science. 2006; 313: 1642-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (5634) Google Scholar), the related fPALM (Hess et al., 2006Hess S.T. Girirajan T.P. Mason M.D. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 4258-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar), and STORM (Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy; Bates et al., 2007Bates M. Huang B. Dempsey G.T. Zhuang X. Science. 2007; 317: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) take advantage of this strategy to build high-resolution fluorescent images of molecules, mainly in fixed cells (Figure 2). In PALM and STORM, brief laser pulses are used to turn on a subset of the photoactivatable fluorophore-tagged proteins, photons are collected until they are photobleached or switched off, and the centroids of these single molecules are measured at ∼20 nm resolution. By repeated photoactivations of new fluorophores, a high-resolution spatial map of the protein emerges from the centroid positions of many single molecules. Both photoswitchable cyanine dye pairs (STORM; different pairs allow for multiple wavelength excitation) and photoactivatable fluorescent proteins (PALM) have been used to implement this method. The recent flurry of single molecule measurements in cells foreshadows what is likely to become an exciting research area, but there are still many technical barriers to be addressed. The unstable fluorescence signal and photobleaching rate of GFP are problematic for single molecule measurements. Improved dyes and new ways of incorporating such dyes into genetically encoded proteins (e.g., HaloTag) will likely extend experimental possibilities. Quantum dots provide ample signal for making single molecule measurements in cells and even in tissues, but their relatively large size and multivalent chemistry creates problems for retaining native protein function in living cells. However, new methods for delivering quantum dots and monovalent chemistry (Howarth et al., 2008Howarth M. Liu W. Puthenveetil S. Zheng Y. Marshall L.F. Schmidt M.M. Wittrup K.D. Bawendi M.G. Ting A.Y. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) could extend their utility in cell biology. PALM and STORM are very promising and are likely to receive considerable attention in the next few years. PALM will benefit from more photoactivatable fluorescent proteins (currently two are available, but three- or four-color imaging will add more possibilities as is the case with STORM). Meanwhile, STORM could find new cell biological applications if ways are developed to attach the dyes directly to genetically encoded proteins (instead of through antibodies). Both methods will benefit from improved microscope automation to “build up” sequential single molecule images into high-resolution maps. But such advances are happening rapidly, as evidenced by a recent study demonstrating time-lapse PALM in living cells (still only useful for slowly changing cellular structures) (Shroff et al., 2008Shroff H. Galbraith C.G. Galbraith J.A. Betzig E. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The utility of such methods for high-resolution 3D imaging also has been demonstrated (Huang et al., 2008Huang B. Wang W. Bates M. Zhuang X. Science. 2008; 319: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). These techniques are being incorporated into commercial instruments for cell biology labs. Single molecule work in cells also awaits a next generation of assay development. Most live-cell studies currently just “follow the bouncing ball.” By tracking single molecule movement, one can determine if the motion is purely diffusional, restricted (reflecting boundaries or interactions with a “static” structure), or super-diffusional (reflecting directed transport). From such measurements, one can derive insight into the environment that the molecules experience inside the cell. Even direct observation of individual motor steps inside living cells is possible with sufficiently bright probes. In addition to “tracking” single fluorophores in living cells, new assays will be needed to measure outputs of single protein molecules, e.g., phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, ligand binding, and changes in protein conformation (e.g., relief of autoinhibition). Many of these events can be measured with FRET sensors (possibly using new quantum dots as donors; Howarth et al., 2008Howarth M. Liu W. Puthenveetil S. Zheng Y. Marshall L.F. Schmidt M.M. Wittrup K.D. Bawendi M.G. Ting A.Y. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), although other readouts are possible. By following the “biochemical histories” of single molecules, one can potentially gain new insights into spatial-temporal events and stochastic properties of signaling pathways. Single molecule detection also is likely to have a considerable impact in biotechnology. A recent advance has been the sequencing of single DNA molecules. Single molecule DNA sequencing has been long considered as a means of achieving higher fidelity (since error-prone PCR amplification is avoided) and potentially lower cost than other sequencing methods. Recently, this goal has been realized by investigators at Helicos Biosciences who have reported single molecule DNA sequencing of a viral genome (Harris et al., 2008Harris T.D. Buzby P.R. Babcock H. Beer E. Bowers J. Braslavsky I. Causey M. Colonell J. Dimeo J. Efcavitch J.W. et al.Science. 2008; 320: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Their technique involves attaching short fragments of genomic DNA to a surface at low enough densities so that individual DNA fragments can be distinguished by light microscopy. Then, one of the four nucleotides labeled with a fluorescent dye is added and DNA polymerase incorporates the dye-tagged nucleotide into the subset of DNA fragments that have a complementary nucleotide in the primed position. The slide is rinsed, hundreds of thousands of DNA fragments are imaged by fluorescence microscopy, and then the fluorescence dye is cleaved off to allow a new round of fluorescent nucleotide incorporation and imaging. By scoring the nucleotide cycles when the DNA fragment is “bright” or “dark,” its nucleotide sequence can be read. The next goal will be applying this method to the large human genome with sufficient coverage to enable rare mutations to be identified with confidence. This method potentially could be used to obtain information on epigenetic modifications (e.g., by using other fluorescent antibodies to methylated DNA). A second method for single molecule DNA sequencing (Greenleaf and Block, 2006Greenleaf W.J. Block S.M. Science. 2006; 313: 801Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) determined the precise positions of RNA polymerase pausing when one of each of the four bases was at low concentration. Although unlikely to become a low cost, high-throughput method, it provides a clear example of how watching the motion of an enzyme can provide detailed structural and chemical information about the substrate. Proteomics also will no doubt benefit from miniaturization and single molecule detection. Huang et al., 2007Huang B. Wu H. Bhaya D. Grossman A. Granier S. Kobilka B.K. Zare R.N. Science. 2007; 315: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar have taken an important first step in this direction by building a device to count the number of molecules of a specific protein present in a single cell. Their technology involves a microfluidic chip that can capture, lyse, and label the released proteins with a fluorescently labeled antibody. The protein-antibody complexes are then electrophoretically separated and individually counted by an intensified CCD camera as they flow through an observation channel. Other types of single molecule proteomic technologies will likely be developed in the future. Single molecule measurements are certainly technological highlights of the past two decades. These methods have played a prominent role in developing an understanding of kinesin, myosin, F1-ATPase, and RNA polymerase, providing paradigms of what it is possible to learn using these approaches. But this only represents a very small subset of the interesting proteins that deserve to be explored by single molecule techniques, leaving much to be done by the next generation of biophysicists. In living cells, researchers are still exploring how single molecule approaches might best be used to answer a large range of questions in biology. In an era of research characterized by a proliferation of standard kits, assays, and reagents, formulating the right question and developing the proper assay and instrumentation to peer into the lives of single molecules is a challenging but extremely rewarding undertaking. There is a lot left to explore, and scientists from many disciplines can contribute to such efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2011554394,"Stereotypical connections between olfactory sensory neuron axons and mitral cell dendrites in the olfactory bulb establish the first synaptic relay for olfactory perception. While mechanisms of olfactory sensory axon targeting are reported, molecular regulation of mitral cell dendritic growth and refinement are unclear. During embryonic development, mitral cell dendritic distribution overlaps with olfactory sensory axon terminals in the olfactory bulb. In this study, we investigate whether olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium influence mitral cell dendritic outgrowth in vitro. We report a soluble trophic activity in the olfactory epithelium conditioned medium which promotes mitral/tufted cell neurite outgrowth. While the trophic activity is present in both embryonic and postnatal olfactory epithelia, only embryonic but not postnatal mitral/tufted cells respond to this activity. We show that BMP2, 5 and 7 promote mitral/tufted cells neurite outgrowth. However, the BMP antagonist, Noggin, fails to neutralize the olfactory epithelium derived neurite growth promoting activity. We provide evidence that olfactory epithelium derived activity is a protein factor with molecular weight between 50-100 kD. We also observed that Follistatin can effectively neutralize the olfactory epithelium derived activity, suggesting that TGF-beta family proteins are involved to promote mitral/tufted dendritic elaboration."
https://openalex.org/W1993346441,"In earlier studies, we have shown that cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), a surrogate for cigarette smoke, is capable of transforming the spontaneously immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A. These transformed cells displayed upregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene, bcl-xl. Upregulation of this gene may impede the apoptotic pathway and allow the accumulation of DNA damage that can lead to cell transformation and carcinogenesis. In the present study, we have determined the mechanism of CSC-mediated transcriptional upregulation of bcl-xl gene expression in MCF10A cells. We cloned the human bcl-xl promoter (pBcl-xLP) and identified putative transcription factor binding sites. Sequential deletion constructs that removed the putative cis-elements were constructed and transfected into MCF10A cells to determine the CSC-responsive cis-element(s) on the pBcl-xLP. Gel-shift, super-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) specifically bound to a C/EBP-binding site on the pBcl-xLP in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, overexpression of C/EBPβ-LAP2 stimulated pBcl-xLP activity and Bcl-xL protein levels, which mimicked the conditions of CSC treatment. Our results indicate that C/EBPβ regulates bcl-xl gene expression in MCF10A cells in response to CSC treatment; therefore, making it a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention of cigarette smoke-induced breast carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2013551190,"The core components of the cell-cycle control system are governed by numerous additional regulators, which ensure that cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and anaphase-promoting complex (APC) activities are robustly and rapidly activated in the correct order and at the appropriate cell-cycle stage. Cyclin-Cdk activities are controlled by phosphorylation at inhibitory sites on the Cdk subunit, association with Cdk-inhibitory proteins (CKIs), transcriptional control of cyclins and other regulators, and the ubiquit-in-dependent proteolysis of cyclins and CKIs. APC activity is fine-tuned by inhibitory proteins that restrain its function outside mitosis.A multisubunit ubiquitin ligase called SCF contributes to early cell-cycle control by triggering the ubiquitination and destruction of some CKIs and G1/S cyclins. The SCF core (containing three subunits, not listed here) interacts with numerous F-box proteins that recruit specific substrates for ubiquitination. Typically, SCF targets must be phosphorylated by Cdks or other kinases to allow their recognition by F-box subunits of SCF.Progression through the cell cycle depends in part on transcriptional regulators, including the particularly well-understood regulators of G1/S gene expression at the begin-ning of the cycle. Prior to cell-cycle entry, these regulators interact with inhibitor proteins, blocking the activation of G1/S gene expression and, in some cases, actively repressing it. G1-Cdks phosphorylate and thereby inactivate these inhibitors, unleashing G1/S gene expression.Although the details vary among different species, the general scheme of eukaryotic cell-cycle control can be summarized as follows. In response to the appropriate extracel-lular signals or cell size, G1-Cdks trigger G1/S gene expression, leading to expression of G1/S and S cyclins and other components required for S phase events. G1/S-Cdk activation helps promote S-Cdk activation, at least in some cases, by phosphorylating CKIs and thereby targeting them to SCF for ubiquitination. G1/S- and S-Cdks then collaborate to initiate chromosome duplication and duplication of the spindle poles. M cyclins rise during S phase or thereafter, but M-Cdk complexes are initially restrained in many species by inhibitory phosphorylation by Wee1-related inhibitory kinases. Dephosphorylation by Cdc25-related phosphatases then triggers M-Cdk activation, resulting in mitotic spindle assembly and other preparations for chromosome segregation. When the chromosomes are aligned on the spindle, activation of APC"

https://openalex.org/W2025754671,"Self-association is an important biological phenomenon that is associated with many cellular processes. NMR relaxation measurements provide data about protein molecular dynamics at the atomic level and are sensitive to changes induced by self-association. Thus, measurements and analysis of NMR relaxation data can provide structurally resolved information on self-association that would not be accessible otherwise. Here, we present a computer program, NMRdyn, which analyses relaxation data to provide parameters defining protein self-association. Unlike existing relaxation analysis software, NMRdyn can explicitly model the monomer-oligomer equilibrium while fitting measured relaxation data. Additionally, the program is packaged with a user-friendly interface, which is important because relaxation data can often be large and complex. NMRdyn is available from http://research1t.imb.uq.edu.au/nmr/NMRdyn."
