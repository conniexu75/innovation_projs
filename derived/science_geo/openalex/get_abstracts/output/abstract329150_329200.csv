https://openalex.org/W2021458657,"Electrodes can be coated with electrochemically reactive polymers in several microstructural formats called sandwich, array, bilayer, micro-, and ion-gate electrodes. These microstructures can be used to study the transport of electrons and ions through the polymers as a function of the polymer oxidation state, which is essential for understanding the conductivity properties of these new chemical materials. The microstructures also exhibit potentially useful electrical and optical responses, including current rectification, charge storage and amplification, electron-hole pair separation, and gates for ion flow."
https://openalex.org/W2028103813,"The use of molecular reagents to manipulate the properties of electrode surfaces has broad application in areas such as electrochemical synthesis, energy conversion and storage, displays, sensors, and new kinds of microelectronic devices. Surface modification of electrodes has contributed to a revival of interest in basic and applied research in electrochemistry and electrochemical devices. This article is focused on specific examples of systems modified electrodes where basic developments provide promising opportunities for applications stemming from the properties of molecules attached to an electrode surface."
https://openalex.org/W1994796300,"An iridium anomaly has been found in coincidence with the known microtektite level in cores from Deep Sea Drilling Project site 149 in the Caribbean Sea. The iridium was probably not in the microtektites but deposited simultaneously with them; this could occur if the iridium was deposited from a dust cloud resulting from a bolide impact, as suggested for the anomaly associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Other workers have deduced that the microtektites are part of the North American strewn tektite field, which is dated at about 34 million years before present, and that the microtektite horizon in deep-sea cores is synchronous with the extinction of five radiolarian species. Mass extinctions also occur in terrestrial mammals within 4 million years of this time. The iridium anomaly and the tektites and microtektites are supportive of a major bolide impact about 34 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2042273476,"Because of the reaction of cosmic rays with elements in minerals, chlorine-36 accumulates in rocks exposed at the earth's surface. This suggests that the ratio of chlorine-36 to stable chloride can be used as a geochronometer. Reasonable agreement has been obtained between measurements of chlorine-36 in volcanic rocks of known age and calculations of chlorine-36 production based on rock composition and cosmicray flux. The buildup of chlorine-36 should be a useful means for measuring the surface exposure time of young volcanic rocks and geomorphic features in the age range of 10(3) to 10(6) years."
https://openalex.org/W2004264006,"A deep-sea core from the Caribbean contains a layer of sediment highly enriched in meteoritic iridium. This layer underlies a layer of North American microtektites dated at 34.4 million years ago and coincides with the extinction of five major species of Radiolaria. It is suggested that a massive, chemically undifferentiated meteorite collided with the earth, producing the tektites and leading to extinctions 34 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2032371950,"Stable isotopic and shell-growth banding studies of the symbiont-bearing giant clam Tridacna maxima reveal the existence of two growth phases related to sexual maturity that can be discerned in the shells of extinct and extant mollusks. The changeover from the first to second growth phase at an age of approximately 10 years is accompanied by a decrease in rate of calcification and suggests a reordering of energy priorities between biomineralization and reproduction. The carbon-13 to carbon-12 ratio of Tridacna maxima is systematically depleted relative to symbiont-barren mollusks, making it possible to determine the importance of algal-molluscan symbiosis to the functional morphology and paleoecology of mollusks in the geologic record."
https://openalex.org/W2052379308,"Germanium enrichment in the oceanic water column above the southern axis of the East Pacific Rise results from hydrothermal solutions emanating from hot springs along the rise crest. This plume signature provides a new oceanic tracer of reactions between seawater and sea floor basalts during hydrothermal alteration. In contrast to the sharp plumes of (3)He and manganese, the germanium plume is broad and diffuse, suggesting the existence of pervasive venting of low-temperature solutions off the ridge axis."
https://openalex.org/W2091466414,"""Salt fingers"" are generated when a slowly diffusing solute overlies a more rapidly diffusing solute in a gravitationally stable fluid. The phenomenon is important in many areas of science; for example, it affects the temperature and salinity structure in the upper half of the ocean, the production of crystals when liquid alloys solidify, and the distribution of properties in magma chambers below the earth's crust. The evolution of a salt finger from initial instability to a fully developed feature is difficult to follow in a fluid because of the close-packed array of cells that is formed. However, when the fluid is contained in a Hele Shaw cell, individual fingers occupy the entire gap width, thereby enabling the experimenter to monitor and record the evolution much more easily. The instability of an array of wide fingers to disturbances that lead to (preferred) smaller scales is documented in a sequence of photographs, and a qualitative, physically consistent argument is offered to explain the instability."

https://openalex.org/W2017266229,"So much interest is being manifested in the polymorphism of long chain compounds, particularly the fatty acids (Piper, Malkin, and Austin, J. Chem. Soc., 1926, 2310. de Boer, NATURE, 119, 50, 635; 1927. Thibaud, Compt. rend., 184, 24, 96; 1927. Muller, Proc. Roy. Soc., A, 114, 542; 1927), that it seems advisable to report the results of some X-ray experiments with ordinary commercial paraffin waxes. Only one mention of X-ray studies of these complex mixtures of many hydrocarbons has been made, that by Piper, Brown, and Dyment (J. Chem. Soc., 127, 2194; 1925), who found that the lines of the C28 hydrocarbon appeared alone for a paraffin wax, although this fraction furnished only 16 per cent, of the mixture and other members as high as C32 were probably present."

The plan, drawn up by the Department of Health and Human Services, in fact sets the goal of ""eliminating transmission of HTLV-III infection"" by 2000 and assumes that ""It is unlikely that a vaccine or therapy to substantially limit transmission will be generally available before 1990."""
