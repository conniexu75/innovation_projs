https://openalex.org/W2081730365,"Calcium is a major component of the mineral phase of bone and serves as a key intracellular second messenger. Postnatally, all bodily calcium must be absorbed from the diet through the intestine. Here we report the properties of a calcium transport protein (CaT1) cloned from rat duodenum using an expression cloning strategy in Xenopus laevis oocytes, which likely plays a key role in the intestinal uptake of calcium. CaT1 shows homology (75% amino acid sequence identity) to the apical calcium channel ECaC recently cloned from vitamin D-responsive cells of rabbit kidney and is structurally related to the capsaicin receptor and the TRP family of ion channels. Based on Northern analysis of rat tissues, a 3-kilobase CaT1 transcript is present in rat duodenum, proximal jejunum, cecum, and colon, and a 6.5-kilobase transcript is present in brain, thymus, and adrenal gland. In situ hybridization revealed strong CaT1 mRNA expression in enterocytes of duodenum, proximal jejunum, and cecum. No signals were detected in kidney, heart, liver, lung, spleen, and skeletal muscle. When expressed inXenopus oocytes, CaT1 mediates saturable Ca2+uptake with a Michaelis constant of 0.44 mm. Transport of Ca2+ by CaT1 is electrogenic, voltage-dependent, and exhibits a charge/Ca2+uptake ratio close to 2:1, indicating that CaT1-mediated Ca2+ influx is not coupled to other ions. CaT1 activity is pH-sensitive, exhibiting significant inhibition by low pH. CaT1 is also permeant to Sr2+ and Ba2+ (but not Mg2+), although the currents evoked by Sr2+ and Ba2+ are much smaller than those evoked by Ca2+. The trivalent cations Gd3+ and La3+ and the divalent cations Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ (each at 100 μm) do not evoke currents themselves, but inhibit CaT1-mediated Ca2+ transport. Fe3+, Fe2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ have no significant effects at 100 μm on CaT1-mediated Ca2+ transport. CaT1 mRNA levels are not responsive to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 administration or to calcium deficiency. Our studies strongly suggest that CaT1 provides the principal mechanism for Ca2+ entry into enterocytes as part of the transcellular pathway of calcium absorption in the intestine.

Calcium is the most abundant cation and the fifth most common inorganic element in the human body. It is a well known first and second messenger in signal transduction and an essential component of bone mineral (1Brown E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 2Bronner F. O'Dell B.L. Sunde R.A. Handbook of Nutritionally Essential Mineral Elements. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 13-66Google Scholar). Calcium homeostasis in blood and other extracellular fluids is tightly controlled through the actions of calciotropic hormones on bone, kidneys, and intestine (2Bronner F. O'Dell B.L. Sunde R.A. Handbook of Nutritionally Essential Mineral Elements. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 13-66Google Scholar). The availability of dietary calcium is a critical determinant of calcium homeostasis (3Birge S.J. Avioli L.V. Andreoli T.E. Hoffman J.F. Fanestil D.D. Schultz S.G. Clinical Disorders of Membrane Transport Processes. Plenum Press, New York1987: 121-140Crossref Google Scholar). In humans, dietary intake of calcium approximates 500–1000 mg/day, and obligatory endogenous losses in stool and urine total ∼250 mg/day. On the order of 30% of calcium in the diet must be absorbed to sustain bone growth in children and to prevent postmenopausal bone loss in aging women (2Bronner F. O'Dell B.L. Sunde R.A. Handbook of Nutritionally Essential Mineral Elements. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 13-66Google Scholar, 4Schron C.M. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 467-484Google Scholar). To meet the body's need for calcium, the intestines of most vertebrates evolved specialized vitamin D-dependent and -independent mechanisms for ensuring adequate intestinal calcium uptake. Intestinal absorption of Ca2+ occurs by a saturable, transcellular process and a nonsaturable, paracellular pathway (5Bronner F. Pansu D. Stein W.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: G561-G569PubMed Google Scholar). When dietary calcium is abundant, the passive paracellular pathway is thought to be predominant. In contrast, when dietary calcium is limited, the active, vitamin D-dependent transcellular pathway plays a major role in calcium absorption (5Bronner F. Pansu D. Stein W.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: G561-G569PubMed Google Scholar, 6Buckley M. Bronner F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 202: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Pansu D. Duflos C. Bellaton C. Bronner F. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1396-1404PubMed Google Scholar). The transcellular pathway is a multistep process, consisting of entry of luminal Ca2+ into the enterocyte and translocation of Ca2+ from its point of entry (the microvillus border of the apical plasma membrane) to the basolateral membrane, followed by active extrusion from the cell (8Bronner F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 131: 169-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Kumar R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Wasserman R.H. Fullmer C.S. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1971S-1979SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ diffusion is thought to be facilitated by a calcium-binding protein, calbindin D9K(11Feher J.J. Fullmer C.S. Wasserman R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C517-C526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whose biosynthesis is dependent on vitamin D (12Wasserman R.H. Taylor A.N. Science. 1966; 152: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The extrusion of Ca2+ takes place against an electrochemical gradient and is mainly mediated by Ca-ATPase (13Ghijsen W.E. van Os C.H. Heizmann C.W. Murer H. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G223-G229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wasserman R.H. Chandler J.S. Meyer S.A. Smith C.A. Brindak M.E. Fullmer C.S. Penniston J.T. Kumar R. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The entry of Ca2+across the apical membrane of the enterocyte is strongly favored electrochemically because the concentration of Ca2+ within the cell (10−7 to 10−6m) is considerably lower than that in the intestinal lumen (10−3m), and the cell is electronegative relative to the intestinal lumen (15Stein W.D. J. Nutr. 1992; 122: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, the movement of Ca2+across the apical membrane does not require the expenditure of energy (10Wasserman R.H. Fullmer C.S. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1971S-1979SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Holdsworth E.S. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, it has been controversial as to whether a transporter or a channel is responsible for this process, although previous studies indicated that Ca2+ entry is voltage-independent and largely insensitive to classic L-type calcium channel blockers (17Favus M.J. Angeid-Backman E. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G676-G681PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fox J. Green D.T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 129: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transcellular calcium absorptive pathway requires the cloning of the gene(s) encoding the relevant calcium carrier(s). To achieve this goal, we took advantage of an expression cloning strategy by usingXenopus laevis oocytes as the expression system (19Romero M.F. Kanai Y. Gunshin H. Hediger M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 17-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Functional screening of a rat duodenal library by measuring45Ca2+ uptake resulted in the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a calcium transport protein (CaT1). Interestingly, CaT1 is structurally related to the recently reported renal apical calcium channel ECaC (20Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Hartog A. van de Graaf S.F. Van Os C.H. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8375-8378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that CaT1 plays a key role in mediating Ca2+ entry into the enterocytes as the first step of transcellular intestinal calcium absorption. DefolliculatedX. laevis oocytes were injected with 50 nl of either water or RNA. 45Ca2+ uptake was assayed 3 days after injection of poly(A)+ or 1–3 days after injection of synthetic cRNA. For expression cloning, oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution (19Romero M.F. Kanai Y. Gunshin H. Hediger M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 17-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1 mmSrCl2 (to avoid excessive loading of oocytes with Ca2+) as well as penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin at 1 mg/ml. Standard uptake solution contained the following components: 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2(including 45Ca2+, NEN Life Science Products), and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Uptake was performed at room temperature for 30 min (for the expression cloning procedure, 2-h uptakes were employed), and oocytes were washed six times with ice-cold uptake solution plus 20 mm MgCl2. The effects of capsaicin or L-type channel blockers on Ca2+ uptake were studied in uptake solution by addition of 50 μm capsaicin (in ethanol solution, 0.05% final concentration) or 10–100 μm calcium channel blockers in water (nifedipine was diluted with uptake solution from 100 mm Me2SO stock solution). Control experiments were performed with the appropriate ethanol and Me2SO concentrations. Unless stated specifically, data are presented as means obtained from at least three experiments with 7–10 oocytes/group with S.E. as the index of dispersion. Statistical significance was defined as having ap value of <0.05 as determined by Student's ttest. Expression cloning usingXenopus oocytes was performed essentially as described (19Romero M.F. Kanai Y. Gunshin H. Hediger M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 17-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, duodenal poly(A)+ RNA from rats fed a calcium-deficient diet (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) for 2 weeks was size-fractionated. A cDNA library was then constructed from the fractions of 2.5–3 kilobases (kb) 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); TM, transmembrane domain that stimulated45Ca2+ uptake activity when expressed in oocytes. The RNAs synthesized in vitro from pools of ∼500 clones were injected into oocytes, and the abilities of the pools to stimulate Ca2+ uptake were assayed. A positive pool was sequentially subdivided and assayed in the same manner until a single clone was obtained. The cDNA clone was sequenced bidirectionally in the W. M. Keck facility at Yale University. Poly(A)+ RNA (3 μg) from rat tissues was electrophoresed in formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were probed with32P-labeled full-length CaT1 cDNA; hybridized at 42 °C with a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 2× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA; and washed with 5× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 2 × 30 min and with 0.1× SSC at 65 °C for 3 × 30 min. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C for 1–2 days. Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense runoff transcripts were synthesized using the Genius kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). CaT1 cRNA probes were transcribed from a polymerase chain reaction fragment that contains ∼2.7 kb of CaT1 cDNA (nucleotides 126–2894) flanked at either end by promoter sequences for SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases. Sense and antisense transcripts were alkali-hydrolyzed to an average length of 200–400 nucleotides. In situ hybridization was performed on 10-μm cryosections of fresh-frozen rat tissues. Sections were immersed in slide mailers in hybridization solution composed of 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.02% SDS, and 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine and hybridized at 68 °C for 16 h with sense or antisense probe at a concentration of ∼200 ng/ml. Sections were then washed three times in 2× SSC and twice for 30 min in 0.2× SSC at 68 °C. After washing, the hybridized probes were visualized by alkaline phosphatase histochemistry using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. In vitrotranscription was performed with the mMESSAGE mMACHINETM T7 kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). In vitro translation of the CaT1 protein was performed with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The two-microelectrode voltage clamp experiments were performed following the method described previously (21Chen X.Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using a commercial amplifier (Clampator One, Model CA-1B, Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) and pCLAMP software (Version 7, Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). An oocyte was introduced into the chamber containing Ca2+-free solution and was incubated for ∼3 min before being clamped at −50 mV and performing measurements. In experiments involving voltage ramps or jumps, whole-cell current and voltage were recorded by digitizing at 300 μs/sample and by Bessel filtering at 10 kHz. When recording currents at a holding potential, digitization at 0.2 s/sample and filtering at 20 Hz were used. Voltage ramping consisted of pre-holding at −150 mV for 200 ms to eliminate capacitive currents and a subsequent linear increase from −150 to +50 mV, with a total duration of 1.4 s. Voltage jumping consisted of 150-ms voltage pulses of between −140 and +60 mV, in increments of +20 mV. Steady-state currents were obtained as the average values in the interval from 135 to 145 ms after the initiation of the voltage pulses. For experiments involving voltage-clamped 45Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+-evoked currents and uptake of45Ca2+ were simultaneously measured at −50 mV using a method similar to that described previously (22Chen X.Z. Zhu T. Smith D.E. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2773-2779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Patch clamp methodology was employed to search for single channel activities using cell-attached and excised membrane patches (23Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflüegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were prepared from Corning 7052 glass capillaries (Garner Glass Co.). The pipette tip resistance was 5–10 megaohms. Seal resistances of >10 gigaohms were employed in single channel experiments, and currents were measured using an integrating patch clamp amplifier with filtering at 3 kHz through an 8-pole Bessel filter. In cell-attached patches, the resting potential corresponded to holding the patches at 0 mV. For data acquisition and analysis, voltage stimuli were applied, and single channel currents were digitized (50–200 μs/point) and analyzed using a PC, a Digidata Pack, and programs based on pCLAMP Version 6 (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The lack of information on the molecular structure of the intestinal apical calcium transport protein(s) prompted us to employ the X. laevis oocyte expression cloning procedure (19Romero M.F. Kanai Y. Gunshin H. Hediger M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 17-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) for isolation of cDNA clones. Oocytes injected with mRNA from rat duodenum or cecum exhibited reproducible increases in Ca2+ uptake over water-injected control oocytes. After size fractionation of rat duodenal poly(A)+ RNA, we detected a substantial increase in45Ca2+ uptake by injection of RNA from a 2.5–3-kb pool (Fig. 1). A library was constructed using this RNA pool, and a single clone was isolated from this size-fractionated cDNA library by screening progressively smaller pools of clones for their ability to induce45Ca2+ uptake in cRNA-injected oocytes. The resultant 3-kb cDNA produced large increases in Ca2+uptake (∼30-fold) when expressed in oocytes (Fig. 1). Based on the properties of the encoded protein, including its saturation kinetics, we named this protein CaT1, for Ca2+transport protein, subtype 1. The 2995-base pair CaT1 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2181 base pairs that encodes a protein of 727 amino acid residues with a predicted relative molecular mass of 83,245 Da (Fig. 2 A), which is consistent with the molecular mass obtained by in vitro translation without microsomes (84 kDa; data not shown). Hydropathy analysis suggests that CaT1 is a polytopic protein containing six transmembrane domains (TMs) with an additional short hydrophobic stretch between TM5 and TM6 (Fig. 2, A andB). Consistent with the molecular mass of the protein obtained by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes (89 kDa; data not shown), an N-glycosylation site is predicted in the first extracellular loop of the protein. The amino-terminal hydrophilic segment (326 amino acid residues) of CaT1 contains four ankyrin repeat domains, suggesting that the protein may somehow associate with the spectrin-based membrane cytoskeleton (24Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus (150 amino acid residues) contains no recognizable motifs. Putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinases A and C are present in the cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 2, Aand B), suggesting that transport activity could be regulated by phosphorylation. CaT1 shows 75% amino acid sequence identity to the recently cloned rabbit apical epithelial calcium channel ECaC (20Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Hartog A. van de Graaf S.F. Van Os C.H. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8375-8378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) when using the BESTFIT sequence alignment program. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains of CaT1 from rat and ECaC from rabbit exhibit a lower degree of similarity than the equivalent regions of rat CaT1 and partial sequences obtained from human small intestine (data not shown) by homology screening using the CaT1 cDNA as a probe. Comparisons of sequences of 150 amino acids in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains revealed 90 and 74% identities respectively, between rat and human CaT1, but only 61 and 50% identities, respectively, between CaT1 and ECaC. CaT1 has four ankyrin repeats and one protein kinase A phosphorylation site in its amino-terminal segment, whereas ECaC contains three ankyrin repeats and no protein kinase A site in the same region. In contrast, ECaC possesses three protein kinase C sites and two protein kinase A sites in its carboxyl terminus, whereas CaT1 has only one protein kinase C site and no protein kinase A sites in the same region. In addition, CaT1 lacks the putative N-glycosylation site found in ECaC between the pore region and TM6. Additional homology searches of available protein data bases revealed significant similarities between CaT1 and the capsaicin receptor, VR1 (25Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7143) Google Scholar), and OSM-9, a Caenorhabditis elegans membrane protein involved in olfaction, mechanosensation, and olfactory adaptation (26Colbert H.A. Smith T.L. Bargmann C.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8259-8269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are structurally related to the family of putative store-operated calcium channels (27Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), among which the first two identified were the Drosophila retinal proteins TRP (28Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) and TRPL (29Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 631-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Based on the program BESTFIT, CaT1 shows 33.7 and 26.7% identities to VR1 and OSM-9, respectively, over a stretch of at least 500 residues, as well as 26.2% and 28.9% identities to TRP and TRPL, respectively, in more restricted regions (residues 552–593 for TRP and residues 556–593 for TRPL). The latter region covers part of the pore region and the last transmembrane domain. A common feature of all of these proteins is the presence of six TMs with a hydrophobic stretch between TM5 and TM6, resembling one of the four repeated motifs of six TMs in the voltage-gated channels. Another common feature is the presence of three to four ankyrin repeat domains in the cytoplasmic N-terminal region. Of note, members of the polycystin family also possess six transmembrane segments (30Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A.

A homology search using the CaT1 sequence in expressed sequence tag data bases revealed the following GenBankTM sequences with high degrees of similarity to CaT1 (percent identities refer to nucleotide identities): GenBankTM accession number AI101583from rat brain (99%); AI007094 from mouse thymus (96%); AA447311,AA469437, and AA579526 from human prostate (87, 85, and 84%, respectively), W88570 from human fetal liver spleen (91%); AA078617from human brain (85%); and T92755 from human lung (92%). Northern analysis of rat tissues revealed a strong 3.0-kb band in rat small intestine and a weaker 6.5-kb band in brain, thymus, and adrenal gland (Fig.3 A). No CaT1 transcripts were detected in heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and skeletal muscle. Northern analysis of the gastrointestinal tract revealed that the 3-kb CaT1 transcript is expressed in duodenum, proximal jejunum, cecum, and colon, but not in stomach, distal jejunum, or ileum (Fig.3 B). The CaT1 mRNA in rat duodenum was not regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or by calcium deficiency in vivo (Fig. 3 C). In situ hybridization revealed expression of CaT1 mRNA in the absorptive epithelial cells of duodenum, proximal jejunum, cecum, and colon, but not in ileum (Fig.4). CaT1 mRNA is expressed at high levels in duodenum and cecum, at lower levels in proximal jejunum, and at very low levels in colon. In all CaT1-expressing intestinal segments, mRNA levels are higher at the villi tips than in the villi crypts (Fig. 4, A, B, and D). No signals were detected in kidney under the same experimental conditions or in sense controls. Since CaT1 shares similarity in its structure with the capsaicin receptor (VR1) (25Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7143) Google Scholar) and TRP (transient receptor potential) and TRPL (TRP-like) channels (28Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 29Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14146-14151Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that the activity of CaT1 could be stimulated by capsaicin or calcium store depletion. Capsaicin (up to 50 μm) did not stimulate CaT1-mediated45Ca2+ uptake in oocytes (data not shown). Instead of stimulating Ca2+ entry, depletion of calcium stores by thapsigargin treatment decreased CaT1-mediated Ca2+ activity to ∼20% of its base-line activity (Fig.5 A). Based on these data, it is unlikely that CaT1 is another subtype of capsaicin-gated or store-operated ion channels. When expressed in oocytes, CaT1-mediated 45Ca2+uptake was linear for up to 2 h (data not shown). Ca2+uptake was concentration-dependent and saturable, with an apparent Michaelis constant (K m) of 0.44 ± 0.07 mm (Fig. 5 B). This K m is appropriate for absorbing Ca2+ from the intestine, which is normally ∼1–5 mm after a calcium-containing meal. Consistent with the prediction from early studies that apical Ca2+ uptake is not energy-dependent, CaT1-mediated transport did not appear to be coupled to Na+, Cl−, or H+ (Fig. 5,C and D). To study the substrate specificity of CaT1, we initially performed inhibition studies of45Ca2+ uptake (1 mmCa2+) by various di- and trivalent cations (100 μm) (Fig. 5 E). Gd3+, La3+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ produced marked to moderate inhibition, whereas Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ had no significant effects. In contrast, Ba2+ and Sr2+ had only slight inhibitory effects, even at a concentration of 10 mm, whereas Mg2+ (10 mm) produced no significant inhibition (Fig. 5 E). Ca2+ entry into enterocytes has, in general, been reported to be insensitive to classic voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers and to be only slightly inhibited by verapamil (17Favus M.J. Angeid-Backman E. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: G676-G681PubMed Google Scholar,18Fox J. Green D.T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 129: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Among the three classes of L-type calcium channel blockers that we tested (nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil), only the latter two modestly inhibited CaT1-mediated Ca2+ uptake (by 10–15%) at relatively high concentrations (10–100 μm) (data not shown). External application of Ca2+ to oocytes expressing CaT1 generated inward currents at a holding potential of −50 mV (Fig. 6 A, left panel), which were absent in control oocytes (data not shown). Addition of 5 mm Ca2+ evoked an overshoot of inward current to several hundred nA, followed by a rapid reduction to a plateau value of 20–50 nA (Fig. 6 A, left panel). CaT1-mediated current was also voltage-dependent, as revealed by current-voltage (I-V) curves (Fig. 6 A, right panel). The peak current (curve 2) is due to endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride channel currents (34Dascal N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 317-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) because it could be blocked by chloride channel (curve 3) blockers such as flufenamate (data not shown). The plateau also contained flufenamate-inhibitable currents, suggesting that some endogenous, Ca2+-activated chloride channels remained active during this phase. Chelating intracellular Ca2+ by injection of EGTA into oocytes expressing CaT1 to a final concentration of 1–2 mm resulted in a 3–5-fold increase in Ca2+uptake (data not shown) and abolished the overshoot of the current (Fig. 6 B, left panel). Under the same condition, EGTA-injected control oocytes produced no detectable currents. Therefore, CaT1 likely mediates the observed Ca2+-evoked currents in EGTA-injected oocytes (Fig.6 B). In the absence of Ca2+, oocytes expressing CaT1 exhibited a"

Recently, the cell survival protein kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) was proposed to be involved in protein synthesis. Here we show that angiotensin II causes rapid phosphorylation of Akt/PKB (6- +/- 0.4-fold increase). Exogenous H(2)O(2) (50-200 microM) also stimulates Akt/PKB phosphorylation (maximal 8- +/- 0.2-fold increase), suggesting that Akt/PKB activation is redox-sensitive. Both angiotensin II and H(2)O(2) stimulation of Akt/PKB are abrogated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (2(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one), suggesting that PI3-K is an upstream mediator of Akt/PKB activation in VSMCs. Furthermore, diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of flavin-containing oxidases, or overexpression of catalase to block angiotensin II-induced intracellular H(2)O(2) production significantly inhibits angiotensin II-induced Akt/PKB phosphorylation, indicating a role for ROS in agonist-induced Akt/PKB activation. In VSMCs infected with dominant-negative Akt/PKB, angiotensin II-stimulated [(3)H]leucine incorporation is attenuated. Thus, our studies indicate that Akt/PKB is part of the remarkable spectrum of angiotensin II signaling pathways and provide insight into the highly organized signaling mechanisms coordinated by ROS, which mediate the hypertrophic response to angiotensin II in VSMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2063017603,"In mammals, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), cytochrome c, and dATP activate caspase-9, which initiates the postmitochondrial-mediated caspase cascade by proteolytic cleavage/activation of effector caspases to form active ∼60-kDa heterotetramers. We now demonstrate that activation of caspases either in apoptotic cells or following dATP activation of cell lysates results in the formation of two large but different sized protein complexes, the “aposome” and the “microaposome”. Surprisingly, most of the DEVDase activity in the lysate was present in the aposome and microaposome complexes with only small amounts of active caspase-3 present as its free ∼60-kDa heterotetramer. The larger aposome complex (M r = ∼ 700,000) contained Apaf-1 and processed caspase-9, -3, and -7. The smaller microaposome complex (M r = ∼ 200,000–300,000) contained active caspase-3 and -7 but little if any Apaf-1 or active caspase-9. Lysates isolated from control THP.1 cells, prior to caspase activation, showed striking differences in the distribution of key apoptotic proteins. Apaf-1 and procaspase-7 may be functionally complexed as they eluted as an ∼200–300-kDa complex, which did not have caspase cleavage (DEVDase) activity. Procaspase-3 and -9 were present as separate and smaller 60–90-kDa (dimer) complexes. During caspase activation, Apaf-1, caspase-9, and the effector caspases redistributed and formed the aposome.

It is now widely recognized that the execution phase of apoptosis requires the activation of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, caspases, which are related to interleukin-1β converting enzyme, or caspase-1 (1Chinnaiyan A.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar), which all have a strict substrate requirement for cleavage of Asp-X bonds at the P1 position. The substrate specificity of the individual caspase is then further defined by the three amino acids in the P4, P3, and P2 positions of the tetrapeptide cleavage motif (5Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar). A positional scanning combinatorial substrate approach (7Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar) has been used to characterize the caspases into three functional subgroups. Group I caspases (caspase-1, -4, and -5) cleave at (W/L)EHD tetrapeptide motifs and are probably involved in inflammation. The effector caspases (II), which include caspase-2, -3, and -7 (and also CED-3), cleave the DEXD tetrapeptide motif, which is found in many proteins associated with apoptosis, e.g. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, 70-kDa U1 small ribonucleoprotein, and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (5Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar). Group III (activator) caspases include caspase-6, -8, and -9 as well as granzyme B and cleave at (I/V/L)EXD tetrapeptide sequences.Caspases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes and activated, following cleavage at specific tetrapeptide residues (e.g.for caspase-3 this is IETD), to yield large (∼20 kDa) and small (∼10 kDa) subunits. The active enzyme is believed to be a heterotetramer composed of two large and two small subunits with aM r of ∼60,000 (8Wilson K.P. Black J.-A.F. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P.

Although all of the caspases conform to this general scheme, there are considerable and significant differences in caspase structure and function (5Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar). Thus, all have prodomains of varying length; some have linker regions, which need to be cleaved to give the small and large fragments, whereas others require only a single cleavage between the p20/p10 junction. The prodomains of the caspases may have a functional role, as “activator” caspases have long prodomains and are believed to activate the “effector” caspases, which have short prodomains (7Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). The cleavage/activation sites contain the P1Asp-X bond, and removal of the prodomains and generation of the large and small subunits are most likely carried out by caspases.The proteolytic activity of both activator and effector caspases can be assayed with synthetic fluorogenic substrates, which contain the appropriate cleavage motif (i.e. fluorogenic (I/ V/L)XXD and DEXD analogues). As activation of the effector caspases represents a point of no return in the apoptotic process, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying this process and how this influences and regulates the caspase cascade. Recent studies by Zou et al. (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar) have provided new insights into these mechanisms and have indicated that for caspase-3 activation there is a requirement for cytochrome c, dATP, and two proteins designated apoptotic protease-activating factors 1 and 3 (i.e. Apaf-1 and Apaf-3). Apaf-3 has been identified as caspase-9 (10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar), and Apaf-1 is the first identified mammalian homologue of CED-4 (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 is a large (M r = 130,000) soluble protein with a short N-terminal caspase recruitment domain, a central CED-4 homology domain followed by 12 WD-40 repeats, which are probably involved in protein-protein interactions (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). This and other studies provide evidence for a mechanism of caspase activation in which cytochrome c, the mammalian homologues of CED-3, and CED-4 interact as a caspase-activating complex (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar, 10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

Nature. 1997; 388: 714-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the subsequent activation of the caspase cascade are still unknown.In THP.1 cells, we previously demonstrated the activation of caspase-2, -3, -6, and -7 during apoptosis (12MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have used gel filtration and sucrose density centrifugation to examine the cytosolic distribution and molecular speciation/composition of caspases and Apaf-1. Our data show that in THP.1 cells the process of caspase activation involved the formation of two large soluble protein complexes hereafter referred to as the aposome and microaposome. Surprisingly most of the effector caspase activity (DEVDase) was present primarily as these two large complexes rather than as the free ∼60-kDa heterotetramer. In lysates isolated from control cells, Apaf-1 was present in its native state as a dimer and eluted from a gel filtration column as a complex of 200–300 kDa. Procaspase-9 was also present in its native state as a dimer (∼70–90 kDa) and, after activation of caspases with dATP, redistributed with Apaf-1 to form the large aposome (M r ∼ 700,000) complex. The aposome recruited and processed the effector caspases, which were then released in the microaposome complex.DISCUSSIONThe most striking finding of the present study was the observation that effector caspase activity was found in two large multimeric complexes, the aposome and the microaposome. The larger complex, the aposome, had a M r of ∼700,000 and contained Apaf-1 together with the processed forms of caspase-3, -7, and -9 (Figs. 2 and 5). The aposome was formed in lysates from control cells activated with dATP (Figs. 1 and 2) as well as in apoptotic cells (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a caspase-activating complex in untransfected apoptotic cells. A theoretical model for caspase activation (11Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 388: 714-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), based on studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and transfected mammalian cells (10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar, 11Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 388: 714-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), proposed the formation of the apoptosome, a complex including Apaf-1·caspase-9·cytochrome c. The size and composition of the partially purified aposome demonstrate that it was not simply a complex composed of Apaf-1·caspase-9·cytochromec, but rather it may be a multimer of these proteins together with other proteins such as caspase-3. Although only partially purified, the aposome was relatively stable following both gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Apaf-1 and processed caspase-3 and -9 appeared tightly bound with the aposome, as they largely remained associated with it throughout its purification (Figs. 2 and 5). In contrast, caspase-7 was less tightly associated as it was found with the aposome following gel filtration (Fig. 2) but not following further purification (data not shown). The relative stability of the aposome during purification supported the suggestion that such complexes were formed under physiological conditions.In lysates from control cells, the size of native Apaf-1 was 200–300 kDa (Fig. 2 A), which suggested it was probably present as a dimer or possibly complexed with another protein. Native procaspase-9 also probably existed as a dimer as it was detected as a 70–90-kDa complex (Fig. 2). Thus in control cells Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 were clearly not associated. Similarly procaspase-3 also appeared to exist as a dimer, whereas procaspase-7 eluted as a 200–300-kDa complex (Fig.2). These results raise the possibility that procaspase-7 may be associated with and regulate the activity of Apaf-1 in control cells. Alternatively, procaspase-7 may be associated with other protein(s).Following dATP-dependent activation, Apaf-1 and both the p35 and p37 active subunits of caspase-9 were associated with the aposome (Figs. 2 and 5). Whereas the initial processing of procaspase-9 to its p35 subunit is autocatalytic, the generation of the p37 subunit is mediated by caspase-3 (22Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In this regard it was of interest that active caspase-3 was also associated with the aposome and was likely responsible for the formation of the p37 subunit.The DEVDase containing the microaposome complex was most likely derived from the aposome as it was only detected when the caspases were activated and when the aposome was generated (Figs. 1 and 3). The relationship between the aposome and microaposome may be analogous to the cytosolic chaperonin-containing T-complex polypeptide 1 complex, which is a large cytosolic complex with a M r of ∼950,000 that exists in equilibrium with smaller microcomplexes of 120–250 kDa (23Liou K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The microaposome may be a proteolytically degraded form of the aposome, but this seems unlikely given that little or no Apaf-1 was present in the microaposome (Fig. 5 E). Another possibility was that the appearance of active caspases in the microaposome complex occurred after caspase activation, when they were released from the large ∼700-kDa aposome complex to form the smaller ∼200–300 kDa sized microaposome. In support of this, the microaposome contained active effector caspases but not Apaf-1 (Fig. 2and 5 E). The size of the microaposome complex also suggested that it might contain other proteins in addition to the active caspases. Although we have not characterized the complex, we have shown that Hsp-90 co-eluted with the microaposome complex. 2K. Cain and D. G. Brown, unpublished results. Thus other molecules, such as Hsp-90, may be involved in transporting or targeting the active caspases to key intracellular targets, e.g. the nucleus or endoplasmic reticulum. In this regard, it should be stressed that prior to caspase activation, procaspase-3 and -7 were located in different sized soluble complexes (Fig. 2). This may be of functional significance as we have recently shown that following Fas-induced apoptosis in mouse liver, activated caspase-3 and -7 are targeted to different subcellular locations (24Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).The large size of the aposome was similar to that of energy-dependent self-compartmentalizing proteases, such as the proteasome and ClpAp proteases found in Escherichia coli and mitochondria (20Lupas A. Flanagan J.M. Tamura T. Baumeister W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 21Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). As similar methods were used to purify the aposome as well as these complexes, it was not totally unexpected that the proteasome co-purified with the aposome complex (Fig. 5). Interestingly IETDase/VEIDase activities of the control lysate co-purified with the proteasome (Fig. 4), suggesting that they may be previously uncharacterized proteolytic activities of the proteasome. Such IETDase activity may be responsible for the activation of effector caspases. It is unclear at the moment whether or not the proteasome and the aposome are part of one larger complex or are independent complexes, which may possibly interact during caspase activation. As yet we cannot answer this question, because we have only partially purified the aposome and not separated it from the proteasome. In preliminary studies, high concentrations of lactacystin, a potent proteasome inhibitor (25Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar), inhibited neither dATP-dependent caspase activation nor IETDase activity (data not shown), which suggested that the proteasome was not directly involved with caspase activation. However, further experiments are clearly required to resolve this issue. Many studies have implicated an important but as yet undefined role for the proteasome in apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 26Drexler H.C.A. Apoptosis. 1998; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our present findings may help to define this role.In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that active effector (DEVDase) caspase activity is associated with two large cellular complexes, the aposome and the microaposome. The aposome is an ∼700-kDa multimeric complex, which is formed during apoptosis by the recruitment of Apaf-1 together with caspase-9, -3, and -7. The microaposome appears to be released from the aposome and contains primarily active effector caspase-3 and-7. Our results suggest that these two large interacting complexes play a key role in the activation and execution of the caspase cascade. It is now widely recognized that the execution phase of apoptosis requires the activation of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases, caspases, which are related to interleukin-1β converting enzyme, or caspase-1 (1Chinnaiyan A.M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar), and Apaf-1 is the first identified mammalian homologue of CED-4 (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 is a large (M r = 130,000) soluble protein with a short N-terminal caspase recruitment domain, a central CED-4 homology domain followed by 12 WD-40 repeats, which are probably involved in protein-protein interactions (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). This and other studies provide evidence for a mechanism of caspase activation in which cytochrome c, the mammalian homologues of CED-3, and CED-4 interact as a caspase-activating complex (9Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar, 10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

Nature. 1997; 388: 714-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which Apaf-1 activates caspase-9 and the subsequent activation of the caspase cascade are still unknown. In THP.1 cells, we previously demonstrated the activation of caspase-2, -3, -6, and -7 during apoptosis (12MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have used gel filtration and sucrose density centrifugation to examine the cytosolic distribution and molecular speciation/composition of caspases and Apaf-1. Our data show that in THP.1 cells the process of caspase activation involved the formation of two large soluble protein complexes hereafter referred to as the aposome and microaposome. Surprisingly most of the effector caspase activity (DEVDase) was present primarily as these two large complexes rather than as the free ∼60-kDa heterotetramer. In lysates isolated from control cells, Apaf-1 was present in its native state as a dimer and eluted from a gel filtration column as a complex of 200–300 kDa. Procaspase-9 was also present in its native state as a dimer (∼70–90 kDa) and, after activation of caspases with dATP, redistributed with Apaf-1 to form the large aposome (M r ∼ 700,000) complex. The aposome recruited and processed the effector caspases, which were then released in the microaposome complex. DISCUSSIONThe most striking finding of the present study was the observation that effector caspase activity was found in two large multimeric complexes, the aposome and the microaposome. The larger complex, the aposome, had a M r of ∼700,000 and contained Apaf-1 together with the processed forms of caspase-3, -7, and -9 (Figs. 2 and 5). The aposome was formed in lysates from control cells activated with dATP (Figs. 1 and 2) as well as in apoptotic cells (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a caspase-activating complex in untransfected apoptotic cells. A theoretical model for caspase activation (11Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 388: 714-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), based on studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and transfected mammalian cells (10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar, 11Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 388: 714-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), proposed the formation of the apoptosome, a complex including Apaf-1·caspase-9·cytochrome c. The size and composition of the partially purified aposome demonstrate that it was not simply a complex composed of Apaf-1·caspase-9·cytochromec, but rather it may be a multimer of these proteins together with other proteins such as caspase-3. Although only partially purified, the aposome was relatively stable following both gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Apaf-1 and processed caspase-3 and -9 appeared tightly bound with the aposome, as they largely remained associated with it throughout its purification (Figs. 2 and 5). In contrast, caspase-7 was less tightly associated as it was found with the aposome following gel filtration (Fig. 2) but not following further purification (data not shown). The relative stability of the aposome during purification supported the suggestion that such complexes were formed under physiological conditions.In lysates from control cells, the size of native Apaf-1 was 200–300 kDa (Fig. 2 A), which suggested it was probably present as a dimer or possibly complexed with another protein. Native procaspase-9 also probably existed as a dimer as it was detected as a 70–90-kDa complex (Fig. 2). Thus in control cells Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 were clearly not associated. Similarly procaspase-3 also appeared to exist as a dimer, whereas procaspase-7 eluted as a 200–300-kDa complex (Fig.2). These results raise the possibility that procaspase-7 may be associated with and regulate the activity of Apaf-1 in control cells. Alternatively, procaspase-7 may be associated with other protein(s).Following dATP-dependent activation, Apaf-1 and both the p35 and p37 active subunits of caspase-9 were associated with the aposome (Figs. 2 and 5). Whereas the initial processing of procaspase-9 to its p35 subunit is autocatalytic, the generation of the p37 subunit is mediated by caspase-3 (22Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In this regard it was of interest that active caspase-3 was also associated with the aposome and was likely responsible for the formation of the p37 subunit.The DEVDase containing the microaposome complex was most likely derived from the aposome as it was only detected when the caspases were activated and when the aposome was generated (Figs. 1 and 3). The relationship between the aposome and microaposome may be analogous to the cytosolic chaperonin-containing T-complex polypeptide 1 complex, which is a large cytosolic complex with a M r of ∼950,000 that exists in equilibrium with smaller microcomplexes of 120–250 kDa (23Liou K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The microaposome may be a proteolytically degraded form of the aposome, but this seems unlikely given that little or no Apaf-1 was present in the microaposome (Fig. 5 E). Another possibility was that the appearance of active caspases in the microaposome complex occurred after caspase activation, when they were released from the large ∼700-kDa aposome complex to form the smaller ∼200–300 kDa sized microaposome. In support of this, the microaposome contained active effector caspases but not Apaf-1 (Fig. 2and 5 E). The size of the microaposome complex also suggested that it might contain other proteins in addition to the active caspases. Although we have not characterized the complex, we have shown that Hsp-90 co-eluted with the microaposome complex. 2K. Cain and D. G. Brown, unpublished results. Thus other molecules, such as Hsp-90, may be involved in transporting or targeting the active caspases to key intracellular targets, e.g. the nucleus or endoplasmic reticulum. In this regard, it should be stressed that prior to caspase activation, procaspase-3 and -7 were located in different sized soluble complexes (Fig. 2). This may be of functional significance as we have recently shown that following Fas-induced apoptosis in mouse liver, activated caspase-3 and -7 are targeted to different subcellular locations (24Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).The large size of the aposome was similar to that of energy-dependent self-compartmentalizing proteases, such as the proteasome and ClpAp proteases found in Escherichia coli and mitochondria (20Lupas A. Flanagan J.M. Tamura T. Baumeister W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 21Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). As similar methods were used to purify the aposome as well as these complexes, it was not totally unexpected that the proteasome co-purified with the aposome complex (Fig. 5). Interestingly IETDase/VEIDase activities of the control lysate co-purified with the proteasome (Fig. 4), suggesting that they may be previously uncharacterized proteolytic activities of the proteasome. Such IETDase activity may be responsible for the activation of effector caspases. It is unclear at the moment whether or not the proteasome and the aposome are part of one larger complex or are independent complexes, which may possibly interact during caspase activation. As yet we cannot answer this question, because we have only partially purified the aposome and not separated it from the proteasome. In preliminary studies, high concentrations of lactacystin, a potent proteasome inhibitor (25Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar), inhibited neither dATP-dependent caspase activation nor IETDase activity (data not shown), which suggested that the proteasome was not directly involved with caspase activation. However, further experiments are clearly required to resolve this issue. Many studies have implicated an important but as yet undefined role for the proteasome in apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 26Drexler H.C.A. Apoptosis. 1998; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our present findings may help to define this role.In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that active effector (DEVDase) caspase activity is associated with two large cellular complexes, the aposome and the microaposome. The aposome is an ∼700-kDa multimeric complex, which is formed during apoptosis by the recruitment of Apaf-1 together with caspase-9, -3, and -7. The microaposome appears to be released from the aposome and contains primarily active effector caspase-3 and-7. Our results suggest that these two large interacting complexes play a key role in the activation and execution of the caspase cascade.

A novel orphan receptor, estrogen receptor-related protein 3 (ERR3), was identified by yeast two-hybrid screening, using the transcriptional coactivator glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) as bait. The putative full-length mouse ERR3 contains 458 amino acids and is closely related to two known orphan receptors ERR1 and ERR2. All the ERR family members share an almost identical DNA-binding domain, which has 68% amino acid identity with that of estrogen receptor. ERR3 bound specifically to an estrogen response element and activated reporter genes controlled by estrogen response elements, both in yeast and in mammalian cells, in the absence of any added ligand. A conserved AF-2 activation domain located in the hormone-binding domain of ERR3 was primarily responsible for transcriptional activation. The ERR3 AF-2 domain bound GRIP1 in a ligand-independent manner both in vitro and in vivo, through the LXXLL motifs of GRIP1, and GRIP1 functioned as a transcriptional coactivator for ERR3 in both yeast and mammalian cells. Expression of ERR3 in adult mouse was restricted; highest expression was observed in heart, kidney, and brain. In the mouse embryo no expression was observed at day 7, and highest expression occurred around the 11–15 day stages. Although ERR3 is much more closely related to ERR2 than to ERR1, the expression pattern for ERR3 was similar to that of ERR1 and distinct from that for ERR2, suggesting a unique role for ERR3 in development.

Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). The most well studied members of the NR superfamily are receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, vitamin D, and retinoid acid, but the family also includes a group called orphan receptors whose cognate ligands are unknown or unnecessary. At present orphan receptors are by far the largest subclass of the family, although some orphan receptors later may be removed from this subclass after the identification of their ligands (5Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Most orphan receptors are composed of three structural domains which are characteristic of NRs (7Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.-R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 8Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain, which often contains a transcriptional activation function, is usually not conserved among the family members, and is absent in some NRs. The C-terminal domains of NRs share 10–60% homology among the family members; this domain is responsible for binding ligands in the hormonally regulated NRs, and it also contributes to transcriptional activation. The centrally located DNA-binding domain (DBD) is typically composed of two four-cystine zinc fingers and is responsible for specific recognition of enhancer or hormone response elements in the promoter region of target genes. The DBD is the region which shares the highest homology among the NR family members (40–90%); its sequence is often used to classify NRs into subfamilies. Although the biological functions of most orphan NRs are largely unknown, they are likely to play some important roles, since their sequences are usually highly conserved among mammals and even other taxa, and their expression in either embryonic or adult tissues often occurs in very restricted spatial and temporal patterns (5Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For example, steroidogenic factor 1 regulates many of the enzymes that synthesize steroids and plays a key role in the development and differentiated function of the adrenal gland and gonads (10Parker K.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 140: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Wong M. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Caron K.M. Weber T.J. Swain A. Schimmer B.P. Parker K.L. Recent Prog. Horm.

Hepatic nuclear factor 4 is preferentially found in the liver where it controls the expression of liver-specific genes (13Sladek F.M. Zhong W.M. Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Orphan receptors may act by different mechanisms (5Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Some act as enhancer element-bound transcriptional activators for specific genes, in a manner similar to the well documented mechanism of hormone-binding NRs. Other orphan receptors may regulate the function of other NRs, by competing for the same enhancer element or forming active or inactive heterodimers with the other NRs. NRs use one or more activation domains to mediate their functions (8Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar,9Durand B. Saunders M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5477-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In some NRs, the N-terminal AF-1 activation domain makes the major contribution to transcriptional activation. However, there is generally little if any sequence conservation among the N-terminal domains of different NRs, and some NRs lack an N-terminal activation function. The AF-2 activation domain within the C-terminal hormone-binding domain (HBD) of NRs is also important for transcriptional activation and is highly conserved among essentially all NRs that activate transcription (15Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 16Ito M. Yu R.N. Jameson J.L. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, a new class of proteins called transcriptional coactivators have been found to play key roles in mediating transcriptional activation by NRs (18Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 19Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol.

While transcriptional coactivators for the AF-1 domains are mostly unknown, quite a few putative coactivators for the AF-2 domain have been reported, and some were shown to enhance or be required for transcriptional activation by NRs, including some orphan receptors. The best characterized coactivators for NRs are three genetically distinct but structurally and functionally related proteins of approximately 160 kDa known as NR coactivators or p160 coactivators: SRC-1 (20Kamei Y.

The physical interactions between NRs and these transcriptional coactivators are quite conserved: the conserved AF-2 domains of apparently all NRs that function as transcriptional activators form a conserved hydrophobic groove that accommodates an LXXLL motif (where L is leucine and X can be any amino acid) found in several copies in the p160 coactivators (30Ding X.F.

Classical NRs require binding of ligand before they can interact with coactivators and activate transcription (21Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). However, at least some orphan receptors have been found to bind coactivators and activate transcription in the absence of any added ligand. For example, orphan receptor CARβ apparently functions as a transcriptional activator in the absence of ligand, but the binding of its ligand results in the dissociation of bound coactivators, thus providing a negative regulatory mechanism for the ligand (36Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Since the first two orphan NRs, estrogen receptor related proteins 1 and 2 (ERR1 and ERR2), were identified 10 years ago based on their sequence homology with the DBD of estrogen receptor (ER) (37Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), a large number of new orphan NRs have been identified (5Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Orphan NRs have recently been one of the most rapidly growing families of proteins, and characterization of their functions has contributed to our understanding of important biological processes. This paper reports the identification of mouse ERR3, a novel member of the ERR subfamily of orphan NRs, by a new approach which is based on the interaction of the receptor with its transcriptional coactivator GRIP1. We tested the ability of ERR3 to act as a transcriptional activator, both in mammalian cells and in yeast, identified a functional domain responsible for transcriptional activation, and explored the role of coactivators in ERR3 function. A comparison of the sequence homology and expression patterns for the three ERR proteins suggests distinct developmental and/or regulatory roles for all three. Mammalian expression vectors: pSG5.HA was constructed by inserting AATTACCGCCGCCATGGGCTACCCATACGATGTTCCTGACTATGCGGAATTCTCGA, containing a translation start signal and codons for hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag YPYDVPDYA (38Wilson I.A.

The multiple cloning site following the HA tag contains EcoRI, XhoI, BamHI, andBglII sites. The following ERR3 expression vectors were constructed by inserting the indicated PCR amplified fragment into pSG5.HA: pSG5.HA-ERR3AF-1/DBD, anXhoI/BglII fragment encoding ERR31–216; pSG5.HA-ERR3DBD/HBD and pSG5.HA-ERR3ΔAF-2, XhoI/BamHI fragments encoding ERR3119–458 and ERR3119–448, respectively. Expression vectors for ERR3DBD/HBD containing L449A/F450A or M453A/L454A amino acid substitutions were made by including relevant point mutations in PCR primers, and then inserting the PCR amplified fragments into theXhoI/BamHI sites of pSG5.HA. pSG5.HA-ERR3, encoding full-length ERR3, was constructed by inserting the PCR amplified C-terminal region of ERR3 into theBamHI/BglII sites of pSG5.HA-ERR3AF-1/DBD.

Expression vector pSG5.HA-SRC-1a for full-length SRC-1a was made by inserting SmaI/SalI fragment at theEcoRI site (which was blunted by filling with Klenow polymerase) and the XhoI site of pSG5.HA. Yeast expression vectors: pGBT9.GRIP15–765 encoding a Gal4DBD/GRIP1 fusion protein was made by inserting a GRIP1EcoRI/XhoI fragment intoEcoRI/SalI sites of pGBT9 (CLONTECH). pGAD10.ERR3 encoding the fusion protein of the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD) and mouse ERR3 amino acids 28–458 were isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening (see below). pGBT9.ERR3 encoding the Gal4DBD/ERR3 fusion protein was made by subcloning an EcoRI fragment encoding the ERR328–458 from pGAD10.ERR3 (derived by partial digestion with EcoRI) into pGBT9. Vectors for fusion proteins of Gal4 DBD and ERR3 AF-2 mutations were made by a strategy similar to that described above for the corresponding mammalian vectors containing ERR3 AF-2 mutations; the resultant PCR amplified fragments coding for ERR3 HBD (amino acids 214–458) were inserted into the BamHI site of pGBT9. Vectors for full-length GRIP1 (pGRIP1/fl) and for fusion proteins of Gal4AD with wild type GRIP1 and its NR Box mutants were described previously (23Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R.

Yeast expression vectors pRS314-GR N795 encoding full-length rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and pRS314-hER encoding full-length human ER were constructed by first inserting aClaI/BamHI DNA fragment containing the yeastgpd promoter into pRS314 (trp1, cen-ars) (45Sikorski R.S.

Bacterial expression vector for GST/GRIP1 fusion protein, pGEX.2TK.GRIP1563–1121, was made by inserting a PCR-amplified GRIP1 fragment into BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX.2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterial expression vector for GST/ERR3 fusion protein, pGEX.4T-1.ERR3, was made by subcloning the insert of pGAD10.ERR3 (a partially digestedEcoRI fragment) into the EcoRI site of pGEX.4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast two-hybrid system screening (49Fields S. Song O.-k. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) was performed as described before by using a CLONTECH MATCHMAKER system and a 17-day mouse embryo cDNA library (22Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). GRIP15–765 was fused to Gal4DBD and used as bait in the screening, which was performed without any added hormone but in the presence of 20 mm 3-aminotriazole because of the high background caused by the bait alone. Of the 84 colonies selected in the screening, three cDNA clones contained the same 1.5-kilobase pairs insert, which encoded ERR328–458. The cDNA of ERR3 was sequenced in both directions with an ABI automatic sequencer in the University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center Microchemical Core Facility. Multiple Tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) for mouse adult tissues and whole mouse embryo were hybridized with an ERR3 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 28–110 by using ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocols. CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc.). Transient transfection was performed in 6-well plates (3.3-cm diameter wells) by using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Total DNA used in each transfection was adjusted to 2.0 μg by adding the appropriate amount of pSG5.HA vector. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection and tested with the Promega Luciferase Assay kit. Data shown represents the mean and S.D. for three transfected cultures. These were performed as described previously (30Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities shown are the mean and S.D. from three independent yeast transformants. These assays were performed as described previously (44Hong H. Darimont B.D. Ma H. Yang L. Yamamoto K.R. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3496-3502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with transcriptional coactivator GRIP1, a fragment of GRIP1 (amino acids 5–765) was used as bait to screen a mouse 17-day embryo cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. The screening was performed in the absence of any hormone in order to avoid isolating classical hormone-regulated NRs, which interact with GRIP1 in a strictly hormone-dependent manner (21Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 23Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of the screening, a 1.5-kilobase cDNA clone was identified. A BLAST search (50Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) of GenBank using the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that the known proteins with the highest sequence homology were two orphan NRs, ERR1 and ERR2 (37Giguere V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, A and B). Therefore, the new protein was named estrogen receptor-related protein 3 (ERR3). Like other orphan NRs, ERR3 exhibited typical structural features of the NR family (Fig. 1 B): a putative DBD, which is almost identical to that of ERR1 and ERR2; a putative HBD, sharing 57% amino acid identity with ERR1 and 73% with ERR2; and an N-terminal domain which shares very little homology with ERR1 but 58% amino acid identity with ERR2. The regions of sequence similarity and divergence between ERR3 and the other two ERR proteins were finely dispersed throughout the entire lengths of the proteins (Fig.1 A), indicating that ERR3 is not a splicing variant of either ERR1 or ERR2, and thus is a novel member of the ERR subfamily of orphan NRs. Since the original ERR3 cDNA sequence isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screening was presumably only a partial sequence, it was used to perform a BLAST search of GenBank EST Data base. A human cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession Number W26274) overlapped with the 5′-end of our partial mouse ERR3 cDNA clone, and the overlapping portions shared 93% identity; PCR primers designed from this presumed human ERR3 sequence were then used to amplify a DNA fragment from the mouse 17-day embryo cDNA library by PCR. The amplified DNA fragment was identical to the original mouse ERR3 sequence in their overlapping region and had a 5′-end extension relative to the original mouse cDNA clone. The combination of both sequences resulted in a cDNA sequence of 1567 nucleotides (GenBank Accession NumberAF117254), which contains an open reading frame of 458 amino acids and is proposed to encode the full-length mouse ERR3 (Fig. 1 A). The putative start codon was designated because of an upstream stop codon in the same reading frame and because the sequence around the putative start codon resembled the consensus for a translation start signal (51Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The same PCR primers were also used to amplify a DNA fragment from a human brain cDNA library. The resulting cDNA sequence (not shown, GenBank accession number AF117255) corrected several likely sequencing mistakes from the original human EST cDNA, and encoded the N-terminal 129 amino acids of a human ERR3 protein which is identical to that part of mouse ERR3. During our characterization of mouse ERR3, Eudy et al. (52Eudy J.D. Yao S. Weston M.D. Ma-Edmonds M. Talmadge C.B. Cheng J.J. Kimberling W.J. Sumegi J. Genomics. 1998; 50: 382-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of a human cDNA sequence ESRRG, which encoded a protein sequence sharing 98% amino acid identity with mouse ERR3 codons 24–458; no functional analysis of ESRRG was reported. Our mouse and human ERR3 cDNA sequences are totally unrelated to that of ESRRG before our ERR3 amino acid 24 (amino acid 1 in ESRRG), indicating that ESRRG and ERR3 are probably splicing variants produced from the same gene. RNA blot analysis of adult mouse tissues, using the N-terminal region of ERR3 as a probe, indicated the presence of a 5.7-kilobase transcript of ERR3 in selected tissues, with the highest expression in the heart, brain, and kidney, much lower expression in the liver, and no detectable expression in other tested tissues (Fig.2 A). In mouse embryo, ERR3 was not expressed at the 7-day stage; highest expression was detected during the 11–15-day period, and decreased expression at 17 days (Fig.2 B). Eudy et al. (52Eudy J.D. Yao S.

We, and others, recently identified a family of proteins termed Cool/Pix, which interact with Pak3. In cells, p50Cool-1 suppresses Pak activation by upstream activators; p85Cool-1 has a permissive effect on Pak activation, and we now show that the closely related Cool-2 stimulates Pak kinase activity. To understand the differential regulation of Pak by Cool proteins, we screened for Cool-interacting proteins by affinity purification and microsequencing. This has led to the identification of two closely related proteins called Cat (Cool-associated, tyrosine phosphorylated), which contain a zinc finger followed by three ankyrin repeats. Cat-1 is identical to the recently identified binding partner for the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK or GRK-2), which was shown to have Arf-GAP activity. Cat-1 and Cat-2 both bind to the COOH-terminal region of p85Cool-1 and p85Cool-2but do not bind to p50Cool-1. Cat-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in growing NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and its tyrosine phosphorylation is increased following cell spreading on fibronectin, decreased in cells arrested in mitosis, and increased in the ensuing G1 phase. Cat proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated when co-expressed in cells with the focal adhesion kinase Fak and Src. These findings suggest that in addition to playing a role in Cool/Pak interactions, Cat proteins may serve as points of convergence between G protein-coupled receptors, integrins, Arf GTPases, cell cycle regulators, and Cdc42/Rac/Pak signaling pathways.

The mammalian Paks are homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste20 protein kinase, which plays an essential role in the pheromone/mating factor pathway by regulating a protein kinase cascade that leads to the nucleus and stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinases FUS3/KSS1 (10Herskowitz I.

It was subsequently appreciated that both Cdc42 and Rac also initiate signaling cascades to the nucleus that involve activation of the stress responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun kinase, and p38 (11Minden A.

In some cases, it appears that Pak activation antagonizes RhoA-mediated signaling, resulting in dissolution of actin stress fibers and a decrease in the formation of focal complexes (17Manser E. Huang H.-Y. Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the overexpression of Pak leads to actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, which do not depend on its kinase activity (16Sells M. Knaus U. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), and that Pak is essential for neurite extension in rat adrenal PC12 cells (19Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that Pak is required for cell transformation by Ras (22Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation of Raf-1 by Pak may play an important role in Ras-mediated transformation (23King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Paks may therefore function as critical control proteins for a variety of Cdc42- and Rac-stimulated cellular responses making it likely that they are tightly regulated both in terms of their activity and cellular localization. Recent developments are consistent with an intricate regulation of the Paks, because a family of Pak-binding proteins named Cool (clonedout of library; Ref. 24Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A.

These proteins share tandem SH3, Dbl homology, and pleckstrin homology domains and associate with Paks via their SH3 domain. The presence of the Dbl homology domain implied a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity for the Cool proteins, which by directly activating Cdc42 and/or Rac would activate Pak. p85Cool-1 (identical to β-Pix and p85SPR) has been shown to have weak (25Manser E.

This suggests that either the exchange factor activities of Cool proteins are tightly regulated or that their mechanism of action does not involve exchange factor activity. This possibility is supported by the observation that p50Cool-1, a splice variant of p85Cool-1 that contains the presumptive exchange factor domain, inhibits rather than activates Pak (24Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). p85Cool-1 does not inhibit Pak activity but rather has a permissive effect on the stimulation of Pak by the GEF Dbl (24Bagrodia S.

The differences in the functional outcomes of the binding of p50Cool-1 and p85Cool-1 to an identical site on the Paks suggest that the extended carboxyl-terminal region of p85Cool-1 might prevent it from competitively inhibiting Pak autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of substrates. In the present work, we describe the identification and characterization of a family of proteins that bind to the carboxyl-terminal region of p85Cool-1 and do not bind to p50Cool-1. One of these is a 95-kDa protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo and therefore has been designated Cat-1 (Cool-associated,tyrosine phosphorylated). A second highly related gene product, M r ∼85 kDa, was cloned and named Cat-2. In addition to their specific binding to p85Cool-1, both Cat-1 and Cat-2 are also capable of binding to the carboxyl-terminal domain of Cool-2 (identical to α-Pix), a member of the Cool/Pix/p85SPR family that unlike Cool-1 activates Pak3 when the two proteins are co-expressed in cells. The abilities of the Cat proteins to selectively bind to Cool proteins, which promote rather than repress Pak activity, as well as our finding that Cat is tyrosine phosphorylated in a cell adhesion and cell cycle-dependent manner, suggest that Cool-Cat complexes may play key roles in Pak regulation. Based on peptide microsequencing results, oligonucleotides 5′-GATGCAGTCTGGCTTGCCACG-3′ and 5′-TCGTGTTGATGAGTACGCAGG-3′ corresponding to DAVWLAT and PEYSSTR, respectively, encoded by the human KIAA0148 gene were used to amplify a 96-bp PCR product from a lambda ZAP HeLa cDNA library (Stratagene). The PCR product was subcloned into PCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A lambda ZAP mouse NIH 3T3 cDNA phage library (Stratagene) was screened with the 96-bp PCR product labeled by randomly priming with [α-32P]dCTP (Prime-gene kit, Stratagene). Eight positive plaques were purified, and the excised cDNA inserts were partially sequenced. Several clones contained sequences related to the KIAA0148 gene. The longest clone (∼2100 bp) was sequenced and determined to lack the 5′-end. The 5′-end of Cat-2 containing the initiation ATG (∼400 bp) was cloned by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Life Technologies) from mouse brain poly(A) RNA (CLONTECH). Cool-2 was cloned from a human hippocampus lambda ZAP cDNA library (Stratagene) using a probe containing nucleotides 658–1324 that were generated using primers based on the GenBankTMD23304 sequence. Full-length Cat-2 was cloned into theBamHI site of hemagglutinin (HA)- or Myc-tagged pcDNA3.1Ack-2 or a Myc-tagged pcDNA3 vector as an ∼2480-bp insert. Full-length Cool-2 was cloned into the XbaI andPleI/SmaI sites in the Myc-tagged vector J3M as an ∼2500-bp insert. Cool-2 from the J3M vector was also subcloned into the XbaI/EcoRI sites of the Myc-tagged pcDNA3 vector. The COOH-terminal domain of Cool-1 spanning amino acids 369–649 was amplified by PCR and cloned as aBamHI-EcoRI fragment into Myc-tagged pcDNA3. The plasmid expressing COOH-terminal Flag-tagged rat Git-1 (G protein-coupled receptor kinaseinteractor-1) has been described previously (27Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A.

Plasmids expressing p50Cool-1, p85Cool-1, p85(W43K) Cool-1, and Dbl have all been described (24Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The Dbl homology domain of p85Cool-1 spanning amino acids 83–290 was amplified by PCR and subcloned as aBamHI-EcoRI fragment into the Myc-tagged CMVM6 vector. A cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 148–238 of Pak3 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into theBamHI-SalI site of the pGEX-KG plasmid to express the Cool-binding domain (CBD). Amino acids 537–666 of Cool-2 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into theBamHI-EcoRI site of plasmid pGEX-KG. The triple HA-tagged Fak, the kinase-defective HA-Fak (K454R), and HA-Fak(Y397F) expression plasmids have been described previously (28Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

The HA-Tiam-1 expression plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Frits Michiels (The Netherland Cancer Institute, Netherlands). GST-Cdc42, GST-Cdc42(Q61L), GST-CBD, and GST-Cool-2-(537–666) fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (29Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J.

LipofectAMINE-mediated transient transfections of COS or 3T3 cells were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc). Cells were lysed 36–48 h after the addition of DNA. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in lysis buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) with 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 5% glycerol and lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. For kinase assays, lysates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The amount of Pak3 in the lysates was first determined by Western blotting an aliquot prior to immunoprecipitation. Lysates containing equal amounts of Pak3 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Pak3 primary antibody (a gift from Dr. S. Pelech, Kinetek Biotechnology Corp., Vancouver, Canada) for 1–2 h followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer A and once with 2× kinase buffer (40 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm MnCl2) and mixed with 5 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of kinase buffer and 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 3.5 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm EDTA. Proteins eluted by boiling for 2 min were separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore) and autoradiographed prior to immunoblotting. Blots were stained with Amido Black, and bands corresponding to myelin basic protein were excised and subjected to Cherenkov counting. Blots were probed with anti-HA (12CA5 (ascites) or CA-11 (Babco)), anti-Myc (ascites), anti-FLAG M2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Cool (24Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L.

NIH 3T3 cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% calf serum. 1 × 106 cells were plated/100-mm dish 18–24 h prior to adding nocodazole (0.1 μg/ml). After 14 h of nocodazole treatment, mitotic cells were collected by shake-off. Cells were released from mitosis by washing twice with DMEM, plated in DMEM plus 10% calf serum on tissue culture plates, and lysed after 60 or 90 min. For cell adhesion, NIH 3T3 cells were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.5% calf serum for 18–24 h. Starved cells were trypsinized for 1–2 min, washed with DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), resuspended in DMEM, and added to plates coated with either bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml), fibronectin (10 μg/ml), or polylysine (10 μg/ml) for different time points. Tissue culture plates were treated with fibronectin or polylysine for 16 h at 4 °C. Plates were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (3×) and additionally treated with heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 2 h. We have previously shown that a novel Pak3 binding partner, named p50Cool-1 (clonedout of library), inhibits Pak3 activity and its stimulation by upstream activators. A larger splice variant designated p85Cool-1, which is identical to β-Pix (25Manser E. Loo T.-H. Koh C.-G. Zhao Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), competes with p50Cool-1 for binding to Pak3 but is not inhibitory and instead has a permissive effect on Pak3 activity (24Bagrodia S.

A related gene product, which we named Cool-2 and is identical to α-Pix (24Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 25Manser E. Loo T.-H. Koh C.-G. Zhao Z.-S. Chen X.-Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), also competes with p50Cool-1 for binding Pak3; however, it stimulates rather than inhibits Pak3 activity. These data are presented in Fig. 1. In this experiment, Pak3 was co-expressed with the different Cool proteins or with other members of the Dbl family, in COS cells. Pak3 was then precipitated, and its ability to phosphorylate exogenous substrates was assayed using myelin basic protein. In the absence of a stimulatory factor (e.g. activated Cdc42 or Rac), p50Cool-1had no detectable effect on myelin basic protein phosphorylation, whereas p85Cool-1 showed a modest (<2-fold) stimulation. However, like Dbl, Tiam-1 and Vav, which have been shown to act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Cdc42 or Rac (30Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 31Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G.

Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and thereby activate Cdc42/Rac-targets (e.g. Pak3), co-expression of Cool-2 with Pak3 also significantly stimulated Pak3 activity. These findings raise the question of why Cool-2 is able to bind and stimulate Pak3 activity or in the case of p85Cool-1 permissively support Pak3 activity, whereas p50Cool-1 acts as a competitive inhibitor of autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation. We reasoned that the extended carboxyl terminus present within p85Cool-1 and p85Cool-2, relative to p50Cool-1, may allow a protein-binding interaction that prevents these Cool molecules from blocking access to the protein kinase active site of Pak3. Thus, we set out to identify a binding partner that was capable of associating with p85Cool-1 and/or p85Cool-2 but not p50Cool-1. Our first clue to the existence of a cellular protein that binds specifically to p85Cool-1 or Cool-2, but not p50Cool-1, came from biochemical studies aimed at identifying Pak3-associated proteins. As shown in Fig.2 A, we initially noticed a tyrosine-phosphorylated ∼95-kDa protein that co-immunoprecipitated with Pak3 from NIH 3T3 cell lysates (lane 6). A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of identical mass was also detected when cell lysates were affinity precipitated with a GTPase-defective, constitutively active Cdc42 mutant, GST-Cdc42(Q61L) (Fig.2 A, lane 4) but not when lysates were incubated with GST-Cdc42(GDP) (lane 3). Thus, the 95-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (originally designated p95) appeared to associate with GST-Cdc42, perhaps via its association with Pak3. To delineate the region on Pak3 that was responsible for its association with p95, different GST-Pak3 fusion proteins were prepared and used as affinity reagents. A GST fusion protein that contained amino acid residues 148–238 of Pak3 was able to affinity precipitate the tyrosine-phosphorylated p95 from NIH 3T3 cell lysates (Fig.2 A, lane 5). We refer to this region on Pak3 as the CBD, because we have found that it is sufficient for binding the Cool proteins. The fact that the CBD was essential for the association of p95 raised the possibility that p95 may bind indirectly to Pak3 via Cool. This was further suggested when we were able to co-immunoprecipitate p95 with Cool from NIH 3T3 cells using an anti-Cool antibody (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). We were not able to detect endogenous Pak in the anti-Cool immunoprecipitates (possibly because there is less Pak than Cool or p95 in NIH 3T3 cells and/or because the Cool antibody interferes with the Pak3-binding site on Cool). Therefore, co-precipitation of p95 with Cool-1 could not be attributed to a p95-Pak interaction, but most likely reflected a direct interaction between p95 and Cool. We next set out to establish that the tyrosine-phosphorylated p95 that co-immunoprecipitated with Cool was identical to the 95-kDa protein that co-immunoprecipitated with Pak-3, as well as affinity precipitated with GST-CBD. The serial depletion of tyrosine-phosphorylated p95 from Src(Y527F)-transformed NIH 3T3 cell lysates resulted in a decrease in the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated p95 associated with GST-CBD (Fig.2 C, lanes 1–3) and in the amount of p95 associated with GST-Cool-2 (residues 537–666) (lane 4 where p95 was depleted from lysates versus lane 5 where it was not depleted). These data argue that the tyrosine-phosphorylated p95 that associated with Pak3 and GST-CBD was identical to the 95-kDa phosphoprotein that bound to GST-Cool-2 (residues 537–666). Because p95 was a Cool-associated andtyrosine-phosphorylated protein, we refer to it as Cat-1. It should be noted that the ability of Cat-1 to associate with activated Cdc42 (Fig. 2 A, lane 4) is apparently through a quaternary Cdc42-Pak3-Cool-Cat complex. Using GST-CBD as an affinity reagent, we set out to purify Cat-1 from Src(Y527F)-transformed cells, which can be grown to high density and appeared to contain relatively large amounts of the tyrosine-phosphorylated p95Catprotein. Silver staining revealed two major bands ofM r ∼86 and 95 kDa that were co-precipitated with GST-CBD (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2 and 3). The protein band at ∼86 kDa is p85Cool-1, as determined by microsequence analysis. Three peptides obtained from microsequencing of the 95-kDa protein were identical to a recently identified protein designated Git-1, which was discovered based on its ability to bind the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (GRK-2) (27Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The same three peptides obtained from the 95-kDa protein also showed close matches with an ∼50-kDa human protein of unknown function, KIAA0148 (peptide 1, 15/15 identity; peptide 2, 16/18 identity; peptide 3, 13/16 identity, 15/16 similarity). We also identified an additional related protein through molecular cloning, using oligonucleotides derived from the KIAA0148 sequence to screen an NIH 3T3 cDNA library. We isolated a full-length clone that encodes a protein of 708 amino acids that we termed Cat-2 (Fig. 3 B). As shown below, both Cat-1 and Cat-2 are Cool-binding proteins. Cat-2 appears to be 81% identical and 87% similar to a paxillin-binding protein designated paxillin kinase linker (Pkl) (45Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 45: 851-863Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and Cat-2 is 69% identical and 78% similar to rat Git-1 and 86% identical and 89% similar to human KIAA0148. In summary, we believe that Cat-1 is the mouse homolog of rat Git-1 and that Cat-2 is an alternatively spliced homolog of human Pk1 and KIAA0148. Both Cat-1 and Cat-2 are widely distributed in a variety of tissues including heart, brain, and skeletal muscle (data not shown). Blast sequence analysis showed that like Cat-1, the Cat-2 protein has a Gcs-type (33Zhang C. Cavenagh M.M. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

Both Cat-1 and Cat-2 also show sequence similarity to ASAP1, a phospholipid-dependent Arf-GAP that associates with and is phosphorylated by Src (34Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G.

These post-translationally modified peptides may serve as an early immunologic stimulus in autoimmune disease. The immune system has evolved to be tolerant of self-proteins by the deletion of autoreactive cells in the thymus or bone marrow and by the establishment of B and T lymphocyte anergy in the peripheral circulation (1Billingham R.E.

These mechanisms are based on the presentation of a vast array of self-peptides to the lymphoid repertoire. Despite the efforts to instruct the immune system to ignore self-tissues, the appearance of various autoimmune diseases demonstrates that tolerance to self-antigens is not perfect. Flaws in the development of immune tolerance can be revealed by the immunization of animal models with a variety of self-peptides leading to B and T cell autoimmunity as well as autoimmune-mediated pathology (7Lehmann P.V.

How tolerance is broken in the initiation of autoimmunity is not completely understood. The immunization of mice with a single self-peptide, the amino-terminal 11 amino acids of myelin basic protein (MBP) 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, myelin basic protein; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in complete Freund's adjuvant can elicit pathology resembling that of human multiple sclerosis (7Lehmann P.V. Forsthuber T. Miller A. Sercarz E.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The induction of disease requires a post-translationally acetylated form of MBP peptide 1–11. While this disease can be elicited with a single self-peptide or even with T cells of a single specificity, the autoimmune response diversifies to many sites on the MBP over the course of the disease. T cell responses originate with the dominant single self-peptide but rapidly evolve to include other cryptic peptide epitopes within MBP. Similar observations of determinant spreading have been made in murine models of diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), two diseases arising spontaneously in susceptible strains of mice (8Kaufman D.L. Clare-Salzier M. Tian J. Forsthuber T. Ting G.S.P. Robinson P. Atkinson M.A. Sercarz E.E. Tobin A.J. Lehmann P.V.

Antinuclear autoantibodies specific for double-stranded DNA and the U1/Sm ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) are diagnostic markers of SLE. The snRNP particle is an RNA-protein complex essential for the splicing of pre-mRNA (14Wassarman D.A. Steitz J.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1918-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Proteins designated B, B′, and D comprise the target proteins of anti-Sm autoantibodies in SLE patients. It is not known how high affinity autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells arise to these intracellular proteins. The mature phenotype of autoantibodies found in diseases such as SLE indicates that autoimmunity is driven by helper T lymphocytes and a source of antigen (15Steinberg A.D. Roths J.B. Murphy E.D.

While it is clear that autoimmunity can spread to several sites on an autoantigen over the course of experimentally induced disease models, the initiating antigenic peptide in naturally arising disease is unknown. A hypothesis of molecular mimicry implies that foreign pathogens that share amino acid sequences with self-peptides can break immunologic tolerance in the induction of autoimmunity. However, no pathogen has been unambiguously linked with the induction of any human autoimmune syndrome. Alternatively, we have initiated studies to consider forms of self-antigens that can be viewed as “foreign” by the immune system. As would be expected, we have demonstrated that the immune system does not respond to immunization with selected peptides from self-proteins. However, when the same self-peptides are converted to the isoaspartyl isoform, vigorous autoimmune responses develop upon immunization. After initiation by the isoaspartyl peptide isoforms, autoimmunity is amplified to other peptides on the autoantigen. Isoaspartyl peptides arise spontaneously under physiologic conditions and are particularly elevated in cells undergoing stress and in aging cells (21Aswad D.W. Aswad D.W.

With relevance to immune responses, it is possible that tolerance to these forms of self-proteins fails to occur early in lymphocyte development. Based on the enhanced immunity to some isoaspartylated self-peptides, it is possible that an accumulation of these aberrant peptides may be an early stimulus for an autoimmune responses. Aspartyl and isoaspartyl forms of murine snRNP D peptide 65–79 (IRYFILPDSLPLDTL), murine cytochrome c 90–104 (ERADLIAYLKKATNE), and murine cytochrome c81–104 (IFAGIKKKGERADLIAYLKKATNE) were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)) biochemistry in the Yale University/W.M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory. Isoaspartyl residues of aspartic acid were introduced at the residues designated in bold (as indicated above). Peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography to single peaks and were analyzed by mass spectroscopy, amino acid analysis, amino acid sequencing, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, as described below). Native murine U1/Sm snRNPs were purified as described previously (26Bringmann P. Rinke J. Appel B. Reuter R. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, agarose bound mouse monoclonal anti-trimethylguanosine (Oncogene Sciences, Manhasset, New York) was used for affinity purification of snRNP particles. Nuclear extracts were added to the anti-trimethylguanosine column at a rate of 2 ml/min and bound snRNPs competitively eluted under nondenaturing conditions using 20 mm 7-methylguanosine. Eluted snRNPs were dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol, concentrated, and stored at −70 °C for future use. The efficiency of binding to and elution from the anti-trimethylguanosine column was assessed using both RNA and protein gel electrophoresis. The 70,000, A, B, C, and D proteins of the U1 snRNP particle were approximately equal in quantity in these preparations. Native murine and pigeon cytochrome c was purchased from Sigma and repurified by ion exchange chromatography. B10.A, B10.BR, and MRL lpr/lpr mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. Samples of either peptide were dissolved in H2O/D2O (90:10) to a final concentration of 9 mm (for aspartyl 90–104) or 1.6 mm (for isoaspartyl 90–104). No pH adjustments were made to neutralize residual trifluoroacetic acid in the preparations. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, myelin basic protein; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayH- 1The abbreviations used are: MBP, myelin basic protein; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayH ROESY spectra were acquired on a Bruker AM-500 spectrometer at ambient temperature. Both spectra consisted of a 4096 × 256 point data matrix, with 16 transients per F1 point for A, and 256 transients per F1 point for B. Spectra were processed off-line using FELIX (Biosym, San Diego). In F2, the data were apodized with a 2048 point π/2 phase-shifted sine-bell function, and then were Fourier transformed. Prior to Fourier transformation in F1, the data were zero filled to 2048 points, and were apodized with a 256 point π/2 phase-shifted sine-bell function. Spectra were referenced in F1 and F2 by setting the water resonance to 4.7 ppm. Isoaspartyl residues were detected by the enzyme, protein isoaspartyl methyltransferase, according to the manufacturer's protocol (ISOQUANTTM Protein Deamidation Detection Kit, Promega Corp., Madison, WI). In brief, samples and control peptides are incubated 30 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing protein isoaspartyl methyltransferase, [3H]S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and cold S-adenosyl-l-methionine. The reaction is stopped at pH 10 on ice and volatile [3H]methanol is condensed in the reaction vessel. Fifty μl of sample is adsorbed to a sponge attached to the cap of a scintillation vial. The sample is incubated 60 min at 40 °C to volatilize [3H]methanol into the scintillation mixture and counted for counts/min. Positive controls include those provided in the ISOQUANTTM kit as well as synthetic peptides described above containing 1 isoaspartyl residue/peptide (1 pmol of [3H]methanol/pmol of protein). In some experiments, isoaspartyl levels were examined in mitogen-activated B and T lymphocyte populations. In brief, freshly isolated splenic or lymph node B and T cells (5 × 105/ml) were cultured with either lipopolysaccharide (10 μg/ml) for 48 h or with concanavalin A (10 μg/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell pellets (104 cells) were collected from each culture, lysed by sonication in 100 μl of PBS/Tween, and assayed for isoaspartyl content as described above. Control cultures were incubated under identical conditions in the absence of lipopolysaccharide or concanavalin A. B10.A mice were immunized subcutaneously with 100 μg of either isoform of the murine snRNP D or cytochrome c peptide in PBS emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco). After 10 days, the draining lymph nodes (popliteal, inguinal, and periaortic) were excised and single cell suspensions were prepared. Cells were cultured in triplicates (5 × 105 cells/well) in 200 μl of Clicks medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics). Antigen stimulation was provided by adding the aspartyl or isoaspartyl isoforms of the snRNP D or cytochrome c peptides, whole mouse cytochromec (Sigma), or purified native murine snRNPs, as indicated. After 3 days, cultures were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine, harvested 16 h later onto glass fiber filters, and counted in a BetaPlate liquid scintillation counter (LKB Wallac). Bar graphs represent cultures in which the deviation was less than 10% of the mean counts/min of triplicate cultures. Individual experiments utilized two to three mice immunized with each peptide. The data are representative of at least six individual proliferation experiments. Groups or four to six B10.A mice were immunized at day 0 with 50 μg of the indicated peptide emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted with the same peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at day 21. Mice were bled at day 28 and at weekly intervals thereafter. Antibody binding to individual peptides was measured by ELISA and reported as optical density (405 nm). Polystyrene plates were pretreated with 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.0 for 3 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, peptides were added at a concentration of 5 μg/ml PBS (pH 8.0) for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS before use. All subsequent wash steps used PBS with 0.05% Tween 20. Serum was diluted 1/200 in PBS/Tween with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in wells for 4 h at room temperature. In some experiments, serum dilutions were preincubated for 4 h at room temperature with selected peptides or proteins (as indicated in figures) in order to examine specific solution phase inhibition of antibody responses. After a first incubation of plates with primary antibody, plates were washed three times with PBS/Tween. Bound antibody was quantitated by sequential incubations with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine buffer as chromogenic substrate. NMS indicates the use of preimmune mouse serum. Anti-double-stranded DNA binding was similarly examined by commercially available ELISA (Arlington Scientific, Inc., Arlington, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All data points and percent inhibitions were calculated from the mean of triplicate wells in which individual standard deviation was less than 15% of the mean O.D. (405 nm) signal. The B cell lymphoma CH-27 was used as a source I-Ak and I-Ek MHC class II molecules. The cell line was maintained in vitro by culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), and 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). Large quantities of cells were grown in spinner cultures. Cells were lysed at a concentration of 108 cells/ml in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 25 mmiodoacetamide. The lysates were cleared of debris and nuclei by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Mouse class II molecules were purified as described previously (42Gorga J.C. Horejsi V. Johnson D.R. Raghupathy R. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16087-16094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sette A. Buus S. Colon S. Miles C. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 35-40PubMed Google Scholar) using the 10.3.6 monoclonal antibody (I-Ak-specific) and 14.4.4 (I-Ed,k-specific), coupled to Sepharose 4B beads. Lysates were filtered through 0.8- and 0.4-μm filters and then passed over the appropriate antibody columns, which were then washed with 15 column volumes of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 2 column volumes of PBS containing 0.4% n-octylglucoside. MHC class II was eluted with 0.05 m diethylamine in 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.4% n-octylglucoside (pH 11.5). A 1/20 volume of 1.0 m Tris, 1.5 m NaCl (pH 6.8) was added to the eluate to reduce the pH to ∼7.5, and then concentrated by centrifugation in Centriprep 30 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Purified mouse class II molecules (5–500 nm) were incubated with 1–10 nm125I-radiolabeled peptides for 48 h in PBS containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture. Purified peptides were iodinated using the chloramine-T method (44Buus S. Sette A. Colon S.M. Miles C. Grey H.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes used were HEL p46–61 for I-Ak and λ-repressor 12–26 for I-Ek. I-Ak and I-Ek assays were performed at pH 5.0 (45Sette A. Southwood S. O'Sullivan D. Gaeta F.C. Sidney J. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 844-851PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide inhibitors were typically tested at concentrations ranging from 120 μg/ml to 1.2 ng/ml. The data were then plotted and the dose yielding 50% inhibition (IC50) was measured. In appropriate stoichiometric conditions, the IC50 of an unlabeled test peptide to the purified MHC is a reasonable approximation of the affinity of interaction (K d). Peptides were tested in two to four completely independent experiments. Class II peptide complexes were separated from free peptide by gel filtration on TSK2000 columns (TosoHaas 16215, Montgomeryville, PA), and the fraction of bound peptide calculated as described previously (43Sette A. Buus S. Colon S. Miles C. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 35-40PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, each of the I-A and I-E preparations were titered in the presence of fixed amounts of radiolabeled peptides to determine the concentration of class II molecules necessary to bind 10–20% of the total radioactivity. All subsequent inhibition and direct binding assays were then performed using these class II concentrations. In previous studies using cytochrome c as a model autoantigen, immunization with a cryptic self-peptide from the carboxyl terminus of mouse cytochrome c (residues 81–104) can elicit strong autoimmune responses (10Mamula M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Shorter cytochrome c peptides within p81–104 were then synthesized to more accurately identify the range of T cell immune tolerance to self-cytochrome cpeptides. In the course of these studies, two separate preparations of murine cytochrome c 90–104 were synthesized approximately 4 months apart. B10.A mice were immunized individually with either preparation of self-peptide emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. We discovered that one preparation of the cytochrome cpeptide produced strong T cell responses in a proliferative assay, whereas a second preparation, synthesized 4 months later, elicited no B or T cell responses in a manner identical to Fig.1 A, left (isoaspartyl) andright (aspartyl) sets of columns. We next sought to determine the biological properties that conferred immunity to one peptide preparation while a second preparation of the same self-peptide elicited no responses. Both cytochrome cpeptide preparations had identical compositions by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry but had different retention times by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (data not shown). Amino acid sequencing revealed that the non-immunogenic peptide contained the predicted sequence of mouse cytochrome c while the immunogenic peptide sequenced as predicted to the site of an aspartic acid at residue 4 from the amino terminus (data not shown). Thereafter, the sequencing reaction was blocked. Both peptide preparations were analyzed by two-dimensional NMR to determine the structural basis for this difference in immunogenicity (Fig.2). The analysis demonstrated that in the immunogenic cytochrome c peptide, Asp93 was joined to Leu94 through an amide bond involving the carboxyl group of the side chain (27Chazin W.J. Kordel J. Thulin E. Hofmann T. Drakenberg T. Forsen S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8646-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We did not detect any other physical or biochemical differences between the two peptides. As described earlier, isoaspartyl post-translational modifications occur through a cyclic imide intermediate formed by the attack of peptide bond nitrogen on the side chain carbonyl (27Chazin W.J. Kordel J. Thulin E. Hofmann T. Drakenberg T. Forsen S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8646-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Under cellular physiologic conditions, hydrolysis of the cyclic intermediate yields either the isoaspartyl peptide or conversion back to the normal (aspartyl) form. T lymphocyte responses after immunization with isoaspartyl and aspartyl forms of self-cytochrome c 90–104 are illustrated in Fig.1 A. As demonstrated, T cell responses arise only after immunization with the isoaspartyl cytochrome c peptide while tolerance (or unresponsiveness) is maintained to the aspartyl form. T cell responses elicited by the isoaspartyl cytochrome c are not cross-reactive and do not respond to stimulation with the aspartyl peptide or with native cytochrome c protein. Immunogenicity was not related to MHC binding properties since it was determined that the aspartyl and isoaspartyl isoform peptides had virtually identical affinity for the restricting I-Ek class II molecule (TableI).Table IAffinity of isoaspartyl and normal isoform peptides to MHC class II (I-Ek)PeptideK dμmCytochrome c81–95239Aspartyl cytochrome c 90–1042.2Isoaspartyl cytochrome c 90–1042.0λ Repressor 12–260.29K d of individual peptides were examined in solution phase to affinity- purified MHC class II (I-Ek; see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab K d of individual peptides were examined in solution phase to affinity- purified MHC class II (I-Ek; see “Experimental Procedures”). Positive and negative control peptides (λ repressor peptide 12–26 and cytochrome c peptide 81–95, respectively) were included in parallel assays. Since the isoaspartyl form of self-peptides can arise physiologically in cells, we wanted to determine if specific T cells and/or autoantibodies of autoimmune disease could be initiated by post-translationally modified peptides. We examined the immunogenicity of an aspartyl and an isoaspartyl peptide of the D protein component of the U1/Sm snRNP, an autoantigenic target of human SLE and in murine models of this disease. Normal, non-autoimmune prone strains of mice were immunized with either form of the peptide emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. In a manner similar to immunization with isoforms of self-cytochrome c, T cells from mice immunized with the isoaspartyl form of the snRNP D peptide responded to the isoaspartyl peptide (Fig. 1 B) but not to the aspartyl (normal) form of the same peptide or to the native snRNP particle. In contrast, no T cell response was observed when the aspartyl form of the snRNP D peptide was used as the immunogen. We next investigated the humoral immune responses in mice immunized with either the normal or isoaspartyl forms of cytochrome cpeptides or the snRNP D peptides (Fig.3). Antibodies were elicited by immunization with the isoaspartyl form of cytochrome c with specific binding to the isoaspartyl immunogen as well as to the aspartyl form of peptide from either the p81–104, p90–104, and also to the native cytochrome c protein. In contrast to T cell immune responses, antibodies elicited by the isoaspartyl peptide are cross-reactive in their ability to bind either isoform of self-peptide. As a control, antibodies did not bind to an irrelevant cytochromec peptide 52–67. Immunization with the aspartyl peptide did not elicit detectable antibodies at any time point even when followed to more than 6 months post-immunizations. Solution-phase inhibition studies were performed to better elucidate the fine specificity and/or degree of epitope spreading of antibody responses to the isoaspartyl cytochrome c isoform peptide (Table II). Anti-isoaspartyl cytochromec 90–104 antibodies were preincubated with specific peptides in solution prior to their binding by ELISA to the longer isoforms of cytochrome c peptide 81–104. As a control, the unrelated cytochrome c peptide, 52–67 failed to inhibit binding to either cytochrome c isoform of 81–104. In contrast, isoaspartyl p91–104 significantly inhibited binding to either cytochrome c 81–104 isoform. The ability of native cytochrome c or the aspartyl forms of p81–104 and p90–104 to primarily inhibit binding to the aspartyl isoform indicates that subsets of autoantibodies exist that selectively bind either the isoaspartyl or aspartyl structure individually. The lack of complete inhibition in these specific studies may be due to antibodies elicited to amino acid sequences flanking the aspartyl site.Table IICompetitive inhibition of antibodies raised to isoaspartyl cytochrome c 90–104Inhibitor% Inhibition of binding toAspartyl 81–104Isoaspartyl 81–104Aspartyl 90–1047440Isoaspartyl 90–1048084Aspartyl 81–1047036Isoaspartyl 81–1047491Native cytochromec7711Cytochrome c52–6795Serum was collected from mice immunized with the isoaspartyl cytochrome c 90–104 peptide (see “Experimental Procedures”).

The interstitial invasion of endothelial cells during angiogenesis is accompanied by up-regulation of several matrix metalloproteinases, including membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). In this study, we show that endothelial cells stimulated to undergo angiogenesis by a three-dimensional extracellular matrix environment increase production of the transcription factor Egr-1. Increased binding of Egr-1 to the MT1-MMP promoter correlates with enhanced transcriptional activity, whereas mutations in the Egr-1 binding site abrogate the increased transcription of MT1-MMP in the stimulated cells. These data identify Egr-1-mediated transcription of MT1-MMP as a mechanism by which endothelial cells can initiate an invasive phenotype in response to an alteration in extracellular matrix environment, thus functionally associating MT1-MMP with a growing number of proteins known to be up-regulated by Egr-1 in response to tissue injury or mechanical stress.

Angiogenesis is a critical component of the adaptations that occur in response to chronic increases in metabolic activity within tissues or tumors (1Pepper M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 605-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 2Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6087) Google Scholar). Defining the regulation of genes involved in early stages of angiogenesis is fundamental to our understanding of this process and to the selection of target control points for therapeutics intended either to augment or to inhibit growth of new blood vessels. Proteolysis of the capillary basement membrane is thought to be a prerequisite for subsequent invasion and migration of capillary endothelial cells into the interstitium, where new capillaries are established (1Pepper M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 605-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of protease production by endothelial cells represents a potentially powerful control point in the angiogenesis pathway. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT, membrane-type; 3D, three-dimensional; 2D, two-dimensional; ActD, actinomycin D; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay comprise a family of structurally related zinc endopeptidases capable of proteolysis of numerous components of the extracellular matrix as well as nonmatrix molecules (3Woessner Jr., J.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Production and activation of MMPs correlates strongly with migratory and invasive behavior in many cell types, including endothelium (4Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 5Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs), which contain a membrane spanning domain, play a unique role compared with secreted MMPs because their cell membrane location focuses extracellular matrix proteolysis on the cell surface, and perhaps specific subdomains of the cell surface, such as the leading edge of a migrating cell (6Nakahara H. Howard L. Thompson E.W. Sato H. Seiki M. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7959-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The most ubiquitous and well characterized MT-MMP, MT1-MMP (MMP-14), is known to have substrate specificity for diverse extracellular matrices including collagens type I and III, fibronectin, and tenascin (7d'Ortho M.P. Will H. Atkinson S. Butler G. Messent A. Gavrilovic J. Smith B. Timpl R. Zardi L. Murphy G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP was demonstrated recently to be an effective activator of fibrin, implicating it as an important player in fibrinolytic cascades (8Hiraoka N. Allen E. Apel I.J. Gyetko M.R. Weiss S.J. Cell. 1998; 95: 365-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In addition to its direct proteolysis of extracellular matrix components, MT1-MMP, together with tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-2, has been shown to play a pivotal role in the cell surface tethering and activation of pro-MMP-2 (9Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar, 10Nagase H. Cell Res. 1998; 8: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In many tissues, MMP-2 is produced constitutively, but is found almost entirely in latent form. MT1-MMP mRNA and protein levels are very low in most noninvasive cells but are up-regulated in invasive cells, and this up-regulation correlates with increased activation of MMP-2 (11Sato H. Okada Y. Seiki M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, production of MT1-MMP likely is a major rate-limiting component of MMP-2 activation. Despite the correlation between MT1-MMP levels and invasive phenotype, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of MT1-MMP mRNA. Our previous studies showed that up-regulation of MT1-MMP mRNA and protein occurs in microvascular endothelial cells cultured in a malleable three-dimensional (3D) type I collagen matrix (12Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the cells adhere to and reorganize the matrix, establishing tractional forces that, in turn, elicit invasive and angiogenic behaviors including cell elongation and migration within the extracellular matrix to form multicell networks and tubular structures. Production of MT1-MMP correlates with this phenotype, and treatment of these cultures with MMP inhibitors or antibodies greatly reduces the ability of these cells to form capillary-like structures (12Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 13Montesano R. Orci L.

Derm. 1998; 111: 1153-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) Furthermore, invasion and migration of fibroblasts and carcinoma cells have been attributed to three-dimensional type I collagen-induced up-regulation of MMPs, including MT1-MMP, implying that extracellular matrix-dependent signaling may be an important means by which multiple cell types regulate production of MT1-MMP (15Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gilles C. Polette M. Seiki M. Birembaut P. Thompson E.W. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tomasek J.J.

Taken together with other studies that have examined the effects of tractional force-dependent mechanical stress on cell behavior (18Roskelly C.D. Srebrow A. Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 19Chicurel M.E. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), there is extensive evidence that adhesion-mediated mechanical forces play a critical role in determining cell phenotype, and in particular, affecting protease production. In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms underlying transcriptional up-regulation of MT1-MMP in endothelial cells under noninvasive or invasive conditions. We found that 3D collagen matrix-induced MT1-MMP transcriptional activity occurred as a consequence of increased production and promoter binding of the transcription factor Egr-1. This finding is notable because it defines a mechanism for extracellular matrix/mechanical force-sensitive transcriptional regulation of MT1-MMP production and it links MT1-MMP to numerous vascular cell gene products involved in tissue remodeling that also are up-regulated by Egr-1 as a result of mechanical stress. A genomic clone of murine MT1-MMP (pm145) in pBluescript SK containing 4.7 kilobases of 5′-flanking and untranslated sequence, exon 1 and part of intron 1 (20Apte S.S. Fukai N. Beier D.R. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25511-25517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was sequenced bidirectionally using automated dye-labeled sequencing (Keck facility, Yale University). The sequence was analyzed using the TRANSFAC data base (21Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 364-370Crossref Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. Ribonuclease protection assays were performed to locate the 5′-transcription start site(s). Probes were generated by subcloning aPstI-SacII fragment of pm145 (360-base pair fragment from −395 to −39 from ATG) into Bluescript followed by transcription with either T7 or T3 polymerase to generate sense and antisense riboprobes labeled with [32P]UTP, which were gel-purified prior to use in ribonuclease protection assays. The RPAII kit (Ambion) was used according to manufacturer's directions, using 20–40 μg of total RNA (isolated from NIH 3T3 cells, day 11 mouse embryo, or mouse placenta) and 1.5 × 105 cpm of probe per sample. Samples were analyzed first on a 11 × 15-cm 5% acrylamide denaturing gel and then on a 8% acrylamide denaturing sequencing gel to provide better size resolution of the protected fragments. Ambion century markers and [γ-32P]dATP end-labeled 10- and 25-base pair DNA ladders were used as size markers. The assay was repeated five times using multiple preparations of RNA and probes. Start sites were calculated by approximating the band size of each protected fragment and calculating their corresponding distances from the ATG codon, with the assumption that RNase degradation occurred only from the 5′-end of the probe. MT1-MMP mRNA half-life was estimated using RNA harvested from cultured rat microvascular endothelial cells exposed to actinomycin D (ActD) (10 μg/ml). Microvascular endothelial cells were isolated from rat epididymal fat pad and cultured as described previously (22Madri J.A. Williams S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were either plated as a monolayer on type I collagen (2D culture) or embedded within a three-dimensional collagen matrix (3D culture) (23Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. Tucker A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). After 1 day of culture in these conditions, ActD was added to all cultures. RNA was harvested from cells after 0, 4, 8, 12, and 18 h of ActD treatment, and samples were analyzed by Northern blotting (12Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Following autoradiography, films were scanned, and MT1-MMP mRNA band intensity was quantitated using Biomax software (Kodak) and normalized to 28 S ribosomal RNA. Intensities were expressed as a ratio to the 0 h samples. Results from four experiments were averaged and expressed as mean ± S.E. mRNA half-life was estimated using a linear regression best-fit to mathematically define the decay profile (Cricket Graph 1.1). Restriction enzyme-generated fragments of the MT1-MMP genomic clone (SacII site at position −39 as the 3′-end) were subcloned into the pGL3 Basic reporter vector (Promega) for use in transient transfection assays. Additional truncation constructs of the MT1-MMP-luciferase constructs were generated using Erase-a-Base (Promega) and sequenced to define the sites of the resultant truncations. Mutations of the Egr-1 and Sp1 binding sites (refer to Fig. 4 A) were made to the −300-base pair truncation construct using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. β-Galactosidase cDNA (originating from pCMVβ) (CLONTECH) was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for use as a normalization vector for transient transfections (β-galactosidase-pcDNA3). An Egr-1-pcDNA3 expression vector was generated using the full-length human Egr-1 coding sequence kindly provided by Dr. Vikas Sukhatme (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Lipofectamine-based transient transfections of MT1-MMP promoter sequences and β-galactosidase-pcDNA3 were performed on primary cultures of rat microvascular endothelial cells (passages 5–9), according to manufacturer's directions (Life Technologies, Inc.). On day 2, cells were trypsinized and split into 2D and 3D culture conditions (23Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. Tucker A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). On day 3, cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase (luciferase assay system; Promega) and β-galactosidase activity (Galacto-Light Plus; Tropix) according to the manufacturers' directions. Luminescence was detected with a Lumat 9500 (EG&G Wallac). Data were normalized for β-galactosidase activity and then expressed as fold increase in comparison to the light output of pGL3 Basic (promoterless, enhancerless luciferase construct) samples. Results from four independent experiments, each with duplicate wells, were averaged. In a second series of experiments, either Egr-1-pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 was transiently co-transfected into COS-1 cells together with β-galactosidase-pcDNA3 and either pGL3-Basic or MT1-MMP(−300)-luciferase. Cells were lysed after 48 h and assayed for luciferase activity as described above. Northern blots for Sp1 and Egr-1 mRNA were performed on total RNA harvested from endothelial cells cultured for 20 h in either 2D or 3D conditions, using probes constructed from the Egr-1 expression vector and from murine Sp1 cDNA kindly provided by Dr. Mural Mouradian (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and analyzed as detailed above. Endothelial and COS-1 cells were lysed in 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and Western blotting was done using polyclonal antibodies against Sp1 and Egr-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Histone H1 (Anti-histone H1; Pharmingen) or vimentin levels in the lysates were used to normalize loading variations among samples. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) was performed according to the manufacturer's directions. Consensus Sp1 and Egr-1 binding double-stranded oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and complimentary oligonucleotides corresponding to base pairs −303 to −284 (wild-type) and −309 to −276 (mutants) (synthesized by Critical Technologies Laboratory, Yale University; see Fig. 4 A for sequence details) of the MT1-MMP promoter were annealed and end-labeled using [32P]ATP. Enriched sources of Egr-1 (in vitro transcribed and translated using Promega TNT system) and recombinant Sp1 (Promega) were used to define the binding patterns of these transcription factors to wild-type and mutated MT1-MMP oligonucleotide sequences. Nuclear extracts of endothelial cells cultured in two or three dimensions (20 h) were prepared using a mini-extraction procedure, with modifications (24Pang H. Miranda K. Fine A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 3D cultures were treated with ActD (10 μg/ml), treated with collagenase for 15 min to release cells from the gel, and then pelleted and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. 2D endothelial cells were treated with ActD and then scraped into phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. Both samples were pelleted, resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete mixture, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). After a 15-min incubation on ice, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the cell suspension was incubated for 5 min on ice and then pelleted (700 × g for 5 min). The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended and incubated for 20 min in hypertonic solution (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Complete mixture, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). After a 15-min spin (14,000 × g), glycerol was added to the supernatant (final concentration, 10% (v/v)), protein concentration was determined using BCA (Pierce), and extracts were used immediately in EMSA reactions or were frozen (−80 °C). Gel shift reactions consisted of 5 × 104 cpm oligonucleotide probe, binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 500 ng of salmon sperm DNA, 1 μl of TNT reaction or recombinant Sp1, or 5–10 μg of cellular lysate. For supershift assays, 1–2 μl of the appropriate antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction and incubated for 15 min prior to gel loading. Reactions were electrophoresed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. Statistical significance for each data set was tested using the paired, two-tailed Student's t test, with the significance level set at p < 0.05 (Excel 5.0 software for the Power Mac). Sequencing of a genomic clone containing 3.3 kilobases of the murine MT1-MMP 5′ noncoding region showed that this gene lacks a TATA box (Fig. 1 A). Consensus binding sites for transcription factors include Sp1, Egr-1, AP-4, NFκB, and Nkx-2 (murine tinman homolog) but not AP-1 or AP-2, and there are no typical transforming growth factor-β, hypoxia, or shear stress response elements. The apparent absence of both a TATA box and common phorbol ester- and growth factor-inducible elements within the murine MT1-MMP promoter region are characteristics shared with the MMP-2 promoter but contrast with most other MMP genes, which are known to be regulated strongly by AP-1, AP-2, and transforming growth factor-β responses (25Vincenti M.P. White L.A. Schroen D.J. Benbow U. Brinkerhoff C.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 391-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Crawford H. Matrisian L.M. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Multiple transcription start sites, as identified by ribonuclease protection assay, were localized to a region −260 to −200 base pairs 5′ of the ATG codon (Fig. 1 B). The use of a cluster of multiple start sites is consistent with a TATA-less promoter. Previously, we demonstrated a significant 3.2 ± 1.1-fold increase in MT1-MMP mRNA in primary cultures of rat microvascular endothelial cells stimulated to an invasive phenotype by culture within a 3D type I collagen matrix as compared with noninvasive cells cultured on a planar coating of type I collagen (2D) (12Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Estimations of MT1-MMP mRNA half-life showed no significant differences when comparing 2D and 3D cultured cells (t 12 = 26 and 27 h, respectively), suggesting that transcriptional control of MT1-MMP is likely a major contributor to the difference in mRNA levels seen between 2D and 3D cultures (Fig.2 A). Transcriptional activity of the MT1-MMP promoter region was assessed in endothelial cells using full-length and truncated promoter sequences coupled to the reporter gene encoding luciferase. Comparisons were made between the transcriptional activity of cells cultured in 2D with that of cells in 3D. The full-length MT1-MMP promoter activity was 2.4-fold higher in 3D compared with 2D cells (Fig. 2 B). Although transcriptional activity varied moderately with truncations of distal 5′ noncoding regions, the region between −300 and −220 base pair was sufficient to provide both a low level of basal activity in 2D and 2.2-fold enhanced transcriptional activity in 3D, and thus was considered to contain the nominal elements necessary to enhance transcription in 3D-stimulated endothelial cells. Within the region between −300 and −220 lies a GC-rich sequence (−288 to −275) that contains overlapping consensus binding sites for Sp1 and Egr-1. It has been demonstrated that Sp1 and Egr-1 compete for binding to such regions, with higher levels of transcription occurring when Egr-1 rather than Sp1 is bound to the promoter (27Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Applying the hypothesis that a similar pattern of Sp1 and Egr-1 control would be involved in regulation of the MT1-MMP promoter, the endogenous levels of Sp1 and Egr-1 were assessed in 2D and 3D cultures of rat microvascular endothelial cells. Egr-1 and Sp1 mRNA and protein products were detectable in both 2D and 3D conditions. After 20 h of 3D culture, Egr-1 mRNA was 2.2 ± 0.2-fold greater than in 2D cultured cells, whereas Sp1 mRNA was 0.62 ± 0.13 that of 2D cultured cells (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, Sp1 protein levels in 3D were unchanged (0.99 ± 0.14), whereas Egr-1 protein levels were increased 2.2 ± 0.18-fold in 3D (Fig. 3 B), providing support for the involvement of Egr-1 rather than Sp1 in mediating the 3D collagen matrix induction of MT1-MMP. EMSA analyses, using oligonucleotides containing either wild-type or mutated MT1-MMP promoter sequences (Fig.4 A), were performed to determine Egr-1 and Sp1 binding profiles. Recombinant Egr-1 interacted with the wild-type MT1-MMP oligonucleotide and could be supershifted with specific antibodies to Egr-1 (Fig. 4 B). Mutant oligonucleotides 1 and 3, both containing a GG to TA mutation within the Egr-1 binding site, blocked Egr-1 binding. Binding of Egr-1 to mutant 2 (GG to TA mutation in the 5′ Sp1 site) was unaffected. Mutant 4 (multiple G to T point mutations within both Sp1 and Egr-1 sites) allowed partial binding of Egr-1. Recombinant Sp1 also bound to the MT1-MMP wild-type oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 B). Antibodies to Sp1 depleted the Sp1 gel shift band. Sp1 interacted strongly with mutant sequences 2 and 3, very weakly with mutant 1, and not at all with mutant 4. Recombinant AP2, which also binds to a GC-rich sequence (5′-CCCCAGGC-3′) did not shift the MT1-MMP oligonucleotide (data not shown). We next assessed the gel-shift profiles of nuclear extracts from 2D and 3D endothelial cells. A gel-shift complex that could be supershifted with an Egr-1 antibody was detectable in nuclear extracts of both 2D and 3D cells (Fig. 4 C). However, the Egr-1 gel shift band was much more prominent in the lanes of 3D-stimulated extract. Antibodies to Sp1, Ap2α, or WT (Wilms' tumor product) did not compete off or supershift the gel shifted complexes. Evidence for functional involvement of Egr-1 in enhancing MT1-MMP transcription was obtained using two approaches. First, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the MT1-MMP(−300)-luciferase construct in combination with either cDNA encoding full-length Egr-1 (Egr-1-pcDNA3) or the empty expression vector (pcDNA3). Co-transfection with the Egr-1-pcDNA3 construct resulted in 2.7-fold higher activity of the MT1-MMP promoter than was seen for the MT1-MMP promoter in combination with pcDNA3 alone (Fig.5 A). Secondly, we tested the role of endogenous Egr-1 in enhancing endothelial cell transcription of MT1-MMP in 3D culture. Rat microvascular endothelial cells were transfected with the wild-type MT1-MMP(−300) promoter-luciferase construct or one of four mutated MT1-MMP(−300) promoter constructs, which contained the same series of mutations in the Egr-1/Sp1 binding sites as used in EMSA (Fig.4 A). Luciferase activities of the mutated constructs were compared with the wild-type construct following culture of the endothelial cells in 2D or 3D. As seen in Fig. 2 B, wild-type MT1-MMP promoter constructs exhibited approximately 2.5-fold greater activity in 3D compared with 2D cells. Mutants 1 and 3, which by EMSA lacked the ability to interact with Egr-1, failed to exhibit significantly greater luciferase activity in 3D-stimulated cells. However, mutants 2 and 4, which provided full or partial binding of Egr-1 by EMSA, both exhibited significant increases in luciferase activity in 3D-stimulated cells (Fig. 5 B). The ability to bind Sp1 (mutants 2 and 3) or reduced ability to bind Sp1 (mutants 1 and 4) did not correlate with enhancement of transcription in 3D. Thus, enhanced MT1-MMP transcription upon 3D stimulation appears to be dependent on and entirely attributable to binding of Egr-1. Mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of MT1-MMP are relevant to understanding the cellular events that trigger the invasive phenotype displayed by endothelial cells during angiogenesis. In particular, the role of matrix-initiated signaling in angiogenesis is recognized but not well understood. We present the novel finding that the transcription factor Egr-1 acts to enhance transcription of MT1-MMP in endothelial cells under conditions that involve mechanical stress exerted via the extracellular matrix and that mimic events involved in angiogenesis. Egr-1 is known to be an important activator for multiple endothelial cell genes transcribed during vascular remodeling, including platelet-derived growth factors A and B, tissue factor, and transforming growth factor-β (27Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 28Silverman E.S. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 665-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Those studies demonstrated that increasing levels of Egr-1 displaced the basal transcription factor Sp1 from the promoter, resulting in a significantly greater rate of transcription. The results of our analysis suggest that transcriptional regulation of MT1-MMP in endothelial cells is similar to but not entirely consistent with this paradigm. Although both recombinant Sp1 and Egr-1 interacted with the MT1-MMP promoter in EMSAs, we did not see the expected band corresponding to Sp1 binding to the MT1-MMP promoter in 2D cell extracts. Rather, these assays detected a faint Egr-1/DNA complex in gel shift in the 2D extracts and a prominent Egr-1/DNA complex in the 3D-stimulated extracts. This observation implies that the amount of Egr-1 present rather than the Sp1 to Egr-1 ratio determines transcription rate of MT1-MMP in these cells. Thus, the increased level of Egr-1 in 3D collagen-stimulated cells results in enhanced transcription of MT1-MMP. However, because the contribution of surrounding DNA sequences on transcription factor binding is removed in EMSAs, we do not rule out the possible involvement of Sp1 in binding to the MT1-MMP promoter and regulating basal transcription rates. The potential also exists for modulation of Egr-1-induced transcriptional activity via factors binding to sites currently uncharacterized in the surrounding regions, as has been observed with other promoters (28Silverman E.S. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 665-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Egr-1 levels increase in endothelial cells upon wounding or increased shear stress, or during cyclic mechanical stretching of mesangial cells (27Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 29Schwachtgen J.L. Houston P. Campbell C. Sukhatme V. Braddock M. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C482-C490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that tractional forces develop within collagen matrices as cells attach, elongate, and migrate (19Chicurel M.E. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar,31Vernon R.B. Sage E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 873-883PubMed Google Scholar, 32Chiquet M. Matthisson M. Koch M. Tannheimer M. ChiquetEhrimann R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and it is likely that these forces provide the trigger for production of Egr-1 in our model. Consistent with a mechanical stress induction of Egr-1, and subsequent transcription of MT1-MMP, the time course of increase in Egr-1 and MT1-MMP mRNA upon 3D stimulation (hours rather than minutes) correlates more closely with the processes of cell elongation and matrix contraction rather than with the initial adhesion event. 2T. L. Haas, D. Stitelman, S. J. Davis, S. S. Apte, and J. A. Madri, unpublished observations. Notably, both shear stress and mechanical stretch are hypothesized to trigger angiogenesis in skeletal and coronary muscle in vivo (33Hudlicka O. Microcirculation. 1998; 5: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and increased Egr-1 levels are detectable in skeletal muscle under angiogenesis-promoting conditions (34Michel J.B. Ordway G.A. Richardson J.A. Williams R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The corresponding promoter region of the human MT1-MMP is not yet published, and thus the extent of species-specific differences in transcriptional regulation remains to be determined. It is known that phorbol ester treatment enhances MT1-MMP synthesis 2–3-fold in endothelial cells of human origin but not in rodent cells (12Haas T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 14Chan V.T. Zhang D.N. Nagaravapu U. Hultquist K. Romero L.I. Herron G.S. J. Invest.

Invest. 1996; 74: 538-545PubMed Google Scholar), implying the existence of some unique transcriptional control elements. Because of the apparent co-regulated production of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 in many cell types, including endothelial cells in 3D culture, the use of common regulatory mechanisms to drive transcription of both genes has been hypothesized. However, we have not found evidence for consensus Egr-1 sites in the rat MMP-2 promoter, and neither are there consensus binding sites within the MT1-MMP promoter for the transcription factor YB1, which is an essential factor for MMP-2 transcription in mesangial cells (36Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, although common intracellular signaling pathways may initiate up-regulation of transcription factors required for production of MT1-MMP and MMP-2, it is unlikely that a common transcription factor co-ordinates production of both enzymes. This divergence in signaling could account for the constitutively high levels of MMP-2 and low but inducible levels of MT1-MMP present in many cells versus the constitutively high levels of MT1-MMP and inducible levels of MMP-2 found in other cell types, such as murine T lymphocytes (37Graesser D. Mahooti S. Haas T. Davis S. Clark R.B. Madri J.A. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1445-1458PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, production of MT1-MMP and the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-2 is both spatially and temporally co-ordinated during mouse embryogenesis (20Apte S.S. Fukai N. Beier D.R. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25511-25517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but a review of the human tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-2 promoter (38De Clerck Y.A. Darville M.I. Eeckhout Y. Rousseau G.G. Gene. 1994; 139: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) failed to identify consensus Egr-1 binding sites. By demonstrating MT1-MMP transcriptional regulation via Egr-1, we add support to the preexisting evidence that Egr-1 is a key transcription factor involved in the initiation of a migratory and invasive phenotype in endothelium. We predict that Egr-1-mediated enhancement of MT1-MMP transcription is not endothelial cell-specific but that similar control occurs in other cell types that induce MT1-MMP mRNA in response to a change in extracellular matrix environment (15Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gilles C. Polette M. Seiki M. Birembaut P. Thompson E.W. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tomasek J.J.

Will this include regulation of MT1-MMP production in metastatic tumor cells? Studies to date on the role of Egr-1 in tumor cell phenotype are contradictory. One study has linked increased Egr-1 levels to increased malignancy of prostate tumors (39Eid M. Kumar M.V. Iczkowski K.A. Bostwick D.G. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2461-2468PubMed Google Scholar). However, the majority of studies define Egr-1 as having a tumor suppressor effect, likely by means of its antiproliferative and differentiating effects mediated through induction of transforming growth factor-β (40Liu C. Calogero A. Ragona G. Adamson E. Mercola D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 101-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given our evidence for Egr-1 induction of MT1-MMP in endothelial cells, it will be worthwhile to examine the possibility that Egr-1 is involved in maintaining the abnormally high levels of MT1-MMP so frequently observed in invasive tumor cells. We appreciate Adeline Tucker's technical assistance with cell culture."

Using single cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we show that α- and β-CaM kinase II mRNAs are simultaneously present in the majority of hippocampal neurons examined and that co-assembly of their protein products into heteromers is therefore possible. The subunit composition of CaM kinase II holoenzymes was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies. Rat forebrain CaM kinase II consists of heteromers composed of α and β subunits at a ratio of 2:1 and homomers composed of only α subunits. We examined the functional effect of the heteromeric assembly by analyzing the calmodulin dependence of autophosphorylation. Recombinant homomers of α- or β-CaM kinase II, as well as of alternatively spliced β isoforms, have distinct calmodulin dependences for autophosphorylation based on differences in their calmodulin affinities. Half-maximal autophosphorylation of α is achieved at 130 nmcalmodulin, while that for β occurs at 15 nm calmodulin. In CaM kinase II isolated from rat forebrain, however, the calmodulin dependence for autophosphorylation of the β subunits is shifted toward that of α homomers. This suggests that Thr287 in β subunits is phosphorylated by α subunits present in the same holoenzyme. Once autophosphorylated, β-CaM kinase II traps calmodulin by reducing the rate of calmodulin dissociation.

Once autophosphorylated, β-CaM kinase II traps calmodulin by reducing the rate of calmodulin dissociation. Multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) is a major mediator of Ca2+ action whose activation and autophosphorylation appear to regulate numerous neuronal processes, including two forms of synaptic plasticity, long term potentiation and long term depression (1Bear M.F. Malenka R.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 2Mayford M. Wang J. Kandel E.R. O'Dell T.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 891-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). These two opposing changes in synaptic strength are differentially regulated by the frequency of stimulation of hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, CaM kinase II has been suggested to be a molecular detector of the Ca2+ spike frequency, based on its unique structural and regulatory properties (3De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs.4Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev.

The neuronal CaM kinase II consists of two major subunits of 52 and 60 kDa that are encoded by α- and β-CaM kinase II genes, respectively. Additional isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of these as well as of the ubiquitous γ- and δ-CaM kinase II genes (6Bennett M.K. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1794-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 7Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Nghiem P. Saati S.M.

All of the subunits share a common organization of functional domains and of an ultrastructural arrangement into holoenzymes (4Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The C-terminal association domains of 6–12 subunits assemble into a central globular structure from which the N-terminal catalytic/regulatory domains extend radially like petals of a flower (11Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This unusual structure positions the catalytic/regulatory domains for an intersubunit autophosphorylation that is dependent on the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations (3De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 12Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Upon activation by Ca2+/calmodulin, Thr286 in the regulatory domain of α subunits (or Thr287 in β subunits) is rapidly phosphorylated. Autophosphorylation of Thr286 on α subunits has three consequences: (a) calmodulin remains bound to the phosphorylated subunit for extended periods of time even at low Ca2+concentrations (trapped state), because the autophosphorylation greatly reduces the calmodulin disassociation rate (13Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar); (b) autophosphorylated α and β subunits are rendered Ca2+/calmodulin-independent (autonomous) (reviewed in Ref.4Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar); and (c) the kinase attains an enhanced affinity for NMDA receptors in postsynaptic densities, a submembranous neuronal specialization (14Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 15Leonard S.A. Lim I.A. Hemsworth D.E. Horne M.C. Hell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Both autonomy and calmodulin trapping enable the phosphorylated kinase subunits to remain active beyond the limited duration of a Ca2+ spike. The multimeric structure of CaM kinase II is important for the regulation of the kinase by autophosphorylation, since the phosphorylation of Thr286/287 occurs by an intersubunit reaction within each holoenzyme (12Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 17Kuret J. Schulman H. J. Biol.

Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of one activated subunit in the holoenzyme phosphorylates Thr286/287 in the regulatory domain of a neighboring subunit that must also have calmodulin bound. Therefore, assembly into holoenzymes concentrates the subunits and positions them for autophosphorylation. The multimeric structure of CaM kinase II, the intersubunit phosphorylation of Thr286/287, and the resulting calmodulin trapping and autonomous activity are crucial elements that enable the kinase to act as a Ca2+ spike frequency detector (3De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 5Schulman H. Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,13Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Under conditions of limited free calmodulin, each Ca2+spike activates only a subset of CaM kinase II subunits in a holoenzyme, some of which become autophosphorylated and trap their bound calmodulin. If the interval between spikes is brief, subsequent Ca2+ spike will lead to binding of calmodulin to holoenzymes that still retain calmodulin from a previous spike, increasing the calmodulin occupancy and probability of neighboring subunits with calmodulin bound and therefore the probability of autophosphorylation. A threshold frequency is reached, beyond which autophosphorylation and calmodulin trapping become increasingly more efficient and the number of activated subunits increases. Although autophosphorylation is not necessary for activation of the kinasein vitro, it may be necessary for appropriate activation in response to brief repetitive stimulation in vivo. The essential nature of this autophosphorylation was nicely demonstrated with the finding that mice defective in autophosphorylation of Thr286 in α-CaM kinase II because of a point mutation that substituted an Ala286 for Thr286 do not exhibit long term potentiation, are defective in spatial learning, and have unstable hippocampal place cells (20Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar,21Cho Y.H. Giese K.P. Tanila H. Silva A.J. Eichenbaum H. Science. 1998; 279: 867-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, the subunit composition of CaM kinase II holoenzymes becomes very significant. Since intersubunit phosphorylation of Thr286/287 involves two calmodulin-bound subunits, the kinetic properties of the neighboring subunits in the holoenzyme serving as kinase and as substrate in each reaction are important variables. The frequency dependence for activation of homomers of α or β isoforms, for example, is markedly different (3De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). In an electron microscopic study, forebrain CaM kinase II holoenzymes were found to exist as homomeric α decamers and homomeric β octamers with no evidence of heteromers (11Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, other studies reported that α-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; RU, resonance units; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid co-immunoprecipitated some β-CaM kinase II together with α-CaM kinase II from either rat forebrain (22Bennett M.K. Erondu N.E. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12735-12744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or rat cerebellum (23Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9039-9046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chicken forebrain CaM kinase II purified on an affinity column of α-specific antibody consisted of both α and β isoforms (24Liu N. Cooper N.G.F. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 5: 193-206Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Co-expression of α and β cDNAs produced heteromers both in transfected CHO cells (25Yamauchi T. Ohsako S. Deguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19108-19116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in infected Sf9 cells (18Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-assembly of CaM kinase II subunits will have functional consequences if α and β subunits differ in their calmodulin dependence, their rates of autophosphorylation, and/or their capability to trap calmodulin. Differences in orientation of catalytic/regulatory domains between homomeric and heteromeric assembly of association domains may also alter rates of intersubunit autophosphorylation. For example, half-maximal activation and autophosphorylation of recombinant β-CaM kinase II occurs at a 5- and 4-fold lower calmodulin level, respectively, than recombinant α-CaM kinase II (3De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 25Yamauchi T. Ohsako S. Deguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19108-19116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether α and β isoforms differ in trapping of calmodulin, since this has been demonstrated for recombinant α-CaM kinase II (13Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer L. Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) but has not been assessed for β-CaM kinase II. To study the functional properties of CaM kinase II holoenzymes, we analyzed the subunit composition of CaM kinase II holoenzymes from different preparations by immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific mAbs. Our results indicate that CaM kinase II can be composed of α:β heteromers with variable subunit ratios in addition to homomers of either α or β subunits. We therefore compared the autophosphorylation of homomers and heteromers composed of α, β, and alternatively spliced β subunits. Indeed, the calmodulin dependence is modified based on the subunit composition. Finally, plasmon surface resonance studies showed that autophosphorylated β subunits trap calmodulin and would contribute to prolonging the active state of the enzyme. [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN (Aurora, OH). Bovine brain calmodulin was obtained from Ocean Biologic (Edmonds, WA). CaM kinase II substrate peptide autocamtide-3 was synthesized and purified by David King (University of California, Berkeley). Forebrain CaM kinase II was extracted and purified essentially as described (26Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recombinant CaM kinase II proteins were prepared by transient transfections of COS-7 cells with pSRα.BKS containing full-length cDNA for CaM kinase II isoforms (7Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H.

Protein extracts of transfected COS-7 cells were prepared, and the recombinant CaM kinase II was purified as described (29Hanson P.I. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17216-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) from gizzard smooth muscle was purified as described (30Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In visualized rat hippocampal slice preparations, the single cell cytoplasms of CA1 pyramidal neurons, identified by morphology and electrophysiological recording, were aspirated though the recording pipette and subjected to RT-PCR analysis as described previously (31Chiang L.W. Schweizer F.E. Tsien R.W. Schulman H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For each CaM kinase II isoform, two sets of nested PCR primers were designed. These primers span the variable domain and can be used to distinguish between alternatively spliced isoforms based upon the size of the PCR products. The outer and inner set of primers are as follows: α, base pairs 898–923 to 1342–1368 and 907–930 to 1146–1170 (32Lin C.R. Kapiloff M.S. Durgerian S. Tatemoto K. Russo A.F. Hanson P. Schulman H.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17907-17912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first round of amplification included all four outer primer pairs, for α, β, γ, and δ isoforms. The entire cDNA produced from a single cytosol was subjected to 30 cycles of capillary PCR (Idaho Technologies, Idaho Falls, ID). The product amplified in the first round was diluted 100-fold into a second round of amplification involving separate capillary PCR reactions for each of the four isoforms using the inner primer pair. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. CBα2 and CBβ1 are subunit-specific mAbs for α- and β-CaM kinase II, respectively (35Baitinger C. Alderton J. Poenie M. Schulman H. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1763-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All immunoprecipitations were carried out in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Approximately 100 ng of purified CaM kinase II was incubated with the mAbs indicated in the text in a final volume of 0.5 ml for 1 h at 4 °C. Both CBα2 and CBβ1 mAbs were diluted 1:2000. Subsequently, 40 μl of protein A beads (Repligen, Cambridge, MA) were added, and the incubation was continued for another 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. A second, similar round of immunoprecipitation was initiated by the addition of mAb to the supernatant of the first round, followed by protein A beads as described above. The beads were washed three times with cold PBS containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40. After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in SDS-containing sample buffer and heated at 85 °C for 4 min, and the supernatants were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Shuell), and CaM kinase II isoforms were visualized by calmodulin overlay assay using biotinylated calmodulin and enhanced chemiluminescence (8Nghiem P. Saati S.M. Martens C.L. Gardner P. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5471-5479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The film was scanned and analyzed for the relative intensities of the bands using MacBas software (FUJIX, Stamford, CT). Purified CaM kinase II aliquots were thawed just before use and diluted in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. Autophosphorylation reactions were started with the addition of 5 μl of diluted kinase to a final concentration of 5–10 nm calmodulin binding sites into prewarmed reaction tubes. In addition to the kinase, each reaction tube (25 μl) also contained 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2 Ci/mmol), and variable amounts of calmodulin (0–400 nm). After incubation for 15 s at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 12.5 μl of SDS-containing sample buffer. The samples were heated at 85 °C for 4 min and loaded in their entirety onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (1.5 mm, Novex, San Diego, CA). After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated for 30 min in Coomassie stain and destained overnight for removal of unincorporated radiolabeled ATP by diffusion. The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor-imaging plate at room temperature for 24 h. Gray scale images of the autophosphorylated kinase were obtained using the BAS2000 system (FUJIX), and band intensities were analyzed using MacBas software (FUJIX). The extent of CaM kinase II autophosphorylation at each calmodulin concentration was calculated as a percentage of the maximum intensity value obtained for each isoform at 200–400 nmcalmodulin. It is important to note that the level of autophosphorylation of a given CaM kinase II isoform at intermediate calmodulin concentration was dependent on the reaction time. CaM kinase II activity assays were performed in identical conditions as the autophosphorylation assays, except 20 μm autocamtide-3 was added. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 s, the reactions were stopped with the addition of ice cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. The reactions were processed as described (7Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and counted. The calmodulin dependence of each isoform according to the autophosphorylation and activity assays was calculated and plotted as described (9Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 90-102Google Scholar). The interaction between immobilized calmodulin and several CaM kinase II isoforms was measured using a BIAcore instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Calmodulin was covalently coupled to a CM5 sensor chip (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the amide reaction kit according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the immobilization procedure was carried out at 25 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EGTA, 0.05% surfactant P20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following activation withN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, a solution containing 25 μg/ml calmodulin in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.7, was injected into the flow cell, followed by ethanolamine wash. At the end of the immobilization procedure, the temperature was set at 10 °C, since CaM kinase II is a temperature-sensitive enzyme. All of the binding experiments were performed in flow cells containing 90–150 resonance units (RU) of immobilized calmodulin (equivalent to about 0.09–0.15 ng of protein/mm2). Kinase binding experiments were performed in buffer A (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mmCaCl2, 0.05% surfactant P20) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The co-inject feature of the machine was set to inject 50 μl of purified recombinant CaM kinase II (100–400 ng) diluted in buffer A, followed by 15 μl of 500 nm free calmodulin in buffer A. The free calmodulin in this first dissociation phase should decrease the rebinding of dissociating CaM kinase II to the chip (36Edlund M. Blikstad I. Obrink B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1393-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In some experiments, we included 200 μm ATP during the first dissociation phase to create autophosphorylation conditions. Next, we started the second dissociation phase by the injection of a low Ca2+ buffer, containing 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.05% surfactant P-20 and calculated amounts of CaCl2 to yield free Ca2+ concentrations of 50, 100, 200, or 300 nm. The remaining bound kinase was later washed away by a regeneration solution containing 2 mmEGTA, 1 m NaCl. The RU readings usually returned to a level of 20–40 RU above base line. Each flow cell was used for total of 3–5 cycles of CaM kinase II binding. Although α and β subunits have been reported to reside on separate homomers in rat brain (11Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), in vitroco-transfections of α and β cDNAs into mammalian cells resulted in heteromeric CaM kinase II (18Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yamauchi T. Ohsako S. Deguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19108-19116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these conflicting data, we examined the expression pattern of CaM kinase II isoforms in individual hippocampal neurons by single cell RT-PCR to determine whether CaM kinase II mRNAs are co-expressed in vivo. PCR primers that span the variable domain of each of the four CaM kinase II subunits were used in order to identify alternatively spliced CaM kinase II isoforms with different insertions and deletions in their variable domain. As shown in Fig. 1, multiple CaM kinase II isoforms were detected in rat brain RNA: two α isoforms (αB and α) (7Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), four β isoforms (β, β′, βe, β′e) (7Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); see Fig. 5 a), six γ isoforms (8Nghiem P. Saati S.M. Martens C.L. Gardner P. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5471-5479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tombes R.M. Krystal G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and three δ isoforms (δA, δB, δC) (9Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 90-102Google Scholar). We next studied the expression of CaM kinase II isoforms in single neurons. The expression pattern of CaM kinase II mRNAs in all the single neurons tested is summarized in Table I. In all of the individual neurons tested, mRNAs were detected for either α- or β-CaM kinase II but not for γ- or δ-CaM kinase II (Fig. 1 and Table I). Neuron PP18 and PP1 in Fig. 1 represent expression patterns A and F, respectively. In some single neurons, only α-CaM kinase mRNA was detected (neuron PP1), while in others we detected both α- and β-CaM kinase mRNAs (neuron PP18). More than 90% of the neurons expressed a detectable amount of α mRNA. The alternatively spliced isoform, αB, that contains a 33-base pair insertion and therefore appears as a slightly larger band than α-CaM kinase II (7Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was detected in only one of the neurons. We detected alternatively spliced β isoforms in 58% of the neurons (14/24); nine cells expressed the β- isoform, three expressed βe, and two expressed β′ (Table I). Thus, while some of the neurons contain little or no β and are likely to express predominantly α-CaM kinase II homomers, many cells express both α- and β-CaM kinase II and have the potential for forming α:β heteromers.Figure 5Calmodulin dependence of autophosphorylation in alternatively spliced CaM kinase II isoforms. a, schematic representation of alternatively spliced β-CaM kinase II isoforms. The regulatory domain shared by all β isoforms is composed of exons XI and X. The variable domain is composed of four small exons, IX–VI (54Karls U. Muller U. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Harbers K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3644-3652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-CaM kinase II contains all four exons, while β′, βe, and β′e each lack the indicated exon(s) (dashed lines). b, purified, recombinant preparations of α (●), β (▪), β′ (■) (n = 3,), βe (⋄, n = 3) and β′e (▵, n = 3) were autophosphorylated at increasing concentrations of calmodulin, and phosphate incorporation was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IEight expression pattern groups of α- and β-CaM kinase II isoforms in single neuronsGene expression pattern (PCR signal)No. of single neurons with each patternααBββ′βeβ′eA+−+−−−7B+−−−+−2C+−+−+−1D+++−−−1E+−−+−−1F+−−−−−10G−−−+−−1H−−−−+−1Total22/241/249/242/244/240/2424The expression of the six neuronal CaM kinase II isoforms can be grouped into eight expression pattern groups, designated A to H, with the number of neurons in each group indicated on the right. Open table in a new tab The expression of the six neuronal CaM kinase II isoforms can be grouped into eight expression pattern groups, designated A to H, with the number of neurons in each group indicated on the right. We analyzed the subunit composition of forebrain CaM kinase II preparation using subunit-specific mAbs in order to assess whether α and β subunits assemble as homomers or heteromers. The specificity of the mAbs under our immunoprecipitation conditions was first verified with purified, recombinant α and β homomers. α-mAb (CBα2) immunoprecipitated α protein but not β protein, whereas β-mAb (CBβ1) immunoprecipitated only β protein (Fig.2 a). Furthermore, mixing the two recombinant homomeric isoforms before the addition of the mAbs did not lead to subunit exchange or nonspecific immunoprecipitation, since each antibody precipitated only its cognate subunit (Fig.2 b, lanes 1 and 3). This control experiment demonstrates that successive use of the antibodies can clearly separate the two subunits when each isoform resides on a distinct homomeric holoenzyme. Purified rat forebrain CaM kinase II preparation was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the subunit-specific mAbs. The α-mAb immunoprecipitated both α and β, with a subunit ratio of 3:1 (Fig.3 a, lanes 1 and 3), consistent with previous estimations (22Bennett M.K."
https://openalex.org/W1992807239,"Glial cells have been reported to express molecules originally discovered in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells, such as neuropeptides, neuropeptide processing enzymes, and ionic channels. To verify whether astrocytes may have regulated secretory vesicles, the primary cultures prepared from hippocampi of embryonic and neonatal rats were used to investigate the subcellular localization and secretory pathway followed by secretogranin II, a well known marker for dense-core granules. By indirect immunofluorescence, SgII was detected in a large number of cultured hippocampal astrocytes. Immunoreactivity for the granin was detected in the Golgi complex and in a population of dense-core vesicles stored in the cells. Subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that SgII was stored in a vesicle population with a density identical to that of the dense-core secretory granules present in rat pheochromocytoma cells. In line with these data, biochemical results indicated that 40–50% of secretogranin II synthesized during 18-h labeling was retained intracellularly over a 4-h chase period and released after treatment with different secretagogues. The most effective stimulus appeared to be phorbol ester in combination with ionomycin in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, a treatment that was found to produce a large and sustained increase in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i transients. Our findings indicate that a regulated secretory pathway characterized by (i) the expression and stimulated exocytosis of a typical marker for regulated secretory granules, (ii) the presence of dense-core vesicles, and (iii) the ability to undergo [Ca2+]i increase upon specific stimuli is present in cultured hippocampal astrocytes.

Increasing evidence indicates that these cells can interact with the surrounding neurons and exhibit the equipment to receive, integrate, and transmit signals. It has been reported that astrocytes express a number of membrane ionic channels, transporters, and receptors linked to the most important signal transduction pathways and are capable of intracellular propagation of slow calcium waves (1Cornell-Bell A.H.

In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies have revealed the presence of proenkephalin in cultured as well as in rat brain astrocytes (7Shinoda H. Marini A.M. Cosi C. Schwartz J.P.

Other regulatory (poly)peptides (somatostatin, cholecystokinin) and neuropeptide processing enzymes (carboxypeptidase E and peptidylglycine-α-amidating mono-oxygenase), which are known to be co-stored in secretory granules (11.Mains, R.

In addition, it has been shown that cultured astrocytes and Bergmann glial cells express secretogranin II (SgII) and chromogranin A (CgA), respectively (15Ficher-Colbrie R. Kirchmair R. Schobert A. Olenik C. Meyer D.K. Winkler H. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2312-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,16McAuliffe W.G. Hess A. GLIA. 1990; 3: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), two well characterized members of the granin family (for reviews, see Refs. 17Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 18Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 19Rosa P. Gerdes H.H. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1994; 17: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Besides the discovery of their presence, little information is available, however, on the subcellular localization and the role of SgII and CgA in glial cells. Like the well established neuropeptides and hormones, granins are known to be stored in the dense-core secretory granules of many neuroendocrine cells (18Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 19Rosa P. Gerdes H.H. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1994; 17: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the distribution of the individual members of the granin family is more widespread than that known for any other neuropeptide or polypeptide hormone. Furthermore, the granins were detected in dense-core vesicles of endocrinologically silent neuroendocrine tumors such as the nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (20Rosa P. Bassetti M. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that they may be sufficient for the formation of the dense-matrix of secretory granules. Given their widespread distribution, the granins have been used as the most useful markers to investigate the presence of dense-core granules (also referred to as large dense-core vesicles) in neurons of different areas of the mammalian CNS (18Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 19Rosa P. Gerdes H.H. J. Endocrinol.

Consistent with their subcellular localization, the granins are widely investigated in vivo and in vitro with the aim of studying the mechanisms of secretory granule biogenesis (22Rosa P. Weiss U. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Niehrs C. Stelzer E.H. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B.

This process can be divided into two major steps: (i) the selective sorting of regulated secretory proteins from other proteins destined for different pathways and (ii) the budding from the trans-Golgi network of the dense-core vesicles (12Halban P.A. Irminger J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 25Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev.

These vesicles are then stored intracellularly until a specific signal evokes their exocytosis. The regulated release of neurotransmitters and regulatory polypeptides from neuronal and neuroendocrine cells has been shown to depend on molecular interactions between integral membrane proteins of the neurosecretory vesicles (v-SNARE) and the plasma membrane (t-SNARE) (for reviews see Refs. 27Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 893-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 28Goda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been found that some of these proteins are also expressed in glial cells (30Parpura V. Fang Y. Basarsky T. Jahn R. Haydon P.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Jeftinija S.D. Jeftinija K.V. Stefanovic G. Brain Res. 1997; 750: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These findings, in addition to recent data demonstrating that bradykinin and prostaglandins stimulate a Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate from astrocytes (32Parpura V. Basarsky T.A. Liu F. Jeftinija K. Jeftinija S. Haydon P.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 33Bezzi P. Carmignoto G. Pasti L. Vesce S. Rossi D. Rizzini B.L. Pozzan T. Volterra A. Nature. 1998; 391: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar), suggest the presence of a regulated secretory mechanism in at least certain types of glial cells. However, the presence of classical synaptic-like vesicles or dense-core granules in glial cells has never been reported. To study whether astrocytes contain regulated secretory vesicles, we endeavored to determine the intracellular localization and the secretory pathway taken by SgII in cultured hippocampal astrocytes. In this study, dense-core vesicles containing SgII were identified for the first time in astrocytes. Moreover, our results demonstrated that SgII release could be stimulated by different secretagogues including bradykinin, cyclic AMP, ionomycin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In Ca2+-containing media the ionophore in combination with PMA appeared to be the most effective stimulus for SgII release. Furthermore, treatments with ionomycin or ionomycin plus PMA were found to produce large [Ca2+]i increases in hippocampal astrocytes. The antibodies against rat SgII and chromogranin B (CgB) were raised in rabbits, purified by affinity chromatography, and characterized as described previously (34Rosa P. Hille A. Lee R.W. Zanini A. De Camilli P. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). New antisera against the granins were prepared starting from rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12). Briefly, the heat-stable protein fraction of PC12 cells, enriched in SgII and CgB, was subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography and preparative two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were stained with Ponceau S (Serva Finebiochemica, Heidelberg, Germany), and the pieces containing SgII and CgB were excised, crushed to a fine powder using a glass potter in liquid N2, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The filter homogenates were emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant for the first injection and incomplete Freund's adjuvant for the booster injections. For each injection, 100 or 50 μg of purified protein were used. The anti-SgII and -CgB antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (22Rosa P. Weiss U. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Niehrs C. Stelzer E.H. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibodies was tested by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. The monoclonal antibodies against tubulin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), microtubule-associated protein-2, anti-synaptophysin, and anti-syntaxin 1A (HPC-1) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The antisera against galanin, Met-enkephalin, substance P, and cholecystokinin 26–33 were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories Inc. (Belmont, CA). The antibodies against nestin, mannosidase II, and the α-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase were kind gifts of Dr. W. B. Huttner (University of Heidelberg, Germany) and Dr. M. G. Farquhar (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and G. Pietrini (University of Milan), respectively. Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, Texas Red, 10- or 5-nm gold particles, peroxidase, and protein A conjugated to 5-nm gold particles were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The PC12 cells were grown as described previously (35Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 (E18) or post-natal (day 2) rat hippocampi, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum as described by McCarthy and De Vellis (36McCarthy K.D. De Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar) and Banker and Goslin (37Banker G.A. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991Google Scholar). After dissection, tissues were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 0.25% trypsin and then gently dissociated by trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The cells were plated onto glass coverslips (Zeus Super, Italy) or Petri dishes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Meylan Cedex, France) at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. The cultures were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and glucose at a final concentration of 5.5 g/liter. To compare the relative density of SgII-containing vesicles from astrocytes and PC12 cells, homogenates prepared from both types of cells were separated on sucrose equilibrium gradients as described (38Navone F. Di Gioia G. Jahn R. Browning P. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3425-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. PC12 cells and astrocytes, grown on Petri dishes until near confluence, were scraped from the dishes, washed, and resuspended 1:4 in homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were homogenized using a cell cracker (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to prepare the post-nuclear supernatants (PNS). The PNS was loaded onto a 0.4–1.8m sucrose gradient and spun in a 41 SW rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 25,000 rpm for 18 h. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as described (22Rosa P. Weiss U. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Niehrs C. Stelzer E.H. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Passafaro M. Rosa P. Sala C. Clementi F. Sher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30096-30104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, after electrophoresis proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. After incubation in blocking buffer (5% milk, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), the filters were then labeled with primary antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.3% Tween 20. After extensive washing, the immunodecoration pattern was revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal from Pierce) following the manufacture' s protocol. To clarify SgII metabolism in astrocytes, different procedures for protein radiolabeling were performed. For pulse-chase experiments, 18-day-cultured astrocytes were preincubated for 4 h in cysteine/methionine-free DMEM. Cells were then labeled with 300 μCi/ml Pro-mix (SJQ, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 min in the same medium. After pulse, cells from one dish were washed at 0 °C with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (solubilization buffer). Labeled cells in parallel dishes were chased in DMEM supplemented with 2 times concentrated methionine and cysteine for 2 consecutive periods of 60 and 180 min. The media were then collected and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The remaining cells were solubilized as described before. SgII was immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the clear cell lysates (150 μg of proteins) and from corresponding aliquots of the medium samples, as described above. For long-labeling and stimulation experiments, astrocytes were preincubated in sulfate-free DMEM for 2 h and then incubated overnight in medium containing 500 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate (SJS1, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After labeling, the cells were rinsed in chase medium (standard DMEM supplemented with 1.6 mm Na2SO4 and 1% fetal bovine serum) and then incubated for 4 h in the same medium. To analyze regulated secretion, the cells were subsequently incubated in DMEM supplemented with 50 mm KCl, 1 μm bradykinin, 100 nm PMA, 5 mmdibutyryl-cAMP, 1 μm ionomycin, or 1 μmionomycin plus 100 nm PMA (Sigma) or in standard DMEM. The various media were collected and centrifuged as described above. The cells were washed and solubilized in ice-cold solubilization buffer containing 0.3% Tween 20 instead of Triton X-100. For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were spun for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. The cell lysates (10 μg) and aliquots of their respective media were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography as described previously (35Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SgII was immunoprecipitated from the clear cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins (70 μg) and equivalent aliquots of the corresponding media (see above). Aliquots of the media and clear cell lysates were diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer at a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% (or 1%) Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-rat SgII or anti-rat CgB antiserum. The amounts of antisera were sufficient to bind all of the granins present in the samples (34Rosa P. Hille A. Lee R.W. Zanini A. De Camilli P. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were collected by binding to protein A conjugated to Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Quantitation of labeled SgII in cell lysates or media after immunoprecipitation was carried out using different methods. Fluorograms were quantitated directly by densitometric scanning using an LKB Ultrascan (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or fluorogram images were acquired by means of a ARCUS II scanner (Agfa-Gevaert N.V., Mortsel, Germany), and the density of the bands was quantitated using the Image program (National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA), version 1.55. For each pharmacological treatment, results obtained from three independent experiments were expressed as a percentage of the controls and analyzed using the statistical program StatWorks (Cricket Software Inc., Philadelphia, PA). After long-labeling, the radioactivity incorporated in the SgII bands was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The bands corresponding to [35S]sulfate-labeled SgII were excised from the gels and dissolved by overnight treatment with 35% hydrogen peroxide at 80 °C. After dilution in scintillation liquid (Ultima Gold, Packard Instrument Co.), radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation analyzer. The data are presented as mean ± S.D. For double immunofluorescence, the cells were incubated in 120 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 4% formaldehyde and 4% sucrose. After fixation, cells were immunostained using primary antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies, as described previously (22Rosa P. Weiss U. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Niehrs C. Stelzer E.H. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) before fixation. Specificity of SgII immunostaining was demonstrated by antisera preadsorption with the purified antigen. Briefly, 3 μg of affinity-purified anti-SgII-antibody were preadsorbed with 15 μg of SgII purified by two-dimensional PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The filter pieces containing the desired amount of SgII were preincubated in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% gelatin (immunofluorescence buffer) for 3 h at room temperature and then incubated with affinity-purified anti-SgII antibodies for 18 h at 4 °C. Electron or immunoelectron microscopy was performed as described previously (20Rosa P. Bassetti M. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After fixation, the astrocytes were scraped from the dishes and pelleted in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The pellets were either dehydrated and infiltrated in Epon 812 for preparation of plastic sections or infiltrated in 2.1 m sucrose for the preparation of cryosections. The ultra-thin frozen sections were immunolabeled using anti-rat SgII antibodies revealed with protein A conjugated to 5-nm gold particles. Double labeling with anti-SgII and anti-GFAP was revealed using anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10-nm gold particles and anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to 5-nm gold particles. Astrocytes were loaded for 1 h at 37 °C with 3–4 μm Fura-2 pentacetoxymethyl ester in Krebs-Ringer solution buffered with Hepes (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4), washed in the same solution to allow deesterification of the dye, and transferred to the recording chamber of an inverted microscope (100 TV; Zeiss) equipped with a calcium imaging unit. For the assays, a modified CAM-230 dual wavelength microfluorometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) was used as a light source. Fluorescence images were collected with an intensified CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics), digitized, and integrated in real time in an image processor developed in the laboratory (40Grohovaz F. Zacchetti D. Clementi E. Lorenzon P. Meldolesi J. Fumagalli G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Image files were processed off-line to convert fluorescence data into [Ca2+]i maps according to the 340/380-nm excitation wavelength ratio method (41Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mean ratio values in discrete areas of interest were calculated from sequences of images to obtain quantitative temporal analyses. To investigate the possible presence of regulated secretory vesicles in astrocytes, we decided to investigate the intracellular distribution of SgII, a diffuse marker of dense-core granules (17Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 18Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R.

The cell cultures were prepared from brains isolated from 18-day-old embryos or 2–5-day post-natal rats as described (37Banker G.A. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991Google Scholar). After dissection, the cells were maintained in culture in the presence of fetal bovine serum without supplements to promote survival and proliferation of astrocytes. After 3 weeks, the majority of the cells showed a polygonal shape and expressed high levels of the intermediate filament protein GFAP, which is usually expressed by differentiated astrocytes (42Eng L.F. J. Neuroimmunol. 1985; 8: 203-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4and data not shown). Cells expressing markers of the neuronal phenotype (i.e. neurofilament proteins and microtubule-associated protein-2) were not detected (data not shown). In 3-week old cultures prepared from embryonic hippocampi, only a small amount of the cells (10%, n = 2) were found to synthesize the intermediate filament protein marker of neuronal stem cells, nestin (43Frederiksen K. McKay R.D. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the majority of the astrocytes present in the primary culture prepared were largely differentiated.Figure 3Double-immunofluorescence showing the intracellular storage of SgII in astrocytes. Three-week-old astrocyte cultures were incubated for 4 (A–A′) and 18 (B–B′) h with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. After drug treatment, the cells were fixed and immunolabeled for GFAP (A and B) and SgII (A′ andB′). In the cycloheximide-treated cells, SgII immunoreactivity is only observed in dot-like structures (A′ and B′, arrows), which remain for a long time, whereas the Golgi-like staining is completely abolished.Bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2Expression of SgII in hippocampal astrocytes in 18-h-old culture.

One mutant, Cav-1-(1–101), contains only the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and lacks the membrane spanning domain and the C-terminal domain. Interestingly, Cav-1-(1–101) still behaves as an integral membrane protein but lacks any known signals for lipid modification. In striking contrast, another deletion mutant, Cav-1-(1–81), behaved as a soluble protein. These results implicate caveolin-1 residues 82–101 (also known as the caveolin scaffolding domain) in membrane attachment. In accordance with the postulated role of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain as an inhibitor of signal transduction, Cav-1-(1–101) retained the ability to functionally inhibit signaling along the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, whereas Cav-1-(1–81) was completely ineffective. To rule out the possibility that membrane attachment mediated by the caveolin scaffolding domain was indirect, we reconstituted the membrane binding of caveolin-1 in vitro. By using purified glutathioneS-transferase-caveolin-1 fusion proteins and reconstituted lipid vesicles, we show that the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain and the C-terminal domain (residues 135–178) are both sufficient for membrane attachment in vitro. However, the putative membrane spanning domain (residues 102–134) did not show any physical association with membranes in this in vitro system. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that the caveolin scaffolding domain contributes to the membrane attachment of caveolin-1.

The plasma membrane of many cell types is stippled with 50–100 nm diameter vesicular invaginations termed caveolae. These “little caves” have many functions, including vesicular transport (1Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 341-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lisanti M.P. Scherer P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M.

Caveolins are postulated to assume an unusual membrane topology, with intracellular N-terminal (residues 1–101 in Cav-1) and C-terminal (residues 135–178 in Cav-1) domains separated by a single putative membrane spanning domain (residues 102–134 in Cav-1). Caveolins homo-oligomerize, bind cholesterol, and resist solubilization by the detergent Triton X-100 at low temperatures (9Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 10Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). The protein domains responsible for some of the biological properties of caveolins have recently been defined. For example, homo-oligomerization is mediated by a 41-amino acid domain that is located at the membrane-proximal region of the N-terminal domain (residues 61–101 in Cav-1) (10Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar); deletion of this oligomerization domain (and all sequences N-terminal to it) prevents multimerizationin vivo (13Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fusion of the oligomerization domain of Cav-1 to GST results in GST multimerization in vitro (10Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Thus, the oligomerization domain is necessary and sufficient for caveolin self-association. The C-terminal half of the oligomerization domain (i.e.residues 82–101 in Cav-1) binds to and regulates the activity of signaling molecules, including receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream targets (e.g. EGFR, c-Neu, Ha-Ras, MEK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) (14Couet J.

Glenney (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), Perry Bickel (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis), and Peter Davies (Departments of Neuroscience and Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), respectively. Standard polymerase chain reaction strategies were used in constructing the various deletions shown in Fig. 1 A. The canine caveolin-1 cDNA (29Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) was used as the template for these reactions. Various caveolin-1 deletion mutants were subcloned into the pCB7 vector using theHindIII/BamHI sites within the polylinker (13Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The correctness of the intended mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Except where indicated, all experiments were performed using HEK 293T cells. These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. All experiments involving HEK 293T cells were performed 36 h post-transfection. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The protein bands were visualized with Ponceau S (Sigma). Membranes were then incubated with primary antibody, washed, and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Laboratories). Bound IgG were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Post-nuclear lysates were separated into soluble and insoluble components, as described previously (30Galbiati F. Guzzi F. Magee A.I. Milligan G. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluence in a 60-mm diameter dish were scraped into cold PBS, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors. Following a 30-min incubation on ice, the lysate was passed through a 21-gauge needle 10 times and centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclear debris. The post-nuclear lysate was transferred to an 11 × 34-mm polycarbonate tube and centrifuged at 56,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA-100.2 rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of 1% SDS. Equal volumes of both fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis, as described above. In the salt extraction experiments, the lysate was treated with NaCl (to the indicated final concentration) after removal of nuclear debris and then subjected to centrifugation as described above. Carbonate extraction was performed as we described previously (27Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in a 60-mm diameter dish and were washed twice in cold PBS and once in 150 mm NaCl. After aspiration of the NaCl solution, 1 ml of 100 mm NaCO3, pH 11.3, containing protease inhibitors was used to scrape the cells off the dish. The sample was transferred to a loose fitting 1-ml Dounce homogenizer and homogenized with 5 strokes. Following a 30-min incubation on ice, the sample was transferred to an 11 × 34 mm polycarbonate tube and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a TLA-100.2 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of 1% SDS. Both fractions were passed through a 26-gauge needle 10 times, and 50 μl of each were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis, as described above. Extraction of Triton-soluble proteins was performed as we described previously (29Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluence in a 35-mm diameter dish and washed twice with cold PBS. Three hundred microliters of cold MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl), 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors was then added. Following a 30-min incubation on ice without agitation, the soluble fraction was collected. An equal volume of 1% SDS was added to the plate to dissolve the Triton X-100-insoluble material. The latter fraction was passed through a 26-gauge needle 10 times in order to lower its viscosity. Fifty microliters of the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. Caveolae-enriched membrane fractions were purified essentially as described previously (13Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 29Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z.-L. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluence in a 150-mm diameter plate were washed twice in cold PBS, scraped into 2 ml of MBS containing 1% Triton X-100, passed 5 times through a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer, and mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose (prepared in MBS lacking Triton X-100). The sample was then transferred to a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient (4 ml of 30% sucrose, 4 ml of 5% sucrose, both prepared in MBS, lacking detergent). The samples were subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g (39,000 rpm in Sorval rotor TH-641) for 16 h. A light scattering band was observed at the 5/30% sucrose interface. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, and 50-μl aliquots of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Cells were grown on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100, stained with anti-caveolin-1 IgG (N-20), and visualized with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (26Scherer P.E.

The Stratagene PathDetect system was employed essentially as we described previously (15Engelman J.A. Lee R.J. Karnezis A. Bearss D.J. Webster M. Siegel P. Muller W.J. Windle J.J. Pestell R.G.

Briefly, ∼2 × 105 Chinese hamster ovary (GRC+ LR-73) cells (31Pollard J.W. Stanners C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were seeded in 35-mm dishes 12 h prior to transfection and cultured in α-minimum essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with 50 ng of pFA-ELK; 1 μg of pFR-luc; 1 μg of plasmid encoding EGFR, RasG12V, Raf-1ca, or 50 ng of plasmid encoding MEK-1ca (S218/222E; Δ32–51); and 1 μg of empty vector (pCB7), or plasmids containing Cav-1 (FL 1–178), Cav-1 (ΔTM), Cav-1-(1–101), Cav-1-(1–81), or β-galactosidase. Twelve hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice in PBS and cultured in α-minimum essential medium, 1% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Lysates were prepared for luciferase assay 24 h thereafter. Each data point represents the mean ± 1 S.D. of three points. GST-Cav-1 fusion proteins were constructed and affinity purified as we described previously (10Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The incorporation of recombinant GST-Cav-1 into membranes was monitored by flotation in sucrose density gradients, essentially as we described previously for bacterially expressed full-length His-tagged caveolin-1 (12Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 568-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, a given purified GST-Cav-1 fusion protein was mixed with purified lipid components in 2 ml of MBS containing 60 mmoctyl glucoside and dialyzed overnight against MBS lacking detergent to allow the association of caveolin with lipids. More specifically, ∼85 μg of a given GST-Cav-1 fusion protein was added to 1.8 mg of the purified lipid extract dissolved in octyl glucoside. The dialysate was then adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in MBS and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (4 ml of 5% sucrose, 4 ml of 30% sucrose; both in MBS lacking detergent) and centrifuged at 200,000 × g (39,000 rpm in Sorval rotor TH-641). A light-scattering band at the 5–30% sucrose interface contained the associated lipids and formed regardless of whether or not caveolin was added. The light-scattering band at the 5–30% sucrose interface was collected by centrifugation and subjected to immunoblot analysis. It has been postulated that caveolin-1 is anchored to the membrane by a central 33-amino acid hydrophobic segment (32Glenney J.R. Soppet D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10517-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 33Glenney J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 34Kurzchalia T. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). To examine its requirement for membrane anchoring, we created a panel of caveolin-1 deletion mutants lacking this protein domain. Briefly, Cav-1 (ΔTM) lacks only the putative membrane spanning domain but contains both the complete N- and C-terminal domains of caveolin-1; Cav-1-(1–101) lacks both the putative membrane spanning domain and the C-terminal domain but retains the complete cytoplasmic N-terminal domain; and Cav-1-(1–81) consists solely of the N-terminal domain but lacks the caveolin scaffolding domain (residues 82–101). We created the latter two mutants lacking the C terminus, as the C-terminal domain of caveolin-1 undergoes palmitoylation, and palmitoylation is known to mediate membrane anchoring. Fig.1 A diagrammatically illustrates the construction of these “anchor-minus” caveolin-1 mutants. We chose 293T cells as our expression system as they do not express significant levels of endogenous caveolin-1. Fig. 1 B shows that all of these caveolin-1 deletion mutants were expressed to equivalent levels in 293T cells and were easily detected with mono-specific antibodies directed against the extreme N-terminal domain of caveolin-1 (residues 2–21). We evaluated the membrane association of these caveolin-1 deletion mutants using a variety of established assay systems. First, 293T cells transiently expressing wild-type caveolin-1 (FL) or a variety of deletion mutants (ΔTM, 1–101, and 1–81) were subjected to hypotonic lysis and separated into pellet and supernatant fractions. Fig. 2 A shows that wild-type caveolin-1 and two of the three deletion mutants (ΔTM and 1–101) partitioned with the pellet fraction, suggesting an association with membranes. In contrast, Cav-1-(1–81) remained completely soluble under these condition. These results immediately suggested a role for residues 82–101 in mediating membrane attachment. Proteins that resist alkaline carbonate extraction are operationally considered to be “integral membrane proteins” (35Olsen E.N. Spizz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2458-2466PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.3, A and B,demonstrates that wild-type caveolin-1 (FL) and two of the deletion mutants (ΔTM and 1–101) completely resisted extraction with sodium carbonate at pH 11.3. In contrast, Cav-1-(1–81) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (a known cytosolic protein) quantitatively partitioned with the supernatant fraction under these conditions, behaving as soluble proteins. To evaluate the possibility that Cav-1-(1–101) was associated with the membrane via an ionic interaction, we employed increasing concentrations of salt in the extraction buffer (0–1.0 mNaCl). Fig. 3 C shows that even under conditions of 1.0m NaCl, Cav-1-(1–101) remained completely membrane-associated, behaving as expected for an integral membrane protein. Endogenous caveolins 1, 2, and 3 are insoluble in non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 at low temperatures (6Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is thought that octyl glucoside solubilization occurs through the displacement of endogenous lipid components (such as glycosphingolipids and cholesterol) that are concentrated within caveolae membranes and interact directly with the caveolins (29Sargiacomo M.

Interestingly, Cav-1 (ΔTM) and Cav-1-(1–81) were completely Triton-soluble, whereas Cav-1-(1–101) remained completely Triton-insoluble. These results suggested that Cav-1-(1–101) might be correctly targeted to caveolae domains. To separate membranes enriched in caveolae from the bulk of cellular membranes and cytosolic proteins, an established equilibrium sucrose density gradient system was utilized (21Li S. Okamoto T.

Kokontis J. Liao S. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis reveals that the AR molecule has four major functional domains including the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the ligand-binding domain (LBD), the hinge domain, and the N-terminal activation domain (2Evans R.M.

There are two activation functions (AFs) identified in AR: the ligand-independent AF-1 in the N-terminal domain, and the ligand-dependent AF-2 in the LBD. Although AF-1 represents the major transactivation of AR that can be self-transactive in the GAL4DBD (GBD) one-hybrid assays, the androgen may still go through the LBD to control the AF-1 mediated transactivation (4Jenster G. van der Korput H.A.

This suggests a deep impact of steroid hormones on chromatin modulation and transcription regulation.Here, we report the cloning of ARA160, which has the same sequence as TMF (20Garcia J.A. Ou S.H.

Furthermore, co-transfection of ARA160 markedly enhanced the AR-mediated transcriptional activity on both androgen responsive promoters of prostate specific antigen (PSA) gene and mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR), which suggests that ARA160 is an androgen-enhanced N-terminal coactivator.DISCUSSIONAndrogens regulate gene transcription through binding to the AR (1Chang C.

Understanding the transcriptional functions and the regulatory mechanisms of AR is essential for controlling androgen signaling and androgen-regulated prostate cancer growth. Earlier reports suggested that the AR AF-2 may recruit a complex including several AR coactivators, such as ARA70, ARA55, ARA54, and retinal blastoma (5Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), to enhance the AF-2 transactivation function. In contrast, very few coregulators have been reported to selectively bind to the AR AF-1 domain (16Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12101-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), therefore, it will be very important to identify some AF-1 coregulators that can enhance AR AF-1 transactivation.In this study we were able to isolate and demonstrate that ARA160 can function as a coactivator through the interaction with the AR AF-1. Further data indicate that ARA160 can also interact with DBD-LBD of the AR. Although ARA160 enhances the AR AF-1 more significantly than AR AF-2 (Fig. 4 B), these results suggest that ARA160 may physically and functionally serve as a bridge between AR N- and C-terminal activation domain. Moreover, the greater than additive enhancement of ARA160 and ARA70 on AR transactivation as demonstrated in Fig. 5, further supports the hypothesis that the AR can activate transcription through coordinated mechanisms mediated by both the AF-1 and AF-2. Perhaps, androgen-induced AR can recruit the AF-2 coactivator and the AF-1 coactivator to form a higher AR complex, and cooperation between the AF-1 coactivator and the AF-2 coactivator might expand the androgen-AR signal in transactivation.Nuclear receptor coactivators, such as SRC1, TRAM-1, and p120, have been reported to show significant coactivator activity only when high doses of coactivator expression plasmids are co-transfected with receptor expression plasmids (25Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27629-27634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 26Monden T. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29834-29841Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the case of SRC-1 and TRAM1, the ratio of coactivator plasmid to receptor plasmid reached 20 to 25:1. This higher transfection ratio of coactivator to receptor also occurred with ARA160, as shown in Fig. 3 A, more than 10-fold of ARA160 plasmid needs to be co-transfected with AR plasmid for the coactivator enhancing effects. The total ARA160 protein, however, only increases to near 2-fold, even though 30-fold higher ARA160 plasmid than AR plasmid was co-transfected (Fig.7).The strong AR coactivation can be only seen in PC-3 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. ARA160 becomes a relatively weak coactivator in DU145, MCF7, and H1299 cells in the same transfection conditions, indicating that intracellular environments, in addition to a high ARA160 plasmid dose, are required for ARA160 to enhance AR transactivation. Compared with ARA70, ARA160 has relative weak coactivator enhancing effects on T- or E2-mediated AR transactivation in DU145 cells. However, ARA160 becomes a good coactivator to enhance DHT- and T-mediated transactivation in PC-3 cells. These differential enhancing effects between coactivators support the idea that coactivators require special environments for their maximal or proper function.Based on the relatively low homology among the N-terminal domain of steroid receptors, we initially expected that ARA160 might function more specifically to AR. However, ARA160 could also enhance GR- and PR-mediated transactivation in transient transfection assays. Possibly, the other portions of the AR, which have relatively higher homology to GR and PR, contribute to their interaction with ARA160. Nevertheless, our data indicated ARA160 enhanced GAL4-SP1 only marginally (1.5-fold) on pG5E1b-Luc (data not shown), suggesting there are still certain preferences for ARA160 to steroid receptors.Although the apparent molecular mass of ARA160 (160 kDa) is higher than the calculated molecular mass (123 kDa), the running pattern in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is consistent regardless of expression in either eukaryotic or prokaryotic system. These data may imply the post-translational modification of ARA160 to be not very significant. The fact that ARA160 can function as an AR coactivator in multiple cells, including yeast, PC-3, and Chinese hamster ovary, also supports the above suggestion that ARA160 may function well without special modification. Because the baculovirus expressed ARA160 recombinant protein did not show any band shift with PSA-ARE (androgen response element) and core promoter, and the fact that only minimal self-activation occurred when ARA160 was fused to GBD in transfection assays (data not shown), we might be able to conclude that ARA160 will not bind directly to the core promoter sequence of the AR target gene and therefore can only function as a coactivator through interaction with the AR in our transfection assays.In conclusion, we have cloned and identified ARA160 as an AR coactivator through its interaction with the AR N-terminal domain and have shown that ARA160 enhances DHT- and T-mediated AR transactivation in human prostate PC-3 cells. In comparison with ARA70, we found that the cellular environment, ligand, and amino acid within AR are critical for different coactivators to maximally enhance AR transactivation. Further study of the interactions among the AR and all these different AR coactivators will provide us a deeper insight in the regulation of androgen signaling and prostate cancer growth.

Kokontis J. Liao S. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis reveals that the AR molecule has four major functional domains including the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the ligand-binding domain (LBD), the hinge domain, and the N-terminal activation domain (2Evans R.M.

There are two activation functions (AFs) identified in AR: the ligand-independent AF-1 in the N-terminal domain, and the ligand-dependent AF-2 in the LBD. Although AF-1 represents the major transactivation of AR that can be self-transactive in the GAL4DBD (GBD) one-hybrid assays, the androgen may still go through the LBD to control the AF-1 mediated transactivation (4Jenster G. van der Korput H.A.

Localization in the plasma membrane was dependent on the palmitoylation state, since the palmitoylation mutant of eNOS (C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP) was excluded from the plasma membrane and was concentrated in a diffuse perinuclear pattern. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed eNOS-GFP in the perinuclear region moving 3 times faster than the plasmalemmal pool, suggesting that protein-lipid or protein-protein interactions are different in these two cellular domains. FRAP of the palmitoylation mutant was two times faster than that of wild-type eNOS-GFP, indicating that palmitoylation was influencing the rate of trafficking. Interestingly, FRAP of C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP but not wild-type eNOS-GFP fit a model of protein diffusion in a lipid bilayer. These data suggest that the regulation of eNOS trafficking within the plasma membrane and Golgi are probably different mechanisms and not due to simple diffusion of the protein in a lipid bilayer.

The appropriate targeting of lipid-modified signaling proteins into discrete membrane domains is important for the fidelity of signal transduction events. For example, dual acylation reactions via co-translational N-myristoylation and post-translational cysteine palmitoylation of proteins such as G proteins, Src family members, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) 1The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); Man II, mannosidase II; Cav-1, caveolin-1; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; VEGF, vacular endothelial growth factor are required for correct cellular trafficking and for coupling intracellular signaling to extracellular stimuli in intact cells (1Resh M.D. Cell.

In general, mutation of the N-myristoylation sites of dually acylated molecules prevents subsequent cysteine palmitoylation and typically results in mislocalization of the protein into cytosolic compartments, thus providing compelling evidence that lipid modifications support the directional membrane trafficking of otherwise soluble proteins. eNOS is a peripheral membrane protein that targets to specific intracellular domains, including Golgi and cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane, caveolae. Inhibition of dual acylation prevents Golgi targeting (4Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol.

In both of the above situations, the mislocalization of eNOS has functional consequences; the stimulated production of nitric oxide (NO) in intact cells is attenuated, although the purified mutant enzymes are catalytically identical to wild-type (WT) eNOS (3Liu J.

These data suggest that dual fatty acylation is critical for eNOS localization into specific regions of the cell and for optimal NO production. The amount of eNOS detected in Golgi versus plasma membrane varies in different endothelial cell populations as determined byin vitro and in vivo techniques, suggesting a dynamic, complex trafficking pattern of this protein. Interestingly, the first 35 amino acids, inclusive of the N-myristoylation and palmitoylation sites has been shown to direct the green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the Golgi region of living NIH 3T3 cells, whereasN-myristoylation per se cannot, suggesting thatN-myristoylation and cysteine palmitoylation can participate in the Golgi targeting and stable membrane association of this protein. To gain an appreciation for the dynamic nature of eNOS trafficking in its native environment, we have generated endothelial cells that stably express WT eNOS and the palmitoylation mutant eNOS (C15S/C26S eNOS) coupled to GFP. Here we show that the pattern of eNOS-GFP trafficking into the apical plasma membrane depends on palmitoylation. In addition, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) demonstrates that the rate of eNOS-GFP movement differs in Golgi versus plasma membrane and that palmitoylation slows eNOS movement in the cell. These data provide the first direct measurement of the movement of a dually acylated peripheral membrane protein in the Golgi and plasma membrane and support the idea that palmitoylation permits the kinetic trapping of acylated proteins in discrete microenvironments of the cell and facilitates the movement of proteins between Golgi and plasma membrane. WT eNOS-GFP and the palmitoylation-deficient mutant generated by mutation of the two cysteine palmitoylation sites, cysteines 15 and 26, to serines (C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP) were prepared as described previously (9Liu J. Hughes T.E. Sessa W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In brief, polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce anNheI site into the 3′-end of the eNOS coding sequence and into the 5′-end of a GFP clone that was optimal for expression (10Zolotukhin S. Potter M. Hauswirth W.W. Guy J. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4646-4654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences were joined in frame via the NheI site and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. The C15S/C26S mutant of eNOS in pcDNA3 was subcloned as aHindIII/SrfI fragment into the above vector. The immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line, ECV304 (15Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and primary cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). For transfection, ECV304 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106cells/100-mm dish and transfected the next day with the cDNAS for WT eNOS-GFP or C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP according to the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfected ECV304 cells were selected for growth in the presence of G418 (800 μg/ml). After 3 weeks, G418-resistant colonies were selected and maintained in the complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing G418 (200 μg/ml). Several clones of WT and mutant transfected cells were isolated and characterized. Cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, lysed on ice in a modified immune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 10 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and lysates were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were Dounce-homogenized (50 strokes), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, Pansorbin complexes were removed by centrifugation, and eNOS was immunoprecipitated with an excess of eNOS monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., clone 9D10) and Western blotted as described previously. Nontransfected cells and transfected cells were trypsinized, washed and resuspended in complete cell culture medium; counted; washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl); and lysed at equal density, i.e., 107 cells/ml of immune precipitation assay lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS (w/v), 10 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates (Dynatech), and the fluorescence of GFP was measured using CytoFluor II (Dynatech) fitted with filters for 485- and 520-nm excitation and emission, respectively. The amount of eNOS-GFP in transfected cells was calculated based on the standard curve of purified GFP diluted in lysates of the exactly same number of nontransfected cells to exclude both the background and the possible quenching of fluorescence by some cell lysate components. Preliminary data demonstrated that eNOS-GFP extracted from cells was intact and GFP was not proteolytically cleaved (based on sequential Western blots with GFP and eNOS antisera); therefore, measurements of GFP actually reflect intact eNOS-GFP (data not shown). ECV304 cells unlike the parental cells (HUVEC; Ref. 11Papapetropoulos A. Cziraki A. Rubin J.W. Stone C.D. Catravas J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) do not express the soluble isoform of guanylate cyclase as assessed by the lack of cGMP accumulation in response to 100 μm sodium nitroprusside (data not shown). Thus, in order to investigate if ECV304 or ECV304 stably transfected with eNOS-GFP produces biologically active NO, a rat vascular smooth muscle cell-endothelium co-culture system was used (12Papapetropoulos A. Marczin N. Snead M.D. Cheng C. Milici A. Catravas J.D. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and cGMP accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells determined by radioimmunoassay as described. To normalize cGMP values, protein content in each well was measured by the Bradford method following solubilization of the protein with hot 1 n NaOH. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using Student's t test. Differences among means were considered significant at p < 0.05. Transfected ECV304 cells were plated onto Permanox eight-chamber slides. For colocalization with the resident Golgi protein mannosidase II (Man II), cells were fixed in acetone for 5 min at −20 °C and then rinsed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin) for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated sequentially with 5% goat serum in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a 3-h incubation with Man II polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Kelley Moreman; 1:500) and a 45-min incubation with Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:500. Slides were mounted with Slowfade (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and cells were observed with an inverted Zeiss microscope fitted with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal imaging system. For colocalization of eNOS-GFP with caveolin-1 (Cav-1), cells were fixed for 15 min with freshly prepared paraformaldehyde (3%, w/v) at room temperature, washed two times for 5 min, and then incubated sequentially with 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline plus 5% goat serum for 30 min, and thereafter with Cav-1 polyclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories; 1:300) for 2 h. All of the next steps were the same as described above for colocalization with Man II. The specificity of the Man II and Cav-1 antibodies has been demonstrated previously (4Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 5Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Low density caveolin-enriched membrane fractions were isolated as described (13Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent WT or C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP-transfected ECV304 cells cultured in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with DBPS, scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate (pH 11), Dounce-homogenized, and sonicated (three 20-s bursts at 30% of maximal power). The homogenate was then adjusted to 42.5% of sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 85% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mmMes, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (3 ml of 5% sucrose, 5 ml of 30% sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 18 h in an SW40 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). A light-scattered band confined to the 5–30% sucrose interface was observed that contained caveolin but excluded most other proteins. Gradient fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top of the tube to yield a total of 12 fractions, and 30 μl of each fraction was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S to visualize protein bands and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously. Blots were probed with eNOS monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-Cav-1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories), and anti-β-COP polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Affinity BioReagents) followed by horse peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and ECL to detect the immunoreactive proteins. The percentage of total membrane protein in different gradient fractions was determined by laser densitometry. ECV304 cells were grown on coverslips. After washing in PBS at 37 °C, cells were fixed with 1.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h, washed (0.1 m cacodylate wash, twice for 5 min each), postfixed (1% OsO4, 1.5% K3FeCN6 in 0.1 m cacodylate, 1 h), stained with uranyl acetate, and embedded in Epon (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Ultrathin sections were mounted on 200-mesh grids and stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. Micrographs were taken at × 29,000 on a Philips CM10 microscope at 80 kV. A confocal microscope was used to image the eNOS-GFP in living cells. Cells were seeded on gelatin-coated (2%, w/v) 35-mm plates (MatTek, Ashland, MA). To assess the amount of eNOS-GFP in different subcellular compartments, Z-series (0.2-μm steps, approximately 20–30 sections) were collected from live cells, and the percentage of eNOS-GFP in each step was analyzed using IPLAB software. To study the dynamics of eNOS in living cells, we used the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method of Axelrod et al. (21Axelrod D. Ravdin P. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Webb W.W. Elson E.L. Podleski T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4594-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Focusing 100% of krypton/argon laser power (blue light of 488-nm length) on small areas of either plasma membrane or perinuclear region, membrane-associated eNOS was photobleached irreversibly for 20 s. 3% of laser power was then used to image the GFP at 15-, 30-, or 60-s intervals. The first image after photobleaching was recorded after 20–30 s, the time required for adjusting the optics for recording subsequent images. The images were analyzed using IPLAB software. The mean fluorescence signal intensity before photobleaching and in the subsequent time points after photobleaching was measured. If there was any fluorescence signal loss during the recording, FRAP values were normalized to an adjacent cell. We also assessed the mobile fraction of eNOS (in WT or C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP cells) within the perinuclear region after partial bleachings. For this purpose, the regions of interest were marked within the bleached and unbleached part of the perinuclear region, and the fluorescence intensity in those regions was measured before bleaching and after recovery. The percentage of mobile eNOS (percentage of mobile fraction) was calculated by dividing the ratio of fluorescence intensity within the photobleached region to the respective one out of the photobleached region after recovery by the respective ratio before photobleaching as described previously (14Cole N.B. Smith C.L. Sciaky N. Terasaki M. Edidin M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 1996; 273: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To assess the trafficking of eNOS in endothelial cells, the immortalized endothelial cell line ECV304 was stably transfected with WT eNOS-GFP expression plasmid. ECV304 cells retain the typical cobblestone morphology appearance of native endothelial cells and retain expression of several but not all cell markers (15Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.1 A, eNOS-GFP (162 kDa) was amply expressed in transfected ECV304 cells, whereas the nontransfected ECV304 cells did not express a detectable amount of the endogenous protein (135 kDa). To assess the expression more quantitatively, we used a fluorimetric assay to measure the amount of GFP per cell, reflecting the amount of eNOS-GFP fusion protein. Fig. 1 Bshows a typical standard curve with purified GFP diluted in lysates of 107 nontransfected ECV304 cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1 ml). The amount of eNOS-GFP fusion protein from the same number of transfected cells (per ml of lysate) was 744 ± 18.6 ng (n = 3 separate experiments from serial passaged cells) as calculated from the standard curve; thus, the calculated average number of eNOS-GFP molecules per cell was 2.74 × 105. To address the question of whether eNOS-GFP is catalytically active once expressed in ECV304 cells, we employed a sensitive bioassay to quantify the level of cGMP accumulation in detector vascular smooth muscle cells. As seen in Fig. 1 C, the calcium ionophore ionomycin significantly increased cGMP accumulation, an effect that was attenuated by coincubation of the cultures with the NOS inhibitor, nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (n = 4). Ionomycin did not increase cGMP accumulation in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells coincubated with nontransfected ECV304 cells (10.1 ± 0.33 and 4.4 ± 3.0 pmol cGMP/mg of protein for control and ionomycin-treated cells, respectively, n = 4). In addition, two receptor-dependent agonists, ADP and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also stimulated cGMP accumulation. Thus, eNOS-GFP couples NO production to both receptor-dependent and -independent forms of stimulation as seen in native endothelial cells. To determine if eNOS-GFP in ECV304 cells colocalized with the resident protein of cis-medial region of the Golgi apparatus, Man II immunofluorescence was performed. The majority of perinuclear eNOS-GFP (left) in ECV304 cells is colocalized with Man II (middle) as described previously (Fig.2 A; the arrowsdenote areas of colocalization in the right panel). To delineate if eNOS-GFP colocalized with Cav-1, eNOS-GFP cells were immunolabeled with a Cav-1 antibody and observed as above. eNOS-GFP and caveolin-1 appeared to concentrate into the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B, left and middle), and eNOS-GFP partially colocalized with Cav-1 (right; thearrows denote regions of colocalization, and thearrowheads demonstrate regions with little colocalization between eNOS-GFP and caveolin-1). Since there is evidence that some immortalized or oncogenically transformed cells do not contain caveolae, we performed transmission electron microscopy on confluent ECV304 cells. In contrast to several primary endothelial cells in culture that lose their caveolae, ECV304 cells indeed contain membrane-attached, subplasmalemmal, and racemose flask-shaped organelles of approximately 50-nm diameter, defined as caveolae (Fig. 2 C). In order to determine the role of palmitoylation of eNOS in its subcellular distribution in living cells, ECV304 cells were stably transfected with the palmitoylation-deficient mutant C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP. As seen in Fig.3 A, at all time points after plating, C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP cells had a similar perinuclear appearance to that of cells expressing WT eNOS-GFP. However, the palmitoylation mutant, although tightly membrane-associated biochemically (3Liu J. Garcia-Cardena G. Sessa W.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13277-13281Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), was more diffusely distributed in this cellular domain and occupied a larger area of the cell compared with cells expressing WT eNOS-GFP. More importantly, as seen in postconfluent cells (5 days), WT eNOS-GFP was particularly strong in cell junctions in contrast to C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP, which did not yield any enhancement of the fluorescence intensity in cell peripheral borders and was confined to a diffuse perinuclear pattern. Vertical sections through the monolayer (delineated by the horizontal bar in thebottom panel of Fig. 3 A) to examine the plasma membrane distribution demonstrated that WT eNOS-GFP was localized specifically to both apical and basolateral membranes with the greatest concentration of the protein at intercellular junctions (Fig. 3 B), whereas the palmitoylation mutant was excluded from the junctions. We also determined the percentage of WT and C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP in different subcellular compartments by quantitative horizontal Z-series analysis. WT eNOS-GFP was mostly abundant in plasma membrane (53.6 ± 6.2%), followed by Golgi (34.8 ± 4.6%) and cytosol (11.6 ± 3.3%, n = 6). Thus, based on our fluorimetric assessments of WT eNOS-GFP in cell lysates, the average number of eNOS-GFP molecules was 1.47, 0.95, and 0.32 × 105, for plasma membrane, Golgi, and cytosol, respectively. On the other hand, C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP was not present in the plasma membrane, and the majority of it was found in the perinuclear region (65.8 ± 10.5%), followed by the remaining part of cytosol (34.2 ± 9%, n = 7). Next, we examined the subcellular localization of WT and mutant eNOS using sodium carbonate disruption followed by discontinuous sucrose gradients. This methodology allows for the separation of proteins that localize to cholesterol and glycolipid-rich domains (interface of 5–30% sucrose) from other membrane proteins (bottom of gradient) (Fig. 4). Cav-1-enriched fractions (fractions 4 and 5) contained 97% of the total Cav-1 and only 8% of total β-COP immunoreactivity. As seen in Fig. 4 A, WT eNOS-GFP was proportionally distributed into two domains, one enriched in Cav-1 (40% in fractions 4 and 5) and the other enriched in β-COP. This is in contrast to the C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP, which was diffusely distributed throughout the gradient and seemed to follow the pattern of β-COP more closely than that of Cav-1 (only 12.5% in fractions 4 and 5). Fig. 4 B represents densitometric evaluation of these data. To investigate the dynamics of WT eNOS-GFP movement, plasma membrane and perinuclear compartments in confluent cells were photobleached, and the FRAP was determined. The recovery was reasonably fit by a single exponential function, F i= F o*exp(−t/τ), where F irepresents measured fluorescence, F o represents the initial fluorescence, t represents time (s), and τ is the time constant. Fig. 5 A shows the fluorescence recovery in plasma membrane of eNOS-GFP. The average time constant of this process was 716 ± 209 s (n = 4 cells from four experiments). Next, a part of perinuclear region was photobleached to determine the kinetics of FRAP within the Golgi region (Fig. 5 B). The speed of recovery was about 3 times faster in the Golgi (222 ± 50 s;n = 5) compared with that of plasma membrane, suggesting that protein-protein or lipid-protein interactions with eNOS were different in these two membrane compartments. To assess the role of palmitoylation in the movement of eNOS in the cell, we photobleached a region of the perinuclear C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP in ECV304 cells. As seen in Fig. 5 C, the recovery of the palmitoylation mutant was faster than that of WT eNOS, with a time constant of 103 ± 16 s (n = 5). These data suggest that palmitoylation, in addition to contributing to the targeting of eNOS to the plasma membrane, slows the movement of eNOS in the perinuclear region. Moreover, the percentage of mobile fraction of the palmitoylation mutant was greater than that of the wild type enzyme (93 ± 4.5 and 71 ± 13% mobile protein for C15S/C26S eNOS-GFP compared with WT, respectively, n = 5). These data suggest a more homogenous distribution and mixing of the bleached and unbleached pools of the mutant compared with the WT protein. To evaluate the FRAP data further, we inverted the data values of the images and subtracted the prebleach image from the images acquired during recovery. This procedure generated an image of the bleaching pattern (Fig. 6 A). Analysis of the initial bleach pattern did not fit to a Gaussian function for WT eNOS-GFP, and the distribution of the bleaching patterns did not change over time in a manner consistent with a random process of diffusion of a protein in a lipid bilayer. In striking contrast to the WT protein, the initial bleach F o of the palmitoylation mutant was readily fit by a simple Gaussian function described by the equationF o = C*exp(−(x −m)2/ςo2), and the subsequent images of the spreading bleach pattern were fit with the equation F n=C*(ςo2/ςn2)*exp(−(x− m)2/ςn2) (16Yokoe H. Meyer T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), whereC represents the peak bleach value, x represents a data point, and m represents the mean of the curve. The mean of the Gaussian fits for the palmitoylation mutant remained constant over time (Fig. 6 B), and the change in the S.D. squared plotted against time (Fig. 6 C) was well fit by a single line with a slope directly related (Δy/Δx = 4D) to a diffusion coefficient (D) calculated to be 0.051 ± 0.013 μm2/s (n = 8).

https://openalex.org/W2034071735,"A group of transcriptional cofactors for nuclear hormone receptors, referred to as corepressors (CoRs) and coactivators (CoAs), has been shown to induce transcriptional silencing and hormone-induced activation, respectively, of genes that contain positive hormone response elements. Transcriptional silencing by CoRs involves the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), whereas ligand-dependent activation is associated with the recruitment of CoAs, which possess or recruit histone acetyltransferases (HATs). In a reciprocal manner, negatively regulated genes are stimulated by nuclear receptors in the absence of ligand and are repressed in response to ligand binding to receptors. We show here that negative regulation of the thyroid-stimulating hormone α (TSHα) promoter by the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) involves a novel mechanism in which the recruitment of CoRs by TR is associated with transcriptional stimulation and histone acetylation. Expression of excess HDAC reverses the stimulation mediated by the TR·CoR complex, consistent with a pivotal role for acetylation in this event. Addition of the ligand, 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3), induces transcriptional repression of the TSHα promoter and is associated with the loss of histone acetylation. T3-dependent repression is blocked by phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein, or by inhibition of HDAC, indicating that receptor action is subverted by maneuvers that stimulate histone acetylation of the target gene. We propose that negative regulation of a subset of genes by TR involves the active exchange of CoRs and CoAs with intrinsic promoter regulatory elements that normally strongly induce histone acetylation and transcriptional activation.

We propose that negative regulation of a subset of genes by TR involves the active exchange of CoRs and CoAs with intrinsic promoter regulatory elements that normally strongly induce histone acetylation and transcriptional activation. Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that regulate the expression of a wide array of target genes. An intriguing aspect of their action is that, within the same cell, some target genes are stimulated whereas others are repressed. This phenomenon is most readily explained by differences inherent in the regulatory elements of these target genes. In the case of positively regulated genes, the mechanism of transcriptional control is relatively well understood. These genes contain hormone response elements that bind nuclear receptors, usually as homo- or heterodimers.

Transcriptional silencing by this receptor-assembled complex is thought to involve chromatin remodeling caused by histone deacetylation.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of positively regulated genes is dictated by receptor binding to DNA regulatory elements and the recruitment of CoRs in the absence of ligand; in the presence of ligand, CoRs are dissociated and CoAs bind to stimulate gene transcription. In contrast to positively regulated genes, the mechanism by which nuclear receptors control the transcription of negatively regulated genes is less well understood. Proposed mechanisms include competition of nuclear receptors with other transcription factor-binding sites, receptor binding to so-called negative regulatory elements, direct interactions of nuclear receptors with transcription factors like AP1 or NFκB, and competition for transcriptional cofactors like CBP (24Karin M. Cell. 1998; 93: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In the case of the thyroid hormone receptor, negative regulation of gene expression in response to its ligand, 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3), is an essential part of its physiological action. For example, the hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and the pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) α- and β-subunit genes are inhibited by T3 as a physiologic feedback mechanism for modulating circulating thyroid hormone levels. These genes are stimulated in the absence of T3, and the addition of hormone induces rapid and strong transcriptional repression (25Shupnik M.A. Ardisson L.J. Meskell M.J. Bornstein J. Ridgway E.C. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previous studies have localized hormone-responsive regions to the proximal promoter regions of these negatively regulated genes (26Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Flynn T.R. Boers M.E. Cohen O. Wondisford F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 540-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chatterjee V.K.K. Lee J.K. Rentoumis A. Jameson J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the nature of the response elements and the mechanism of ligand-dependent repression remain poorly defined. Recently, we reported (30Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) the unexpected finding that CoRs are involved in the basal activation of the TSH and TRH genes by unliganded TRs. TR mutations that prevent its ability to interact with CoRs eliminated stimulation of these promoters in the absence of ligand, and overexpression of NCoR or SMRT enhanced rather than suppressed the basal activity of these genes. In this report, we describe a potential mechanism for transcriptional control of genes that are negatively regulated by TR. In this model, TR retains the fundamental features of interactions with CoRs and CoAs, but the functional consequences of these interactions are reversed in comparison to positively regulated genes. We demonstrate that the negatively regulated TSHα gene is unusually sensitive to the state of histone acetylation and appears to be controlled by partitioning of HDACs and HATs between TR and other transcription factors that bind to the TSHα promoter. We propose that a subset of negatively regulated genes are controlled by two-step mechanism as follows: 1) the unliganded TR recruits CoRs and withdraws HDAC from the basal promoter to cause activation; 2) T3 binding to the TR dissociates the CoRs/HDACs and recruits CoAs to restrict access of HATs to CREB and other components of the basal promoter, thereby causing ligand-dependent repression. The specificity of this effect is encoded by the promoter elements and transcription factors that bind to negatively regulated genes, as opposite effects are seen with positively regulated promoters studied under identical conditions. The mutant hTRβ1 cDNAs were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, subcloned into pCMX, and verified by DNA sequencing as described previously (27Chatterjee V.K.K. Lee J.K. Rentoumis A.

The total amount of expression plasmid DNA was kept constant in the different experimental groups by adding corresponding amounts of the same plasmids without cDNA inserts. After exposure to the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate for 8 h, Opti-MEM with 1% Dowex resin-stripped fetal bovine serum was added, in the absence or presence of 1 μm T3. Ethanol or 300 nm trichostatin A (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) was added in some of the experiments. Cells were harvested after 40 h for measurements of luciferase activity (44deWet J.R.

TSA-201 cells were transfected with 5 μg of −300 TSHα-Luc and 10 μg of the indicated expression plasmids. After 36 h, 1% formaldehyde was added to the culture media, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with mild shaking. Cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. After sonication for 25 s, lysates were cleared by centrifugation. An aliquot of the lysate (20 μl) was removed as a control, and the remainder was diluted 10-fold with a solution containing 0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mmEDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mmNaCl, protease inhibitors, and anti-acetylated histone H3 or H4 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, NY). After incubation with the antibodies overnight at 4 °C, histone-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using protein A-agarose beads. Precipitants were sequentially washed twice with dilution buffer, followed by washing once with dilution buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. After the final wash, 500 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 mNaHCO3) was added, and beads were rotated at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, 5 m NaCl was added and incubated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA was recovered by proteinase K treatment, phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended in water and subjected to PCR amplification using following primers: 5′ CAGGATGTTATGTGTATGGCTC for the TSHα promoter and 3′ CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTC for the luciferase gene. The32P-labeled PCR product (400 bp) was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics, CA). Previous studies have implicated CoRs in the basal activation of negatively regulated genes, such as the TSHα, TSHβ, and TRH genes (30Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Specifically, TR mutations (e.g. P214R) that impair interactions with CoRs reduce basal stimulation by unliganded TR but do not affect T3-dependent repression. In view of the apparently paradoxical effect of the CoRs on basal stimulation by the unliganded TR, we considered the possibility that CoAs might be involved in the T3-dependent repression of negatively regulated genes. For this purpose, the E457A mutant of TRβ is informative. It binds T3 with near normal affinity, but it selectively lacks binding to CoAs, and it retains interactions with CoRs (47Tagami T. Gu W. Peairs P.T. West B.L. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1888-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In parallel, we examined the effects of another CoR mutant (TRβ AHT), which contains three amino acid substitutions in the CoR interaction domain of TR but retains the ability to bind CoAs (3Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). The AHT mutation exhibits more complete elimination of CoR binding than the P214R mutation in TRβ (data not shown). By using the positively regulated promoter, TREp-tk-Luc, wild-type TR and the E457A mutant exhibited strong transcriptional silencing in the absence of T3, whereas the silencing ability of the AHT CoR mutant was abolished (Fig. 1 A). Wild-type TR and the AHT mutant induced strong transcriptional stimulation in the presence of T3, but the T3-induced stimulation by the E457A mutant was reduced. These controls confirm the expected properties of these TR mutants in the context of positively regulated genes. By using the negatively regulated promoter, TSHα-Luc, wild-type TR and the E457A mutant exhibited a comparable degree of basal activation in the absence of T3. However, basal activation was abolished using the AHT CoR mutant (Fig. 1 B), confirming our previous observation using the P214R CoR mutant (30Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Of note, T3-induced repression (below the basal level) was impaired using the E457A TR mutant but not with the AHT mutant. These results are consistent with a role for CoRs in basal activation, and CoAs in T3-induced repression, of negatively regulated genes. One potential mechanism for basal activation of the TSHα promoter by unliganded TR could involve partitioning of NCoR, SMRT, or other components of the repressor complex. Previously, we attempted to reverse TR-dependent activation of the TSHα promoter by overexpression of NCoR or SMRT (30Tagami T. Madison L.D. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, CoRs enhanced, rather than attenuated, basal activation by unliganded TR. This finding indicates that basal activation of these negatively regulated promoters is not caused by titration of limited quantities of CoRs. Recently, it was shown that the CoR·Sin3 complex also recruits histone deacetylases (HDACs) (6Alland L. Muhle R. Hou Jr., H. Potes J. Chin L. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A.

Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), which are important for inducing alterations in histone structure and perhaps other transcription factors. We therefore hypothesized that the stimulatory effect of excess CoRs or Sin3 (data not shown) might involve the recruitment of HDAC by the TR·CoR complex. To test this idea, the TSHα promoter was transfected with TR along with various combinations of CoRs and HDAC1. As found previously, cotransfection of NCoR enhanced basal activation by unliganded TR in comparison to the expression vector alone (Fig.2 A). In contrast to NCoR, expression of HDAC1 reduced TR-mediated basal stimulation. Since HDAC1 did not alter basal expression in the absence of TR, this effect is TR-specific. Strikingly, coexpression of HDAC1 eliminated the NCoR-mediated enhancement of basal activation by unliganded TR. A similar effect of HDAC1 was seen in the presence of SMRT and Sin3 (data not shown). Of note, T3-dependent repression was maintained in the presence of NCoR or HDAC1. These results suggest that the TR·CoR complex may deplete limiting amounts of HDAC1 in the absence of T3, leading to stimulation of the TSHα promoter. In the presence of T3, when CoR complex dissociates from TR, overexpression of these factors does not appear to affect T3-mediated suppression of the TSHα promoter. In view of the finding that the E457A mutation in TRβ (which selectively alters TR binding to CoAs) appears to abrogate T3-dependent repression, we tested the effect of coexpression of CoAs on negative regulation by TR. Expression of these CoAs (SRC1, FSRC1, glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1, TRAM1, and ACTR) enhanced T3-induced stimulation of positively regulated genes (Fig. 2 B). Each of the CoAs tested enhanced the degree of T3-induced gene suppression by 2–3-fold. However, they had little or no effect on basal activation by unliganded TR. Thus, a role for CoAs in T3-mediated repression of the TSHα promoter is supported by mutations in TR that eliminate CoA binding and by overexpression of CoAs. The regions of the TSHα promoter that are involved in TR-mediated repression have been examined previously (27Chatterjee V.K.K. Lee J.K. Rentoumis A. Jameson J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9114-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 48Madison L.D. Ahlquist J.A. Rogers S.D. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested a role for the CREs as well as basal elements downstream of the TATA box. However, because deletion of the CREs greatly reduces the activity of the TSHα promoter, it is difficult to study repression by T3 after they have been removed. The finding that unliganded TR and NCoR enhance activity of this promoter provides an alternative strategy for localizing regulatory elements that are affected by the TR. Various 5′ deletion constructs of the TSHα promoter were therefore examined for loss of activation by unliganded TR, as well as alterations in T3-dependent repression. The activity of the promoter constructs in the absence of TR was normalized to 100% to allow the effect of TR to be presented on a comparable scale. As shown in Fig. 3 A, stimulation of the TSHα promoter by unliganded TR was relatively constant until deletion of the CREs (between −156 and −100 bp), after which the degree of basal stimulation by the TR decreased by 80%. However, a small degree of TR-dependent basal activation was consistently seen using the minimal promoter constructs, including −30 TSHα-Luc. Because CoRs enhance the degree of activation by unliganded TR, NCoR was cotransfected with TR to more clearly examine promoter regions involved in basal activation (Fig. 3 B). NCoR strongly stimulated the TR-mediated enhancement of −156 TSHα-Luc. However, significant enhancement by NCoR was also observed using shorter versions of the promoter, such as −100 or −30 TSHα-Luc, but not with the backbone plasmid, pA3-Luc. T3 suppression was 60-fold using −156α-Luc and"

We have developed methods to quantitate fibrinopeptides (FPs) and soluble and insoluble Fg/Fn products during the tissue factor induced clotting of whole blood. Significant FPA generation (>50%) occurs prior to visible clotting (4 ± 0.2 min) coincident with factor XIII activation. At this time Fg is mostly in solution along with high molecular weight cross-linked products. Cross-linking of γ-chains is virtually complete (5 min) prior to the release of FPB, a process that does not occur until after clot formation. FPB is detected still attached to the β-chain throughout the time course demonstrating release of only low levels of FPB from the clot. After release of FPB a carboxypeptidase-B-like enzyme removes the carboxyl-terminal arginine resulting exclusively in des-Arg FPB by the 20-min time point. This process is inhibited by ε-aminocaproic acid. These results demonstrate that transglutaminase and carboxypeptidase enzymes are activated simultaneously with Fn formation. The initial clot is a composite of Fn I and Fg already displaying γ-γ cross-linking prior to the formation of Fn II with Bβ-chain remaining mostly intact followed by the selective degradation of FPB to des-Arg FPB.

Fn is generated from plasma Fg (M r 340,000) which is found in blood plasma at ∼3 mg/ml and exists as a symmetrical dimer consisting of Aα, Bβ, and γ polypeptide chains linked by noncovalent and disulfide bonds (1Shafer J.A.

The two carboxyl-terminal domains of the Bβ and γ-chains of Fg are designated “D” while the central domain which contains the amino termini of all the chains is designated “E.” Clot formation which has been extensively studied in anticoagulated plasma and purified Fg occurs in a series of steps (4Mossesson M.W. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 177-188PubMed Google Scholar) initiated by thrombin cleavage of the Aα and Bβ-chains of Fg. Cleavage at Aα-16 releases fibrinopeptide (FP) A to form Fn I. The release of two FPA peptides exposes a site in the E domain that aligns with a complementary site in the D domain to form overlapping fibrils (5Spraggon G. Everse S.J. Doolittle R.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This is followed by cleavage at Bβ-14 releasing the two FPB peptides to form Fn II. FPB release appears to allow for lateral aggregation of the protofibrils (6Hantgan R.R. Hermans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11272-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hantgan R.R. McDonagh J. Hermans J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 344-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The degree of lateral strand association contributes to the tensile strength of the clot, but its resistance to plasmin degradation is influenced mainly by covalent cross-linking. Cross-links are formed by the action of factor XIIIa (fXIIIa), a transglutaminase enzyme whose formation from zymogen fXIII (plasma concentration 90 nmol/liter) is also catalyzed by thrombin (8Lorand L. Jeong J.M. Radek J.T. Wilson J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Schwartz M.L. Pizzo S.V. Hill R.L. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5851-5854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FXIII consists of an A2B2 tetramer where the A subunit is acted upon by thrombin releasing an NH2-terminal activation peptide. Covalent isopeptide cross-links are formed between certain adjacent γ-carboxamido and ε-amino groups of glutamyl and lysyl residues within the extreme carboxyl-terminal γ-chains rapidly forming γ-γ dimers (10Chen R. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4486-4491Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Lorand L. Chenoweth D. Domanik R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal α-chains are also cross-linked but these isopeptide bonds form more slowly (12Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1977; 31: 1-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 13McKee P.A. Mattock P. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, a recent study conducted in human plasma observed that α-polymers and Aα-polymers are already present at the point of gelation (14Grøn B. Filion-Myklebust C. Bennick A. Nieuwenhuizen W. Matsueda G.R. Brosstad F. Blood Coagul. Fibrinol. 1992; 3: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The overall stability of the clot appears to be dependent upon the formation and orientation of the Fn monomers (15Blombäck B. Thromb. Res. 1996; 83: 1-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In vitro, Fn formation in native whole blood proceeds principally by the activation of thrombin by the intrinsic (contact) pathway of coagulation (16Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). However, the pathway relevant to physiological hemostasis is the extrinsic (tissue factor, TF) pathway (17Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) that proceeds through assembly of three membrane surface and vitamin K-dependent enzyme-cofactor complexes (18Mann K.G.

The initiating complex, is formed when circulating blood containing factor VIIa comes in contact with TF membrane (20Morrisey J.H. Macik B.G. Neuenschwander P.F. Comp P.C. Blood. 1993; 81: 734-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting complex activates zymogens factor X and factor IX (21Osterud B. Rapaport S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies of the relevant TF pathway in blood in vitro are only possible by suppression of the contact pathway. We have developed techniques by which selective inhibition of factor XIIa is accomplished by corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI) (24Hojima Y. Pierce J.V. Pisano J. Thromb.

Fg, FPA, thrombin levels, and platelet activation have been studied in whole blood in normal (25Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hemophiliac patients' (34Cawthern K.M. van't Veer C. Lock J.B. DiLorenzo M.E. Branda R.F. Mann K.G. Blood. 1998; 91: 4581-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on normal donors showed that significant amounts of Fg (80%) and FPA (45%) were incorporated into the initial clot at low levels of thrombin (∼15 nmol/liter) (25Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparative studies on a factor VIII-deficient patient (hemophilia A) showed increased clot time with decreased thrombin levels (1.9 nmol/liter/min versus normal 55 nmol/liter/min) characterized by a slower rate (∼30% of the normal) of Fn formation (34Cawthern K.M. van't Veer C. Lock J.B. DiLorenzo M.E. Branda R.F. Mann K.G. Blood. 1998; 91: 4581-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normal levels of FPA were reached by 20 min even with decreased thrombin generation. Therefore, the level of FPA generation in hemophiliacs does not explain why clots are more friable in these patients. Hence, we wanted to develop a system that can be used to observe other Fg degradation products (i.e. FPB) involved in clot formation and possibly explain why clots are unstable in hemophiliacs. Characterizing other FP products (i.e. FPB) have been attempted (38Eckhardt T. Nossel H.L. Hurlet-Jensen A. La Gamma K.S. Owen J. Auerbach M. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but little information is available regarding FPB detection in whole blood. The results obtained present a somewhat different sense of observations from those observed with purified Fg and anticoagulated plasma. Human Fg, >95% clottable (a gift from Dr. Laszlo Bajzar), was isolated by the procedure of Straughn and Wagner (39Straughn W. Wagner R.H. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1966; 16: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) followed by Lys-Sepharose and α-fXIII chromatography to remove traces of plasminogen and fXIII. Thrombin was prepared from prothrombin by the general methods of Lundblad et al. (40Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G.

Goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish perioxidase and goat anti-rabbit (H+L) IgG-horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, Al). Asserachrom enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for FPA were purchased from Diagnostica Stago (American Bioproducts, NJ). Thrombin-AT-III ELISA kits were purchased from Enzygnost TAT Behring (Westwood, MA). HPLC grade HClO4, H2O, and CH3CN were purchased from VWR (Bridgeport, NJ).

Normal donors (age range 21–37) with no history of blood disorders, regular aspirin, or drug use were recruited and advised according to a protocol approved by the University of Vermont Human Studies Committee. All individuals exhibited normal ranges for plasma Fg (147–340 mg/dl). Blood was collected by venipuncture and rapidly distributed to a series of test and control tubes containing 12.5 pmol/liter of TF relipidated in 25 nmol/liter of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (75% phosphatidylcholine/25% phosphatidylserine as described previously (42Lawson J.H. Krishaswamy S. Butenas S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 177-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) and CTI (100 μg/ml) (25Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When used, EACA (50 mmol/liter), was added to the tubes prior to the addition of blood. Tubes were quenched over time with a mixture of coagulation inhibitors, 50 mmol/liter EDTA with 20 mmol/liter benzamidine-HCl in HBS, pH 7.4, and 50 μmol/liter FPRck ± 50 mmol/liter EACA. Aliquots were collected either every minute from 0 to 10 or 0 to 2 then every 20 s from 2 to 6 min, followed by 12-, 14-, 16-, and 20-min time points. The zero time point contained the quench solution prior to addition of blood. A tube containing CTI and no TF was added as a control to determine the quality of the phlebotomy and the extent of contact pathway inhibition. Clot time was determined visually. Solid material was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 2000 rpm) and stored at −80 °C. The fluid material was analyzed directly or aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. SDS-PAGE (4–12%) was performed according to the modified (25Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G.

High molecular weight standard mixtures (14–200 kDa) were loaded along with Fg standards (300 ng/lane), fXIII (50 ng/lane), or activated fXIII (fXIIIa) to allow for comparison on the immunoblots. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and subjected to semi-dry transfer for 3 h at 250 mAmp as described by Towbinet al. (44Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). The primary antibody was either α-Fbgn2E or polyclonal α-fXIII used at 5 μg/ml, the secondary antibody (goat α-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase or goat α-rabbit (H+L) horseradish peroxidase) at 1:5000 dilutions, and the substrate for emitting light was Luminol (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). The blots were developed as described previously (25Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparisons of fXIII conversion to fXIIIa, and Fg levels in solution were analyzed on the immunoblots. A relative fraction was calculated from Fg or fXIIIa present at each time point divided by total Fg or total fXIII A-chain (fXIIIA + fXIIIAa) detectable. FPs were isolated using a Waters Model 484 Controller and Model 510 Solvent Pumps monitored using a Model 481 detector at 214 nm. The column used for all analyses was a wide pore octadecyl (C18) Bakerbond (4.6 × 250 mm) (VWR). Peptide samples were eluted by using linear gradients of Buffer A: H2O, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and Buffer B: CH3CN, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient elution was as follows: 0–5 min 100% Buffer A, 25 min 80% Buffer A, 50 min 60% Buffer A, 55 min 100% Buffer B. The data was analyzed using Labview (Version 4, National Instruments, Austin, TX). FP standards were prepared from Fg (2.5 mg/ml) in HBS treated with thrombin (5 nmol/l), 37 °C, 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of HClO4 (0.2 mol/l final) and the precipitated proteins removed by centrifugation (10 min at 14,000 rpm). The supernatant was subsequently treated with equimolar KOH and allowed to sit on ice for 30 min, removing the salt precipitate by centrifugation. The soluble material from the whole blood quenched sample time points were also treated with HClO4 (0.2 mol/l final) and neutralized with equimolar KOH. The HPLC analyses of the FPs were conducted without further separation. The identities of the resolved fractions were confirmed by mass spectrometry, amino acid composition, and amino acid sequence analyses. Fractions corresponding to phosphorylated FPA (P-FPA), FPA, des-Ala FPA, FPB, and des-Arg FPB were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (linear model; PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The matrix used was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 70/30, H2O, CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a 1:1 ratio with the sample. Amino acid sequencing and composition were performed on the samples (Dr. Alex Kurosky University of Texas, Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). The concentrations of stock FPs were assessed by amino acid composition. To prepare des-Arg FPB standards and analyze the process, Fg (2.5 mg/ml) was incubated for 35 min at ambient temperatures with TAFI (70 nmol/liter), thrombomodulin (4 nmol/liter), and thrombin (10 nmol/liter) in 20 mmol/liter HEPES, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter CaCl2, and chicken albumin (0.01%). The reaction was stopped upon addition of HClO4 (0.2 mol/liter final), centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min), supernatant neutralized with equimolar KOH, and the resultant solution analyzed by HPLC methods as described above. FPA and FPB stocks (1.5 μmol/liter) in 0.04 mol/liter NaH2PO4, 0.084 mol/liter NaCl, 0.01% PEG 8000, were also incubated with TAFI (70 nmol/liter) activated with thrombomodulin (40 nmol/liter) and thrombin (8 nmol/liter) in 20 mmol/liter HEPES, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter CaCl2, and chicken albumin (0.01%). The reaction was carried out at 22 °C for 1 h then stopped by HClO4 (0.2 mol/liter final) neutralized with equimolar KOH and analyzed by HPLC methods. FPA and FPB standard calibration curves of micrograms of injectedversus area were developed. Correlation coefficient values were calculated to be as follows: FPA r 2 = 0.966, FPB r 2 = 0.940. Whole blood samples were spiked at the zero time point with a known amount of FPs and percent recovery determined. Recovery of spiked whole blood samples was calculated to be 57%. Therefore, all samples were corrected for by this factor along with corrections for whole blood sample dilution from 1.0 ml of added quench reagents as described previously (34Cawthern K.M. van't Veer C. Lock J.B. DiLorenzo M.E. Branda R.F. Mann K.G. Blood. 1998; 91: 4581-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Commercial FPA and thrombin-AT-III (TAT) ELISA's were conducted according to the manufacture's protocols with corrections that have been previously described (34Cawthern K.M. van't Veer C. Lock J.B. DiLorenzo M.E. Branda R.F. Mann K.G. Blood. 1998; 91: 4581-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results were obtained and analyzed using a V max microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) equipped with SOFTMax version 2.0 software and an IBM Personal System 2 Model 30/286 PC. Samples and standards (minimum of 5 standard concentrations) were run in duplicate or triplicate. The concentration was determined by log-logit fit of concentration of standard versus optical density as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Devices). The clots were analyzed according to previously published procedures (45Tamaki T. Aoki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 661: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as modified by our laboratory. The insoluble clotted samples were washed 2–3 times with 1 ml of 0.15 mol/liter NaCl and then allowed to sit in the salt solution (1 ml) for 12–15 h so that additional soluble material within the clots could diffuse into solution. The clots were rinsed with H2O to remove salt, lyophilized, and weighed. The dry clots were solubilized in 4 mol/liter urea, 10% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by 5–15% SDS-PAGE. Products were visualized using a Coomassie Blue source or an α-FPB monoclonal antibody. Densitometry was performed on a Hewlett-Packard Scanjet 4C/T. Cross-linking results were expressed as a relative fraction of the dimer at each time point over the total (monomer + dimer). Purified Fg treated with thrombin releases three major forms of FPA: an unmodified form ADSGEGDFLAEGGGVR (FPA) which constitutes ∼70%, an NH2-terminal truncated form (des-Ala FPA) ∼10%, and a product in which Ser-3 is phosphorylated (P-FPA) ∼20%. This is followed by release of FPB (ZGVNDNEEGFFSAR) which should exist in this unmodified form ∼95%. Fig.1 A displays an HPLC chromatogram depicting the forms of P-FPA, FPA, and FPB. The three forms of FPA while not completely resolved are all identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig.2 A). A whole blood assay performed as described (“Experimental Procedures”) was analyzed for FPs (Fig. 1 B) following the procedure used for purified Fg. In contrast to the purified system an additional peak, subsequently identified as des-Arg FPB was present. Approximately 22 studies on blood from multiple individuals confirmed these results although quantitative variability was observed from individual to individual. Des-Arg FPB was formed at different rates depending upon the individual blood being tested.Figure 2MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry profile of isolated FPs. Panel A, shows the three forms of FPA:a) NH2-terminal cleaved des-Ala FPA (m/z, observed mass charge = 1471.75);b) full form FPA (m/z = 1540.56); and c) phosphorylated FPA (P-FPA) on the Ser-3 hydroxyl (m/z = 1621.68). Panel B shows the cleavage product seen in whole blood analysis, des-Arg FPB (d) (m/z = 1422.37) and its dimer (d*, m/z = 2867.85). Panel C shows full form FPB (e,m/z = 1556.48).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The identities of all Fg products was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 2) and amino acid analyses. Des-Ala FPA (Fig.2 A, a) shows a mass m/z = 1471.75, FPA (b) m/z = 1540.56, and P-FPA (c) m/z = 1621.68. Des-Arg FPB is seen in panel B (d) with a massm/z = 1422.37 and its double ion atm/z = 2867.85 (d*). FPB in seen in panel C (e) as a molecular ion of 1556.48. The differences in the values compared with the true molecular ion mass are due to the addition of Na+ present. Since MALDI-TOF is not a quantitative tool the relative areas of the peaks cannot be used for quantitation. Coagulation of blood from normal volunteers after initiation with 12.5 pmol/liter TF was quenched at time points from 0 to 20 min. In Fig. 3, for a typical individual the time points of overlaid HPLC chromatograms are illustrated as 0 (I), 5 (II), 10 (III), and 20 (IV) min. Clotting was visualized at 4 ± 0.2 min while the CTI control (no TF) clotted at 13.25 min. FPA release was complete by 5 min, FPB was observed at lesser amounts, with des-Arg FPB already observed by 5 min. Over time FPB levels decreased and des-Arg FPB levels increased, resulting only in des-Arg FPB by 20 min. Similar results were obtained with des-Arg FPB levels in 15 other whole blood analyses on normal donors initiated with 12.5 pmol/liter TF, where the CTI controls ranged from 12 to 24 min and clot times were between 3 and 4.2 min. The FPs were quantitated based upon calculated areas and standard curves were developed for FPA and FPB (Fig.4). Clot time (CT) is represented by an arrow shown at 4 ± 0.2 min. The maximum levels (15.8 μmol/liter) (-·-·-) of FPs which could be expected were calculated from the patients Fg levels (268 mg/dl) at the time of the blood draw. From this figure it is easy to see that (∼50%, 7 μmol/liter) FPA (▴) was present prior to clot time. This result is comparable to what has previously been seen in whole blood assays using commercial ELISA kits (25Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cawthern K.M. van't Veer C. Lock J.B. DiLorenzo M.E. Branda R.F. Mann K.G. Blood. 1998; 91: 4581-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FPB (♦) just starts to appear at clot time (<1 μmol/liter) and is quickly cleaved to des-Arg FPB (▪). Maximum FPB and des-Arg FPB levels are equivalent (∼5 μmol/liter). Both the final levels of FPA (∼10 μmol/liter) and FPB (∼5 μmol/liter) at 20 min are below the expected FP levels (∼16 μmol/liter), possibly an indication of other degradation processes not yet identified. FPA levels appear to reach a maximum at clot time (∼14 μmol/liter) and begin to decrease with time to a final level of ∼10 μmol/liter. Overall, combined levels of released FPB are not equivalent to FPA levels. The delayed release of FPB after clot formation along with decreased overall levels is suggestive that not all FPB is being cleaved from the Bβ-chain. Previous studies have observed the formation of des-Arg FPB (31Ebert R.F. Bell W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Koehn J.A. Canfield R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and noted that the addition of EACA to the Fg solution prior to thrombin addition prevents the formation of des-Arg FPB. To test whether the enzymatic degradation of FPB occurs during the process of blood coagulation or after sample quenching, the following experiments were performed. 1) EACA (50 mmol/liter) was added to the collecting tubes prior to the addition of blood; 2) EACA (50 mmol/liter) was added to the mixture of coagulation inh"

At the cellular level, this resulted in the synergistic co-aggregation of class II with cholera toxin, a marker of membrane rafts. The accompanying induction of intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation could be inhibited by treating cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a drug that chelates membrane cholesterol and thereby disperses membrane rafts. Signaling could also be inhibited by treating cells with the Src-family kinase inhibitor PP1. Together, these results show that the induced association of class II molecules with membrane rafts can contribute to their aggregation on the cell surface and mediate an association with intracellular protein-tyrosine kinases.

Together, these results show that the induced association of class II molecules with membrane rafts can contribute to their aggregation on the cell surface and mediate an association with intracellular protein-tyrosine kinases. The plasma membrane is known to contain distinct microdomains, which are enriched in glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, and specific membrane proteins (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 2Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Often referred to as membrane rafts, these domains can be distinguished from the rest of the plasma membrane by their relative insolubility in detergents and low buoyant density (3Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar).

He H.-T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Different membrane-associated proteins can partition into the raft fraction to varying degrees; for example, the FcεR I is highly enriched within rafts (11Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 16Stauffer T. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), whereas CD45 is excluded from them (12Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This partitioning can profoundly affect protein function, as has been demonstrated using site-directed mutagenesis to relocate the raft-associated signaling proteins Lck (9Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 166: 4983-4998Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and LAT (14Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) within the fluid phase of the plasma membrane. Both of these molecules are targeted to membrane rafts by palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that is a good predictor of such targeting. To date, however, it has not proved possible to predict the partitioning characteristics of transmembrane proteins based on their primary sequence alone. It was therefore of interest to determine experimentally the degree to which major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; GEM, detergent-insoluble membrane fraction; MES, 2[N-morpholino]ethane sulfonic acid; CT-FITC, cholera toxin B subunit, fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate; PP1, 4-amino-5-(4chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TCR, T cell receptor class II molecules partition into membrane rafts and the influence such partitioning has on class II function. MHC class II molecules are heterodimers composed of α and β polypeptides, both of which span the plasma membrane and have short cytoplasmic tails. High levels of class II are expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells, where they present processed exogenous antigen to CD4+ T cells. When recognition of the MHC-peptide complex by a specific T cell receptor (TCR) occurs, intracellular signals, including the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, are transduced in the T cell through the TCR (17Klausner R. Samelson L. Cell. 1991; 64: 875-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and in the antigen-presenting cells through the MHC class II molecules (18Corley R.B. LoCascio N.J.

Med. 1995; 182: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby class II initiates phosphotyrosine induction is currently unclear; surprisingly, the cytoplasmic tails of the class II polypeptides do not associate with any detectable tyrosine kinases (33Wade W.F. Davoust J. Salamero J. Andre P. Watts T.H. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 539-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the tails are in any case dispensable for the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation (22Andre P. Cambier J.C. Wade T.K. Raetz T. Wade W.F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34Harton J.A. Van Hagen A.E. Bishop G.A.

Such signaling by class II is, however, critically dependent on the sequence of the highly conserved transmembrane regions of both the α and β polypeptides (33Wade W.F. Davoust J. Salamero J. Andre P. Watts T.H. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 539-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34Harton J.A. Van Hagen A.E. Bishop G.A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggests that interactions between class II molecules and components of the plasma membrane are likely to be important for signaling. A precedent for intracellular signaling by proteins naturally lacking a cytoplasmic tail is afforded by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked surface molecules. Signaling by these molecules has been found to be dependent upon the integrity of membrane rafts (13Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Stockinger H. Horejsi V. Waldhausl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19242-19247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Edidin M. Stroynowski I. J.

J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5757-5764PubMed Google Scholar), to which they are targeted by means of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Signaling is thought to be dependent upon the aggregation of membrane rafts that accompany cross-linking of such raft-associated molecules. It is suggested that such aggregation facilitates the transactivation of raft-associated protein-tyrosine kinases and, hence, the initiation of intracellular signaling cascades (39Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). This led us to investigate whether membrane rafts play a role in the aggregation of MHC class II molecules and in facilitating an association protein tyrosine kinases. The human myelomonocytic cell line THP-1 was cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. To increase surface HLA-DR expression as required, cells at 106 ml−1 were cultured with human interferon (IFN)-γ (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Antibodies L243, CR3/43, and TU36, which recognize HLA-DR, were prepared as hybridoma supernatants. CR3/43 was affinity-purified using protein A-Sepharose from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 4G10, which recognizes phosphotyrosyl residues within peptides, was purchased from Upstate Biochemical Inc, Lake Placid, NY. HI30, which recognizes CD45, was from Pharmingen, San Diego, CA. Anti-caveolin was from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. Anti-Lyn rabbit antiserum was a gift of V. Tybulewicz (National Institute for Medical Research, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies for Western blotting were from Pierce. Texas Red conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies for immunofluorescence staining were from Jackson Laboratories, Maine, PA. R-Phycoerythrin-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antiserum, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), and cholesterol-loaded methyl-β-cyclodextrin were from Sigma Aldrich. 4-Amino-5-(4chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) (PP1) was a gift from Y. Xu and R. Munshauer (BASF, Bioresearch Corp., Worcester, MA). To alter the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane, cells were washed three times in RPMI and resuspended at 107 cells ml−1 in the appropriate mix of 10 mm MβCD/cholesterol-loaded methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 30 min at 37 °C. The “percent cholesterol” refers to the percent cholesterol-loaded methyl-β-cyclodextrin in the mix. Cell were then washed into ice-cold RPMI. To stimulate cells, they were resuspended in L243 or CR3/43 supernatant or HI30 at 2 μg ml−1 in RPMI containing 5% fetal calf serum for 15 min on ice. Controls were resuspended in RPMI containing 5% fetal calf serum or 2 μg ml−1isotype-matched control antibody. Cells were then washed in cold RPMI, resuspended in rabbit anti-mouse antiserum for 5 min at 37 °C, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 s before lysis. Stimulation by pervanadate was carried out for 5 min at 37 °C by adding 100× stock solution created 15 min beforehand by mixing 50 mm Na3VO4 and 100 mmH2O2 in water. PP1 stock at 10 mmin Me2SO was used at a final concentration of 10 μm for 30 min at 37 °C to inhibit Src-family kinases. For analysis of whole cell protein, cells were lysed on ice for 15 min in a standard lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 100 mm Na3VO4 and 1 μg ml−1 each of chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and cleared of insoluble matter by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. For the enrichment of glycolipid-enriched membrane fractions (GEMs), cells were lysed in MNE buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mmNa3VO4, and 1 μg ml−1 each of chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in MNE, placed at the bottom of a 40%, 30%, 5% discontinuous sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 h. The insoluble GEM fraction was recovered from the 30%, 5% interface, mixed with an equal volume of MNE buffer, and pelleted at 20,000 × g for 30 min. GEM pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer including 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and soluble proteins in the 40% sucrose layer were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli buffer. For detection of CD45, no β-mercaptoethanol was included. After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by standard Western blotting. Primary antibodies were used at 1 μg ml−1 or 1/1,000 for antisera, and secondary antibodies were used at 1/25,000. Staining was developed using Supersignal substrate from Pierce. For densitometric analysis, autorads were scanned using a Sharp 330 flatbed scanner, and results were analyzed using SharpTwain 1-D analysis software. THP-1 cells were pretreated with 10 mm MβCD for 30 min at 37 °C as appropriate, washed, then stained with primary antibody (neat L243 supernatant, purified HI30 at 2 μg ml−1 or isotype-matched antibody control) on ice for 15 min, washed once, stained with Texas Red conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody at 20 μg ml−1 on ice for 5 min, then warmed to 37 °C for a further 5 min. Cells were then washed in cold RPMI and fixed for at least 4 h in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells adhered to 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (TESPA) (Sigma)-coated coverslips were stained as appropriate with cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (CT-FITC) at 1 μg ml−1 for 10 min before washing and mounting and viewed with an MRC 600 confocal microscope. For dual color analysis, cells were excited at 488 and 568 nm, with FITC (green) and Texas Red (red) fluorescence detected simultaneously. All images represent Z-series pileups of 15–18 transverse sections acquired at 0.5-μm intervals, from the top of a cell to its center. To test whether HLA-DR (MHC class II) is associated with the GEM fraction of the plasma membrane, THP-1 cells were treated with cross-linking antibodies as appropriate, lysed in MNE buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and fractionated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. Three discrete subcellular fractions were isolated: the GEMs from the 5%, 30% sucrose interface, soluble proteins from the 40% sucrose layer, and a pellet from the bottom of the tube. These fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. HLA-DR molecules belonging to both the immature intracellular pool and the mature surface-bound pool were identified in the soluble fraction, the latter distinguished by their greater apparent molecular weight. No HLA-DR could be detected in the GEM fraction. However, when cells were treated with cross-linking anti-HLA-DR antibodies (either L243 or CR3/43 followed by a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody) before lysis, a significant fraction of the mature HLA-DR molecules were detected within the GEM fraction. (Fig.1 A). The immature, intracellular HLA-DR, being inaccessible to antibodies, showed no change in its distribution, although in some experiments a small fraction was constitutively associated with the GEM fraction, presumably reflecting an association with intracellular raft structures (3Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). HLA-DR could not be detected within the nuclear pellet under any circumstances (data not shown). As a control, we determined the fate of the transmembrane molecule CD45 following its cross-linking on the surface of THP-1 cells. In contrast to HLA-DR, CD45 could not be detected in the GEM fraction either before or after cross-linking, even when gels were heavily overloaded (Fig.1 B). This demonstrates that cross-linking with antibodyper se does not cause the indiscriminate entry of transmembrane proteins into the GEM fraction. Thus, cross-linking specifically enhances the partitioning of HLA-DR into GEMs. It is notable that, like other leukocytes (40Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-33748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), THP-1 cells expressed no detectable caveolin (data not shown). Thus caveolae, which can form when caveolin associates with membrane rafts (41Fra A. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), do not contribute to the GEMs isolated here (42Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). To test whether the association of HLA-DR with membrane rafts affects its distribution on the surface of intact cells, THP-1 cells were used that had been induced to express high levels of HLA-DR by exposure to IFN-γ for 48 h. First, membrane rafts were revealed by incubating paraformaldehyde-fixed cells with the CT-FITC. This binds to GM1, a glycolipid concentrated within membrane rafts (43Parton R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Because CT-FITC has pentameric valency for GM1 (44Merritt E.A. Sarfaty S. van den Akker F. LqHoir C. Martial J.A. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), it induced some aggregation of membrane rafts, giving a punctate staining pattern (Fig.2 a) similar to that reported elsewhere (39Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Next, HLA-DR was cross-linked on cells before fixation using the primary antibody L243 and a Texas Red labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Large patches of HLA-DR formed within 5 min of exposure to the secondary antibody at 37 °C, which co-localized with CT-FITC (Fig. 2 b). This indicated that most cross-linked HLA-DR was associated with membrane raft aggregates. These aggregates were larger than those seen on the surface of control cells, suggesting that association with cross-linked HLA-DR contributed to membrane raft aggregation. As a control, the patching of CD45, shown above to be excluded from GEMs, was investigated. Typically of a surface-bound protein, CD45 also patched following cross-linking with antibodies. However, CD45 patches did not co-localize with CT-FITC, and their presence had no effect on the aggregation of membrane rafts (Fig. 2 c). To determine whether membrane rafts conversely contributed to the patching of HLA-DR, cells were pre-treated with MβCD, a drug that chelates cholesterol and thereby disrupts membrane rafts (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). This had little effect on the distribution of CT-FITC on control cells (Fig.2 d), suggesting that GM-1 can be cross-linked by CT-FITC irrespective of membrane rafts. Treatment with MβCD did, however, reduce the size of HLA-DR patches as well as the degree of co-patching with CT-FITC (Fig. 2 e). This suggests that HLA-DR patches are qualitatively affected by their association with membrane raft aggregates. Consistently, the patching of CD45 was unaffected by MβCD (Fig. 2 f). When IFN-γ-treated THP-1 cells were exposed to cross-linking anti-HLA-DR antibodies, tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins was induced, which was maximal within 5–10 min. Similar results were seen using three different antibodies, L243, CR3/43, and TU36; isotype-matched control antibodies induced no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Qualitatively similar, but stronger, signaling was seen when the primary antibodies were hyper-cross-linked with a goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody. As a standard, cells were therefore stimulated by exposure to L243 on ice for 15 min, washed once in RPMI, then exposed to goat anti-mouse antibody for 5 min at 37 °C (Fig.3 A). To test whether phosphotyrosine induction by HLA-DR was dependent upon intact membrane rafts, cells were pretreated with MβCD to disperse the rafts. This inhibited the inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of all protein substrates detectable in total cell lysates by an average of 90% (Fig. 3, B and C). MβCD was not in itself toxic, since if it was partially loaded with cholesterol, its ability to inhibit phosphotyrosine induction was completely reversed (Fig. 3,B and C). Interestingly, excessive loading with cholesterol, which increased the size and protein content of the GEM fraction approximately 2-fold (data not shown), also inhibited the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation. This suggests that phosphotyrosine induction by HLA-DR is critically dependent upon the composition of the plasma membrane and that the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane of THP-1 cells is normally optimal for signaling. To test whether changes to the cholesterol content of cells compromised the integrity of phosphotyrosine signaling pathways, cells were stimulated with the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, which can activate intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation with no requirement for membrane-associated receptors. Pretreatment of cells with MβCD had no effect on their ability to respond to pervanadate, demonstrating that cholesterol modulation did not affect cell viability with respect to the ability to signal via phosphotyrosine induction (Fig.4). The above established that intact membrane rafts are required for the induction of all tyrosine phosphorylation events detectable in total cell lysates. Fractionation of HLA-DR-stimulated cells revealed that most inducible tyrosine phosphorylation occurred within the soluble fraction, although some occurred within the GEM fraction (Fig. 5 A). These events, undetectable in total cell lysates, could also be inhibited by MβCD (Fig. 5 A). There are therefore no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation events that are not inhibited by the disruption of membrane rafts, implying their involvement in the very earliest stages of HLA-DR induced phosphotyrosine induction. Following MβCD treatment, HLA-DR was undetectable in the residual GEM fraction (Fig.5 B), despite about 20% of its total protein remaining, as judged on gold-stained blots. This is consistent with the possibility that MβCD ablates phosphotyrosine induction by preventing the physical association of HLA-DR with residual membrane raft structures. The above suggested that tyrosine kinases physically associated with the inner leaflet of membrane rafts are likely to be involved in the initiation of HLA-DR-induced phosphotyrosine cascades. The prominent phosphorylated doublet enriched in the GEM fraction (Fig.5 A) was found by sequential Western blotting to have identical mobility to the Src-family tyrosine kinase Lyn (Fig.5 C). To test whether Src-family kinases (which are targeted to membrane rafts by N-terminal palmitoylation (45Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar)) play a role in HLA-DR signaling, cells were treated with the Src-family specific kinase inhibitor PP1 (46Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) prior to cross-linking HLA-DR with antibodies. This inhibited all inducible tyrosine phosphorylation events, including those within the GEM fraction, to below detectable levels (Fig. 6). Thus, Src-family kinase(s), most probably Lyn in THP-1 cells, are required for the induction of all detectable phosphotyrosine events induced by cross-linking HLA-DR. We have shown biochemically that cross-linking of HLA-DR induces its entry into GEMs, which are thought to be derived from membrane rafts. At the cellular level, this is accompanied by the co-aggregation of HLA-DR with membrane rafts. This contrasts with events following the cross-linking of CD45, which shows neither entry into GEMs nor co-aggregation with membrane rafts. It has been proposed elsewhere that raft aggregation could provide a mechanism to initiate signaling cascades through the clustering and transactivation of associated signaling molecules (39Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that the induction of intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation following HLA-DR cross-linking is entirely dependent upon the presence of intact membrane rafts, this being inhibited by MβCD. Using the specific inhibitor PP1, we have shown that raft-associated Src-family kinases are proximal mediators of HLA-DR phosphotyrosine induction. The activation of Src-family kinases has been shown to follow the aggregation of membrane rafts in other cell types (9Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 166: 4983-4998Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 11Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 47Field K. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A physical association between HLA-DR and raft-associated intracellular tyrosine kinases mediated by membrane rafts can explain several hitherto puzzling phenomena. First, class II can induce intracellular signaling in the absence of directly associated signaling molecules (33Wade W.F. Davoust J. Salamero J. Andre P. Watts T.H. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 539-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and even in the absence of its cytoplasmic domains (34Harton J.A. Van Hagen A.E. Bishop G.A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Second, the transmembrane sequences of both the α and β chains of class II molecules are critical for class II-mediated phosphotyrosine induction, which can be inhibited by point mutagenesis of these domains (34Harton J.A. Van Hagen A.E. Bishop G.A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the native transmembrane domains exhibit an unusually high level of conservation across species and between different class II loci. Third, reports that class II can associate with the cytoskeleton, even when cytoplasmic tails have been removed, were based on the assumption that insoluble proteins are necessarily associated with the cytoskeleton (48Chia C.P. Khrebtukova I. McCluskey J. Wade W.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3398-3407PubMed Google Scholar). Class II in these instances is, however, likely to be associated with GEMs, which unless separated on the basis of density, co-pellet with the cytoskeleton. Under no conditions could we find HLA-DR associated with the dense, cytoskeletally enriched pellet that forms below the 40% layer of a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Finally, class II is reported to lose lateral mobility following multimerization (49Wilson K.M. Morrison I.E. Smith P.R. Fernandez N. Cherry R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a characteristic of entry into membrane rafts (50Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 51Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that cross-linking of HLA-DR leads to its association with membrane rafts, which are initially small and dispersed. Further cross-linking leads to the synergistic aggregation of membrane raft aggregates and HLA-DR patches. This process is required for the activation of Src-family tyrosine kinases, which are constitutively associated with the membrane rafts. Activation of raft-associated tyrosine kinases leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates within the soluble fraction of the cell, which are likely to be members of an extensive tyrosine kinase cascade. Further analysis will determine their individual identities and functions. This model raises the question as to how HLA-DR may be induced to enter membrane rafts following cross-linking. One possibility is that the transmembrane domains of the HLA-DR polypeptides are re-orientated within the plasma membrane when class II molecules are dimerized or undergo higher multimerization. Multimerization is suggested to occurin vivo when MHC/Ag+ and TCR interact at sufficiently high concentrations, as has been demonstrated in vitro (52Reich Z. Boniface J.J. Lyons D.S. Borochov N. Wachtel E.J. Davis M.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Such reorientation could lead to the partitioning of (multimerized) class II into the raft phase of the plasma membrane. Partitioning could also result from conformational changes induced in individual HLA-DR heterodimers following engagement of the TCR. Extrapolating our findings to the likely course of events in vivo, we suggest that HLA-DR normally occupies the fluid phase of the plasma membrane, where it has a high degree of lateral mobility and has no association with intracellular tyrosine kinases. When engaged by the T cell receptor, HLA-DR bearing specific antigen may be induced to associate with membrane rafts, linking it to raft-associated tyrosine kinases including members of the Src family. Engaged T cell receptor is known to be actively aggregated at the site of cell-cell contact, driven by an actin-dependent mechanism (53Dustin M.L. Shaw A.S. Science. 1999; 283: 649-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 54Wülfing C. Davis M.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2266-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). This may lead to the passive aggregation of bound class II bearing specific antigen on the surface of the antigen-presenting cells. Significantly, we found that treating THP-1 cells with cytochalasin D to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton had no effect on the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by HLA-DR. Passive aggregation of HLA-DR may ensure that this process is dependent upon the specificity of the T cell receptor expressed by the interrogating T cell. Engaged, aggregated class II may then be laterally stabilized as the associated membrane rafts fuse together. Thus, only class II bearing cognate antigen for the specific TCR would be aggregated into a stable antigen presenting array. Raft aggregation may also facilitate the activation of raft-associated tyrosine kinases, as has been suggested elsewhere (39Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). We therefore suggest that membrane rafts may contribute to the function of MHC class II in two discrete ways: first, stabilizing localized aggregates, and second, mediating an association with intracellular tyrosine kinases. Future work will determine whether raft aggregation plays a critical role in antigen presentation by HLA-DR. We thank A. Bigley for support with confocal microscopy, V.

Following prolactin activation, both STAT5A and STAT5B were rapidly translocated into the nucleus and displayed a detergent-resistant, punctate nuclear staining pattern. Similar to prolactin induction, src activation resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of both STAT5A and STAT5B. However, nuclear translocation of only STAT5B but not STAT5A was observed. This selective nuclear translocation appears to be mediated via the carboxyl-terminal sequences in STAT5B. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant negative kinase-inactive mutant of JAK2 prevented prolactin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT5A and STAT5B but did not block src kinase activation and nuclear translocation of STAT5B. In co-transfection assays, prolactin-mediated activation but not src kinase-mediated activation of STAT5B resulted in the induction of a β-casein promoter-driven reporter construct. These results suggest that STAT5 activation by src may occur by a mechanism distinct from that employed in cytokine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in the selective nuclear translocation of STAT5B.

STAT5A and STAT5B can, therefore, participate in many different signaling pathways leading to cell growth and differentiation. The targeted knockout of the individual genes in mice has suggested that they play essential but often redundant roles in the physiological responses associated with Prl (25Teglund S. McKay C.

Despite their homology, there is some evidence suggesting that STAT5A and STAT5B may be differentially activated (26Meinke A. Barahmand-Pour F. Wohrl S. Stoiber D. Decker T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and even exhibit distinct DNA binding specificities (27Boucheron C. Dumon S. Santos S.C. Moriggl R. Hennighausen L. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33936-33941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, functional differences between STAT5A and STAT5B and their precise roles in normal mammary gland development and cancer are just beginning to be elucidated.In this study, we have compared the kinetics of DNA binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B following either Prl treatment or src/abl kinase activation with their subcellular localization determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. src kinase activation resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of both STAT5A and STAT5B, but unlike prolactin induction, nuclear translocation of only STAT5B but not STAT5A was observed. This selective nuclear translocation appears to be mediated via the carboxyl-terminal sequences in STAT5B and was not prevented but instead stimulated by a dominant-negative kinase-inactive mutant of JAK2. These observations establish another mechanism for STAT5 activation in response to the src/ablkinase family that results in the selective nuclear translocation of STAT5B and possibly activation of unique gene targets.RESULTSAlthough there have been numerous studies following the kinetics of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding as a function of cytokine activation, there are relatively few reports in which the subcellular distribution of STATs following activation by either cytokines or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as src has been investigated. In fact, little is known about the mechanisms governing nuclear import and export of STATs. To perform these studies, it was necessary to generate highly specific, affinity-purified antisera raised against either the carboxyl termini of STAT5A and STAT5B proteins or to the phosphotyrosine 700 epitope (Fig.1).Using these specific reagents, the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity was initially compared with the nuclear localization of STAT5A and STAT5B following both Prl and src activation. Transfection experiments with cDNA expression plasmids encoding STAT5A or STAT5B and the PrlR were performed in COS-1 cells. For thesrc experiments, both constitutively active and dominant negative src kinase constructs were employed in similar transient transfection experiments but in the absence of the PrlR.As illustrated in Fig. 2, Prl treatment as expected led to a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding within 30 min for both STAT5A (Fig. 2, lane 2) and STAT5B (Fig. 2, lane 9). STAT 5A and STAT5B tyrosine phosphorylation was detected using both the specific STAT5A phosphotyrosine 700(YP) antibody by direct Western blotting and by the more conventional method of immunoprecipitating with anti-STAT5A or anti-STAT5B followed by Western blotting with a general anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Prl induction of DNA binding activity of STAT5 has been shown previously to be accompanied by phosphorylation on Tyr700 (Tyr694 in sheep STAT5A (3Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar)). The results illustrated in Fig. 2 suggest that Tyr700 is the primary epitope on STAT5 for PY-20 and indicate that the kinetics of total tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B parallel the phosphorylation of Tyr700. For both STAT5A and STAT5B, the maximal level of tyrosine phosphorylation was observed after 30 min of Prl exposure and then appeared to decrease with similar kinetics. Direct Western blot analysis with carboxyl-terminal antibodies revealed that the total expression level of STAT proteins was relatively uniform in the transiently transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 2, second panel). However, in the case of STAT5B, the appearance of slower mobility hyperphosphorylated forms that can be resolved from the nonphosphorylated forms by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was observed to parallel the changes in tyrosine phosphorylation.To establish the time course of DNA binding activity for STAT5A and STAT5B, EMSAs were performed using whole cell extracts and a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to a 34-base pair region of the β-casein proximal promoter containing the STAT5 binding site (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lanes 1–5 andlanes 8–12, respectively). Similar to the tyrosine phosphorylation results, STAT5A and STAT5B DNA binding activity reached a maximum after 30 min of Prl induction and subsequently decreased at longer times of Prl treatment. As expected, the phosphorylation status of STAT5A and STAT5B in response to Prl induction generally correlated with their DNA binding activityTyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of STAT5A and STAT5B were also increased by a constitutively active src(srcK+, Fig. 2, lanes 7 and14) but were not observed following transfection of asrc kinase, dominant negative (srcK−, Fig. 2,lanes 6 and 7) construct. Direct Western blot analysis revealed phosphorylation of both STAT5A and STAT5B (Fig. 2, top two panels, lanes 7 and 14) on Tyr700 as a result of co-transfection of srcK+. Similar results were obtained from immunoprecipitation experiments for STAT5A and STAT5B (Fig. 2,third panel, lanes 7 and14). The DNA binding activity of STAT5A and STAT5B in response to src kinase activation was also demonstrated by EMSA (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lanes 7and 14). No significant differences in the phosphorylation status or DNA binding activity in response to src were detected between STAT5A and STAT5B using these techniques.Cytoplasmic-Nuclear Transport of STAT5A and STAT5B in Response to Prl InductionUsing indirect immunofluorescence, it was possible to examine if the decrease in STAT5A and STAT5B tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity (Fig. 2) with time after Prl treatment was correlated with the changes in subcellular localization of these transcription factors. In cells transfected with PrlR and STAT5A or STAT5B without Prl treatment, both STAT5A and STAT5B appear to be predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig.3, A and B, respectively). Using deconvolution confocal microscropy, some staining for both STAT5A and STAT5B could be detected in the nucleus in the absence of prolactin activation (data not shown). Similar observations using GFP-STAT5B constructs and confocal microscropy have been reported recently in human fibrosarcoma cells (35Herrington J. Rui L. Luo G. Yu Lee L.Y. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5138-5145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the nuclear staining observed in the absence of Prl in our studies was completely removed by extraction with O.5% Triton in CSK buffer, suggesting a loose association of nonactivated STAT5A and STAT5B in the nucleus. After 30 min of Prl stimulation, both STAT5A and STAT5B translocate into the nucleus and generate detergent-resistant complexes (Fig. 3,C and D, respectively). For both STAT5A and STAT5B, a specific punctate pattern of nuclear staining was observed that was resistant to Triton-CSK extraction.Figure 3STAT5A and STAT5B localization in response to Prl and src kinase activation. COS cells were transiently co-transfected with STAT5A (A, C, andE) or STAT5B (B, D, and F) and PrlR (A–D) or the constitutively active srckinase (E and F) and induced by Prl for 30 min (C and D). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed using anti-Stat5a (A, C, andE) and anti-Stat5b (B, D, andF) antibodies.

Thus, it was expected that STAT5A and STAT5B would also exhibit similar nuclear translocation in response to SrcK+ activation. However, surprisingly when transiently transfected COS cells co-expressing srcK+ and STAT5A or STAT5B were examined by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy, it was discovered that only STAT5B was localized in the nucleus following srcactivation. STAT5A remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, compareE (for STAT5A) and F (for STAT5B)). This was confirmed in experiments using double immunofluorescence staining in which STAT5A or STAT5B was localized using specific carboxyl-terminal antibodies with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Texas Red and srcK+ was localized with an anti-v-src antibody recognized with a corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. In cells co-transfected with cDNA encoding STAT5A and srcK+, predominantly yellow cytoplasmic staining formed by the combination of the green and red fluorescence was observed (Fig.4 A). In contrast, in cells co-expressing STAT5B and srcK+, green cytoplasmic staining for src and punctated red nuclear staining for STAT5B was observed (Fig. 4 B). The punctate nuclear pattern observed following src activation was similar to that seen for STAT5B after stimulation with Prl. Furthermore, a similar pattern of selective nuclear translocation for STAT5B activated by c-abl, another member of the same nonreceptor tyrosine kinase family was also detected (Fig. 4 C).Figure 4Nuclear translocation of STAT5A and STAT5B in response to src and abl kinase activation.

Based upon the structural analysis of the STAT proteins, the STAT5A/B chimeric construct was made in the linker domain between the DNA binding and Src homology 2 domains of STAT5A and STAT5B (36Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and presumably does not affect the ability of STAT5 to dimerize or form tetramers on the appropriate DNA response elements (37Verdier F. Rabionet R. Gouilleux F. Beisenherz-Huss C. Varlet P. Muller O. Mayeux P. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Chretien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This chimera was co-transfected in HeLa cells with the PrlR orsrcK+. In parallel, STAT5A and STAT5B were expressed with the PrlR or srcK+ as positive and negative controls. The control experiments showed similar patterns for STAT5A (data not shown) and STAT5B localization in HeLa cells (Fig.5, A–C) as observed previously in COS cells, confirming that the localization patterns did not result from marked overexpression of these proteins in COS cells. Remarkably, the chimeric STAT5A:B mutant translocated to the nucleus in response to both Prl induction and srcK+ activation (Fig. 5,E and F, respectively). This result suggests that STAT5B contains a unique sequence in its carboxyl terminus that could be responsible for nuclear translocation in response to srcactivation.Figure 5Nuclear translocation of STAT5B and chimeric STAT5A:B in response to Prl induction and srcactivation in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were transfected with STAT5B (A, B, and C) or STAT5A:B chimera (D, E, and F); STAT5B and STAT5A:B chimera were co-transfected with PrlR and treated with Prl for 30 min (B and E); STAT5B and STAT5A:B were co-transfected with constitutively active src kinase (C and F). A and D, no Prl treatment. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed using anti-Stat5b and v-src antibodies. Red, anti-rabbit Stat5b antibody; green, anti-mouse v-src antibody;blue, nuclear staining by DAPI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Association of STAT5 with src Kinase and the Role of JAK2 in Nuclear TranslocationAlthough src has been shown to associate with and phosphorylate STAT3 both in vivo andin vitro (38Cao X. Tay A. Guy G. Tan Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) it was unclear whether src could associate with and phosphorylate either STAT5A or STAT5B. Accordingly, immunoprecipitation with an anti-src antibody followed by Western blotting with an antibody that will recognize either STAT5A or STAT5B was performed using extracts prepared from transiently transfected COS cells. These experiments demonstrated thatsrc kinase is capable of in vivo association with both STAT5A and STAT5B (Fig. 6). However, this association appeared not to be dependent upon the enzymatic activity of src kinase, since it was observed in bothsrcK+ and srcK− cells. Furthermore, in vitro kinase assays failed to reveal an increase in STAT5A or STAT5B tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown) in the co-immunoprecipitated complex, suggesting that this was not a direct kinase-substrate interaction.Figure 6Co-immunoprecipitation of STAT5 isoforms withsrc kinase. Lysates of COS cells co-transfected with STAT5A (lanes 1–3) or STAT5B (lanes 4–6) with constitutively activesrc kinase (lanes 3 and 6) or dominant negative src kinase (lanes 2 and 5) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-v-src antibody. Cells transfected with constitutively active src kinase alone (lane 7) and nontransfected cells (lane 8) were immunoprecipitated as controls. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-Stat5 monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Having determined that the activation of both STAT5A and STAT5B bysrc kinase is not a direct enzyme-substrate reaction, we wished to investigate whether srcK+ might activate either STAT5 indirectly through the activation of JAK2. For this purpose, a dominant negative mutant of JAK2 consisting of a carboxyl-terminal truncation deleting the entire kinase domain (JAK829) (30Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T.C. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was utilized. STAT5A or STAT5B and PrlR or srcK+ were co-transfected in COS cells with or without JAK829. Whole cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescent analyses (Fig. 7). As expected (39Han Y. Doppler W. Rogers N.C. Stark G.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1180-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), overexpression of the kinase-inactive, dominant negative mutant of JAK2 blocked Prl-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B (Fig. 7, A and B, lanes 1–3). However, the JAK2 dominant negative mutant did inhibit block src-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A (Fig. 7 A, lanes 4 and5) or STAT5B (Fig. 7 B, lanes 4 and 5). Immunofluorescence analyses were consistent with these results. In cells co-transfected with STAT5A or STAT5B, PrlR, and JAK829 and treated with Prl for 30 min, exclusive cytoplasmic staining for both STAT5s was observed, similar to cells that did not receive Prl treatment (data not shown). In cells co-expressing STAT5B, srcK+, and JAK829, punctated nuclear staining similar to that seen in cells without JAK829 was observed (data not shown). The analysis of numerous fields was performed in order to calculate the percentage of cells displaying nuclear localization (Fig. 8). These results indicate that JAK829 significantly reduced the nuclear translocation of STAT5B induced by Prl, but not by src kinase. In contrast, in cells co-expressing STAT5B and srcK+, an increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization of STAT5B was detected in the presence of JAK829 compared with cells not expressing the dominant-negative JAK2 mutant. These results suggest thatsrc activation of STAT5B may occur by a mechanism independent of the conventional ligand-dependent activation of the JAK/STAT pathway (Fig. 10 and “Discussion”).Figure 7Phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B bysrc kinase is not inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of JAK2. COS cells were co-transfected with STAT5A (A) or STAT5B (B) and PrlR (lanes 1–3), constitutively active src kinase (lanes 4 and 5), and the dominant negative JAK2 mutant (lanes 3 and 5) and induced by Prl for 30 min as indicated (lanes 2 and 3). STAT5 was immunoprecipitated with an NH2-terminal anti-Stat5 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using the PY-20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The blots were then stripped and probed with the anti-Stat5 monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8Nuclear translocation of STAT5B bysrc kinase is not prevented by a dominant negative JAK2 mutant.

A, cytokine-dependent pathway. Binding of Prl to its membrane receptor activates the tyrosine kinase JAK2. This kinase catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5A and STAT5B. After tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT5 isoforms form homo- or heterodimers, which translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA response elements and activate transcription of target genes presumably facilitating the proliferation and terminal differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. B, cytokine-independent pathway. STAT5B is activated by src kinase via an indirect mechanism. After tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT5B homodimers translocate into the nucleus, where they may facilitate the selective regulation of genes involved in proliferation and/or apoptosis.View Large"

AP-2 and AP180 are the resident coat proteins of clathrin-coated vesicles in nerve terminals, and interactions between these proteins could be important in vesicle dynamics. AP180 and AP-2 each assemble clathrin efficiently under acidic conditions, but neither protein will assemble clathrin efficiently at physiological pH. We find that there is a direct, clathrin-independent interaction between AP180 and AP-2 and that the AP180-AP-2 complex is more efficient at assembling clathrin under physiological conditions than is either protein alone. AP180 is phosphorylated in vivo, and in crude vesicle extracts its phosphorylation is enhanced by stimulation of casein kinase II, which is known to be present in coated vesicles. We find that recombinant AP180 is a substrate for casein kinase II in vitro and that its phosphorylation weakens both the binding of AP-2 by AP180 and the cooperative clathrin assembly activity of these proteins. We have localized the binding site for AP-2 to amino acids 623–680 of AP180. The AP180/AP-2 interaction can be disrupted by a recombinant AP180 fragment containing the AP-2 binding site, and this fragment also disrupts the cooperative clathrin assembly activity of the AP180-AP-2 complex. These results indicate that AP180 and AP-2 interact directly to form a complex that assembles clathrin more efficiently than either protein alone.

AP-1 localizes to clathrin-coated vesicles budding from Golgi membranes, while AP-2 localizes to clathrin-coated vesicles budding from plasma membranes (26Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). AP180 localizes to clathrin-coated vesicles budding from presynaptic plasma membranes (28Takei K. Mundigl O. Daniell L. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Both AP-2 and AP180 also contain high affinity binding sites for inositides, the binding of which inhibits their ability to promote clathrin assembly (29Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol.

Mundigl O. Daniell L. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AP-2 and AP180 co-immunoprecipitate from coated vesicle extracts (14Kohtz D.S. Puszkin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7418-7425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and co-purify from various cell extracts (36Wang L.-H. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 37Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). However, since AP-2 and AP180 also both bind to clathrin, it is unclear if their co-immunoprecipitation and co-purification reflect an indirect interaction with clathrin in a ternary complex or a direct interaction between these two proteins. We show here that AP-2 and AP180 interact directly, and we map the binding site for AP-2 on AP180 to amino acids 623–680. Both the α and β subunits of AP-2 bind to this same region of AP180.We also find that AP180 and AP-2 together are more efficient at assembling clathrin than is either AP180 or AP-2 alone. The assembly activity of the two proteins together is significantly greater than can be accounted for by simply adding the assembly activities of each protein alone. Further, we show that disruption of the AP180/AP-2 interaction by a recombinant fragment of AP180 containing the AP-2 binding site inhibits the enhanced assembly activity of the AP180 plus AP-2 combination. This indicates that formation of the AP180-AP-2 complex is required to obtain the supra-additive effects on clathrin assembly observed when both of these proteins are added to an assembly reaction.Coated vesicles also contain an associated CKII, and clathrin light chain β has been shown to be a good substrate for this enzyme (38Bar-Zvi D. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9614-9621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP180 is known to be phosphorylated in vivo, from both labeling studies of cultured neurons (13Keen J.H. Black M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and phosphatase studies of mouse brain extracts (16Zhou S. Sousa R. Tannery N.H. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2144-2155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, AP180 has been shown to be phosphorylated in an assembly protein fraction under conditions in which CKII is stimulated (39Morris S.A. Mann A. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3354-3357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To extend these studies, we carried out experiments with purified proteins to determine if AP180 is a substrate for CKII. We find that there are three CKII phosphorylation sites in AP180, all within the central 42-kDa domain of the protein. Since this domain also contains residues important for clathrin assembly and AP-2 binding, we evaluated the effects of phosphorylation on these activities. While phosphorylation has no effect on the clathrin assembly activity of AP180 alone, it weakens the interaction between AP180 and AP-2. Apparently as a consequence of this, phosphorylation also reduces the assembly activity of the AP180/AP-2 combination by an amount consistent with its effect on AP180-AP-2 affinity.We propose a model in which AP180 and AP-2 associate to form a clathrin assembling complex. Phosphorylation, by modulating the affinity of AP180 for AP-2, may influence formation of this complex and thereby contribute to the regulation of clathrin assembly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsGlutathione-Sepharose 4B was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Monoclonal antibodies against α or β subunits of AP-2, monoclonal antibodies against the γ subunit of AP-1, anti-IgG, ATP, bovine α-casein, polylysine, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase agarose, trypsin, trypsin inhibitor, and the catalytic subunit of PKA were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was from DuPont. CaMKII and CKII were from New England BioLabs. PKC was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.Clathrin, AP-1, and AP-2 were purified from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles according to published procedures (5Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1989-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 40Pearse B.M. Robinson M.S. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1951-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 41Prasad K. Keen J.H.

Bacterially expressed mouse GST-AP180, GST-N33, GST-M42, GST-C58, GST-C16, and GST were expressed and purified as described previously (43Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10933-10939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The expression vector for the β2 subunit of AP-2 was kindly provided by Dr. Tomas Kirchhausen. Recombinant β2 was expressed and purified according to the published procedure (44Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody F1–20 against AP180 was prepared from the hybridoma cell line F1–20 (15Sousa R. Tannery N.H. Lafer E.M. Neuroscience. 1990; 34: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).MethodsPhosphorylation of AP180 and Its DomainsProteins (GST-AP180, GST-N33, GST-M42, GST-C58, GST-C16, and GST) were all dialyzed overnight into buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C and were clarified by centrifuging at 400,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.For all the reactions, 0.6 μm protein, 25 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in buffer A were used in a reaction volume of 50 μl. For phosphorylation by CKII, 100 μg/ml polylysine, 130 mm KCl, and 30 units/μl CKII in buffer A was added (except for the experiment shown in Fig. 10 B, where the amount of enzyme is indicated on the displayed plot). For phosphorylation by CaMKII, 2.4 μmcalmodulin, 2 mm CaCl2, and 15 units/μl CaMKII in buffer A were added. For phosphorylation by PKA, 10 units/μl PKA in buffer A was added. For phosphorylation by PKC, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol, and 0.25 milliunits/ml PKC in buffer A were added. In all cases, the reaction was carried out by adding kinases and incubating for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5× SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling for 5 min. The samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Protein amounts were determined by densitometric analysis relative to GST and bovine AP180 standards (Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI). The radioactivity in the labeled proteins was determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).Figure 10There are three CKII phosphorylation sites in the middle 42-kDa domain of AP180. A, phosphorylation of GST, GST-AP180, GST-N33, GST-M42, GST-C58, or GST-16 in the presence (+) or absence (−) of CKII was carried out. A representative autoradiogram is displayed. B, a quantitative analysis of the phosphorylation of GST-AP180 (closed circle), GST-M42 (open circle), and GST-C58 (cross) as a function of CKII concentration is plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Construction and Expression of Deletion Mutants of AP180A series of progressive deletion constructs expressing the carboxyl-terminal portion of AP180 were made by polymerase chain reaction using one of the following sense primers, 5′-AGCTTCGGTCGACTCGCATGCTCAGGAAATGAC-3′ (C42), 5′-AGCTTCGGTCGACTCGCCCCTCCAGTTCCCGCA-3′ (C38), 5′-AGCTTCGGTCGACTCGCATCCACTGCCTCTCCT-3′ (C27), 5′-AGCTTCGGTCGACTCACGCCAGTGACTCCAG-3′ (C22), and a common antisense primer, 5′-GCTGAAATGCGGCCGCTCTTACAAGAAATCCTT-3′. To construct M36 of AP180, two primers, 5′-AGCTTCGGTCGACTCTCTCCAGCCACAACTGTT-3′ and 5′-GCTGAAATGCGGCCGCTCTGTAGAAGGGGCCAT-3′, were used. To construct M11 of AP180, two primers, 5′-AGCTTCGGTCGACTCGCATCCACTGCCTCTCCT-3′ and 5′-GCTGAAATGCGGCCGCTCTGCAGGACTGGGTGG-3′, were used. To construct M5 of AP180, two primers, 5′-AGCTTCGGTCGACTCGCATCCACTGCCTCTCCT-3′ and 5′-GCTGAAATGCGGCCGCTCTGTAGAAGGGGCCAT-3′, were used. A restriction site of SalI was designed in all sense primers, and aNotI site was designed in all the antisense primers. In all the polymerase chain reactions, plasmid pGEX3X-F1–20 (AS15−) was used as the template (39Morris S.A. Mann A. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3354-3357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with SalI/NotI, and the digestion products were gel-purified, followed by subcloning into pGEX4T-1 expression vector at SalI/NotI sites. The constructs were first transformed into Escherichia coliJM109 and then introduced into E. coli BL21 for protein expression. The recombinant proteins were expressed and purified under the same conditions as described previously for GST-AP180 (39Morris S.A. Mann A. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3354-3357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the optimal induction time for GST-C22 is 2 h.Characterization of the AP180 and AP-2/AP-1 InteractionAll of the procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice unless otherwise indicated. Bovine AP-2 was dialyzed into buffer B (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) overnight and clarified by centrifugation at 400,000 × g for 10 min. 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with a 10 μmconcentration of either GST-AP180 or other GST-AP180 deletion fragments was mixed with 0.63 μm (final concentration) bovine AP-2 in buffer C (0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% gelatin, and 2 mm EGTA in buffer B) in a final volume of 200 μl. The mixture was incubated for 1 h with gentle rocking before the beads were pelleted in a microcentrifuge by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed three times with 500 μl of buffer C. Pelleted beads were resuspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody to the α subunit of AP-2 and detected by ECL (NEN Life Science Products). Data were quantitated using the Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics) to determine the percentage of AP-2 bound. GST served as the negative control. The interaction between GST-AP180 and AP-1 was measured utilizing the same assay. The interactions between the GST-AP180 fusion proteins and the β2 subunit of AP-2 or the α-ear domains of AP-2 were measured utilizing the same assay, except that 20 μmfusion proteins were coupled to the beads, and the final concentration of β2 subunit or the α-ear domains in the reaction was 4 μm. The inhibition of the AP180/AP-2 interaction by M11 was measured similarly, but the indicated amounts of M11 were preincubated with bovine AP-2 for 30 min before the mixture was added to the fusion protein-coupled beads.Preparation of Phosphorylated and Dephosphorylated Fusion Proteins for either AP180-AP-2 Binding or Clathrin Assembly Assays2.4 μm protein, 160 μg/ml polylysine, 100 μm ATP, and 32 units/μl CKII were mixed in buffer A in a final volume of 300 μl, and the reaction was incubated for 80 min at 30 °C. For proteins used in the AP180-AP-2 binding assays, the phosphorylated fusion proteins were incubated with 50 μl of pelleted glutathione-Sepharose beads by rocking for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes each of 500 μl of buffer B and used immediately. In each experiment, it was verified that the same amount of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins had bound to the beads. For proteins used in the clathrin assembly assays, the phosphorylated fusion proteins were incubated with 200 μl of pelleted glutathione-Sepharose beads by rocking for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes each of 500 μl of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0) and elution with 400 μl of buffer E (20 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0). Half of the eluate (phosphorylated GST-AP180) was dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The other half of the eluate was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 8.0, for 4 h and was added to insoluble calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-agarose at a ratio of 0.35 μg of protein/unit of phosphatase. The dephosphorylation was carried out at room temperature by rocking for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by gentle spinning to remove the phosphatase agarose. The dephosphorylated GST-AP180 was subsequently dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, for use in a clathrin assembly assay.As a control, a parallel phosphorylation reaction with the addition of 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was carried out under the same conditions in a volume of 50 μl to ensure that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was similar to that described in Fig. 10. The mock phosphorylated control proteins were incubated under identical conditions but without the addition of CKII.Preparation of CytosolAll of the procedures were performed at 4 °C. Fresh bovine brain tissue was mixed at a weight ratio of 1:2 with buffer B and blended for 3 × 20 s, followed by centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was further clarified by centrifugation at 125,000 ×g for 1 h and concentrated 5 times using 50% saturated ammonium sulfate in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. It was then suspended in buffer B and used at 7 mg/ml (final concentration) under the same conditions as used for pure AP-2 in the characterization of the AP180/AP-2 interaction.Partial Proteolysis of AP-2Partial digestion of AP-2 was carried out by mixing AP-2 and trypsin at a weight ratio of 1:500 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 40 min at room temperature. The digestion was stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor at a weight ratio of 5:1 relative to trypsin. 110 volume of 1m MES, pH 6.2 was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 2 h. Under these conditions the “trunk” of AP-2 aggregated, leaving the “ear” or appendage domains in a soluble form that was easily separated by centrifugation at 400,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (45Beck K.A. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4437-4441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Co-immunoprecipitation of AP-2 and AP180 with AP180 Monoclonal AntibodyClathrin-coated vesicles (4–5 mg), prepared according to Nandi et al. (46Nandi P.K. Prasad K. Lippoldt R.E. Alfsen A. Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6434-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were stripped of clathrin by incubation in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, followed by sedimentation at 400,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The partially decoated vesicles, which still contained APs were suspended in 5 ml of 4% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and incubated on ice for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 400,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was retained. The supernatant was applied to either an affinity column at room temperature made with affinity-purified monoclonal antibodies against AP180 (5 mg of mAb F1–20/ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B) or applied to a control Sepharose 4B column. Unbound protein was washed from the columns with 10 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, and bound protein was eluted from the columns with 50 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.3. The samples were electrophoresed on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by Western blot analysis with antibodies against AP180 and AP-2.Clathrin Assembly AssayFor assembly reactions carried out at pH 6.7, mock-phosphorylated GST-AP180, phosphorylated GST-AP180 (P-GST-AP180), M11, and clathrin were dialyzed overnight into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C, followed by clarification at 400,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The indicated assembly protein was mixed with clathrin, and the assembly was initiated by adding 110 volume of 1 m MES-NaOH, pH 6.7. The final conditions in the reaction were 0.5 μm clathrin, 0.1 mMES-NaOH, 9 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, and the indicated amounts of fusion proteins in a final volume of 200 μl. The mixture was incubated on ice for 45 min and then was centrifuged at 400,000 ×g and 4 °C for 6 min. The upper 80% of the supernatant was removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The percentage of clathrin assembly was determined by the relative depletion of clathrin from the solution before and after centrifugation and quantitated by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI). In the absence of GST-AP180, 3% of the clathrin was depleted by centrifugation.For assembly reactions carried out at pH 7.0, either GST-AP180, AP-2, or AP-2 combined with either GST-AP180, mock-phosphorylated GST-AP180, CKII-phosphorylated-GST-AP180, or dephosphorylated-phosphorylated GST-AP180 (alkaline phosphatase-treated CKII-phosphorylated GST-AP180) were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio of AP180 to AP-2 for 10 min, and the assembly was initiated by adding clathrin and 110 volume of 1m MES-NaOH, pH 7.0. The final conditions in all the experiments were 0.2 μm clathrin, 0.1 mMES-NaOH, 9 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and the indicated amounts of assembly proteins in a final volume of 200 μl. For experiments involving the inhibition of clathrin assembly by M11, the indicated amounts of M11 were mixed with bovine AP-2, followed by the addition of GST-AP180. The final concentrations of both AP-2 and GST-AP180 were 0.3 μm.DISCUSSIONThe finding that AP180 and AP-2 co-localize to the same budding CCV (28Takei K. Mundigl O. Daniell L. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) raises the question of why there needs to be two clathrin assembly proteins in the same CCV. It has long been argued that the cell uses APs to promote clathrin assembly to ensure uniformly sized cages and to ensure that the assembly reaction is efficient under physiological conditions (23Zaremba S. Keen J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 49Ye W. Lafer E.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Clathrin, in the absence of an assembly protein, will form irregularly sized cages but only under conditions of low pH and high calcium (23Zaremba S. Keen J.H. J.

These two fusion events were differentially sensitive to Ca2+, suggesting that they are controlled by different Ca2+-sensing mechanisms. Botulinum neurotoxin C (BoNT/C) treatment of the plasma membranes caused cleavage of syntaxin 2, the apical isoform of this Q-SNARE, but did not affect syntaxin 4, the basolateral isoform.

BoNT/C treatment of plasma membranes abolished granule-plasma membrane fusion, whereas toxin treatment of the granules reduced granule-plasma membrane fusion and abolished granule-granule fusion. Tetanus toxin cleaved granule-associated synaptobrevin 2 but caused only a small reduction in both granule-plasma membrane fusion and granule-granule fusion. Our results indicate that syntaxin 2 is the isoform that mediates fusion between zymogen granules and the apical plasma membrane of the acinar cell.

The pancreatic acinar cell provides an ideal model to study the molecular basis of exocytosis in non-excitable tissue (1Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). The action of secretagogues such as acetylcholine and cholecystokinin on receptors at the basolateral pole of these cells causes a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (2Kasai H. Li Y.X.

Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This in turn leads to fusion of the zymogen granules both with the apical domain of the plasma membrane and with each other (1Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the specific targeting of granules to the apical plasma membrane is illustrated by the fact that a breakdown in the polarity of secretion is associated with a serious clinical condition, acute pancreatitis (4Scheele G.A.

Gastroenterology. 1987; 92: 245-253Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar).It is now widely accepted that the biochemical machinery involved in fusing membranes together is highly conserved (reviewed in Ref. 5Ferro-Novick S.

In neurons, the synaptic vesicle-associated SNARE, synaptobrevin-VAMP, forms a complex with two plasma membrane-associated SNAREs, syntaxin and SNAP-25. These proteins bind together in a parallel manner (7Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) to form a four-helix bundle, with two helices contributed by SNAP-25 and one each by synaptobrevin and syntaxin (8Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). Further, preliminary evidence has been presented that the formation of the SNARE complex is by itself sufficient to bring the two lipid bilayers close enough together to cause fusion (9Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Originally, SNAREs were classified into v-SNAREs and t-SNAREs (6Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar) based on their location on either the vesicle (v) or the target (t) membrane. However, following the determination of the crystal structure of the neuronal SNARE complex (8Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar), an alternative classification into R- and Q-SNAREs was proposed, based on the contribution of either an arginine (R) or a glutamine (Q) residue to the ionic “0” layer at the heart of the SNARE complex (10Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). According to this new classification, synaptobrevin would be an R-SNARE and syntaxin and SNAP-25 would both be Q-SNAREs, and the basic requirement for membrane fusion would be the formation of a SNARE complex consisting of four helices (1R and 3Q) of which at least two are anchored in opposing membranes. One advantage of this new convention is that it deals more satisfactorily with homotypic fusion, such as that between pancreatic zymogen granules, where the distinction between “vesicle” and “target” is meaningless.The most persuasive evidence that the SNAREs are crucial to exocytosis in neurons is the demonstration that each of the SNAREs is a specific target for at least one member of the family of clostridial neurotoxins, which comprise tetanus toxin (TeNT) and the various serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNTs (11Schiavo G.

These toxins produce their pathophysiological effects by blocking neurotransmitter release from the nerves that become poisoned. All of the toxins are zinc endoproteases, and they are highly homologous with each other, especially in the region of their active sites (reviewed in Ref. 14Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As a consequence of their ability to cleave specific SNAREs at particular sites, they are being used widely as molecular scalpels to dissect the mechanism of membrane fusion in various tissues.The neuronal SNAREs are known to be prototypical members of SNARE families, which are growing rapidly (15Bennett M.K.

Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic acinar cell, synaptobrevin 2 is found on the zymogen granule membrane (18Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Foskett J.K. Trimble W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Edwardson J.M. Methods. 1998; 16: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and at least three syntaxin isoforms are also present (syntaxin 2 on the apical plasma membrane, syntaxin 4 on the basolateral membrane, and syntaxin 3 on the granule membrane (20Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)). SNAP-23, the non-neuronal isoform of SNAP-25 (16Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), has also been found on the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane (21Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Wong P.P.C. Klip A. Trimble W.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine how these various SNAREs operate to mediate exocytosis in the acinar cell, a simple functional system is required to which agents such as the clostridial toxins can be applied.It was shown several years ago (22Edwardson J.M. Vickery C. Christy L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1053: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Kitagawa M. Williams J.A. De Lisle R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G157-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Padfield P.J. Ding T.-G. Jamieson J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that acini permeabilized with the bacterial toxin streptolysin O secrete digestive enzymes in response to micromolar Ca2+. More recently, it was shown that TeNT treatment of these cells cleaved synaptobrevin 2 and also caused a reduction in the exocytotic response (18Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Foskett J.K. Trimble W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, permeabilized cell systems are still rather complex and do not permit, for example, manipulation of only one of the interacting membranes. We have developed an in vitro assay in which zymogen granules fuse with plasma membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner (19Edwardson J.M. Methods. 1998; 16: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 25MacLean C.M. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Edwardson J.M. An S. Jahn R. Cell. 1997; 90: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This assay provides greater flexibility than the permeabilized cell system and has already been used to demonstrate the effect of TeNT treatment of the zymogen granules on their ability to fuse with plasma membranes (19Edwardson J.M. Methods. 1998; 16: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here we show that zymogen granules undergo Ca2+-dependent fusion in vitro both with plasma membranes and with each other. In addition, by examining the effects of the BoNT/C and TeNT on membrane fusion, we provide new information about the SNAREs involved in these two membrane fusion events.DISCUSSIONWhen the dequenching assay for exocytotic membrane fusion was first introduced (25MacLean C.M. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) there was no evidence for an effect of Ca2+ on the extent of fusion. In the course of the present study, we found that the key to observing Ca2+-dependent fusion in vitro is the preparation of the membranes in buffers from which Ca2+is effectively absent (i.e. in the presence of EGTA). If the membranes are prepared in buffers containing Ca2+, then fusion occurs in a Ca2+-independent manner. This suggests that during membrane preparation, an inhibitor of fusion is being inactivated in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The identification of the mechanism involved in this process represents a major future goal of this work.In the acinar cell, zymogen granules normally fuse with the apical domain of the plasma membrane, where syntaxin 2 is the predominant Q-SNARE (20Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The observation that cleavage of syntaxin 2 by BoNT/C treatment of the plasma membranes results in a parallel inhibition of zymogen granule-plasma membrane fusion represents the first direct evidence that this Q-SNARE is, as expected, a major participant in this membrane fusion event. The fact that syntaxin 4, the predominant basolateral Q-SNARE, remains intact in the same experiment indicates that it plays no role in this fusion event, which again would be expected on the basis of its cellular location and the known polarity of secretion in the acinar cell. It has recently been suggested (21Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Wong P.P.C. Klip A. Trimble W.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in fact, that syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23, another basolateral Q-SNARE, might interact with synaptobrevin 2 to mediate the inappropriate fusion of zymogen granules with the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane that is a characteristic feature of experimental pancreatitis induced, for example, by hyperstimulation of the pancreas with the secretagogue cerulein (4Scheele G.A. Adler G. Kern H.F. Gastroenterology. 1987; 92: 245-253Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The ability of BoNT/C to cleave all of the syntaxin 2 must also mean, incidentally, that all of the apical membrane fragments present in the plasma membrane are in the form of either sheets or “inside-out” vesicles, which should be capable of fusion with zymogen granules.During exocytosis in the acinar cell, the fusion of zymogen granules with the apical plasma membrane is accompanied by fusion between the granules themselves, in a process known as compound exocytosis (1Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that these heterotypic and homotypic fusion events can both be reconstituted in vitro. Indeed, when R18-labeled granules are incubated with unlabeled plasma membranes, the dequenching observed is probably a result of both types of fusion occurring together (i.e. R18-labeled granules fusing with granules that have already fused with the plasma membrane). The homotypic component of fusion is likely to depend on syntaxin 3 on the granule membrane, and cleavage of this Q-SNARE might account for the 37% reduction in the extent of fusion caused by treatment of the granules with BoNT/C. Further, this figure might represent the contribution to the dequenching signal of granule-granule fusion. The fact that granule-granule fusion is less sensitive to Ca2+ than granule-plasma membrane fusion might reflect the situation in the cell, where compound exocytosis is seen predominantly at high levels of stimulation by secretagogues (4Scheele G.A. Adler G. Kern H.F. Gastroenterology. 1987; 92: 245-253Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Our results strongly support the notion that the role of syntaxin 3 is to mediate fusion between zymogen granules. It has been suggested that some homotypic fusion events, such as fusion between endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles in yeast (34Patel S.K. Indig F.E. Olivieri N. Levine N.D. Latterich M. Cell. 1998; 92: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), occur through the homo-oligomerization of Q-SNAREs between the two interacting membranes. The evidence for this phenomenon is the demonstration that inactivation of the Q-SNARE on one membrane completely blocks fusion. In contrast, homotypic fusion between yeast vacuoles operates at maximal efficiency when both interacting membranes contain R- and Q-SNAREs (35Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R.B. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In our experiments, cleavage of syntaxin 3 on one population of zymogen granules reduced fusion by about 50%, and cleavage of the Q-SNARE on both membranes was required to abolish fusion. These results are more compatible with a model in which syntaxin 3 interacts with a different binding partner on the other membrane.Our experiments show that synaptobrevin 2 plays only a minor role in exocytotic membrane fusion in the acinar cell (16%, in the case of granule-plasma membrane fusion). A partial (30%) inhibition of exocytosis in permeabilized acini after TeNT treatment has also been reported previously (18Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Foskett J.K. Trimble W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The situation is very different in the pancreatic beta cell, where there is a much stronger immunofluorescence signal for synaptobrevin 2 (36Baumert M. Maycox P.R. Navone F. De Camilli P. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and where Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis is abolished by TeNT treatment (37Regazzi R. Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Theler J.-M. Rossetto O. Montecucco C. Sadoul K. Weller U. Palmer M. Thorens B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We have looked for other synaptobrevin isoforms on the granule membrane (for example, the recently identified VAMP 7/TeNT-insensitive VAMP (28Galli T. Zahraoui A. Vaidyanathan V.V. Raposo G. Tian J.M. Karin M. Niemann H. Louvard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and VAMP 8/endobrevin (38Wong S.H. Zhang T. Xu Y. Subramaniam V.N. Griffiths G. Hong W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)) but failed to find them (data not shown). We are therefore left with the problem of identifying the major R-SNARE involved in exocytotic membrane fusion in the acinar cell. Whether another so far unidentified synaptobrevin isoform is responsible or whether a totally new mechanism needs to be proposed remains to be established. The pancreatic acinar cell provides an ideal model to study the molecular basis of exocytosis in non-excitable tissue (1Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). The action of secretagogues such as acetylcholine and cholecystokinin on receptors at the basolateral pole of these cells causes a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (2Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 3Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This in turn leads to fusion of the zymogen granules both with the apical domain of the plasma membrane and with each other (1Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the specific targeting of granules to the apical plasma membrane is illustrated by the fact that a breakdown in the polarity of secretion is associated with a serious clinical condition, acute pancreatitis (4Scheele G.A. Adler G. Kern H.F. Gastroenterology. 1987; 92: 245-253Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is now widely accepted that the biochemical machinery involved in fusing membranes together is highly conserved (reviewed in Ref. 5Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion apparently requires the formation of a complex between SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor; SNAP-25, synaptosome-associated protein of molecular weight 25,000; SNAP-23, synaptosome-associated protein of molecular weight 23,000; TeNT, tetanus neurotoxin; BoNT/C, botulinum neurotoxin C; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; R18, octadecylrhodamine; PT, 1,10-phenanthroline; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor; SNAP-25, synaptosome-associated protein of molecular weight 25,000; SNAP-23, synaptosome-associated protein of molecular weight 23,000; TeNT, tetanus neurotoxin; BoNT/C, botulinum neurotoxin C; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; R18, octadecylrhodamine; PT, 1,10-phenanthroline; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein proteins (6Söllner T.

The fact that syntaxin 4, the predominant basolateral Q-SNARE, remains intact in the same experiment indicates that it plays no role in this fusion event, which again would be expected on the basis of its cellular location and the known polarity of secretion in the acinar cell. It has recently been suggested (21Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Wong P.P.C. Klip A. Trimble W.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in fact, that syntaxin 4 and SNAP-23, another basolateral Q-SNARE, might interact with synaptobrevin 2 to mediate the inappropriate fusion of zymogen granules with the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane that is a characteristic feature of experimental pancreatitis induced, for example, by hyperstimulation of the pancreas with the secretagogue cerulein (4Scheele G.A. Adler G. Kern H.F. Gastroenterology. 1987; 92: 245-253Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The ability of BoNT/C to cleave all of the syntaxin 2 must also mean, incidentally, that all of the apical membrane fragments present in the plasma membrane are in the form of either sheets or “inside-out” vesicles, which should be capable of fusion with zymogen granules.During exocytosis in the acinar cell, the fusion of zymogen granules with the apical plasma membrane is accompanied by fusion between the granules themselves, in a process known as compound exocytosis (1Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that these heterotypic and homotypic fusion events can both be reconstituted in vitro. Indeed, when R18-labeled granules are incubated with unlabeled plasma membranes, the dequenching observed is probably a result of both types of fusion occurring together (i.e. R18-labeled granules fusing with granules that have already fused with the plasma membrane). The homotypic component of fusion is likely to depend on syntaxin 3 on the granule membrane, and cleavage of this Q-SNARE might account for the 37% reduction in the extent of fusion caused by treatment of the granules with BoNT/C. Further, this figure might represent the contribution to the dequenching signal of granule-granule fusion. The fact that granule-granule fusion is less sensitive to Ca2+ than granule-plasma membrane fusion might reflect the situation in the cell, where compound exocytosis is seen predominantly at high levels of stimulation by secretagogues (4Scheele G.A. Adler G. Kern H.F. Gastroenterology. 1987; 92: 245-253Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Our results strongly support the notion that the role of syntaxin 3 is to mediate fusion between zymogen granules. It has been suggested that some homotypic fusion events, such as fusion between endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles in yeast (34Patel S.K. Indig F.E. Olivieri N. Levine N.D. Latterich M. Cell. 1998; 92: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), occur through the homo-oligomerization of Q-SNAREs between the two interacting membranes. The evidence for this phenomenon is the demonstration that inactivation of the Q-SNARE on one membrane completely blocks fusion. In contrast, homotypic fusion between yeast vacuoles operates at maximal efficiency when both interacting membranes contain R- and Q-SNAREs (35Nichols B.J. Ungermann C. Pelham H.R.B. Wickner W.T. Haas A. Nature. 1997; 387: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In our experiments, cleavage of syntaxin 3 on one population of zymogen granules reduced fusion by about 50%, and cleavage of the Q-SNARE on both membranes was required to abolish fusion. These results are more compatible with a model in which syntaxin 3 interacts with a different binding partner on the other membrane.Our experiments show that synaptobrevin 2 plays only a minor role in exocytotic membrane fusion in the acinar cell (16%, in the case of granule-plasma membrane fusion). A partial (30%) inhibition of exocytosis in permeabilized acini after TeNT treatment has also been reported previously (18Gaisano H.Y. Sheu L. Foskett J.K. Trimble W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17062-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The situation is very different in the pancreatic beta cell, where there is a much stronger immunofluorescence signal for synaptobrevin 2 (36Baumert M. Maycox P.R. Navone F. De Camilli P. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and where Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis is abolished by TeNT treatment (37Regazzi R. Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Theler J.-M. Rossetto O. Montecucco C. Sadoul K. Weller U. Palmer M. Thorens B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We have looked for other synaptobrevin isoforms on the granule membrane (for example, the recently identified VAMP 7/TeNT-insensitive VAMP (28Galli T. Zahraoui A. Vaidyanathan V.V. Raposo G. Tian J.M. Karin M. Niemann H. Louvard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and VAMP 8/endobrevin (38Wong S.H. Zhang T. Xu Y. Subramaniam V.N. Griffiths G. Hong W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)) but failed to find them (data not shown). We are therefore left with the problem of identifying the major R-SNARE involved in exocytotic membrane fusion in the acinar cell. Whether another so far unidentified synaptobrevin isoform is responsible or whether a totally new mechanism needs to be proposed remains to be established. When the dequenching assay for exocytotic membrane fusion was first introduced (25MacLean C.M. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) there was no evidence for an effect of Ca2+ on the extent of fusion. In the course of the present study, we found that the key to observing Ca2+-dependent fusion in vitro is the preparation of the membranes in buffers from which Ca2+is effectively absent (i.e. in the presence of EGTA). If the membranes are prepared in buffers containing Ca2+, then fusion occurs in a Ca2+-independent manner. This suggests that during membrane preparation, an inhibitor of fusion is being inactivated in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The identification of the mechanism involved in this process represents a major future goal of this work. In the acinar cell, zymogen granules normally fuse with the apical domain of the plasma membrane, where syntaxin 2 is the predominant Q-SNARE (20Gaisano H.Y. Ghai M. Malkus P.N. Sheu L. Bouquillon A.

The binding of hCAP-18 to lipoproteins suggests that lipoproteins may play an important role as a reservoir of this antimicrobial protein. hCAP-18 belongs to the cathelicidins, a group of antimicrobial peptides found in mammalian neutrophils (1Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The cathelicidins share a highly conserved N-terminal prosequence that is homologous to cathelin, a protein first isolated from porcine leukocytes (2Ritonja A. Kopitar M. Jerala R. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The active antimicrobial domains of the cathelicidins generally reside in their C termini. The antimicrobial activity is observed only when the C-terminal domain is cleaved from the holoprotein (3Scocchi M. Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Gennaro R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Zanetti M. Litteri L. Griffiths G. Gennaro R. Romeo D. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 4295-4300PubMed Google Scholar, 5Panyutich P. Shi J. Boutz P.L. Zhao C. Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 978-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C termini of the cathelicidins show great variability in amino acid sequence, but they are all highly cationic and hydrophobic. The antimicrobial part of many cathelicidins, including the C terminus of hCAP-18 (also named LL-37), has been shown to bind lipopolysaccharide (6Larrick J.W. Michimasa H. Balint R.F. Lee J. Zhong J. Wright S.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Porcine and bovine neutrophils contain a variety of cathelicidins, whereas hCAP-18 is the only cathelicidin identified in humans (6Larrick J.W. Michimasa H. Balint R.F. Lee J. Zhong J. Wright S.C. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Agerberth B. Gunne H. Odeberg J. Kogner P. Boman H.G. Gudmundsson G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). hCAP-18 is a major protein of the specific granules of human neutrophils (9Sørensen O. Arnljots K. Cowland J.B. Bainton D.F. Borregaard N. Blood. 1997; 90: 2796-2803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but is also present in squamous epithelia (10Frohm Nilsson M. Sandstedt B. Sørensen O. Weber G. Borregaard N. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2561-2566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in keratinocytes during inflammatory skin diseases (11Frohm M. Agerberth B. Ahangari G. Ståhle-Bäckdahl M. Lidén S. Wigzell H. Gudmundsson G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15258-15263Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Transcripts for hCAP-18 have been found in lung tissue by in situhybridization (12Bals R. Wang X. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9541-9546Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the relative plasma levels of specific granule proteins from neutrophils are very low compared with the levels in circulating neutrophils (<1%) (13Lollike K. Kjeldsen L. Sengeløv H. Borregaard N. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1995; 9: 159-164PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the concentration of hCAP-18 in plasma is ∼1.2 μg/ml, which is >20% of the amount present in circulating neutrophils (14Sørensen O. Cowland J.B. Askaa J. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 206: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In general, neutrophils are activated to release their granule proteins only when present outside the circulation. Thus, degranulation is unlikely to be the cause of this high plasma level of hCAP-18 since other granule proteins localized in the same granule subset would be expected to have equally high plasma levels as hCAP-18. This is not the case. Thus, a specific mechanism must exist to sequester hCAP-18 in the circulation and provide the relatively high concentration of this pro-bactericidal protein in plasma. Since hCAP-18 partitions mainly in the hydrophobic phase during Triton X-114 phase separation (8Cowland J.B. Johnsen A.H. Borregaard N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), we reasoned that hCAP-18 might partition into lipoprotein particles, possibly in the same way as the bactericidal C terminus of hCAP-18 is believed to insert into the phospholipid bacterial membrane and cause bacterial lysis. In the following, we demonstrate that hCAP-18 is found in plasma complexed with lipoproteins, and we suggest that lipoproteins may serve as a reservoir of a pro-bactericidal substance in plasma. Blood was obtained from healthy volunteers and used to prepare human plasma anticoagulated with EDTA. Specific rabbit anti-hCAP-18 antibodies were generated by immunization of rabbits with recombinant hCAP-18 (14Sørensen O. Cowland J.B. Askaa J. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 206: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (16Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44969) Google Scholar) were performed according to the instructions given by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) were blocked for 1 h with 5% skimmed milk in PBS after the transfer of proteins from 14% polyacrylamide gels. For visualization of hCAP-18, the polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were incubated overnight with protein A-purified rabbit anti-hCAP-18 antibodies. The following day, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with peroxidase-conjugated porcine antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulins (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and visualized by diaminobenzidine/metal concentrate and Stable Substrate Buffer (Pierce). Human neutrophils were isolated from freshly prepared buffy coats as described (17Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Briefly, after sedimentation with 2% dextran T-500 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in isotonic NaCl, the leukocyte-rich supernatant was pelleted and resuspended in saline for subsequent centrifugation on Lymphoprep (Nycomed Pharma A/S, Oslo, Norway) at 400 ×g for 30 min for removal of lymphocytes and monocytes. The remaining erythrocytes were lysed in ice-cold water for 30 s. Tonicity was restored by the addition of 1 volume of 1.8% NaCl. The cells were washed once and resuspended in the desired buffer. All steps were carried out at 4 °C, except sedimentation in dextran, which was carried out at room temperature. Neutrophils were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation after the addition of 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Sigma). The post-nuclear supernatant was loaded on a three-layer Percoll gradient (1.05/1.09/1.12 g/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (18Kjeldsen L. Sengeløv H. Lollike K. Nielsen M.H. Borregaard N. Blood. 1994; 6: 1640-1649Crossref Google Scholar) and centrifuged for 30 min at 37,000 ×g. This resulted in four visible bands. Starting at the bottom, the bands were designated the α-band, which contains the azurophil granules; the β1-band, which contains the specific granules; the β2-band, which contains the gelatinase granules; and the γ-band, which contains the plasma membranes and the secretory vesicles. The β1-band containing specific granules was harvested, and the Percoll removed by ultracentrifugation. The granules were lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Heidelberg, Germany), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 100 kalikrein inhibitory units/ml aprotinin (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), 100 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and 1 mm EDTA (Sigma). The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to an affinity chromatography column with anti-hCAP-18 antibodies immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. The column was washed extensively, and the bound protein was eluted with 0.2 m glycine HCl (pH 2.5). The purity of the eluted protein was ascertained by SDS-PAGE. Isolated neutrophils from freshly prepared buffy coats were resuspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate solution (10 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.95 mmCaCl2, and 5 mm glucose) at a concentration of 3 × 108 cells/ml. Cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min and then stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) for 20 min at 37 °C. The stimulation was stopped by placing the cells on ice. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the exocytosed material was harvested and stored at −20 °C until further use. A recombinant form of cathelin, the N-terminal part of hCAP-18, was produced using the baculovirus expression vector system. The cDNA for the cathelin part of hCAP-18 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from a human bone marrow cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using specific primers and was cloned into the pAcGP67(b) vector (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The sequence of the construct was checked by DNA sequencing. Recombinant protein was produced by Sf9 cells (Pharmingen) after cotransfection of the cells with recombinant pAcGP67(b) and BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen). The recombinant protein was harvested from the supernatant of the infected Sf9 cells and purified by affinity chromatography as described above for native hCAP-18. SDS-PAGE and subsequent staining with Coomassie Blue of the purified protein showed a single band of the expected molecular mass. This band reacted with anti-hCAP-18 antibodies in immunoblotting. Recombinant hCAP-18 was produced and purified as described (14Sørensen O. Cowland J.B. Askaa J. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 206: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Fragments of hCAP-18, exocytosed from neutrophils after stimulation with ionomycin, were affinity-purified on an anti-hCAP-18 antibody column. The eluted material was subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column using fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound material was eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). One peak containing a 14-kDa protein was eluted at 0.2m NaCl. The sample was concentrated on a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and subjected to gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was re-purified and desalted by reverse-phase HPLC employing a Vydac C4 column (2.1 × 150 mm) equilibrated with 10% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) and eluted with a 1%/min gradient from solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to solvent B. An aliquot was analyzed by mass spectrometry (see below) using horse myoglobin as an internal standard, whereas the remainder was reduced and derivatized with iodoacetamide, as described by Matsudaira (19Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, New York1989: 20-23Google Scholar), followed by HPLC purification as described above. The derivatized cathelin was digested with endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. The resulting fragments were separated by HPLC on a Vydac C8 column (2.1 × 150 mm) using the solvents described above. Peak fractions were collected manually. Intact cathelin and proteolytic fragments were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry in a Biflex instrument (Bruker-Franzen) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Sequence analysis was performed on a 494 A Procise Protein Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Immunodiffusion of affinity-purified hCAP-18 from plasma was carried out as described by Ouchterlony and Nilsson (20Ouchterlony Ö. Nilsson L.-A. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. 6. Blackwell Publishers, Oxford1986: 32.1-32.50Google Scholar). LDL was precipitated from plasma as described (21Finley P.R. Schifman R.B. Williams R.J. Lichti D.A. Clin. Chem. 1978; 24: 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Plasma (0.5 ml) was mixed with 0.05 ml (10 g/liter) of dextran sulfate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.5 mMgCl2 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected manually, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. Plasma was adjusted to densities of 1.060 and 1.215 by the addition of solid KBr. The 350-μl sample was centrifuged in an Airfuge at 100,000 × g for 2.5 h as described (22Bronzert T.J. Brewer Jr., H.B. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2089-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Fractions of 100 μl were collected manually from the top and the bottom, respectively, for analysis of plasma proteins as described below. The density of plasma was adjusted to 1.215 by the addition of solid KBr. Samples of 400 μl were centrifuged for 28 h in an Airfuge at 100,000 × g. Delipidated plasma (200 μl) was collected from the bottom of the tube with a syringe to prevent contamination with lipoproteins from the top phase. Delipidated plasma was dialyzed against PBS to remove the KBr before further use. IgG, IgM, IgA, apolipoprotein A-I (a marker of HDL), apolipoprotein B (a marker of VLDL and LDL), and albumin were quantitated by a semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The samples were diluted in 50 mmNa2CO3/NaHCO3 buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated in 96-well flat-bottom immunoplates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) overnight at 4 °C. Unspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 200 μl/well dilution buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 3 mmKCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4/KH2PO4, 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2)) for 1 h. Rabbit antibodies (Dako) against the above-mentioned antigens were diluted 2000-fold in dilution buffer and incubated for 2 h. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Dako) were diluted 1000-fold in dilution buffer and incubated for 1 h. The plates were washed three times in wash buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4/KH2PO4, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2)) after each incubation using a Microwash-II (Skatron, Roskilde). The plates were washed once in substrate buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate and 0.1 m citric acid (pH 5.0)) prior to color development and then incubated with substrate buffer containing 0.04% o-phenylenediamine (Kem-En-Tec, Copenhagen, Denmark) and 0.03% H2O2. 100 μl were added to each well at each incubation step unless otherwise stated. The color development was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m H2SO4; absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a Multiscan Plus ELISA Reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland); and the concentrations are expressed as absorbance units (read at 492 nm). An arbitrary standard of diluted plasma was used in the experiments with immunoprecipitations and delipidation of plasma. hCAP-18 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (14Sørensen O. Cowland J.B. Askaa J. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 206: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Plasma was diluted with 1 volume of PBS. A 200-μl sample was applied to a Superose 12 column. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed for their content of hCAP-18, apolipoproteins B and A-I, and IgA. Molecular mass standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and endogenous IgA were used to estimate the molecular sizes of the plasma proteins investigated. Antibodies against apolipoproteins A-I and B, normal rabbit immunoglobulins, and hCAP-18 were immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose. Plasma was diluted 200-fold in PBS, and 400 μl were incubated with 40 μl of antibodies coupled to Sepharose. The Sepharose particles were pelleted by centrifugation after 4 h of incubation at room temperature. The supernatants were aspirated, and the pellets were washed three times in PBS before elution with glycine HCl (0.2 m, pH 2.5). The Sepharose beads were pelleted again, and the eluted material was aspirated and neutralized by the addition of 2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8). Protein concentrations were measured in the supernatant and pellet after immunoprecipitation. The fractions containing the highest concentration of hCAP-18 after gel filtration of plasma (fractions 17 and 23) were diluted 5-fold in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. When hCAP-18 isolated from the specific granules of neutrophils was applied to molecular sieve chromatography on a Superose 12 column, a major peak of hCAP-18 was found in fraction 29 (∼15–30 kDa) as expected for monomeric hCAP-18. When isolated hCAP-18 was subjected to chromatography in the presence of HSA, a minor high molecular mass peak of hCAP-18 was observed in fraction 22 (Fig.1 A). When human plasma was subjected to gel filtration, two major high molecular mass peaks of hCAP-18 were observed at fraction 17 (void volume) and fraction 22 (150 kDa), and no hCAP-18 was found at 15–30 kDa (Fig. 1 A). This indicates that the high molecular mass complexes of hCAP-18 found in plasma were not caused by self-aggregation of hCAP-18. When plasma was separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions, followed by immunoblotting with anti-hCAP-18 antibodies, the only band observed was at the expected molecular mass of 18 kDa (14Sørensen O. Cowland J.B. Askaa J. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 206: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This indicates that hCAP-18 is bound noncovalently to a high molecular mass component present in plasma. To identify the nature of these high molecular mass complexes, hCAP-18 was isolated from plasma by affinity chromatography using anti-hCAP-18 antibodies. The resulting eluate contained several proteins, including hCAP-18 and apolipoproteins, as judged by immunodiffusion and SDS-PAGE (data not shown). It has previously been found that hCAP-18 from neutrophil granules is very hydrophobic and partitions into the Triton-rich (hydrophobic) phase during phase separation of neutrophil granules with Triton X-114 (8Cowland J.B. Johnsen A.H. Borregaard N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that hCAP-18 might be associated with lipoproteins. Analysis of the fractions obtained by gel filtration of plasma showed that the low molecular mass peak of hCAP-18 co-localized with apolipoprotein A-I and that the high molecular mass peak co-localized with apolipoprotein B (Fig. 1 B). To investigate this further, lipoproteins were isolated from plasma, and their content of hCAP-18 was determined. 80% of hCAP-18 and almost 100% of apolipoprotein B, but no IgG, IgM, albumin, or apolipoprotein A-I present in plasma, coprecipitated with LDL/VLDL (by the dextran sulfate method) (Fig. 2 A). To ensure that hCAP-18 itself is not precipitated by this method, a sample of purified hCAP-18 was precipitated under the same conditions. No significant precipitation of hCAP-18 was found (Fig.2 B). Ultracentrifugation was used to further examine the association of plasma hCAP-18 with lipoproteins. When plasma was subjected to ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.060, VLDL and LDL were found in the top fraction, and HDL was found in the bottom fraction; hCAP-18 was found in both the HDL- and LDL/VLDL-enriched fractions (data not shown). When the density was increased to 1.215, >95% of hCAP-18 was found in the top fraction, together with VLDL, LDL, and HDL (Fig. 3). Common plasma proteins like IgG and albumin were more evenly distributed in the fractions at all densities examined. Thus, hCAP-18 in plasma was found to partition with lipoproteins obtained by two different separation procedures. As an additional control, plasma was delipidated through a 28-h ultracentrifugation after adjustment of the density to 1.215 with solid KBr. Less than 1% of the original concentration of hCAP-18 was found in plasma after delipidation, whereas the concentrations of the common plasma proteins like albumin, IgG, and IgM were increased (TableI). A small amount of hCAP-18 was incubated with delipidated plasma for 2 h at 37 °C. hCAP-18 in delipidated plasma was then subjected either to gel filtration or to ultracentrifugation (after adjustment of the density to 1.215). In the gel filtration experiment, exogenous hCAP-18 was found in the low molecular mass fractions (Fig. 1 C). Following ultracentrifugation of the delipidated plasma, the added hCAP-18 was present at the same concentrations in the top and bottom fractions (Table I), as expected when no formation of complexes takes place.Table IUltracentrifugation of plasma (d = 1.215)FractionhCAP-18ApoA-IApoBAlbuminIgGIgMhCAP-18 in delipidated plasmaBottom fraction0.37.21.683.168.554.249.9Middle fraction35.919.622.91329.543.525Top fraction63.873.275.53.922.325.2All concentrations are given as percent of the total amount.

Open table in a new tab All concentrations are given as percent of the total amount. The volume of the samples was 400 μl. After centrifugation, 200 μl were collected from the bottom (bottom fraction) and 100 μl from the top (top fraction); the remaining 100 μl were the middle fraction. The bottom fraction represents delipidated plasma. In the last column, hCAP-18 was incubated with delipidated plasma (dialyzed against PBS), followed by adjustment of the density and ultracentrifugation. To further substantiate the association of hCAP-18 with lipoproteins in plasma, immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies against hCAP-18, apolipoprotein A-I (HDL), and apolipoprotein B (VLDL and LDL). 46% of hCAP-18 was found in the apolipoprotein B precipitate (n = 4, S.D. = 10.5), and 17.3% was found in the apolipoprotein A-I precipitate (n = 4, S.D. = 12.2). It was not possible, however, to immunoprecipitate all of the lipoproteins from plasma without increasing the antibody concentration to an extent that resulted in high unspecific precipitation. No hCAP-18 was found after precipitation with preimmune rabbit immunoglobulins, whereas >95% of hCAP-18 was precipitated with anti-hCAP-18 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of hCAP-18 present in plasma resulted in coprecipitation of 30% of LDL/VLDL (n = 4, S.D. = 15.2) and 12.4% of HDL (n = 4, S.D. = 10.8), indicating that not all lipoproteins in plasma are associated with hCAP-18. The association of hCAP-18 with apolipoproteins during gel filtration of plasma was investigated by immunoprecipitation of the fractions that contained peak concentrations of hCAP-18. No hCAP-18 was precipitated from fraction 17 (void volume), but 48.3% (n = 4, S.D. = 10.3) of hCAP-18 was precipitated with anti-apolipoprotein A-I antibodies from fraction 23 (150 kDa). 72.9% of hCAP-18 in fraction 17 was precipitated with anti-apolipoprotein B antibodies (n = 4, S.D. = 19.8), and 40.5% was precipitated in fraction 23 (n = 3, S.D. = 11.5). All of apolipoproteins A-I and B were precipitated, respectively. The results of the specific lipoprotein isolation and the immunoprecipitation indicate that 80% of hCAP-18 is bound to LDL or VLDL. The 20% of hCAP-18 in plasma that is not isolated with LDL/VLDL-specific precipitation is bound to HDL and represents the amount of hCAP-18 that was precipitated with anti-lipoprotein A-I antibodies in fractions with a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa after gel filtration of plasma. To study the nature of the binding between lipoproteins and hCAP-18, gel filtration of plasma was performed either with 3 m KSCN or at pH 4.5. The high molecular mass complexes were not dissociated by 3m KSCN (Fig. 4) or by lowering the pH to 4.5. This indicates that the binding of hCAP-18 to lipoproteins in plasma is not due to electrostatic interactions, but is caused by hydrophobic interactions. Different amounts of hCAP-18 purified from neutrophils were added to EDTA-treated plasma and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by gel filtration. The fractions were subsequently analyzed for their content of hCAP-18. More than 85% of hCAP-18 was still found in the high molecular mass complexes even when >20 times the endogenous amount of hCAP-18 was added to the plasma (Fig. 5). The antimicrobial active domain of hCAP-18 (LL-37) is cleaved off during exocytosis from human neutrophils (23Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Odeberg J. Bergman T. Olsson B. Salcedo R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting (with anti-hCAP-18 antibodies) of the exocytosed material revealed three bands with apparent molecular masses of 18, 14, and 4 kDa (Fig. 6, lane A). The molecular mass of hCAP-18, calculated from the amino acid sequence, is 16 kDa, 11.5 kDa for cathelin and 4.5 kDa for LL-37. To confirm that the 14-kDa band seen by immunoblotting was the cathelin part of hCAP-18, the exocytosed material from neutrophils was affinity-purified on an anti-hCAP-18 antibody column. As the different parts of hCAP-18 have different pI values (with the holoprotein and LL-37 being very cationic and the cathelin part being anionic), the eluate obtained from the antibody column was subjected to anion-exchange chromatography. The 14-kDa fragment of hCAP-18 was eluted at 0.2 m NaCl and further purified and desalted by gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. The N terminus of hCAP-18 (and of the cathelin part) is blocked for protein sequence analysis (8Cowland J.B. Johnsen A.H. Borregaard N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Fragments of the 14-kDa protein were therefore generated by cleavage with endoproteinase Asp-N, separated by HPLC, and identified by mass spectrometry (TableII). Endoproteinase Asp-N was chosen to recover both an N- and a C-terminal fragment so that both termini of the protein could be identified. It was expected that several of the small very hydrophilic fragments were not retained on the HPLC column, as was also observed (Table II). All the fragments generated were from the cathelin part of hCAP-18, and the last fragment detected (DNKRFA) was consistent with the C terminus of cathelin (Fig.7). Furthermore, the molecular mass of the purified intact 14-kDa fragment was determined by mass spectrometry. The protein was heterogeneous, showing three peaks at 11,910, 12,178, and 12,462 Da, respectively, compared with 11,520 Da calculated for the cathelin part of hCAP-18 (residues 1–103 of the holoprotein) (Fig. 7). The heterogeneity of the protein and the discrepancy from the calculated value remain unexplained, but do suggest either a post-translational modification located in one or more of the non-recovered fragments or a non-consensus cleavage by Asp-N after the C-terminal alanine (Fig. 7). Thus, the data obtained by mass spectrometry and the sequences from the Asp-N-derived fragments identified the 14-kDa fragment as the cathelin part of hCAP-18. To substantiate that the 4-kDa fragments seen by immunoblotting represented the antibacterial C terminus of hCAP-1"
https://openalex.org/W1983944696,"CD40 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that mediates a number of important signaling events in B-lymphocytes and some other types of cells through interaction of its cytoplasmic (ct) domain with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins. Alanine substitution and truncation mutants of the human CD40ct domain were generated, revealing residues critical for binding TRAF2, TRAF3, or both of these proteins. In contrast to TRAF2 and TRAF3, direct binding of TRAF1, TRAF4, TRAF5, or TRAF6 to CD40 was not detected. However, TRAF5 could be recruited to wild-type CD40 in a TRAF3-dependent manner but not to a CD40 mutant (Q263A) that selectively fails to bind TRAF3. CD40 mutants with impaired binding to TRAF2, TRAF3, or both of these proteins completely retained the ability to activate NF-κB and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), implying that CD40 can stimulate TRAF2- and TRAF3-independent pathways for NF-κB and JNK activation. A carboxyl-truncation mutant of CD40 lacking the last 32 amino acids required for TRAF2 and TRAF3 binding, CD40(Δ32), mediated NF-κB induction through a mechanism that was suppressible by co-expression of TRAF6(ΔN), a dominant-negative version of TRAF6, but not by TRAF2(ΔN), implying that while TRAF6 does not directly bind CD40, it can participate in CD40 signaling. In contrast, TRAF6(ΔN) did not impair JNK activation by CD40(Δ32). Taken together, these findings reveal redundancy in the involvement of TRAF family proteins in CD40-mediated NF-κB induction and suggest that the membrane-proximal region of CD40 may stimulate the JNK pathway through a TRAF-independent mechanism.

The ct domain of huCD40 is only 62 amino acids (aa) long and lacks any motifs that might suggest a biochemical mechanism for transducing signals into cells. Signaling by this receptor appears to be initiated by the binding of TRAF family proteins to CD40ct. TRAFs represent a group of structurally similar adapter proteins that link the cytosolic domains of some TNFR family cytokine receptors to downstream signaling pathways. All members of this family contain a conserved C-terminal ∼150-aa region known as the TRAF domain, which mediates their interactions with the cytosolic domains of specific TNF family cytokine receptors (reviewed in Ref. 7Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar).

It is unclear whether those TRAF family members that fail to activate NF-κB and JNK have other unidentified signaling functionsversus operating as competitors that preclude recruitment of other TRAFs to CD40ct and other TNF family receptors after ligand binding. Previous studies have shown that a 17-aa segment of CD40ct (250PVQETLHGCQPVTQEDG266) is sufficient for activating NF-κB and binding TRAF2 and TRAF3 (8Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.-S. Hong D.I.

Given that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are all capable of activating NF-κB and JNK, redundancy in the signal-initiating mechanisms used by CD40 may exist. If TRAF family proteins are to serve as potential therapeutic targets for modulating CD40 action, it is important to define the individual contributions of each TRAF family member that binds this receptor. We therefore created CD40ct mutants that selectively lost the ability to bind specific TRAFs, with the goal of determining the resulting effects on downstream CD40-mediated signal transduction events. The plasmid pGEX4T1-CD40 encoding huCD40ct fused to GST (10Sato T. Irie S. Reed J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) was employed for creation of CD40 mutants using either one-step or two-step polymerase chain reaction methods. These pGEX-CD40 mutants were digested with MscI and XhoI, and then DNA inserts corresponding to the mutagenized CD40ct regions were subcloned in place of the corresponding wild-type (WT) sequences in pcDNA3-huCD40, a plasmid encoding full-length huCD40.

For two-hybrid screens, a cDNA encompassing the TRAF domain of TRAF2 was subcloned into pGilda. The promoter-containing reporter gene plasmids pUC13–4xNF-κB-Luc (containing four tandem HIV-NF-κB response elements and the minimalfos promoter) and pCMV-M2FLAG-JNK1 have been described (24Lin S.C.

BL21(DE3) strain Escherichia coli transformed with either pGEX-4T-1-TRAF2-(263–501) or pET21b-TRAF3-(341–568) were grown in LB medium and induced at an A 600 = 1.0 with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C. The GST-TRAF2-(263–501) protein was purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and digested with thrombin, followed by passage over glutathione-Sepharose to remove GST and over benzamidine-agarose to remove residual thrombin. His6-TRAF3 was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Inc.) GST-CD40ct fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria (BL-21) from pGEX plasmids and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, essentially as described (10Sato T. Irie S. Reed J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, beads were resuspended in Co-IP buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 142 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). GST fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue staining and normalized to ∼1 μg/5 μl of beads by adding “empty” beads. Protein content was confirmed on eluted proteins by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). TRAF cDNAs in pcDNA3 were in vitrotranscribed/translated with l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Immobilized GST fusion proteins (∼1 μg/5 μl) were incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translation (IVT) products in a total volume of 200 μl in Co-IP buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times in 1 ml of Co-IP buffer, and proteins were eluted in 20 μl of Laemmli solution for SDS-PAGE/autoradiography analysis. Results were quantified with a Bio-Rad phosphorimaging device and expressed relative to WT CD40. Alternatively, lysates were prepared from transfected 293 cells in Co-IP buffer (0.5 mg of total protein/ml) and precleared with glutathione-Sepharose, and immobilized GST-fusion proteins (∼5 μg) were added to 500 μl for incubation at 4 °C for 4 h. After washing, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Experiments involving recombinant TRAF domains were performed similarly, using Co-IP buffer and GST fusion proteins at 1 μg/μl. An aptamer library in pJM-1 was used for identification of TRAF2-binding peptides (28Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 380: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Library screening by the yeast two-hybrid method was performed as described in detail previously (29Durfee T. Becherer K.

From ∼8.5 × 106 transformants screened, ∼300 clones were identified, which transactivated the LEU2 reporter gene (grew on leucine-deficient media), 82 of which were positive for β-galactosidase. Forty candidates were cured of the LexA-TRAF2 bait plasmid by growth in medium containing histidine and mated with each of five indicator strains (29Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y.

The candidates were then selected on histidine-deficient medium, resulting in 15 clones that displayed specific interactions with TRAF2. 293T and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1 mml-glutamine, and antibodies. Cells in 10-cm dishes at 80% confluence were transfected (10 μg of total DNA) using a calcium phosphate method. The plasmid pcDNA3-βGal (1 μg) was included in all transfections to adjust for differences in transfection efficiency, as assessed by β-galactosidase assay (31Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 1 ml of Co-IP buffer. For NF-κB reporter gene assays, 293T or HeLa cells were calcium phosphate-transfected with 3 μg (total) of plasmid DNA at 60–80% confluency in 12-well plates. After 1.5–2 days, cells were lysed in 0.1 ml of Promega lysis buffer. Lysates were measured for luciferase activity using a luminometer (EG & G Berthold) and Promega luciferase kits, normalizing relative to β-galactosidase. 293T or HeLa cells in 10-cm dishes were subjected to lipofection with various wild-type or mutant pcDNA3-CD40 plasmids (5 μg) and 1.2 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG-JNK1. Whole cell lysates were prepared using 1 ml of JNK kinase buffer assay (32Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar), and 300 μg of protein in 1 ml was employed for immunoprecipitation using 20 μl of anti-FLAG antibody-Sepharose (Sigma), followed by in vitro kinase assay (32Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated GST-c-Jun bands in gels were analyzed with a Bio-Rad phosphorimaging device. Comparable expression of FLAG-JNK1 and CD40 constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-CD40ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-FLAG-M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) antibodies. Alanine substitution mutations and C-terminal truncations of huCD40ct were produced as GST fusion proteins and used for protein binding assays employing IVT 35S-TRAF1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Similar experiments were also performed using cell lysates from 293T cells that had been transiently transfected with plasmids producing epitope-tagged TRAF1, -2, -3, -4, -5, or -6, followed by immunoblot detection of bound TRAFs (Fig. 2 and data not shown).

In contrast, TRAF5 failed to bind GST-CD40 altogether or was seen at levels only slightly above background, as determined by comparisons with GST nonfusion, GST-p75-nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) ct domain, or other GST-control proteins (Fig. 2 C and data not shown), whereas TRAF6 binding was completely absent (Fig. 2C). Binding of TRAF5 and TRAF6 to the ct domains of other TNFR family members, e.g.GST-LTβR and GST-p75-NGFR, respectively, was readily detectable under similar conditions (not shown), implying that TRAF5 and TRAF6 produced by IVT or by expression in 293T cells were competent to bind at least some TNF family receptors. TRAF1 and TRAF4 also did not bind GST-CD40ct (not shown), although they did interact with control GST fusion proteins such as GST-cIAP1 (33Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takashashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

Binding ratios represent quantification of the data by phosphorimager, expressed relative to binding to WT CD40 (set at 1.0). p75-NGFR was included as a negative control (far right). One-tenth (A) or one-twentieth (B) of the input35S-TRAF protein was run directly in gels (far left) for comparison. B, similar binding assays were performed using GST-CD40 fusion proteins and lysates from 293T cells that had been transiently transfected with plasmids producing HA-tagged TRAF2 or TRAF3. Bound TRAFs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using antibodies specific for TRAF2 or TRAF3 followed by 125I-Protein-A and autoradiography. Note that endogenous TRAF2 and TRAF3 as well as HA-tagged TRAF2 and TRAF3b were detected by the antibodies. HA-tagged protein results were used for calculation of binding ratios. Loading of equivalent amounts of each GST fusion protein was confirmed by stripping and reprobing blots with anti-GST monoclonal antibody (not shown). C, binding of immobilized GST-CD40 to 35S-labeled in vitrotranslated TRAF5 and TRAF6 (left) or to epitope-tagged TRAF5 and TRAF6 derived from lysates of transfected 293T cells (right) was tested as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As described previously (8Cheng G.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11830-11845Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) point mutations in a conserved PXQX(T/S) core motif found in several TRAF-binding TNFR members (250PVQET254) significantly impaired binding of both TRAF2 and TRAF3. The T254A mutation abolished binding of TRAF2 and TRAF3 completely, whereas alanine substitution mutants of other residues in the250PVQET254 motif reduced but did not entirely abrogate binding of these TRAFs (Fig. 1). Interestingly, Pro250 and Val251 appeared to be relatively more important for TRAF2 than TRAF3 binding, implying differences in the specificity of these proteins for residues in the PVQET core motif of CD40. Alanine substitutions in a region (229PKQEPQE235) located upstream of, but having similarity to, the PVQET core motif had no effect on TRAF2 or TRAF3 binding. Differences in the requirements for TRAF2 and TRAF3 binding to GST-CD40 were revealed by mutations affecting residues distal to the PVQET motif. For example, alanine replacements within the262TQEDGK267 region demonstrated that Gln263 is crucial for TRAF3 binding but not TRAF2 (Fig. 1). Although TRAF2 binding was relatively insensitive to alanine substitutions within 262TQEDGK267 of CD40ct, a G266A mutation did reduce binding by approximately half. In contrast, TRAF3 binding was slightly enhanced by the G266A mutation (Fig. 1), again indicating differences in the structural features of CD40ct binding by TRAF2 and TRAF3. Similarly, C-terminal truncation mutations of CD40ct provided further evidence of different requirements for TRAF2 and TRAF3 binding. Deleting 11, 13, or 15 aa from the C terminus of CD40ct reducedin vitro TRAF2 binding to ∼40% of control levels, whereas TRAF3 binding was unaffected by removal of the C-terminal 11 aa and only modestly reduced by deletion of the last 13 aa of CD40ct. Deletion of another 2 amino acids (Δ15 aa), thus removing Gln263and Glu264, completely abrogated TRAF3 binding (Fig. 1). These data are consistent with the alanine substitution results, which identified Gln263 as an important residue for TRAF3 binding, suggesting that Gln263 lies near or at the carboxyl boundary of the minimal TRAF3 binding site within CD40ct. We conclude therefore that TRAF2 and TRAF3 bind overlapping but nonidentical sites in the ct domain of CD40. A combinatorial library of constrained 20-residue peptides displayed by the active-site loop of E. coli-derived thioredoxin was screened for TRAF2 binders using a yeast two-hybrid method (28Colas P. Cohen B. Jessen T. Grishina I. McCoy J. Brent R. Nature. 1996; 380: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Peptides that bound specifically to TRAF2 were identified by secondary screens against irrelevant bait proteins, eliminating false positives. Most of the identified peptides shared sequence similarity with each other and with sequences within the C-terminal 11 aa of huCD40 (Fig.3). This 11-aa region is perfectly conserved in the human and mouse CD40 proteins, containing an ISVQE motif, which is resembled by several of the TRAF2-binding peptides. Some of the peptides were more similar to motifs in the C terminus of CD30 or LMP1 than to CD40 (Fig. 3), all of which have been previously implicated in TRAF2 binding (35Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C.

Virol. 1997; 71: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of the peptides identified by aptamer library screening bound TRAF3 (not shown), arguing that the recognition of peptide ligands by TRAF2 and TRAF3 differs. The peptide aptamer library screening results, therefore, indirectly support the idea that optimal binding of TRAF2 to CD40 is facilitated by residues in the C-terminal 11 aa of CD40ct. To determine whether TRAF2 and TRAF3 compete for binding to CD40ct, competitive binding assays were performed using the TRAF domains of TRAF2 and TRAF3, which were produced as recombinant proteins in bacteria and purified. The TRAF domain of TRAF2 or TRAF3 was preincubated at a 10-fold molar excess relative to GST-CD40ct to saturate its binding sites on CD40, and then various amounts of the opposing TRAF domain were added in 1–90-fold molar ratios compared with GST-CD40, and binding was monitored 1 h later by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. In pilot experiments, both TRAF domains reached saturation binding when added at ∼5–10-fold molar excess over GST-CD40, with ∼15–20% of the input TRAF binding. Despite presaturation of binding sites for TRAF2 on GST-CD40ct, TRAF3 bound in a concentration-dependent manner, and vice versa(Fig. 4). Furthermore, the titration of the other TRAF did not lead to a reduction in retention of the preincubated TRAF. Even when TRAF domains were added at ∼9-fold molar excess of the opposing TRAF and at ∼90-fold excess of GST-CD40, no apparent reduction in the amounts of TRAF prebound to GST-CD40 was seen (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained in experiments where TRAF2 and TRAF3 were added simultaneously to GST-CD40 in various molar ratios (not shown). We conclude, therefore, that TRAF2 and TRAF3 do not efficiently compete for binding sites on CD40ct, despite the apparent overlap in some regions required for their recognition of CD40ct. TRAF3 and TRAF5 can bind to each other but not to other known TRAF family members in vitro and in yeast-two-hybrid assays (13Pullen S. Miller H. Everdeen D. Dang T. Crute J. Kehry M.

We therefore asked whether TRAF5 could be indirectly recruited to CD40ct through interactions with TRAF3. To test this idea, GST-CD40ct was incubated with 35S-labeled (“hot”) TRAF5 in the presence or absence of IVT unlabeled (“cold”) TRAF3 (Fig.5 A). As a control,"

In addition to the role cAMP plays in hormonal modulation of insulin secretion, basal cAMP levels appear to be required for glucose to induce insulin secretion (24Serre V. Dolci W. Schaerer E. Scrocchi L. Drucker D. Efrat S. Thorens B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4448-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Potentiation of glucose-induced insulin secretion is evident not only upon treatment of insulin secreting cells with the insulinotropic gut factor GLP1 (glucagon-like peptide 1), but also upon treatment with reagents that stimulate cAMP signaling including membrane permeable cAMP analogs, activators of adenylyl cyclase, and PDE inhibitors (11Rasmussen H.

Like GLP1, these cAMP elevating agents do not induce significant insulin secretion in the absence of glucose. Targets for cAMP action are PKA substrates such as the voltage-sensitive calcium channel, GLUT2, and potentially also ion channels to which cAMP binds directly (13Liang Y. Matschinsky F.M. Annu. Rev.

In addition to the potentiation of glucose and calcium-dependent insulin secretion, cAMP-stimulated exocytosis via calcium-independent mechanisms is evident in patch clamped cells, and the contribution of this mechanism to insulin secretion under physiological conditions remains to be determined (29Ammala C. Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Nature. 1993; 363: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A requirement for the localization of PKA to specific sites within pancreatic β-cells via anchor proteins has been demonstrated for GLP-1 potentiation of insulin secretion (31Lester L.B.

The involvement of cyclic nucleotide PDEs in the regulation of insulin secretion is inferred from the stimulatory effects of the non-selective PDE inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) on insulin secretion from insulin secreting cell lines, from islets, and from transgenic mice expressing a constitutively activated Gαs mutant in their pancreatic β-cells (11Rasmussen H.

Cyclic nucleotide PDEs present in β-cells were thus far investigated as total PDE activities of crude islet extracts and the presence of PDEs 3 and 4, and calcium-sensitive PDEs, in β-cells has been inferred from these studies (32Parker J.C.

The presence of PDE3B in pancreatic β-cells and its involvement in insulin-like growth factor-1 and in leptin-mediated inhibition of insulin secretion has been demonstrated recently (10Zhao A.Z.

Invest. 1998; 102: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, in cultured pancreatic β-cells PDE3B does not appear to play a role in insulin secretion induced by glucose in the absence of hormone regulation (10Zhao A.Z. Zhao H. Teague J. Fujimoto W. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3223-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This study details the chromatographic, biochemical, and pharmacological characterization of β-cell PDEs, and the identification of a subset of β-cell PDEs that are involved in counteracting glucose-induced insulin secretion. We demonstrate the presence of PDEs 1C, 4A, and 4D, and a cGMP-specific PDE, in soluble cell lysates, and of PDE3 in particulate cell lysates, of βTC3 insulinoma cells. We also demonstrate the involvement of PDE1C in the regulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion from βTC3 cells and pancreatic islets. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Following a 30-min 150,000 × gcentrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Pharmacia Mono-Q anion exchange column and PDE activities were fractionated by FPLC along a two-step salt gradient. Column buffers were: A) 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and B) 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl. The gradient consisted of a 10-min increase to 0.1 m NaCl (20% B), and a 90-min increase to 0.5 m NaCl (100% B). One-ml fractions were collected. PDE assays were performed in duplicate as described (40Han P. Zhu X. Michaeli T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16152-16157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5–1 μg of protein extract, or 10 μl of Mono-Q fractions, were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with appropriate concentrations of either 2,8-[3H]cAMP or 8-[3H]cGMP in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 unit of snake venome nucleotidase. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA, AMP, and cAMP to final concentrations of 10, 1.25, and 1.25 mm, respectively, and transfer to 4 °C. Reaction mixtures were applied to AG-1-X8 anion exchange columns (Bio-Rad) and the hydrolyzed products were eluted with 50% ethanol. The 3H content of the eluate was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. Analysis and plotting of kinetic data was performed by using the computer program Kaleidagraph. The contributions of the high and low affinities cGMP PDEs of peak I to total PDE activity of this peak at a given substrate concentration were calculated using the formula: V =V 1 + V 2 =V m1·S/(K m1 + S) +V m2·s(K m1 + S). βTC3 cells were cultured as described and early passages (22Grodsky G.M.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For measurements of insulin secretion cells were plated onto 24-well culture dishes 3–4 days, and refed 16 h prior to the assay. On the experiment day, cells were washed in Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer solution, and incubated in this glucose-free solution for 1 h. Subsequently, either no glucose or 16.7 mm glucose and, when relevant, PDE inhibitors were added to the cells in Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer solution and the cells were incubated for 2 additional hours. Each condition was assayed in triplicate. Secreted insulin found in the supernatant after centrifugation, and endogenous insulin content of the cells after acid extraction, were determined by a radioimmunoassay as described (20D'Ambra R. Surana M. Efrat S. Starr R.G. Fleischer N. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Average insulin content was 2% of total cellular protein. PDE inhibitors used are: IBMX, a non-selective inhibitor; 8-methoxymethyl-isobutylmethylxanthine (8MM-IBMX), a PDE1 selective inhibitor; zaprinast, a PDE1/5/6 selective inhibitor; rolipram and RO20–1724, PDE4 selective inhibitors; milrinone and trequinsin, PDE3 selective inhibitors (1Beavo J.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All inhibitors applied to βTC3 cells in glucose-free Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer solution did not induce significant insulin release. Mouse pancreatic islets were prepared from normal C3H male mice via collagenase digestion of pancreatic tissue, separation on a Ficoll gradient and manual picking (43Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). Groups of 10 islets were first preincubated in Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer solution containing 1.67 mm glucose for 1 h and subsequently for 2 h in the presence of either 1.67 mm glucose alone or 16.7 mm glucose along with PDE inhibitors. Following the incubation with glucose and various PDE inhibitors, insulin released to the incubation media, and islet insulin content were measured by a radioimmunoassay. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped after the addition of butanol-saturated 1 m formic acid and incubated on ice for 10 min. After a 10-min spin at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was harvested, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and resuspended in water. Cyclic AMP content was measured by a radioimmunoassay after acetylation in the assay buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.75). Samples and standards were incubated overnight with 125I-cAMP (adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphoric acid, 2′-O-succinyl-[125I]iodotyrosine methyl ester, NEN Life Science Products Inc.), goat anti-cAMP antibodies and rabbit γ-globulins. Following ammonium sulfate precipitation, the antibody-125I-cAMP immune complexes were counted in a γ-counter. RT-PCR analysis was performed on 5 μg of RNA prepared from βTC3 cells using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Controls lacking reverse transcriptase were included in the reactions. To determine expression of PDE1C the following oligonucleotides were used: for RT, oligo-dT; for PCR amplification, JWPDE1C-5 5′-ACAGGGCAGAGGAGATCAAGTTT; and JWPDE1C-3, 5′-CTTTTCGCCTGCCTTTTCTCCTT. The 408-base pair PCR product was cloned and its DNA sequence was determined to be identical to the published mouse PDE1Csequence. The following oligonucleotides were used for PCR amplification to determine the expression of PDE4A, JWPDE4A-5, 5′-AGCCATGGAACAGTCAAAGGTCAA; and JWPDE4A-3, 5′-TCAGGAGGGCCAGGAGTCGT. To determine the expression of PDE4D, JWPDE4D-5, 5′-GAGGGCCGGCAGGGACAGAC; and JWPDE4D-3, 5′-GGGGGTGGGGTGGGTGAGAGG. Amplification products 436 and 470 base pairs long were obtained for PDE4A and D, respectively. To identify β-cell PDEs involved in the regulation of insulin secretion, we first set to identify the cyclic nucleotide PDE families and isozymes expressed in βTC3 insulinoma cells. For these purposes, we fractionated soluble βTC3 cell extracts by Mono-Q FPLC anion exchange chromatography and analyzed their cyclic nucleotide PDE activities profile (Fig. 1). The PDE profile was comprised of four peaks of PDE activities: a single peak (peak I) containing both cAMP and cGMP PDE activities, and three cAMP-specific PDE activity peaks (peaks II-IV). Both cAMP and cGMP PDE activities of peak I were stimulated by calcium and calmodulin at low substrate concentrations, demonstrating the presence of a high affinity isozyme of the dual specificity, calcium/calmodulin-dependent PDE1 in this peak (Table I). However, while the cAMP PDE activity of peak I was highly sensitive to the PDE1 selective inhibitor 8MM-IBMX, the cGMP PDE activity of peak I was partially resistant to 8MM-IBMX, raising the possibility that additional cGMP PDE activities are present in this peak. PDE activities of peaks II-IV were abolished by 2.5 μm rolipram, a highly selective PDE4 inhibitor, thus demonstrating the presence of multiple PDE4 isozymes in βTC3 cells. Expression of both PDE4A and 4D in these cells was demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis (see “Materials and Methods”). Milrinone-sensitive PDE3 activity constituted the majority of the particulate PDE activity (>70%, not shown). These observations demonstrate the presence of soluble PDE1 and -4 isozymes, of a soluble cGMP-specific PDE, and of a particulate PDE3, in βTC3 cells.Table IBiochemical and pharmacologic properties of fractionated PDE activities of βTC3 cellsPeakSubstrateCa2+ & calmodulin/EGTAaRatio of the PDE activity measured in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and 4 μg/ml calmodulin to the activity measured in the presence of 1 mm EGTA is presented.% Inhibition8MM-IBMXbPercent inhibition by 50 μm 8MM-IBMX.RolipramcPercent inhibition by 2.5 μm rolipram.IcAMP, 0.5 μm9.190NDdND, not determined.IcGMP, 0.1 μm11.882NDIcGMP, 10 μm13.157NDIIcAMP, 1 μm1.5ND98IIIcAMP, 1 μm>1.1ND97IVcAMP, 1 μm1.1ND96a Ratio of the PDE activity measured in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and 4 μg/ml calmodulin to the activity measured in the presence of 1 mm EGTA is presented.b Percent inhibition by 50 μm 8MM-IBMX.c Percent inhibition by 2.5 μm rolipram.d ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To identify PDE1 isozymes and other PDE activities of peak I, we examined the kinetic and pharmacological properties of PDEs present in peak I (Fig. 2, TableII). Kinetics of cAMP PDE activities of peak I demonstrated the presence of a single high affinity cAMP PDE activity possessing a K m of 0.47 μmfor cAMP (Fig. 2 A). The kinetics of cGMP PDE activities of peak I demonstrated the presence of two cGMP PDE activities (Fig.2 B). Two kinetic curves of cGMP PDE activities resolved as the best fit for the obtained data included activities possessingK m of 0.25 μm and of 57.5 μm for cGMP. Based on these kinetic parameters, it is calculated that 95% (at 0.1 μm) and 50% (at 10 μm) of the cGMP PDE activity of peak I are derived from the high affinity PDE of this peak (V =V 1 + V 2, see “Materials and Methods”). Accordingly, 8MM-IBMX inhibited 82% of the cGMP PDE activity of peak I at 0.1 μm substrate, and only 57% of the cGMP PDE activity of peak I at 10 μm substrate. As 8MM-IBMX inhibition reflected the calculated content of the high affinity cGMP PDE activity of peak I, it appears that the low affinity cGMP PDE activity of peak I is 8MM-IBMX resistant and is not derived from the PDE1 isozyme present in this peak (Table I). Taken together, these observations indicate that peak I contains a high-affinity dual specificity PDE1 activity that is stimulatable by calcium/calmodulin and is sensitive to 8MM-IBMX, and a low affinity cGMP PDE activity.Table IIInhibitor IC50 values for PDE1C activityCompoundIC50 values8MM-IBMX7.5 ± 2 μmZaprinast4.5 ± 2 μmVinpocetine>100 μmRolipram>100 μmMilrinone>100 μmIC50 values were determined using 1 μm cAMP substrate and are presented as average ± S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2116418998,"Aerolysin is a channel-forming bacterial toxin that binds to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors on host cell-surface structures. The nature of the receptors and the location of the receptor-binding sites on the toxin molecule were investigated using surface plasmon resonance. Aerolysin bound to the GPI-anchored proteins Thy-1, variant surface glycoprotein, and contactin with similar rate constants and affinities. Enzymatic removal ofN-linked sugars from Thy-1 did not affect toxin binding, indicating that these sugars are not involved in the high affinity interaction with aerolysin. Aerolysin is a bilobal protein, and both lobes were shown to be required for optimal binding. The large lobe by itself bound Thy-1 with an affinity that was at least 10-fold weaker than that of the whole toxin, whereas the small lobe bound the GPI-anchored protein at least 1000-fold more weakly than the intact toxin. Mutation analyses provided further evidence that both lobes were involved in GPI anchor binding, with certain single amino acid substitutions in either domain leading to reductions in affinity of as much as 100-fold. A variant with single amino acid substitutions in both lobes of the protein was completely unable to bind the receptor. The membrane protein glycophorin, which is heavily glycosylated but not GPI-anchored, bound weakly to immobilized proaerolysin, suggesting that interactions with cell-surface carbohydrate structures other than GPI anchors may partially mediate toxin binding to host cells. Aerolysin is a channel-forming bacterial toxin that binds to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors on host cell-surface structures. The nature of the receptors and the location of the receptor-binding sites on the toxin molecule were investigated using surface plasmon resonance. Aerolysin bound to the GPI-anchored proteins Thy-1, variant surface glycoprotein, and contactin with similar rate constants and affinities. Enzymatic removal ofN-linked sugars from Thy-1 did not affect toxin binding, indicating that these sugars are not involved in the high affinity interaction with aerolysin. Aerolysin is a bilobal protein, and both lobes were shown to be required for optimal binding. The large lobe by itself bound Thy-1 with an affinity that was at least 10-fold weaker than that of the whole toxin, whereas the small lobe bound the GPI-anchored protein at least 1000-fold more weakly than the intact toxin. Mutation analyses provided further evidence that both lobes were involved in GPI anchor binding, with certain single amino acid substitutions in either domain leading to reductions in affinity of as much as 100-fold. A variant with single amino acid substitutions in both lobes of the protein was completely unable to bind the receptor. The membrane protein glycophorin, which is heavily glycosylated but not GPI-anchored, bound weakly to immobilized proaerolysin, suggesting that interactions with cell-surface carbohydrate structures other than GPI anchors may partially mediate toxin binding to host cells. Aerolysin is one of the best characterized of the toxins secreted by pathogenic bacteria (1Lacy D.B. Stevens R.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The protein is released by Aeromonas hydrophila as an inactive 52-kDa precursor called proaerolysin, which is converted to aerolysin by proteolytic removal of a C-terminal peptide (2Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Binding of aerolysin to receptors on target cells promotes its oligomerization, and this is followed by membrane insertion and channel formation. Remarkably, all of the proteins that are known to bind aerolysin with high affinity are attached to the cell surface with GPI 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; APT, aerolysin pertussis toxin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RU, resonance unit(s) anchors. These include the erythrocyte aerolysin receptor, brain and T-lymphocyte Thy-1, brain contactin, and VSG of trypanosomes (3Cowell S. Aschauer W. Gruber H.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have also shown that cathepsin D, a protein with no affinity for aerolysin, can be converted to an aerolysin-binding protein by addition of a GPI anchor (5Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Pleshak E.N. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that the anchor itself is the major aerolysin binding determinant. All anchor structures reported to date have a core structure consisting of ethanolamine-HPO4-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcNH2α1–6-myo-inositol-1HPO4linked to diacylglycerol, alkylacylglycerol, or ceramide. Perhaps not surprisingly, the lipid does not play a role in aerolysin binding: the toxin binds at least as well to GPI-anchored proteins that have been released from cell surfaces by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. The inositol in the core structure can be acylated, and other sugars and/or ethanolamine phosphate can be added to the core mannoses (7Schneider P. Ferguson M.A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 614-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These additions are not always stoichiometric, adding further complexity to anchor structure (8Mehlert A. Richardson J.M. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Not all GPI-anchored proteins can bind aerolysin, at least in some cases because of species differences in modifications to the core structure. Thus, the Leishmania protease purified with its naturally occurring anchor attached has no affinity for the toxin, whereas the same protein expressed from the cloned gene in a mammalian cell can bind aerolysin. Proaerolysin and aerolysin both exist as dimers in solution. Based on the crystal structure of the proaerolysin dimer, each monomer is composed of a small globular lobe containing the first 83 residues joined by a short arm of ∼10 amino acids to a large elongated lobe containing the remaining residues (9Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis of two-dimensional crystalline arrays of the heptameric aerolysin oligomer indicated that part of the large lobe forms an amphipathic β-barrel that becomes the transmembrane channel upon insertion (9Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 10Buckley J.T. Wilmsen H.U. Lesieur C. Schulze A. Pattus F. Parker M.W. van der Groot F.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16450-16455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and a number of residues in this lobe that are involved in the oligomerization process have been identified by chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis (2Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The large lobe may also be involved in receptor binding, based on the observation that the α-toxin ofClostridium septicum, which is a homologue of the large lobe of aerolysin, but lacks a region equivalent to the small lobe, can also bind some GPI-anchored proteins (6Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Sellman B.R. Tweten R.K. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 2V. M. Gordon, K. L. Nelson, J. T. Buckley, V. L. Stevens, R. K. Tweten, P. C. Elwood, and S. H. Leppla, manuscript in preparation. However, there is also some evidence that the small lobe is involved in receptor binding. Erythrocytes are far more sensitive to aerolysin than to α-toxin, and fusing the aerolysin small lobe to the clostridial toxin results in a hybrid that is at least as hemolytic as aerolysin (6Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Sellman B.R. Tweten R.K. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The structure of the small lobe also points to a role in carbohydrate binding. We have observed that it is nearly identical to folds in subunits S2 and S3 of pertussis toxin (11Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Hazes B. Murzin A.G. Read R. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the common fold, which we have called an aerolysin pertussis toxin (APT) domain, is similar to a fold in C-type lectins and link modules that recognize cell-surface oligosaccharides (11Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Hazes B. Murzin A.G. Read R. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although GPI anchors are clearly the most important determinants of the interaction with aerolysin, there are other properties of surface proteins that appear to influence toxin binding. For example, we have found that binding to Thy-1 is abolished by protease treatment, indicating that some still uncharacterized feature of the polypeptide chain is required (5Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Pleshak E.N. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have also observed that, unlike C. septicum α-toxin, aerolysin binds weakly to glycophorin, a heavily glycosylated membrane protein that is not GPI-anchored (6Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Sellman B.R. Tweten R.K. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Garland W.J. Buckley J.T Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Fusing the small lobe of aerolysin to the clostridial protein confers glycophorin-binding ability on the resulting hybrid (6Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Sellman B.R. Tweten R.K. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taken together, the evidence suggests the possibility that aerolysin may contain two carbohydrate recognition sites: one in the large lobe for GPI anchor binding and a second in the small lobe for binding a second carbohydrate determinant, such as is found in glycophorin (6Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Lawrence T.S. Sellman B.R. Tweten R.K. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In previous studies, the methods used to estimate aerolysin binding have typically been qualitative. Here we describe the use of surface plasmon resonance to obtain quantitative data on aerolysin binding to GPI-anchored proteins and glycophorin. The purified large and small lobes of the toxin as well as a panel of proaerolysin variants were used to investigate the role of each lobe in ligand binding. Thy-1 was purified from deoxycholate extracts of pig brain using a modification of the procedure of Letarde-Muirhead et al. (14Letarde-Muirhead M. Barclay A.N. Williams A.F. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 685-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It migrated as a single band upon SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 4). Contactin was isolated from rat brain according to the following procedure. Fresh brain was homogenized (20%, w/v) in ice-cold 0.16 m NaCl, 50 mmTris, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, containing 1 μg/ml pepstatin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate (20 ml) was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and washed by recentrifuging. The washed pellet was resuspended to the original volume, and 4 units of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Sigma) were added. Following incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to a column of immobilized lentil lectin. Fractions containing contactin were eluted from the column with 1 m α-methyl-d-mannoside and applied to a column of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 8. Contactin was eluted from the column with a linear NaCl gradient. The pooled fractions gave a single band upon SDS-PAGE and silver staining. In addition, a single N-terminal sequence corresponding to the published sequence of contactin was obtained. Trypanosoma brucei brucei VSG was a generous gift from Dr. Terry Pearson (University of Victoria). More than 95% of the protein migrated as a single band upon SDS-PAGE. Deglycosylation was performed using the GlycoShift protein de-N-glycosylation kit from Oxford GlycoSystems (Oxford, United Kingdom). Thy-1 (4 μg) was incubated with 2 units of enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl for 23 h at 37 °C. Deglycosylation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The proaerolysin variants listed in Table I were produced by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (10Buckley J.T. Wilmsen H.U. Lesieur C. Schulze A. Pattus F. Parker M.W. van der Groot F.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16450-16455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In every case, the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each proaerolysin variant was purified to homogeneity, and its purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. All of the variants described in this study could be correctly processed to aerolysin by trypsin, and once processed, they were all capable of forming heptameric oligomers in the same way as native aerolysin. The purification and characterization of the large and small lobes of aerolysin have also been described previously (15).Table ICorrelation of hemolytic activity with the kinetic and dissociation constants for the binding of wild-type, truncated, and mutant forms of proaerolysin to native and deglycosylated Thy-1Proaerolysin formNative Thy-1Deglycosylated Thy-1k ak dK oRelative bindingk ak dK oRelative bindingHemolytic activityM −1s −1s −1mm −1s −1s −1mWild type6.9 × 104 (12%)aValues in parentheses are S.D. values based on analyses at five or more concentrations.7.5 × 10−4 (17%)1.1 × 10−4 (12%)1003.1 × 104 (14%)7.8 × 10−4 (1%)2.6 × 10−8 (16%)100100bAs percent of wild-type activity.Small lobe5.0 × 10−5 cDetermined by Scatchard analysis.0.023.7 × 10−5 cDetermined by Scatchard analysis.0.070Domains 2–43.3 × 103 (5%)2.6 × 10−3 (2%)8.0 × 10−7 (5%)1.46.3 × 103 (16%)2.2 × 10−3 (1%)3.5 × 10−7 (15%)7.40.5W45A3.9 × 103 (29%)1.7 × 10−3 (5%)4.5 × 10−7 (23%)2.43.9 × 103 (30%)1.2 × 10−3 (21%)3.2 × 10−7 (21%)8.12I47E1.1 × 103 (34%)2.6 × 10−3 (24%)2.9 × 10−6 (57%)0.42.0 × 103 (16%)8.1 × 10−4 (10%)4.1 × 10−7 (25%)631M57A1.4 × 104 (23%)1.7 × 10−3 (13%)1.3 × 10−7 (13%)8.45.9 × 103 (36%)1.3 × 10−3 (8%)2.3 × 10−7 (28%)113Y61A5.9 × 103 (20%)1.5 × 10−3 (6%)2.6 × 10−7 (14%)4.25.2 × 103 (48%)8.5 × 10−4 (11%)1.9 × 10−7 (47%)131K66Q5.4 × 103 (19%)2.0 × 10−3 (12%)3.7 × 10−7 (13%)3.04.3 × 103 (32%)1.4 × 10−3 (13%)3.4 × 10−7 (32%)7.61N154D6.4 × 104 (18%)1.1 × 10−3 (2%)1.7 × 10−8 (18%)655.7 × 104 (39%)1.2 × 10−3 (11%)2.3 × 10−8 (37%)11325C159S8.6 × 104 (39%)8.3 × 10−3 (3%)1.1 × 10−7 (35%)103.9 × 104 (14%)5.7 × 10−3 (5%)1.5 × 10−7 (16%)176Y162A6.0 × 104 (18%)1.6 × 10−3 (13%)2.8 × 10−8 (32%)395.0 × 104 (25%)1.7 × 10−3 (10%)3.6 × 10−8 (15%)726K167M3.9 × 104 (10%)6.5 × 10−4 (11%)1.7 × 10−8 (8%)652.6 × 104 (26%)6.6 × 10−4 (21%)2.6 × 10−8 (7%)10025K171C5.6 × 104 (13%)1.0 × 10−3 (22%)1.7 × 10−8 (12%)654.2 × 104 (24%)1.0 × 10−3 (7%)2.4 × 10−8 (24%)108100W324A5.8 × 104 (23%)2.0 × 10−2 (4%)3.6 × 10−7 (24%)3.13.3 × 104 (44%)1.5 × 10−2 (5%)5.6 × 10−7 (47%)4.612.5H332N4.0 × 104 (14%)1.6 × 10−3 (2%)4.1 × 10−8 (15%)273.4 × 104 (18%)1.7 × 10−3 (6%)5.1 × 10−8 (15%)5125E407C6.1 × 104 (18%)8.5 × 10−4 (14%)1.3 × 10−8 (8%)854.2 × 104 (34%)1.1 × 10−3 (7%)2.8 × 10−8 (30%)93100Y61A/W324ANAdNot active.NA0Ligands were directly immobilized on CM5 sensor chips by amine coupling.a Values in parentheses are S.D. values based on analyses at five or more concentrations.b As percent of wild-type activity.c Determined by Scatchard analysis.d Not active.

Two of the proaerolysin mutants, K171C and E407C, were biotinylated by treating them with 0.2 mm N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propanionamide (Pierce) in 0.15 m NaCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 90 min at room temperature. Excess reagent was removed by gel filtration. Binding kinetics and affinities were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIACORE® 1000 biosensor system (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) (16Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfås S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Ståhlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). All analyses were performed on research-grade CM5 sensor chips (Biacore, Inc.). Thy-1, VSG, contactin, and streptavidin were immobilized in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, at protein concentrations of 5, 10, 10, and 50 μg/ml, respectively, using the amine coupling kit supplied by the manufacturer (Biacore, Inc.). Streptavidin was immobilized at a surface density of 2500 RU. Surface densities of ∼1000 RU were used for comparison of wild-type proaerolysin and aerolysin binding to immobilized Thy-1, VSG, and contactin. Surface densities of ∼8000 RU were used for comparison of wild-type and mutant proaerolysin binding to native and deglycosylated Thy-1. Proaerolysin variant K171C was immobilized by thiol coupling chemistry, at a surface density of 1750 RU, using the kit provided by the manufacturer (Biacore, Inc.). One RU corresponds to an immobilized protein density of 1 pg/mm2 (17Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Measurements were carried out in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P-20 (Biacore, Inc.) at 25 °C and at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Following analyte binding, surfaces were regenerated with 100 mm HCl and a contact time of 6 s. Sensorgram data were analyzed using BIAevaluation Version 3 software (Biacore, Inc.). Titers were determined using washed human erythrocytes according to our published procedure (12Garland W.J. Buckley J.T Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are a number of conserved surface residues in the APT domain of the small aerolysin lobe and the two pertussis toxin subunits. These include Trp-45, Ile-47, Tyr-61, and Lys-66 of aerolysin, which cluster on the surface in a way that fully exposes the lysine and the three hydrophobic residues to the solvent (Fig.1) (11). In addition, Met-57 in aerolysin is fully exposed in a position corresponding to a leucine in S2 and S3. All five of these aerolysin residues seemed likely candidates for receptor interaction, and they were each replaced with another amino acid, producing five variants that were all far less active than native aerolysin in hemolytic titers (TableI). Several other residues in domain 1 were also replaced. These residues are not conserved in the APT fold and hence are less likely to be involved in binding. The activities of these variants were similar to the activity of the wild-type toxin (data not shown). For a variety of reasons, we have changed ∼50 different residues throughout the large lobe of aerolysin. Many of these changes were found to have no effect on the activity of the protein, whereas others reduced activity by affecting the ability of the toxin to oligomerize or insert (2Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 3C. R. MacKenzie, T. Hirama, and J. T. Buckley, unpublished observations. Several variants, each with a change at the top of the large lobe, had lower activity than the wild type, and the decrease could not be attributed to changes in oligomerization or insertion. These variants are included in Table I. One of them, C159S, has a free cysteine at 164 and has lost the 159–164 disulfide bridge of the native toxin. Also included in Table Iis the variant Y61A/W324A. This variant had no detectable hemolytic activity (Table I), nor was it able to kill T-lymphoma cells, even at concentrations 105-fold higher than the wild type (data not shown). Similar toxin binding profiles were observed for the three GPI-anchored proteins (Thy-1, VSG, and contactin) that were tested as ligands (Fig.2 and TableII). In addition, there were no significant differences in the kinetics of proaerolysin and aerolysin binding to Thy-1 and contactin. With Thy-1 surfaces, the amount of toxin binding increased after the initial acid regeneration step (Fig.2), but remained stable throughout subsequent binding and regeneration cycles. A slower dissociation rate constant was responsible for the improved binding on acid-regenerated Thy-1 surfaces (Table II). The rate constants given in Table II were derived by fitting the data to a 1:1 interaction model. In all instances, the fitting was not ideal, but was acceptable if only the early dissociation data were used. The Thy-1 data gave better fitting to this model than the VSG and contactin data and even met the rigorous demands of global fitting (Fig.3 and Table I). The values obtained for the proaerolysin/Thy-1 interaction by averaging the rate constants derived by local fitting of individual sensorgram data and by global fitting were similar (Table II).Table IIKinetics of proaerolysin and aerolysin binding to Thy-1, VSG, and contactin surfacesImmobilized ligandCurve fittingProaerolysinAerolysink ak dK Dk ak dK Dm −1s −1s −1mm −1s −1s −1mThy-1Local3.3 × 1042.1 × 10−36.6 × 10−8NDaNot determined.NDNDAcid-treated Thy-1Global3.9 × 1047.7 × 10−42.0 × 10−82.4 × 1044.5 × 10−41.9 × 10−8Acid-treated Thy-1Local5.0 × 1048.1 × 10−41.8 × 10−8NDNDNDAcid-treated VSGLocal2.0 × 1046.0 × 10−43.8 × 10−82.8 × 1043.6 × 10−41.3 × 10−8Acid-treated contactinLocal1.0 × 1052.3 × 10−32.8 × 10−8NDNDNDLigands were directly immobilized on CM5 sensor chips by amine coupling.a Not determined.

Since the data for toxin binding to Thy-1 fit better to a 1:1 interaction model than those collected on VSG and contactin surfaces, Thy-1 surfaces were used for comparison of the ligand binding affinities of wild-type, truncated, and mutant forms of proaerolysin. High density surfaces were required for these comparisons in order to obtain acceptable signals with the lower affinity binders. Local fitting was used in data analysis since the use of high density surfaces gave data that did not always meet the demands of global fitting. Both lobes of proaerolysin were required for full binding activity on Thy-1 surfaces, and binding to Thy-1 was observed with isolated small and large lobes (Table I). The small lobe (domain 1) bound weakly to Thy-1. The data were amenable only to Scatchard analysis because of the rapid kinetics (Fig.4). Relative to the whole toxin, theK D for binding of the large lobe (domains 2–4) to Thy-1 (8 × 10−7m) was >50-fold weaker, and that of the small lobe (5.5 × 10−5m) was 5000-fold weaker (Table II). Analysis of mutant binding to immobilized Thy-1 identified several residues in domain 1 and at least one residue in domain 2 that appear most important in ligand binding. The affinities of the five domain 1 variants (W45A, I47E, M57A, Y61A, and K66Q) were each <5% of the wild-type activity (Table I). In all instances, slower association and faster dissociation rates contributed to the lower affinities. Of the domain 2 variants, only W324A reduced ligand binding affinity to a level that was <5% of the wild-type activity. Among the lower affinity mutants, W324A was unique in that weaker binding was attributable entirely to a faster dissociation rate (Table I). Three other domain 2 mutants (C159S, Y162A, and H332N) showed significantly weaker binding to Thy-1 relative to the wild type (Table I). A double domain 1/domain 2 mutant (Y61A/W324A) was observed to be completely inactive. There was generally excellent agreement between the affinities determined by surface plasmon resonance and the hemolytic activities of the various forms of proaerolysin (Table I). For example, relative to the wild-type protoxin, the affinity and lytic activity of W45A were reduced ∼50- and 75-fold, respectively (Table I). The small and large lobes were both inactive in the titer assay at the concentrations we used. This is consistent with the fact that both lobes are presumably required not only for binding, but for the optimal formation of the insertion-competent oligomer. Thy-1 was efficiently de-N-glycosylated by enzymatic treatment. SDS-PAGE showed a somewhat diffuse band at ∼29 kDa for native Thy-1 and a sharp band at ∼15 kDa for enzyme-treated Thy-1 (Fig.5). The profiles for the binding of wild-type whole toxin as well as the truncated and mutant forms to deglycosylated Thy-1 were similar to those observed for native Thy-1 binding (Table I). With the exception of mutant I47E, which bound >10-fold more strongly to the deglycosylated form than to the native form, all truncated and mutant forms of proaerolysin bound to deglycosylated Thy-1 with kinetics and affinities that were very similar to those observed for binding to native Thy-1. Analyte concentrations that were sufficiently high (at least 10 × K D) to result in near saturation of various surfaces with analyte were used in order to derive information relating to the stoichiometries of toxin/ligand interaction under the experimental conditions employed here. Aerolysin was used at a lower concentration than proaerolysin because it begins to oligomerize at concentrations higher than 200 nm. With Thy-1 surfaces, relatively little of the Thy-1 ligand was available for toxin binding. Toxin/Thy-1 ratios were much lower than 1, based on monovalent binding for both monomeric large lobe and dimeric proaerolysin and aerolysin. In addition, the toxin/Thy-1 ratios were lower for the large lobe relative to proaerolysin and aerolysin and also for deglycosylated Thy-1 relative to native Thy-1 surfaces (TableIII).Table IIIInteraction stoichiometries of proaerolysin, aerolysin, and domains 2–4 with Thy-1Ligand on chipAnalyteAnalyte/ligand1000 RU native Thy-14 μm proaerolysin0.221000 RU native Thy-1200 nm aerolysin0.261000 RU native Thy-18 μm domains 2–40.151000 RU deglycosylated Thy-12 μmproaerolysin0.061750 RU proaerolysin K171C2 μm native Thy-11.8Molecular masses used in the calculations were 104 kDa for proaerolysin, 95 kDa for aerolysin, 44 kDa for domains 2–4, 30 kDa for Thy-1, and 15 kDa for deglycosylated Thy-1. Open table in a new tab Molecular masses used in the calculations were 104 kDa for proaerolysin, 95 kDa for aerolysin, 44 kDa for domains 2–4, 30 kDa for Thy-1, and 15 kDa for deglycosylated Thy-1. The binding stoichiometries were also determined using thiol-immobilized K171C, a proaerolysin mutant with wild-type activity (Table III). In this orientation, both chains of proaerolysin bound Thy-1. The ratio of bound Thy-1 to immobilized dimer was 1.8 at an analyte concentration of 2 μm. The kinetics of Thy-1 binding to proaerolysin surfaces were similar to those observed in the other orientation (data not shown). Attempts at immobilizing glycophorin on CM5 sensor chips were unsuccessful, presumably because of the low pI of the protein. To use alternative methods of monitoring the interaction of proaerolysin and glycophorin, two proaerolysin variants with introduced cysteines (E407C and K171C) were used. Both of these variants had similar activities and Thy-1 affinities compared with the wild type (Table I). The K171C variant was readily immobilized on sensor chips by thiol coupling, but attempts at immobilizing E407C in this way were not successful. However, both variants could be captured on streptavidin surfaces following biotinylation. Glycophorin bound to streptavidin-captured E407C (Fig.6), but not to either streptavidin-captured or thiol-immobilized K171C. The lack of glycophorin binding to K171C was not a result of the immobilization process since Thy-1 bound to both thiol-immobilized K171C and streptavidin-captured K171C (data not shown). Kinetic and affinity constants for binding to E407C were not determined because the binding data could not be fitted to conventional interaction models. This probably reflects varying degrees of multivalent binding arising from the fact that glycophorin is heavily glycosylated and presents multiple copies of carbohydrate structures that can bind to immobilized proaerolysin. However, the low response observed for 20 μm glycophorin binding to 3000 RU of immobilized proaerolysin indicated that this is a very weak interaction. Nevertheless, it is apparently specific since the K171C variant was unable to bind glycophorin, yet was fully active in terms of Thy-1 binding (Table I). The results of the present quantitative analysis of aerolysin binding using surface plasmon resonance allow us to draw several important conclusions about the nature of the interaction between the toxin and its receptors. Perhaps most important, the results show that both the small lobe of the toxin and a region at the top of the large lobe are involved in binding to GPI anchors. This conclusion is consistent with the circumstantial evidence we had before we began this study. Thus, we had observed that the small lobe of the toxin has a fold that we have called the APT domain (Fig. 1 ), which is similar to the carbohydrate recognition domain of the C-type lectins and other proteins. Changing any of the five conserved surface-exposed residues in the aerolysin APT domain had a profound effect on binding to Thy-1 (Table I). This was due to a decrease in the interaction of the small lobe with the glycosyl portion of the anchor, rather than with the N-linked sugars of Thy-1, since proaerolysin and aerolysin bound at least as well to de-N-glycosylated Thy-1 as to the native glycoprotein. Changing residues in the small lobe that are not conserved in the APT fold had little or no effect on binding (data not shown). The observation that C. septicum α-toxin also binds GPI-anchored proteins, despite the fact that it lacks a region homologous to the small lobe of aerolysin, suggested that the large lobe is also capable of binding the anchor, and this, too, was confirmed in this study. In fact, the results in Table I show that the large lobe by itself bound better to Thy-1 than the purified small lobe. This interaction appears to involve the top of the large lobe, in the region we have called domain 2. Removing the disulfide bridge by replacing Cys-159 with serine or changing a number of nearby residues, most notably Tyr-162 and Trp-324 (Fig. 1), all reduced aerolysin binding to Thy-1. It should be noted that we have changed >40 other residues throughout the large lobe with no apparent effects on receptor binding, more evidence that it is the top of the large lobe that contributes to binding. In common with other carbohydrate-binding proteins, the GPI-binding site of aerolysin contains numerous aromatic residues. In carbohydrate-binding proteins, the side chains of aromatic amino acids frequently stack against the hydrophobic faces of sugar rings (18Evans S.V. MacKenzie C.R. J. Mol Recognit. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, two proaerolysin residues (Tyr-62 in the small lobe and Trp-324 in the large lobe) are crucial for binding since the double mutant Y61A/W324A was inactive. These residues are close to each other in the aerolysin dimer, raising the possibility that initial toxin binding to individual GPI anchors may involve both monomers. The mutation studies indicated that a third aromatic residue, Trp-34, was also a component of the ligand-binding site. The significant clustering of aromatic residues on the surface of domain 2 (9Parker M.W. Buckley J.T. Postma J.P.M. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) suggests a probable role for additional domain 2 residues in binding. The origin of the dramatic effect of the I47E mutation on binding (Table I) is not clear, but may relate more to the introduction of a negative charge than to alteration of the ligand-binding site. Significantly, the effect was much more pronounced with native Thy-1 than with deglycosylated Thy-1. With native Thy-1, this mutation reduced the affinity to less than that of the large lobe. Also, the effect of the C159S mutation (Table I) may not reflect direct alteration of a ligand contact residue, but may be due to the loss of the 159–164 disulfide bridge. With a K D in the vicinity of 20 nm, the interaction of aerolysin with the Thy-1 anchor is very high affinity for protein-carbohydrate binding. The K D values for these kinds of interactions are more typically in the micromolar range (18Evans S.V. MacKenzie C.R. J. Mol Recognit. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The core GPI structure has two phosphate groups (7Schneider P. Ferguson M.A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 614-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that could interact ionically with the toxin and contribute to the unusually high affinity. The observation that the K66Q mutation reduced proaerolysin affinity for Thy-1 (Table I) supports this possibility. It has been observed that antibodies specific for oligosaccharides containing 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid also have affinities in the nanomolar range, and this has been attributed to the presence of charged groups on the antigens. 4S. Müller-Loennies, C. R. MacKenzie, S. I. Patenaude, S. V. Evans, P. Kosma, H. Brade, L. Brade, and S. Narang, manuscript in preparation. The dissociation kinetics indicated monovalent binding of proaerolysin and aerolysin dimers to immobilized Thy-1. The avidity effect associated with bivalent binding would result in dramatically slower dissociation rate constants, and the k d for the interaction of monomeric large lobe with native Thy-1 was only 3-fold faster than that of the dimeric protoxin (Table I). Also, the binding stoichiometries were consistent with monovalent binding of the bivalent toxin molecules. The reasons for the low toxin/Thy-1 ratios on Thy-1 surfaces under near saturation conditions are not clear, but are presumably related to poor accessibility of the GPI anchor to the toxin. It is possible that Thy-1 molecules are immobilized in an orientation that obstructs binding. Alternatively, accessibility may be affected by Thy-1 aggregation, through the lipid tails, on the sensor chip surfaces. Interestingly, Thy-1 accessibility was less restricted with native Thy-1 relative to deglycosylated Thy-1 and for intact forms of the toxin relative to the large lobe. Our results also confirm that aerolysin can bind to erythrocyte glycophorin, although the interaction is considerably weaker than the interaction with any of the GPI-anchored proteins. The fact that the K171C variant was unable to bind glycophorin, although it could bind Thy-1, indicates that the binding site for sugars of the erythrocyte protein is at least partly different from the binding site for the GPI anchor. It is possible that there is an ionic interaction between the lysine side chain at position 171 of the toxin and the acidic sugars displayed on glycophorin. Residue 171 is located in domain 2, with its side chain pointing away from the surface of proaerolysin opposite the interface between the two chains (Fig. 1). It is in relatively close proximity to domain 1 of the other chain of the dimer. Domain 1 has been previously implicated in glycophorin binding (10Buckley J.T. Wilmsen H.U. Lesieur C. Schulze A. Pattus F. Parker M.W. van der Groot F.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16450-16455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the region of domain 1 of the adjoining chain that is closest to Lys-171 has two lysines at positions 66 and 67 (Fig. 1). In the assays performed here, any interaction between proaerolysin and theN- and O-linked sugars on Thy-1 would be completely masked by the strong binding to the GPI anchor. However, it is possible that the initial interaction of the toxin with host cells involves carbohydrate structures more distant from the membrane surface than GPI anchors, such as the N-linked sugars of Thy-1 and the sugars of glycophorin. Such a mechanism for binding might explain how aerolysin penetrates the cell's glycocalyx, and it would be analogous to that observed in the inflammatory response wherein the low affinity selectin/oligosaccharide interaction is followed by a stronger interaction between cell adhesion molecules and integrins (19Simanek E.E. McGarvey G.J. Jablonowski J.A. Wong C.-H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 833-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In addition, it would explain the dramatic increase in hemolytic activity observed when the small lobe of aerolysin, itself inactive, is fused to the weakly hemolytic C. septicum α-toxin.

Crystallographic evidence indicates that NM23/NDP kinase is a hexamer of six identically folded subunits, enclosing a large (25 Å) central cavity. The hexamer has dihedral 3-fold (D3) symmetry and can be viewed as a dimer of trimers or a trimer of dimers, with the dimers exhibiting 2-fold symmetry (20Webb P.A. Perisic O. Mendola C.E.

NM23-H2/PuF recognizes a nuclease-hypersensitive transcriptional regulatory element in the human c-MYC promoter termed NHE, through which it activates c-MYC transcription in vitro and in cell transfection assays (22Postel E.H.

In vivo footprinting experiments showed that NM23-H2/PuF also binds to the NHE in vivo which correlates with the differentiation of promyelocytic HL60 cells (25Arcinas M. Boxer L.M.

The NHE (nuclease-hypersensitive element) lies between −160 and −101 bp from the P1 transcription initiation site of the c-MYC promoter and is comprised of a polypurine/polypyrimidine sequence prone to form non-B DNA structures and intermolecular triplexes (reviewed in Refs. 22Postel E.H.

Embedded in the NHE sequence is an assortment of directly repeated elements, including three CCTCCCCA motifs and two CCCACCC PuF/NM23-H2-binding sites (16Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol.

Moreover, stoichiometric amounts of protein are needed to achieve significant DNA binding activity (23Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A.

The present paper extends these observations by showing that NM23-H2 binding to the c-MYC NHE sequence can result in double-stranded DNA breaks. The cleaving of DNA is reversible, and a covalent protein-DNA complex is formed. These properties implicate NM23-H2 in structural transactions of DNA and are consistent with our earlier proposal (23Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A.

Sweitzer N. Otero A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and subsequent elution with a NaCl gradient. NM23-H1 was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation (60–90% saturation), elution from DEAE-cellulose with a NaCl gradient, followed by hydroxyapatite and size exclusion chromatography (23Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 26Postel E.H. Weiss V.H. Beneken J. Kirtane A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by mixing equimolar concentrations of each DNA strand in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl and by heating to 95 °C and slow cooling. After 5′-end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the oligonucleotides were gel-purified by electroelution and ethanol-precipitated. The 57-bp-long DNA substrate was obtained by restriction of the pUC19myc plasmid with BamHI andEcoRI restriction enzymes. This plasmid contains a 45-bp c-MYC NHE sequence and seven additional bases at the 5′-end and four on the 3′-end (Fig. 1), cloned into the uniqueBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pUC19 plasmid (gift of R. Durland). Uniquely end-labeled DNA fragments were obtained after EcoRI restriction cleavage by either 3′-end labeling with T7 polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), [α-32P]dTTP, and [α-32P]dATP or by 5′-end labeling with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The end-labeled products were cleaved withBamHI, and the resulting 57-bp fragments were gel-purified. Radiolabeled nucleotides were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. To end label the 3′-OH group, linear plasmid DNA produced by NM23-H2 cleavage was gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]ddATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Promega). Uniformly radiolabeled pUC19myc plasmid was prepared by nick translation using [α-32P]dCTP and a commercial kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Quick Prime Kit) and by following the experimental protocol of the supplier. Negatively supercoiled plasmids were prepared by the alkali lysis procedure using a kit (Qiagen). Nicked circular plasmid was prepared by DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) treatment (28Kanaar R. Klippel A. Shekhtman E. Dungan J.M. Kahmann R. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 353-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and linear plasmid by BamHI restriction. Ten microliter reactions were assembled in Reaction Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). MgCl2, KCl, EDTA, protease K, and ATP were added as specified in the figure legends. Radiolabeled DNA and NM23-H2 in storage buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitors; see Ref. 22Postel E.H. Mango S.E. Flint S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were added last, and the reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. To separate the protein-DNA complexes, the reactions were loaded onto 5% native polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1.25 mm EDTA) at room temperature for 30 min at 100 V. Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed onto XAR (Eastman Kodak Co.) films. Reactions were prepared in Reaction Buffer as for mobility shift analysis, with the addition of 1 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, terminated with SDS (2% final concentration), and treated with 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 55 °C for 30 min. Samples were extracted with a 1:1 mixture of phenol and chloroform, concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in 5 μl of 80% formamide, 3 mm EDTA, and tracking dyes. The dissolved DNAs were heated for 5 min at 90 °C and analyzed on 16% sequencing gels. Sequencing ladders were prepared according to standard protocol (29Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5477) Google Scholar). Supercoiled pUC19 plasmid (2.6 kb) containing the 57-bp c-Myc NHE insert was incubated with NM23-H2 in Reaction Buffer with the various cofactors as specified in the figure legends. After 30 min at 20 °C the reactions were terminated with 1% SDS, 10 mmEDTA, and proteinase K treatment (200 μg/ml) for 30 min at 55 °C. Control topoisomerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) reactions were carried out under identical conditions. Following addition of a gel loading dye (5% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue), samples were resolved on 1% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA). The gels were stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 30 min, destained in water, and photographed under short wave UV illumination. Uniformly labeled plasmid (25 ng, specific activity 1–2 × 108cpm/μg) was mixed with an equal amount of unlabeled plasmid and with 4 μg of NM23-H2 and incubated in Reaction Buffer containing 40 mm KCl and 1.5 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by heating for 10 min at 90 °C, and the bulk DNA was exhaustively digested with 30 units of DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 145 units of exonuclease III (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at 37 °C; this treatment was repeated for an additional 6 h. One sample was further treated for 60 min with 500 μg/ml proteinase K. The reaction mixtures were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid by incubation on ice for 30 min. The centrifuged pellets were rinsed with trichloroacetic acid and ethanol, dried, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min the samples were resolved on 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 1 h, destained overnight in 20% acetic acid, 10% methanol, and vacuum-dried prior to photography and exposure to x-ray film. Molecular mass standards were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Reactions of NM23-H2 with 105-bp DNA fragments (26Postel E.H. Weiss V.H. Beneken J. Kirtane A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The radiolabeled protein-DNA complexes were excised and eluted into buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with gentle rolling for 6 h at room temperature. The eluted complexes were acetone-precipitated, dissolved in SDS sample buffer, boiled, and loaded onto 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels. The wet gels were exposed to film at 4 °C overnight, followed by immunoblotting as described previously (26Postel E.H. Weiss V.H. Beneken J. Kirtane A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6892-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After the initial DNA-binding reaction, some of the samples were treated with 0.01% glutaraldehyde for 20 min in order to produce dimers and higher order NM23 oligomers (26Postel E.H. Weiss V.H. Beneken J. Kirtane A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6892-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as markers for migration. Uniquely end-labeled 57-bp DNA fragments were incubated in standard reactions with varying amounts of KCl, followed by the addition of SDS, EDTA, and, as indicated, proteinase K treatment. The reactions were diluted 2-fold with sequencing gel-loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 90 °C, and loaded onto 5 or 8% sequencing gels. NM23-H2 was previously identified in our laboratory as a DNA-binding protein with affinity for a polypurine/polypyrimidine sequence of the human c-MYCpromoter, termed NHE (see Ref. 23Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar; Fig.1). In the context of these studies we noted that purified NM23-H2 preparations also cleaved the substrate DNA, provided it contained the NHE sequence (Fig.2, lanes 2 and 3). Unrelated DNA or oligonucleotides that did not bind NM23-H2 (23Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) were not cleaved by the enzyme (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and5), indicating that the cleavage of DNA, like the DNA binding, is sequence-dependent. NM23-H2 mutant proteins known to be defective in DNA binding (26Postel E.H. Weiss V.H. Beneken J. Kirtane A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6892-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed significantly reduced cleaving activity in comparison with wild type (Fig. 2, lanes 6 versus 7). Additional experiments indicated that NM23 proteins purified by affinity chromatography through Blue Sepharose (19Lascu I. Morera S. Chiadmi M. Cherfils J. Janin J. Veron M. Marshak D.R. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. VII. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 209-217Google Scholar) or Reactive Yellow (27Yi X. Sweitzer N. Otero A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) also contained DNA binding and cleaving activity. 2Molecular Biology Corelab students, Princeton University, and E. H. Postel, unpublished results. These observations suggested that the cleavage of DNA by NM23-H2 depends on an intrinsic component of the wild type protein and that the cleavage is functionally related to the DNA binding activity. Experiments examining the role of metal ions on DNA cleavage indicated that cleavage was stimulated by Mg2+ ions (Fig.3 A), whereas KCl was inhibitory (Fig. 3 B). When EDTA was included in the reaction, the cleavage was virtually abolished (Fig. 3 C,lanes 3 versus 2 and 8 versus 7). However, when EDTA was added at the end of the cleavage reaction followed by proteinase K treatment, the cleavages were restored almost completely in both the uniquely end-labeled 3′- and 5′-end DNA fragments (Fig.3 C, lanes 4 versus 2 and 9 versus 7). These results demonstrated that 1) DNA breaks occur in both strands and 2) that the breaks can be restored upon removal of divalent cations by EDTA treatment; the latter suggests that the cleavage reaction is mediated by a covalent protein-DNA complex. The high energy cofactor ATP was not required for the cleaving activity; in fact, 1 mm ATP was inhibitory (Fig.3 C, lanes 5 versus 2 and 10 versus 7). Because the inhibition depended, to some extent, on the order of addition of ATP and MgCl2, it was probably due in part to tying up Mg2+ ions. Since KCl or EDTA did not significantly affect the DNA binding, it seems likely that the binding and cleavage of DNA are separate steps and that the binding is a prerequisite for the cleaving activity. To confirm that the breaks occur in both DNA strands and to determine the size of the newly produced fragments, the products of the cleavage reaction were analyzed on sequencing gels (29Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5477) Google Scholar). The use of denaturing gels allows the visualization of a break produced in a single strand that is uniquely end-labeled. With the 57-bp c-MYC DNA fragment labeled at the EcoRI restriction site, we located a strong cleavage site at 12 nucleotides from the 3′-end on the top strand (Fig. 4 A, lane 6). Several additional but less prominent cleavages were also noted in the top strand, all appearing between the first and second cytosine residues, counting from the 3′-end, of the CTCCCCA directly repeated sequence (indicated by small arrows on theright side panel). A prominent break also occurred in the 5′-end-labeled bottom strand between the fifth and sixth guanines in the first repeat element, at 17 nucleotides from the 5′-end (Fig.4 A, lane 3). This indicated that the fragment that was cleaved off at the 5′-end was longer, by 5 nucleotides, than the fragment released from the 3′-end. Of several minor cleavages on the bottom strand, at least one other occurred between the fifth and sixth position in the next repeat element (lane 3, marked by asmall arrow on the right side panel). These and several other independent experiments established the following: 1) DNA is cleaved in both strands; 2) the cleaved DNA ends are staggered with single-stranded 3′ termini; and 3) the strand breaks occur ∼5 bp apart. A schematic representation of these findings is shown in Fig.4 B. Chemical sequencing (29Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5477) Google Scholar) of gel-purified DNA cleavage products confirmed the major cleavage sites on both strands. 3E. H. Postel, unpublished results. Because the natural DNA-binding substrate of NM23-H2 is a potentially distorted DNA region that may be under superhelical stress, we considered the possibility that NM23 may have DNA topoisomerase-like activity, binding and cleaving this structure in order to relax it. To test for such an activity, NM23-H2 protein was incubated with supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA containing the 57-bp c-MYC, NHE sequence; the reaction was terminated with detergent and the protein removed by proteinase K treatment, and the products were monitored by horizontal agarose gel electrophoresis. Under standard DNA-binding conditions, i.e.in the presence of 120 mm KCl and saturating (stoichiometric) amounts of protein (greater than a 1:2 hexamer to plasmid ratio), NM23-H2 had no relaxation activity and yielded products that comigrated with nicked (open circular) and cleaved unit length (linear) plasmids (Fig. 5 A). In most cases, however, when the presumed “open circular” plasmids were gel-purified and subjected to a second round of electrophoresis, more than half of these structures comigrated with the linear products, indicating that the open circular products are a mixed population. Nonetheless, the conversion of negatively supercoiled plasmids to nicked circular DNA suggests the production of single-stranded breaks, whereas the presence of linear molecules signify double-stranded cleavage. The structure of these plasmid products, and the relationship of the nicking and cleaving, remain to be addressed. It should be noted here that the cleavage of plasmid DNA, like that of linear DNA fragments, occurs in the absence of detergent, although SDS can liberate additional fragments from one DNA end (see Fig.7 B). Therefore, SDS, EDTA, and proteinase K were routinely added at the end to terminate the reactions and remove NM23.Figure 7NM23-H2 binds to cleaved DNA at the 5′-phosphoryl end and has free 3′-hydroxyl groups.

Seven different subunits (P2X1-P2X7) have been molecularly cloned and are known to form homomeric, and in some cases heteromeric, channel complexes. However, the molecular determinants leading to the assembly of subunits into P2X receptors are unknown. To address this question we utilized a co-immunoprecipitation assay in which epitope-tagged deletion mutants and chimeric constructs were examined for their ability to co-associate with full-length P2X subunits. Deletion mutants of the P2X2 receptor subunit were expressed individually and together with P2X2 or P2X3 receptor subunits in HEK 293 cells. Deletion of the amino terminus up to the first transmembrane domain (amino acid 28) and beyond (to amino acid 51) did not prevent subunit assembly. Analysis of the carboxyl terminus demonstrated that mutants missing the portion of the protein downstream of the second transmembrane domain could also still co-assemble. However, a mutant terminating 25 amino acids before the second transmembrane domain could not assemble with other subunits or itself, implicating the missing region of the protein in assembly. This finding was supported and extended by data utilizing a chimera strategy that indicated TMD2 is a critical determinant of P2X subunit assembly.

Ligand-gated ion channels (ionotropic receptors) are oligomeric protein complexes formed by the specific association of homologous subunits (1Unwin Neuron. 1989; 3: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). All of the known ionotropic receptors are members of families composed of multiple subunit genes, each encoding proteins with unique biophysical and pharmacological properties (2Barnard E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Co-assembly among the subunit proteins of any particular family results in the formation of homo- and/or hetero-oligomeric receptors. For some families, this subunit-subunit interaction occurs in a promiscuous fashion, whereas in other families, there appears to be specific restrictions placed on which productive interactions are allowed (3Seeburg P.H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 4Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P.

Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 291-313PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical and cellular mechanisms underlying assembly of subunits into functional receptor complexes are complex and poorly understood (for review, see Refs. 6Green W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 7Keller S.H. Taylor P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Receptor families formed by subunits containing four transmembrane domains (4TMD) 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; aa, amino acid(s); MEM, minimal essential medium; HA, hemagglutinin, HEK 293 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline-Tween have been extensively used as models to investigate the rules governing ionotropic receptor assembly and stoichiometry. The best studied is the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which contains four different subunits that combine to form pentameric hetero-oligomers (8Devillers-Thiery A. Galzi J.L. Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The nAChR appears to be assembled using a stepwise pathway, and critical motifs involved in initial subunit assembly events reside in the large extracellular amino-terminal domain of each subunit (9Yu X.-M. Hall Z.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Sumikawa K. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 13: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, this receptor type has rigid constraints placed on the composition and stoichiometry of its constituent subunits such that only particular subunit-subunit interactions are allowed as intermediates and as final complexes (4Kreienkamp H.J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Keller S.H. Taylor P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Such constraints are not observed in other 4TMD receptor families, and this divergence in assembly rules raises a concern of whether the process found for the nAChR is representative of a template used by all ionotropic receptors. Unlike the 4TMD receptors mentioned above, the ionotropic receptors for extracellular ATP (P2X receptors) have been found to have a much different topological arrangement. P2X subunits have only two TMDs, yielding a topology that places their amino- and carboxyl termini in the intracellular compartment and the loop connecting the two TMD extracellular (12Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Newbolt A. Stoop R. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North R.A. Buell G. Rassendren F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15177-15182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that, like the 4TMD receptors, P2X subunits can participate in the formation of homo- and hetero-oligomeric channel assemblies (14Radford K.M. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North R.A. Kawashima E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6529-6533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Torres G.T. Haines W.R. Egan T.E. Voigt M.M. Mol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Thus, the P2X receptors represent a new and perhaps simpler model system for the investigation of mechanisms involved in the subunit assembly of other members of the ligand-gated receptor family. In an effort to identify the domain(s) of the P2X subunit protein that are critically important for productive subunit assembly, we systematically examined the involvement of the amino terminus, carboxyl terminus, and TMDs in subunit-subunit interaction between subunits transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. Using a co-immunoprecipitation assay to analyze homomeric and heteromeric assembly of a combination of truncated and chimeric constructs from different P2X subunits, we report here that in contrast to the nAChR, it is the second TMD of P2X subunits that carries a critical determinant of specific subunit-subunit interactions. The full-length cDNA for the rat P2X2 receptor subunit was obtained from Dr. D. Julius, whereas the cDNAs for P2X1, P2X3, and P2X6 receptor subunits were cloned as described previously (17Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). PCR-based mutagenesis (36 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min) was used to incorporate the FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope into the amino terminus, following the first methionine (P2X2-NFLAG) or into the carboxyl-terminal end, followed by a stop codon (P2X2-CFLAG), of the P2X2 subunit. After PCR mutagenesis, restriction fragments containing epitope-tagged sequences were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRK-5. Amino-terminal truncations ΔN7, ΔN14, ΔN22, ΔN28, ΔN35, and ΔN51 (numbers indicate the quantity of residues deleted starting from the wild type-initiating Met) were generated using P2X2-CFLAG as a PCR template, a flanking 3′ primer, and 5′ oligonucleotide primers containing methionine codons and the specific sequences of the new amino termini. Because construct ΔN51 starts in the extracellular loop of P2X2, we fused the signal peptide sequence (MRGSLCLALAASILHVSL) of the rat α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit (18Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) to the P2X2 sequence beginning at amino acid (aa) 52 to direct the membrane translocation of the new amino-terminal domain. Carboxyl-terminal-truncated subunits ΔC387, ΔC380, ΔC370, ΔC362, and ΔC304 (numbers indicate last amino acid position before stop codon) were created using P2X2-NFLAG as a PCR template with 5′-flanking primers and 3′ oligonucleotide primers containing stop codons in addition to the specific carboxyl terminus sequences. The HA (YPYDVPDYA) epitope was inserted into the carboxyl termini of P2X2, P2X3, and P2X6 by PCR-based mutagenesis, and these constructs were subcloned into pRK-5. Chimeric constructs between P2X1 and P2X3 were constructed by performing two successive PCR amplifications using 5′ and 3′ primers containing overlapping regions between P2X1and P2X3. The primers used had the following sequences: for 1.3.1, post-TMD1 overlap oligos encoded aa VYEK/AYQV (corresponding to aa 50–53 for P2X1, 47–50 for P2X3), and the pre-TMD2 overlap oligos encoded aa AGKF/DIIP (aa313–316 from P2X3, aa327–330 from P2X1); for 3.1.3, the post-TMD1 overlap oligos encoded aa LHEK/GYQT (aa 43–46 from P2X3, aa54–57 from P2X1), and the pre-TMD2 overlap oligos encoded aa AGKF/NIIP (aa 323–326 from P2X1, aa317–320 from P2X3). These reactions yielded two constructs: chimera 1.3.1 consists of the amino-terminal and first TMD of P2X1 followed by the extracellular region of P2X3 up to 2–4 aa from the second TMD, at which point the protein reverts to P2X1 until the final stop codon. Chimera 3.1.3 consists of the amino terminus and first TMD of P2X3, the extracellular domain of P2X1, and second TMD and carboxyl terminus of P2X3. These chimeras were tagged at the carboxyl terminus with the FLAG epitope as described above. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing with the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using the deaza-T7 Sequenase kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. cDNAs encoding the wild type and mutant P2X subunits were expressed individually or in different combinations in HEK 293 cells. 35-mm dishes containing 3 × 105 cells were incubated with 1 μg of total cDNA mixed with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of serum-free medium. After 5 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with MEM, and cells were incubated for another 40–48 h. Whole cell recordings were obtained from single HEK 293 cells using AxoPatch 200 series amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and low resistance electrodes (1–2 megaohms). The typical holding voltage was −40 mV. Recording pipettes were filled with the following intracellular solution: 150 in mm CsCl, 10 in mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 in mm EGTA, 10 in mm HEPES, pH 7.3 with CsOH. The extracellular solution was: 150 in mm NaCl, 1.0 in mm CaCl2 1 in mm MgCl2, 10 in mm glucose, 10 in mm HEPES, pH 7.3 with NaOH. ATP (30 μm) was applied by manually moving the electrode and attached cell into the line of flow of solutions, exiting an array of inlets tubes lying side by side. Confluent monolayers of HEK 293 cells in 35-mm dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with gentle agitation for 30 min at room temperature with 0.5 ml of 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. The reaction was quenched by incubating the cells for an additional 10 min with 50 mm ammonium chloride in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in solubilization buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin in phosphate- buffered saline) at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) in the presence of 50 μl of protein G Gamma-Bind-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with solubilization buffer and resuspended in protein sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked overnight in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 145 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h with streptavidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Filters were washed extensively in TBS-T, and immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, transfected HEK 293 cells were solubilized without immunoprecipitation, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were incubated with 10 μg/ml of the anti-FLAG antibody. After several washes with TBS-T, filters were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody for 1 h. Filters were washed extensively in TBS-T, and immunoreactivity was detected with the ECL detection kit. Similar to all other known ligand-gated ion channels, P2X subunits can form homo- and/or hetero-oligomeric receptor channels when expressed in heterologous systems such as HEK 293 cells (17Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). As the amino-terminal region of 4TMD ionotropic receptors has been implicated in subunit assembly (10Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether this domain was also involved in P2X subunit assembly. We therefore created deletion mutants of P2X2lacking the first 7, 14, 22, and 28 aa (designated ΔN7 through ΔN28, Fig. 1 A). In each case an initial methionine was engineered into the truncated sequence to ensure correct translation. These nested deletions cover the portion of the protein up to the first TMD (predicted to span aa 32–52, approximately), and the truncated proteins were tagged with the FLAG epitope at the carboxyl terminus to allow for immunodetection after expression in HEK 293 cells. As seen in Fig. 1 B, all deletion mutants were efficiently synthesized and were of the predicted size. When the four deletion mutants were tested for functionality, only the ΔN7 mutant gave whole cell currents gated by ATP (Fig.1 C). Currents from cells expressing ΔN7 were similar to those observed in cells transfected with the full-length P2X2 receptor and, superficially, the activation and deactivation kinetics for the responses did not differ from wild type P2X2. To determine whether the lack of function of the other three deletion mutants was a result of disruption in the mutants' protein processing and/or sorting, leading to the absence of receptor molecules on the plasma membrane, cells transfected with these constructs were incubated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. This compound binds to free amino groups of proteins and, because it is membrane impermeant in intact cells, can be used to distinguish between cell surface and intracellular proteins. Membranes labeled with Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin were solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody. Precipitates were then electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose, and biotinylated protein was detected with streptavidin. As shown in Fig. 1 D, all four amino-terminal deletion mutants yielded labeled proteins when transfected, indicating that they were present on the cell surface. This suggested that the absence of functional expression was not because of lack of their delivery to the cell membrane. Next, we examined the ability of the amino-terminal deletion mutants to co-associate with full-length P2X2 receptor subunits. Because assembly would be predicted to depend upon the interaction of specific recognition sequences between subunits, we hypothesized that if the amino-terminal domain did contain a motif critical for P2X subunit-subunit interaction, then deletion mutants missing such a motif would fail to interact with full-length P2X subunits. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a co-immunoprecipitation assay in which each of the FLAG-tagged P2X2 deletion constructs were individually co-expressed with the full-length P2X2 subunit tagged with the HA epitope. Deletion mutants were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the presence of P2X2.HA was detected on Western blots using the anti-HA antibody. This strategy provided the means to specifically isolate and analyze stable complexes consisting of mutant and wild type subunits. Membranes from transfected cells were solubilized with detergent (1% Nonidet P-40), and P2X receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. As a positive control, we also tested the co-expression of P2X2.FLAG with P2X2.HA. As expected, P2X2.FLAG co-precipitated with P2X2.HA, and this interaction was observed only when both constructs were co-expressed in cells, as simply mixing lysates from cells expressing individual subunits did not result in co-precipitation (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of each of the deletion mutants with the anti-FLAG antibody also resulted in the co-precipitation of full-length P2X2.HA (also Fig. 2 A). Thus, deletion of the amino terminus of P2X2 up to the first TMD did not prevent homomeric association of P2X2 receptor subunits. Because P2X2 can also co-associate with P2X3 to form hetero-oligomeric receptors, we tested whether the amino terminus of P2X2 might be involved in hetero-oligomeric assembly by co-transfecting each of the deletion mutants with P2X3.HA. In each case we detected specific and stable interactions (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that in the absence of the amino terminus, the mutant P2X2 subunits still contained recognition sequences directing both homo- and hetero-oligomeric channel assembly. Because the previous experiments ruled out the amino-terminal domain as being critical for assembly, our attention next turned to the carboxyl terminus. To investigate the role of this region in P2X receptor assembly, we made a series of deletions of the P2X2 receptor subunit at amino acid positions 362, 370, 380, and 387 (designated ΔC362 through ΔC387, Fig. 3 A) by introducing stop codons immediately following those residues. These constructs were tagged with the FLAG epitope at the amino terminus. All carboxyl-terminal-truncated subunits expressed well in HEK 293 cells and gave proteins of the appropriate molecular size (Fig.3 B). Whole cell recordings from HEK 293 cells expressing each of these mutants revealed that progressive deletions of the carboxyl terminus of P2X2 to amino acid 362 (which is just on the presumed intracellular side of the TMD2 region, thought to span from aa 328 to 356) did not prevent the formation of functional ATP-gated channels (Fig. 3 C). Although the kinetics of activation and desensitization for the ΔC387, ΔC380, and ΔC370 mutants compared with wild type channels were not altered, there was an appreciable difference in both the size and the rate of desensitization of currents given by ΔC362. The fact that all of these carboxyl-terminal mutants were functional implied that they retained the ability to form homo-oligomers, and indeed we found that these carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants immunoprecipitated co-transfected P2X2.HA (Fig.3 D). These interactions occurred only after co-expression of the full-length and mutant subunits and were not detectable when lysates from cells expressing individual subunits were mixed before immunoprecipitation. These findings were also extended to hetero-oligomeric assembly properties, as specific and stable interactions were observed between each of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants and P2X3.HA (Fig. 3 E). These results therefore provide direct evidence that the bulk of the intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail of P2X2 does not play a critical role in either homo- or heteromeric channel assembly. As deletion of either of the intracellular domains did not prevent the oligomerization of P2X2 subunits, we next tested the possibility that one or both of the TMDs were important for this process. This was accomplished through the engineering of two different constructs. For the first construct, the first TMD was removed by deleting the amino terminus to aa 51 (ΔN51). To enable the proper membrane orientation of the ΔN51 protein (which begins at an extracellular site), we fused the signal peptide from the rat α7 nAChR (MRGSLCLALAASILHVSL) to the truncated P2X2 sequence beginning at aa 51. To test the role of the second TMD, we generated a construct in which a stop codon was introduced at aa 304 (ΔC304), resulting in a protein missing both the second TMD and carboxyl terminus. Both constructs were epitope-tagged with FLAG at their nondeleted termini and are shown in Fig.4 A. Neither of these mutants produced functional ATP-gated channels. 2G. E.Torres, T. M. Egan, and M. M. Voigt, unpublished observation. As shown in Fig. 4 B, ΔN51 was expressed at high levels in transfected cells. Its apparent molecular weight was decreased after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the protein was glycosylated and had achieved the appropriate transmembrane orientation. This mutant was able to co-assemble with either P2X2.HA or P2X3.HA (Fig. 4 C), thus effectively ruling out TMD1 as being critical for assembly. In contrast, ΔC304 did not assemble with either P2X2.HA or P2X3.HA (Fig. 4 D). Additionally, no self-assembly of ΔC304 was observed in cells co-transfected with two different ΔC304 constructs, differentially tagged with the FLAG and HA epitopes (Fig. 4D), thus ruling out the possibility that the negative co-assembly results were because of the mutant protein preferentially associating with itself rather than with the full-length wild type proteins. Another possible explanation for the lack of assembly could be that the truncated protein is not inserted into the membrane correctly. However, tunicamycin treatment of cells transfected with ΔC304 produced a downward shift in the apparent molecular mass of the protein (Fig. 4 E), indicating that glycosylation had occurred. This in turn suggests that the truncated protein was inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in the appropriate orientation, as the only N-glycosylation consensus sites present in the protein exist in the extracellular loop. Taken together, the results of studies using both of these truncated proteins support the hypothesis that the region of the P2X2 subunit lying between aa 304 and aa 362 is critical for co-assembly, with an obvious candidate for such an interaction being TMD2. To verify the role of TMD2 in assembly, we used intact proteins rather than truncated ones so that obvious concerns regarding appropriate subunit folding would be reduced. Therefore, a chimeric approach was chosen to investigate the question of TMD2 involvement in assembly. We have previously reported that the hetero-oligomeric association of different P2X subunits is selective (17Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). One result pertinent to our experimental design was that P2X6 could co-immunoprecipitate either P2X1 or P2X2 but not P2X3 when co-expressed in HEK 293 cells. We reasoned that exploiting these intrinsic subunit properties through the use of chimeric receptor subunits would enable us to establish that it is a TMD and not the extracellular domain that is critical for productive P2X subunit assembly. In designing the chimeric constructs, we were cognizant that two subunits with such widely differing biophysical and pharmacological properties as P2X2 and P2X3 could yield problematic chimeric proteins. So instead of P2X2, we chose to use the P2X1 subunit, which functionally is nearly identical to P2X3. Two chimeric constructs were then engineered: 1.3.1, in which only the extracellular domain was from P2X3 and the rest of the flanking protein from P2X1, and 3.1.3, in which the extracellular domain of P2X1 was flanked by the amino and carboxyl termini of P2X3 (shown schematically in Fig.5 A). We inserted the FLAG epitope into the carboxyl termini of both constructs and then tested whether either of these chimeric constructs could co-precipitate with P2X6.HA when co-expressed in HEK 293 cells. As Fig.5 B shows, the chimera 1.3.1.FLAG was able to co-precipitate P2X6.HA when co-transfected, whereas 3.1.3.FLAG could not. In contrast, both chimeras were able to individually co-precipitate P2X1.HA (Fig. 5 C). This supports the contention that a TMD contains a critical motif for subunit-specific assembly. Most previous studies investigating the processes underlying the assembly and formation of ionotropic receptors have used the 4TMD muscle-nAChR as the model system. Such studies have demonstrated that assembly occurs in a stepwise fashion, with the four monomeric subunits assembling into specific hetero-oligomeric intermediates through interactions of motifs present on their amino-terminal domains before the mature pentameric assembly is formed (6Green W.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Keller S.H. Taylor P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, not all ionotropic receptors have a similar stoichiometry or topology to the nAChRs (e.g. ionotropic glutamate or P2X receptors). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the knowledge garnered from the nAChR studies had general applicability to other ionotropic receptors, especially the P2X receptor. We and others have previously established that P2X2subunits can assemble into homo- and/or hetero-oligomeric channels when co-expressed in HEK 293 cells (e.g. 17, 19). As the initial step to examining the molecular determinants involved in the homo- and hetero-oligomerization of P2X receptors, a series of amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions mutant subunits were constructed and assayed for the ability to form functional channels and to specifically associate with wild type subunits in HEK 293 cells. Nested deletions of the initial 28 amino acids of the amino terminus of P2X2were found not to prevent homo- or hetero-oligomeric channel assembly. Identical results were obtained using the carboxyl-terminal-truncated subunits, in which the construct with the most minimal intracellular tail (of some 10 aa) was still able to co-assemble with either P2X2 or P2X3. Interestingly, our data indicate that although the amino terminus does not play a critical role in the membrane insertion and plasma membrane targeting of the protein, it does influence the functional attributes of the receptor shows. With the exception of ΔN7, all other amino-terminal deletions resulted in nonfunctional channels despite the fact that these proteins were expressed on the cell surface. One possible mechanism underlying these results is that the agonist binding and/or gating properties of the mutant channels are altered through effects mediated by the first TMD. In contrast to the results with the amino-terminal deletions, we found that removal of almost the entire intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain did not result in loss of channel function. However, the results from the carboxyl-terminal nested deletions did show that the desensitization properties of the P2X subunit can be modulated by a stretch of eight amino acids just downstream of TMD2. This stretch of primary sequence contains a number of charged and aromatic amino acids, and future site-directed mutagenesis experiments should be useful in delineating the roles that these residues play in receptor desensitization. As neither the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains appeared to be important for assembly, the next step was to investigate the role of either of the TMDs. We were unable to observe any interaction between a deletion mutant subunit lacking the second transmembrane domain (ΔC304) with either of the wild type subunits. This lack of interaction was not the result of improper targeting and insertion of this protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as evidenced by its glycosylation (as the only N-linked consensus sites are present in the extracellular domain of the protein). In fact, the inability of this mutant to even co-assemble with itself suggests that it does not contain recognition sequences required for subunit assembly. We could not, however, rule out the possibility that the lack of co-assembly by ΔC304 was the result of an inadequate secondary or tertiary structure. An additional consideration was a report by Kimet al. (20Kim M. Yoo O.J. Choe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), in which they described the self-assembly into tetramers of a bacterial fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of P2X2. Therefore we also wanted to rule in, or out, the importance of the extracellular domain of full-length P2X subunits in their assembly. For those reasons, our next step was to use an alternative approach for verifying the deletion mutant analysis. The truncation studies had pointed to the area of the P2X2 protein next to and including the second TMD as carrying a pivotal determinant for subunit co-assembly. We therefore constructed chimeras derived from P2X1 and P2X3 so that only the extracellular domain, which lies between the two TMDs, was exchanged and then tested for their co-assembly with P2X6 (which will co-assemble with P2X1 but not P2X3). These experiments demonstrated that an extracellular loop comprised of P2X1sequence (construct 3.1.3) was not sufficient to direct co-assembly with P2X6 and that an extracellular domain derived from P2X3 (construct 1.3.1) did not prevent co-assembly with P2X6. In both cases, the individual chimeras did co-assemble with P2X1, thus demonstrating that the failure of the 3.1.3 chimera to co-assemble with P2X6 is not because of impairment of assembly but rather to the lack of a domain promoting or stabilizing specific subunit-subunit interactions. These findings lead us to two conclusions. First, they demonstrate that the extracellular region on its own is not sufficient for assembly of full-sized subunits to occur, and second, they support the idea that a TMD is involved in allowing productive subunit-subunit interaction to occur. When these results are combined with those from the deletional studies, the most parsimonious explanation is that the TMD2 of P2X subunits contains a critical determinant for productive subunit co-assembly. This postulate does not rule out other areas of the protein as being involved in assembly, but it assumes that such domains play a subservient role in allowing and/or maintaining subunit assembly than does TMD2. In summary, we report here that the assembly of the ATP-gated P2X receptors is dependent upon a motif(s) present in the second TMD of the protein. This is in marked contrast to what has been shown for the 4TMD muscle-nAChR, in which the amino terminus has been shown to be important for assembly. Thus, the findings presented in this report demonstrate that not all ligand-gated ion channels undergo assembly using a generic process."

Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are necessary for normal cell growth, and their proliferative effects are probably due to stimulation of nucleic acid and protein synthesis (1Tabor C.W.

In a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system, under conditions in which spermidine produced a maximal stimulation of globin synthesis, the amount of polyamine bound to RNA was very close to the value estimated for intact cells, suggesting an important physiological role for polyamines bound to RNA (10Ogasawara T.

We found that stimulation of OppA synthesis by polyamines occurs at the level of translation and that the position and secondary structure of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence (13Shine J. Dalgarno L.

In the present work we wanted to clarify the nature of the structural change of OppA mRNA induced by polyamines that is responsible for stimulation of OppA protein synthesis. For this purpose, four different 130-mer mRNAs containing the initiation region of OppA were synthesized in vitro and used to study both the structural change of the OppA mRNA induced by polyamines and polyamine stimulation of initiation complex formation. The results show that polyamines cause a structural change of the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG, facilitating formation of the initiation complex.

Triplet AUG, PI-19 (5′-GAGGGAGUCCCAAUGACCA-3′), and PI-25 (5′-GAGGGAGUCCAAAAAACAAUGACCA-3′) were synthesized by DNA/RNA synthesizer Expedite 8909 (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Templates used for the first PCR for constructs I, II, and III were pMW211, pMW9-lacZ, and pMWSD2, respectively, in addition to pBluescript II SK+. Primers used for the first PCR were P2/P3 and P4/P1 for construct I, P2/P3 and P4/P9 for construct II, and P2/P5 and P1/P6 for construct III. Then, second PCRs for constructs I and III and for construct II were performed using the first PCR products as templates and P1/P2 and P2/P9 as primers, respectively. Three PCR products thus obtained were digested withNheI and HindIII and inserted into the same restriction sites of pSP64 (Promega). PI-SD* (IV) was similarly made using construct I as the template. The first PCR was performed using P2/P8 and P1/P7 as primers, and the second PCR was performed using the first PCR product as the template and P1/P2 as the primer. The product was inserted into pSP64 as described above. The nucleotide sequence of the four DNAs was confirmed by the DNA sequencer DSQ-1000 (Shimadzu, Japan). Four kinds of 130-mer OppA mRNAs (PI-130, PI-lacZ, PI-SD2, and PI-SD*) were synthesized from T7 promoter-fused constructs I, II, III, and IV, respectively, by T7 RNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNAs were linearized byHindIII prior to the reaction. PI-71 mRNA was prepared by T7 RNA polymerase using a single-stranded PI-71 DNA template and T7 promoter primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATA-3′). The reaction mixture (0.1 ml) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmGTP, 90 μg (33.3 pmol) of salt-washed ribosomes, 14 μg of crude initiation factors, 18.7 pmol of [3H]fMet-tRNA, AUG or various kinds of OppA mRNA at the specified concentration, and Mg2+ and spermidine at the indicated concentrations was incubated at 30 °C for 4 min. The reaction mixture was passed through a cellulose nitrate filter (pore size, 0.45 μm) (ADVANTEC, Japan). The filter was washed with 10 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm Mg2+. Radioactivity on the filter was measured with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The reaction was linear during incubation. 32 P-Labeled OppA mRNAs—The reaction mixture (20 μl) for limited RNase digestion contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm Mg2+, 100 mm KCl, 5 × 104 cpm 5′-32P-labeled OppA mRNA, 2 μg of yeast tRNA (Sigma), and spermidine at the specified concentration and was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, 0.12 unit of RNase T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 0.058 unit of RNase V1 (cobra venom, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and incubated further at 30 °C for 15 or 10 min, respectively. The 5′-32P-labeled OppA mRNA used was prepared with [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 148 TBq/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (TOYOBO, Japan) and purified according to the method of Donis-Keller et al. (17Donis-Keller H. Maxam A.H. Gilbert W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 5: 2527-2538Crossref Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.3 ml (30 μg) of yeast tRNA and 0.3 ml of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:50:1). The RNA fragments were recovered from the water layer by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in 10 μl of a solution of 7 m urea, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue. Gel electrophoresis was performed by the procedure of Donis-Keller et al. (17Donis-Keller H. Maxam A.H. Gilbert W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 5: 2527-2538Crossref Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified using a Fujix Bas 2000 II imaging analyzer. Optimal computer folding of mRNAs was performed by the method of Zucker and Stiegler (18Zucker M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 6: 133-148Crossref Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Free energy (ΔG) for the formation of the secondary structure was calculated on the basis of the data of Turner and Sugimoto (19Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). We have shown that the SD sequence of OppA mRNA is absolutely necessary for OppA synthesis (14Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Gualerzi and co-workers (20Calogero R.A. Pon C.L. Canonaco M.A. Gualerzi C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6427-6431Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) showed that the SD sequence is necessary for efficient initiation complex formation using an artificial 126-mer mRNA. However, the size of mRNA necessary for efficient recognition of the SD sequence has not been determined. Therefore, we initially carried out experiments to determine the size of OppA mRNA necessary for efficient recognition of the SD sequence. Several different OppA mRNAs of different sizes and with differences in the position of the SD sequence were synthesized (Fig.1). The effects of these mRNAs on fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes were measured by adding increasing amounts of mRNA. In Table I, the relative activities of these mRNAs are shown as a function of the amount of mRNA that caused maximal binding of fMet-tRNA to ribosomes. In the case of AUG, 90 times more mRNA (3 nmol) than ribosomes (33 pmol) and 11 mm Mg2+ were necessary for maximal binding. When the SD sequence was fused to the initiation codon AUG (PI-25), maximal fMet-tRNA binding was obtained in a molar ratio for mRNA and ribosomes of 30 to 1 (i.e.the affinity of mRNA for ribosomes increased by 3-fold), and the optimal Mg2+ concentration decreased to 9 mm. When the SD sequence was positioned only five nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon AUG (PI-19), the maximal binding activity was almost the same as that seen with PI-25, but the affinity for ribosomes decreased compared with PI-25. The results suggest that a high concentration of Mg2+ (9–11 mm) is necessary for small mRNAs to direct fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes. With PI-71, the affinity for ribosomes increased greatly, and the optimal Mg2+ concentration decreased to 6 mm. However, the maximal fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes was still 2.91 pmol. With PI-130 mRNA, an increase in affinity for ribosomes, a lowering of the optimal Mg2+ concentration, and a large increase in maximal fMet-tRNA binding were observed. The results suggest that more than 100 nucleotides are required for efficient recognition of the OppA SD sequence during initiation complex formation.Table IBinding of fMet-tRNA to ribosomes directed by various sizes of OppA mRNAsmRNAmRNA/ribosomesOptimal Mg2+fMet-tRNA boundmmpmolAUG90112.12PI-1910091.27PI-253091.31PI-71562.91PI-130349.14The molar ratio of mRNA to ribosomes is the ratio in which the maximal fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes was obtained.

Assay was performed in the presence of various concentrations of Mg2+, and each value is the average of two determinations at the optimal Mg2+ concentration. The effects of spermidine on fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes were examined in the presence of different concentrations of Mg2+. Binding of fMet-tRNA to ribosomes directed by AUG, PI-19, and PI-25 was slightly stimulated by 1–2 mm spermidine (approximately 1.1-fold) in the presence of 6–11 mm Mg2+, and higher concentrations of spermidine did not influence fMet-tRNA binding (data not shown). When PI-71 was used as the mRNA, spermidine significantly stimulated fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes, but 4–6 mm spermidine was necessary to cause stimulation (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that PI-71 includes a GC-rich stem I structure (see Fig. 3), which was suggested to be the binding site of spermidine in a previous publication (14Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Figure 3Effect of spermidine on sensitivity of PI-71 mRNA to RNase T1.

A decrease in the optimal Mg2+ and spermidine concentrations was observed with the increasing size of the OppA mRNA, suggesting that low concentrations of Mg2+ and spermidine may be enough to maintain a suitable conformation of long mRNAs. We examined the effect of spermidine on fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes directed by other 130-mer OppA mRNAs. These experiments were designed to clarify the structural change of the OppA mRNA induced by polyamines that is necessary for stimulation of fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes. PI-lacZ mRNA consists of the 5′-untranslated region of OppA mRNA fused with the open reading frame oflacZ, so that the GC-rich stem I structure is modified. In PI-SD2, the triple Gs in the GC-rich stem I were replaced by triple Us, and in PI-SD* the SD sequence was positioned at the typical site, seven nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon AUG (Fig. 1). When PI-lacZ, PI-SD2, and PI-SD* were used as mRNAs, 0.5–1 mm spermidine slightly stimulated fMet-tRNA binding in the presence of 2–3 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 2). The maximal fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes in the presence of spermidine was PI-130 > PI-SD* > PI-lacZ > PI-SD2. Thus, the levels of both polyamine stimulation and of initiation complex formation were parallel with the effects of these mRNAs on protein synthesis previously determined in vivo (14Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the equilibrium between 70 S ribosomes and the 30 S and 50 S subunits is influenced by polyamines (21Favaudon V. Pochon F. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3903-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 22Rosano C.L. Hurwitz C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 652-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 2–3 mm Mg2+ and 100 mmK+, however, the percentage of 70 S ribosomes (70–80% of total ribosomes) was not influenced strongly by 0.5–1 mmspermidine (data not shown). The structural change of OppA mRNA induced by spermidine was examined by limited digestion of the mRNA with a single-stranded G-specific RNase T1. The digested products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. When PI-71 mRNA was used as a substrate, the G in the initiation codon AUG was easily hydrolyzed in the absence or presence of spermidine (Fig. 3). The five Gs in the SD sequence were hydrolyzed at higher concentrations of spermidine. The optimal concentration of spermidine for the hydrolysis of the SD sequence was 5–10 mm, in accordance with the results of fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes (see Fig. 2). The results indicate that a structural change of the SD sequence of PI-71 mRNA by polyamines is important for efficient fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes. The RNase T1 sensitivity of the different 130-mer OppA mRNAs was studied to determine the relationship between the structural change of the OppA mRNAs and polyamine stimulation of fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes. When PI-130 mRNA was used as a substrate, hydrolysis of the five Gs in the SD sequence and the G in the initiation codon AUG was stimulated greatly by spermidine (Fig.4). The optimal concentration of spermidine was 0.4–0.8 mm. The hydrolysis of Gs positioned at 18, 20, and 23 (see Fig. 6) was not influenced by spermidine. The results suggest that spermidine relaxes the structure of both the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG of PI-130 mRNA.Figure 6Possible secondary structure of PI-130 and PI-lacZ mRNAs and their hydrolyzed points by RNase T1and RNase V1.

SPD, spermidine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When PI-lacZ mRNA was used as a substrate, the hydrolysis of five Gs in the SD sequence was inhibited by spermidine, although the hydrolysis of the G in the initiation codon AUG was stimulated by spermidine. When PI-SD2 mRNA was used as a substrate, the five Gs in the SD sequence were relatively insensitive to RNase T1, and hydrolysis of the G in the initiation codon AUG was not influenced by spermidine. When PI-SD* mRNA was used as a substrate, the five Gs in the SD sequence and the G in the initiation codon AUG were strongly hydrolyzed, and spermidine did not influence this hydrolysis (Fig. 4). The putative secondary structures of the initiation regions of the four mRNAs are shown in Fig. 4. OppA mRNA has an unusual property in that the SD sequence is 12 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon AUG. Thus, it may be that the SD sequence and the initiation codon become closer during formation of the initiation complex and that this is important for initiation. There are no G residues in the region between the SD sequence and the initiation codon. Therefore, to look for structural changes of this region induced by spermidine, we studied sensitivity to RNase V1, which recognizes double-stranded RNA or stacked RNA (23Ehresmann C. Bandin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.-P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9228Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, the region between the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG of PI-130 and PI-lacZ became sensitive to RNase V1 in the presence of spermidine, whereas the sensitivity to RNase V1 of this region in PI-SD2 and PI-SD* was weak and did not change in the presence of spermidine. The results suggest that the relative distance between the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG becomes shorter in PI-130 and PI-lacZ but not in PI-SD2 and PI-SD*, because the loop I structure of the former two mRNAs adopts a stacking conformation. The SD sequence of PI-SD2 was hydrolyzed by RNase V1 (Fig. 5), indicating that this region makes a stem structure (see Fig. 4). The structural change of OppA mRNAs is summarized in Fig. 6 and TableII. Among four OppA mRNAs, only fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes directed by PI-130 mRNA was stimulated by spermidine (Fig. 2). In that case, the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG in the mRNA were relaxed by spermidine, and the relative distance between the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG became shorter, judging from the increased sensitivity of the loop I structure to RNase V1.Table IISummary of structural change of various OppA mRNAs by spermidinemRNASpermidine effectsHydrolysis with RNase T1Hydrolysis with RNase V1SD sequenceLoop IAUGSD sequenceLoop IAUGPI-130++no+no+noPI-lacZ−−no+no+noPI-SD2nono±±±noPI-SD*±±±nono±Results are summarized from the data of Figs. 4 and 5. ++, strong stimulation by spermidine; +, stimulation by spermidine; ±, no effect; −−, strong inhibition by spermidine; no, no hydrolysis by RNases. Open table in a new tab Results are summarized from the data of Figs. 4 and 5. ++, strong stimulation by spermidine; +, stimulation by spermidine; ±, no effect; −−, strong inhibition by spermidine; no, no hydrolysis by RNases. With PI-lacZ, the stem structure of the SD sequence was strengthened by spermidine, but the structure of the initiation codon AUG became loosened by spermidine. Furthermore, the relative distance between the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG became shorter. Thus, the two opposing effects of spermidine largely cancel each other, and spermidine has only a small net effect on PI-lacZ. With PI-SD2 and PI-SD*, spermidine does not produce a structural change of the mRNAs, and fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes was therefore not influenced by spermidine. Because the SD sequence of PI-SD* is exposed in the absence of spermidine, relatively effective fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes can occur in the absence of spermidine. It is known that the SD sequence, the initiation codon AUG, and the spacing between these two elements are important determinants of the efficiency of translational initiation (24Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a previous publication (14Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) we studied the molecular mechanism of polyamine stimulation of OppA synthesis in a polyamine-requiring mutant ofE. coli using several artificial oppA genes. Through analysis of the secondary structure by optimal computer folding of OppA mRNA, it was suggested that the degree of polyamine stimulation of OppA synthesis is dependent on the secondary structure of the SD sequence in addition to its position. In this communication, we synthesized four different 130-mer OppA mRNAs and studied the relationship between spermidine stimulation of fMet-tRNA binding to ribosomes and structural changes of OppA mRNA. We found that the strong polyamine stimulation of protein synthesis directed by natural OppA mRNA is caused by exposure of the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG due to polyamine binding to the GC-rich stem close to the SD sequence. On the other hand, the lack of effect of polyamines on protein synthesis directed by an artificial OppA mRNA (9-lacZ mRNA, including PI-lacZ initiation region) was due to stronger base pair formation of the SD sequence, perhaps because of direct polyamine binding to the stem/bulge structure containing the SD sequence (Fig. 6). It is known that spermidine can bind to RNA at a ratio of two to three molecules per 100 nucleotides of RNA (6Miyamoto S. Kashiwagi K. Ito K. Watanabe S. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20803-20809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Quigley G.J. Teeter M.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It is expected that spermidine binds to the four 130-mer mRNAs that we have studied at about the same ratio. However, the structural change induced by spermidine is different for each mRNA. Spermidine may recognize a special structure or sequence to cause a drastic structural change in the native OppA mRNA. One candidate is a bulge structure containing a GC-rich stem, like stem I in PI-130 mRNA. Such a stem structure was strengthened by spermidine (Fig. 6). In this respect, we have previously reported that only Ile-tRNA formation was stimulated by spermidine among 20 aminoacyl-tRNA formations (26Igarashi K. Eguchi K. Tanaka M. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Peng Z. Kusama-Eguchi K. Watanabe S. Ito K. Watanabe K. Nomoto Y. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 279: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The amino acid acceptor stem of tRNAIle, which is responsible for polyamine stimulation, also consists of a GC-rich stem containing one unpaired G similar to the bulge structure, and the amino acid acceptor stem structure was strengthened by polyamines. It is notable that more than 100 nucleotides are required for the SD sequence of OppA mRNA to be recognized efficiently during formation of the initiation complex. The results of this study support the idea that the region of mRNA required for the optimal initiation complex formation is considerably larger than that protected by ribosomes. We are grateful to Dr. K. Williams for help in preparing this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2074714984,"We describe a permanent line of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a cDNA encoding a truncated form of Site-1 protease (S1P) that is secreted into the culture medium in an enzymatically active form. S1P, a subtilisin-like protease, normally cleaves the luminal loop of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). This cleavage initiates the two-step proteolytic process by which the NH2-terminal domains of SREBPs are released from cell membranes for translocation to the nucleus, where they activate transcription of genes involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of cholesterol and fatty acids. Truncated S1P (amino acids 1–983), produced by the transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, lacks the COOH-terminal membrane anchor. Like native S1P, this truncated protein undergoes normal autocatalytic processing after residue 137 to release an NH2-terminal propeptide, thereby generating an active form, designated S1P-B. Prior to secretion, truncated S1P-B, like native S1P-B, is cleaved further after residue 186 to generate S1P-C, which is the only form that appears in the culture medium. The secreted enzyme, designated S1P(983)-C, cleaves a synthetic peptide that terminates in a 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin fluorochrome. This peptide, RSLK-MCA, corresponds to the internal propeptide cleavage site that generates S1P-B as described in the accompanying paper (Espenshade, P. J., Cheng, D., Goldstein, J. L., and Brown, M. S. (1999), J. Biol. Chem. 274, 22795–22804). The secreted enzyme does not cleave RSVL-MCA, a peptide corresponding to the physiologic cleavage site in SREBP-2. However, S1P(983)-C does cleave after this leucine when the RSVL sequence is contained within a 16-residue peptide corresponding to the central portion of the SREBP-2 luminal loop. The catalytic activity of S1P(983)-C differs from that of furin/prohormone convertases, two related proteases, in its more alkaline pH optimum (pH 7–8), its relative resistance to calcium chelating agents, and its ability to cleave after lysine or leucine rather than arginine. These data provide direct biochemical evidence that S1P is the protease that cleaves SREBPs and thereby functions to control lipid biosynthesis and uptake in animal cells.

The NH2-terminal domains enter the nucleus, where they enhance transcription of multiple genes encoding enzymes of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis and the low density lipoprotein receptor. Excess cholesterol inhibits its own synthesis by blocking the activity of S1P, thereby preventing the NH2-terminal domains of SREBPs from entering the nucleus. This feedback inhibition controls the cholesterol content of cells and plasma (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). The RSVLS target sequence for S1P is located in a luminal loop between two membrane-spanning helices of SREBP-2 (3Hua X. Sakai J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29422-29427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of SREBPs extend into the cytosol, and the luminal loop projects into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope. Cleavage by S1P separates SREBP-2 into two halves. This allows a second protease to cleave at Site-2, which is within the first transmembrane helix, thereby liberating the NH2-terminal domain from the membrane (4Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B.

SREBPs are complexed with a polytopic membrane protein called SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), the presence of which is required for S1P to act within cells (6Sakai J. Nohturfft A. Cheng D.

The S1P cleavage reaction has been studied in intact cells that were transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant forms of SREBP-2. S1P cleaves SREBP-2 between the leucine and serine of the sequence RSVLS (8Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12778-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cleavage absolutely requires a basic residue at the P4 position. Either of the serines or the valine can be replaced with alanine without affecting cleavage, but a leucine to valine replacement abolishes cleavage. In an accompanying paper (9Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we show that the S1P precursor is inserted into the ER lumen by virtue of a cleaved NH2-terminal signal sequence. The protein remains attached to ER membranes through a hydrophobic transmembrane segment near the COOH terminus. This segment is followed by a short positively charged sequence that extends into the cytosol. Signal peptidase generates the pro form of S1P, which is designated S1P-A. This form is inactive. S1P-A is activated by intramolecular cleavage at Site-B, which follows lysine-137. The hamster sequence at this site is RSLKF. This releases a propeptide of 115 amino acids and activates the enzyme. This propeptide is secreted from cells, apparently in an intact form. Subsequently, S1P undergoes cleavage after the second leucine of the sequence RRLLR, which removes an additional 49 amino acids and generates S1P-C (amino acids 187–1052). The carbohydrates of S1P-A and S1P-B remain endo H-sensitive, indicating that these proteins are located in pre-Golgi compartments. S1P-C is endo H-resistant, suggesting that it resides in the Golgi or more distal compartments. Mutation of the active site serine of S1P (S414A) inactivates the enzyme and prevents generation of either S1P-B or S1P-C (9Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), indicating that these cleavages are autocatalytic. Studies of S1P are facilitated by the availability of SRD-12B cells, a line of mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that fails to produce S1P mRNA and protein, owing to mutations in both copies of the S1P gene (1Sakai J.

As a result of this defect, SRD-12B cells are unable to release SREBPs from membranes, and they fail to transcribe multiple genes encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor and the enzymes of cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. These cells can grow only if they are supplied with exogenous sources of cholesterol and oleate. The activity of S1P in cleaving SREBPs has been studied so far only in intact cells. To understand this reaction more completely and to show directly that S1P is able to cleave the SREBP-2 recognition sequence, in the current studies, we prepared a permanent line of SRD-12B cells that expresses a truncated form of S1P that lacks the COOH-terminal membrane anchor. Despite the lack of membrane attachment, this truncated form of S1P processes SREBPs normally and alleviates the lipid growth requirements of the cells. Truncated S1P is secreted from the cells and can be isolated from the culture medium. This secreted enzyme cleaves peptide substrates corresponding to the recognition site in SREBP-2 and to the internal recognition site within S1P that releases the propeptide. These developments have permitted us to characterize the catalytic activity of S1P in vitro. We obtained serum-free CHO-S-SFM II medium from Life Technologies, Inc.; Pefabloc® SC, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, (4-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin from Roche Molecular Biochemicals;N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal from Calbiochem; and aprotinin and 1,10-phenanthroline from Sigma. Ac-Ser-Gly-Arg-Ser-Val-Leu-MCA and Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA were purchased from Peptide International, Inc. (Louisville, KY) and Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA), respectively. Peptides Ac-Val-Phe-Arg-Ser-Leu-Lys-MCA, Ac-Val-Phe-Ala-Ser-Leu-Lys-MCA, Ac-Val-Phe-Arg-Ser-Arg-Arg-MCA, Ac-Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly-Arg-Ser-Val-Leu-MCA, Ac-Arg-Ser-Leu-Lys-MCA, and Ac-Arg-Ser-Val-Leu-MCA were synthesized by Tularik Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) by solution coupling of the appropriate fully deprotected peptide fragment with Lys-MCA, Arg-MCA, or Leu-MCA followed by reverse-phase HPLC purification. Peptides NH2-Arg-Lys-Val-Phe-Arg-Ser-Leu-Lys-Phe-Ala-Glu-Ser-Asp-Pro-Ile-Val-COOH and NH2-His-Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly-Arg-Ser-Val-Leu-Ser-Phe-Glu-Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly-COOH were synthesized in Dallas using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis chemistry on a Rainin Symphony multiplex peptide synthesizer (Washburn, MA). IgG-7D4, a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the NH2-terminal domain of hamster SREBP-2 (amino acids 32–250), was prepared as described previously (11Yang J. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12152-12161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Other materials were obtained from sources described in the accompanying article (9Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

It consists of an initiator methionine, amino acids 2–1052 of hamster S1P (1Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), three novel amino acids (GGR) encoded by the sequence of theNotI restriction site, three tandem copies of the 9E10 epitope derived from the human c-Myc protein (EQKLISEEDLGGEQKLISEEDLGPRFEQKLISEEDL), five novel amino acids (DMHTG) encoded by linker sequences, and six consecutive histidines. Expression is driven by the CMV promoter/enhancer. pCMV-S1P(1052)-Myc-His was constructed in three steps, as follows. First, an intermediate plasmid (plasmid 1) was constructed by ligation of three DNA fragments: 1) a ∼5.4-kb fragment released from the BamHI and NotI digestion of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), 2) a ∼4-kb fragment released from theEcoRI and NotI digestion pCMV-S1P (1Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and 3) a ∼150-base pair fragment released from the BamHI andEcoRI digestion of a polymerase chain reaction-amplified product obtained from the pCMV-S1P template using the following primers: 5′ primer, 5′-CGGGATCCATGAAGCTCATCAACATCTGGC-3′; and 3′ primer, 5′-GGAGAATTCCACCTTCAAAGTCAGG-3′. Second, an intermediate plasmid (plasmid 2) was constructed by ligation of the following three fragments: a ∼5.5-kb fragment released from a BamHI and NotI digestion of pcDNA3.1/MycHis(+) B (Invitrogen); 2) a ∼2.6-kb fragment released from a BamHI and NdeI digestion of intermediate plasmid 1; and 3) a ∼550-base pair fragment released from the NdeI andNotI digestion of a polymerase chain reaction-amplified product obtained from the pCMV-S1P template using the following primers: 5′primer, 5′-TTCAGTACACATCATATGGCGTGAACCCTC-3′; and 3′ primer, 5′-TAGACTCGAGCGGCCGCCCACTGACGGGGTCCTTGGTGGGTGGGTCTG-3′. Third, a pair of complementary oligonucleotides (top strand, 5′-GGCCGCGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGGTGGTGAGCAGAAGTTGATTTCTGAGGAAGACCTGGGCC-3′; bottom strand, 5′-CAGGTCTTCCTCAGAAATCAACTTCTGCTCACCACCCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCGC-3′) were annealed. These oligonucleotides correspond to two additional copies of the c-Myc 9E10 epitope tag. The annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into the ∼8-kb fragment released from the ApaI and NotI digestion of intermediate plasmid 2. The plasmid resulting from this ligation is designated pCMV-S1P(1052)-Myc-His. pCMV-S1P(983)-Myc-His encodes the same fusion protein as does pCMV-S1P(1052)-Myc-His, except that the DNA encoding the last 69 amino acids of S1P (residues 984–1052) was deleted so as to remove the membrane anchor and COOH-terminal tail. The strategy for the construction of this plasmid was similar to that for pCMV-S1P(1052)-Myc-His except for the second step, in which a ∼300-base pair fragment was amplified from pCMV-S1P using the following primers: 3′-primer, 5′-TAGACTCGAGCGGCCGCCCTCTTGGTTGTAGCGGCCAGGCATGATCC-3′; and 5′-primer, same as described above. All of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments and ligation junctions in each step of the above constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. On day 0, cholesterol auxotrophic SRD-12B cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish in Medium B (9Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm sodium mevalonate, and 20 μm sodium oleate. On day 1, cells were transfected with 5 μg of either pCMV-S1P(1052)-Myc-His or pCMV-S1P(983)-Myc-His using an MBS kit (Stratagene) and cultured overnight in Medium B supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. On day 2, the medium was switched to Medium B supplemented with 5% fetal calf lipoprotein-deficient serum without cholesterol. The medium was changed every second day until individual colonies were visible on day 11. Stable expression of S1P-Myc permitted the growth of SRD-12B cells in the absence of sterols (1Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Single cell clones that stably expressed S1P were isolated by limiting dilution and analyzed for S1P expression by immunoblotting with the anti-Myc (9E10 clone) monoclonal antibody. The resulting cell lines expressing S1P(1052)-Myc-His (TR-3109 cells) and S1P(983)-Myc-His (TR-3117 cells) are designated S1P(1052) and S1P(983) cells, respectively. Stock cultures of S1P(983) cells were grown in 850-cm2 roller bottles in Medium B (9Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% (v/v) newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum and 500 μg/ml G418. On day 0, 10 roller bottles of S1P(983) cells were seeded at a density of ∼4 × 107 cells/roller bottle. On day 2, the medium was replaced with 100 ml of serum-free medium CHO-S-SFM II. The medium from each roller bottle was collected daily from day 3 to day 7. The collected medium was pooled, filtered through 0.45-μm cellulose acetate low protein binding membrane filter units (Corning Costar), and stored at 4 °C for 0–4 days. On day 7, the filtered medium was adjusted to pH 8.0 by addition of Tris-HCl at a final concentration of 25 mm and then loaded onto four parallel 5-ml Ni-NTA agarose columns (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) equilibrated with 20 ml of Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2). The chromatography was performed at 4 °C via gravity at ∼100 ml/h. The column was washed with 40 ml of Buffer B supplemented with 1m NaCl followed by 20 ml of Buffer B without NaCl. Elution was achieved with 15 ml of Buffer B containing 250 mmimidazole, pH 8. The eluate was concentrated with a Centriprep 30 filter followed by a Centricon 30 filter (Amicon, Inc.). The concentrated solution was supplemented with an equal volume of 100% glycerol and stored in multiple aliquots at −20 °C without loss of activity for at least 4 months. Ten roller bottles of cells yielded 1 mg of protein. S1P activity was measured fluorometrically with MCA-conjugated peptidyl substrates. Each reaction was carried out in 0.2 ml of assay buffer (25 mmTris, 25 mm Mes, 25 mm acetic acid, and 1 mm CaCl2 adjusted to pH 8.0 with concentrated NaOH). Reactions contained MCA-peptide (final concentration 100 μm, added in 2 μl DMSO) and 1.5–5 μg of purified S1P(983)-C. After incubation for 0.5–5 h at 37 °C, each reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 5 mm sodium EDTA. The liberated 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC) was measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS-30 luminescence spectrometer (360 nm excitation, 460 nm emission). A standard curve of fluorescence intensity was generated with different concentrations of AMC (Promega). Each reaction was carried out in a final volume of 40 μl of assay buffer (see above) containing a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide (final concentration, 300 μm) and 3 μg of purified S1P(983)-C. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the reaction products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a 4.6 × 250-mm RP300 column using a Waters HPLC system. Chromatography was performed in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at 0.75 ml/min. Elution was achieved with a 50-min gradient of 7–50% (v/v) acetonitrile. Peptide masses were measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry using a Voyager DE time-of-flight mass spectrometer from PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) as the matrix. Fig. 1 A diagrams the structure of the S1P constructs that were used in these studies. The S1P signal sequence ends at residue 22. The propeptide cleavage site (Site-B) is after residue 137. Cleavage at this site generates S1P-B. This is followed by a second cleavage after residue 186 to generate S1P-C. The active site serine is at residue 414, and the transmembrane anchor sequence begins at residue 997. The wild-type protein terminates at residue 1052. We also prepared a cDNA encoding a truncated form of S1P that terminates after residue 983, deleting the transmembrane sequence and the COOH-terminal tail. Three copies of a Myc epitope tag and six consecutive histidines are added at the COOH terminus of both proteins. cDNAs encoding the proteins illustrated in Fig. 1 A were introduced into SRD-12B cells, which lack S1P (10Rawson R.B. Cheng D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28261-28269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Permanent cell lines were grown in the absence of cholesterol and oleate, a protocol that selects for cells that express functional S1P. The resulting permanent lines that express full-length and truncated protein are called S1P(1052) and S1P(983), respectively. To quantify expression of the transfected S1P, the cells were homogenized, and a crude membrane pellet was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the Myc tag (Fig.1 B). In order to study the regulation of S1P activity, we incubated the cells in the absence of sterols with or without the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor compactin. S1P is expected to be active under both conditions. We incubated parallel dishes in the presence of compactin plus a mixture of 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol that is known to suppress S1P activity (1Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). As expected, membranes from wild-type CHO-7 cells and mutant SRD-12B cells did not contain a protein that reacted with the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–6). Membranes from the S1P(1052) cells exhibited three bands of immunoreactive protein that corresponded to the sizes expected from S1P-A, -B, and -C (lanes 7–9). Membranes from the S1P(983) cells showed two bands that were slightly smaller than the bands in the S1P(1052) cells (lanes 10–12). We believe that these represent S1P(983)-A and S1P(983)-B. These proteins were found in the membrane pellet even though they lack a transmembrane anchor. The amounts of the different S1P bands were not altered when the cells were incubated in the presence of compactin plus or minus sterols. As shown in Fig. 1 C, nuclear extracts from CHO-7 cells contained detectable amounts of the NH2-terminal segment of SREBP-2, as determined by immunoblotting when the cells were incubated in the absence of sterols (lane 1). The amount was increased when the cells were further deprived of sterols by treatment with compactin (lane 2). The band disappeared when the compactin-treated cells were incubated with sterols (lane 3). The SRD-12B cells failed to exhibit nuclear SREBP-2 under any of these conditions (lanes 4–6). In the absence of sterols, nuclear SREBP-2 was found in both the S1P(1052) cells and the S1P(983) cells in either the absence or presence of compactin (lanes 7, 8, 10, 11). In both cases, nuclear SREBP-2 was abolished by addition of sterols (lanes 9 and 12). These data indicate that the truncated S1P and the full-length S1P were active and regulated normally by sterols in the transfected cells. Thebottom panel of Fig. 1 C confirms that membranes from all of the cells contained the precursor form of SREBP-2. Fig. 2 shows an experiment designed to determine whether the transfected cells secreted S1P and to assess the form of the secreted protein. For this purpose, the cells were incubated in fresh medium for 24 h, after which the medium was removed and the cells were lysed in a detergent buffer. Aliquots of the cell lysate corresponding to 0.1 dish of cells and aliquots of concentrated medium also corresponding to 0.1 dish of cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-Myc (Fig. 2 A). In the S1P(1052) cells, all immunoreactive protein was found in the lysate (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), and none was in the medium (lane 4). The lysate contained three bands corresponding to S1P-A, -B, and -C. In the S1P(983) cells, the lysate contained two bands corresponding to the sizes expected for S1P(983)-A and S1P(983)-B (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). The medium contained abundant amounts of a protein corresponding to the expected size of S1P(983)-C (Fig.2 A, lane 6). At the 24 h time point, the total amount of S1P(983)-C in the medium was roughly equal to the amount of S1P(983)-A plus S1P(983)-B in the lysate. Consistent with the findings in the accompanying paper (9Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), in the S1P(1052) cells, S1P-A, -B, and -C all showed increased mobility after treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), indicating that all three forms containN-linked carbohydrates. Endo H increased the mobility only of S1P-A and S1P-B. Endo H-treated S1P-B overlapped with S1P-C, which was unaffected by endo H (lane 3). In lysates from the S1P(983) cells, the A and B forms were both sensitive to endo H as well as to peptide N-glycosidase F. No C form was visible (Fig.2 B, lanes 6 and 7). The medium from these cells contained a protein that corresponded in size to S1P(983)-C (lane 9). This protein was sensitive to peptide N-glycosidase F (lane 10), but resistant to endo H (lane 11). To confirm the identity of this band, we grew the S1P(983) cells in bulk in roller bottles and purified the protein from the medium by nickel affinity chromatography, taking advantage of the His6 tag. Fig. 2 C shows a Coomassie Blue stain of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing this purified protein. A corresponding band was excised from an unstained parallel gel and subjected to Edman degradation, revealing the NH2-terminal sequence shown in Fig. 2 C. This sequence corresponds to the product expected from cleavage at Site-C (see Fig. 4 of Ref. 9Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To characterize the catalytic activity of the secreted enzyme, we prepared a series of peptides that contain a COOH-terminal amide of AMC at the COOH terminus. AMC does not show fluorescence at 460 nm unless it has been released from the peptide through proteolysis. Similar substrates have been used to assay furin, prohormone convertases, and other subtilisin-related enzymes (12Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Fig.3 A shows the fluorescence observed when the peptide Ac-VFRSLK-MCA was incubated with purified secreted S1P(983)-C. The sequence of this peptide corresponds to the sequence at Site-B of S1P, which is known to be cleaved by S1P in an autocatalytic reaction (9Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Fluorescence rose linearly with time for 5 h. Fig. 3 B shows a saturation curve with the same substrate performed at the 4-h time point. The inset shows a Lineweaver-Burk plot of these data, which yielded aK m of 100 μm and aV max of 1.6 nmol/min/mg of protein. TheK cat was only 0.16 mol/min/mol of enzyme, which is extremely low, but is sufficient for preliminary characterization. Cleavage was absolutely dependent on the arginine at the P4 position because there was no detectable cleavage of the peptide Ac-VFASLK-MCA (Fig. 3 B). Surprisingly, the enzyme did not cleave the MCA-peptide corresponding to Site-1 in SREBP-2 (Ac-SGRSVL-MCA). The maximal rate of cleavage of Ac-VFRSLK-MCA was observed at pH 8, and there was very little cleavage at pH 6 (Fig. 3 C). This differs from the observations with furin and the prohormone convertases, the pH optima of which are generally in the range of 6–7 (12Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). To further explore the recognition requirements for the peptide-MCA assay, we prepared a series of MCA-coupled peptides of varying sequence and incubated them with purified S1P(983)-C. Shortening the Ac-VFRSLK-MCA peptide by two residues reduced its susceptibility to cleavage by about 50% (Table I). Ac-RSVL-MCA peptides ranging in length from four to eight residues were not cleaved. Importantly, S1P did not cleave MCA peptides that corresponded to"
https://openalex.org/W1968602572,"We have previously reported that the Huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) gene is fused to the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (PDGFβR) gene in a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. We now show that HIP1/PDGFβR oligomerizes, is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, and transforms the murine hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3, to interleukin-3-independent growth. A kinase-inactive mutant is neither tyrosine-phosphorylated nor able to transform Ba/F3 cells. Oligomerization and kinase activation required the 55-amino acid carboxyl-terminal TALIN homology region but not the leucine zipper domain.

Each of these require an oligomerization domain to constitutively activate the partner tyrosine kinase and hence transform cells. We have identified another cytogenetic abnormality associated with the clinical phenotype of CMML, t(5;7)(q33;q11.2), that results in expression of the transforming fusion protein HIP1/PDGFβR (10Ross T. Bernard O. Berger R. Gilliland D. Blood. 1998; 91: 4419-4426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1) is 116-kDa protein that binds Huntingtin, the protein product of the gene mutated in Huntington disease (11Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. McCutcheon K. Graham R.K. Nichol K. Nishiyama K. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Lynn F.C. Wellington C. Metzler M. Goldberg Y.P. Kanazawa I. Gietz R.D. Hayden M.R. Nat.

All but the 18 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of HIP1 are fused to the transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains of the PDGFβR in this novel fusion protein. The function of HIP1 is unknown, but it contains evolutionarily conserved sequences. The yeast homologue, SLA2P, is essential for yeast growth as well as assembly and function of the cortical cytoskeleton (13Holtzman D.A. Yang S. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). There is also a C. eleganshomologue of unknown function. 2GenBankTM accession no. celzk370.3. Finally, HIP1 has a leucine zipper motif and the carboxyl terminus is homologous to TALIN, a cytoskeletal protein implicated in cell-substratum as well as cell-cell interactions (15Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Several signaling pathways are employed by the activated native PDGFβR kinase. The signaling intermediates, including SRC family members, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase), RasGTPase-activating protein, and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), may also be activated by HIP1/PDGFβR. Certain tyrosine residues when phosphorylated are designated SH2 docking sites, since they are binding sites for these SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. Two tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr579 and Tyr581) (Fig.1) associate with the SRC family tyrosine kinases (SRC, Fyn, and Yes) (16Courtneidge S.A. Kypta R.M. Cooper J.A. Kazlauskas A. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 483-486PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mori S. Ronnstragd L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and this association leads to mitogenesis in NIH 3T3 cells. The 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase binds to phosphorylated Tyr740 and Tyr751 in the kinase insert domain of the PDGFβR, and PLCγ binds to phosphorlyated Tyr1009 and Tyr1021 (18Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Both are required for full mitogenic activity in HepG2 cells (19Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Here we have dissected the role of HIP1 in HIP1/PDGFβR transformation by deletion mutational analysis of the HIP1 moiety. We have also determined the relevance of the mitogenic pathways known to be activated by native PDGFβR by testing the effect of key tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions in the PDGFβR in the context of the HIP1/PDGFβR fusion. The breakpoint was amplified from patient material using primers HIP1301F (5′-CCTGAAACTGCTAAGAACCA-3′) and PDGFβR 1806R, and the product was digested with BglI and NheI. The BglI–SacII fragment of the PDGFβR was isolated after BglI and SacII digestion of the PDGFβR cDNA and ligated to the NheI–BglI breakpoint fragment. This ligation reaction was amplified with primers containing the NheI and SacII sites (5′-AAATTGCTGCTAGCACAGCCCAGCTTG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTCCCGCGGCAGCTCCCACGTGGA-3′, respectively), digested withSacII, and ligated with the 3′-end of PDGFβR or the kinase-inactive point mutant (PDGFβR (R634K) (18Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)). This ligation reaction was then digested with NheI and ligated with the 5′-end of HIP1 (the HIP1 cDNA was the kind gift of M. Hayden, University of British Columbia, Vancouver) via the uniqueNheI site. The region amplified by PCR was confirmed to be void of PCR-generated mutations by sequence analysis. The resultant 4.6-kilobase inserts (kinase-active and -inactive) were subcloned into the appropriate vectors for use in the expression experiments. The reconstructed cDNAs for HIP1/PDGFβR and H/P(KI) were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). H/P(del)3 was generated by digestion of pcDNA3-HIP1/ PDGFβR with PflMI, blunting with T4 DNA polymerase, digestion with EcoRI, and isolation of the insert. The insert was ligated withEcoRI/EcoRV-cut pcDNA3. The 23-amino acid leucine zipper was deleted by amplifying nucleotides 1534–2641 of HIP1 with an XbaI site engineered onto the 5′-end of the amplicon. The resulting PCR product was then digested with XbaI and NheI and ligated intoXbaI/NheI-digested HIP1/PDGFβR in the vector pBluescript KS(+). This construct was then digested withHpaI and NheI, and the insert was ligated intoHpaI/NheI-digested pcDNA3-HIP1/PDGFβR. In addition, HIP1 amino-terminal deletion mutants were constructed. The H/P(RI) deletion mutant was prepared by digestion of the wild type HIP1/PDGFβR construct in pcDNA3 with EcoRI followed by religation. H/P(NI) was made by digesting HIP1/PDGFβR in pcDNA3 with EcoRI and NheI, filling in the sticky ends with T4 DNA polymerase followed by religation. The H/P(del)H mutant was constructed by amplifying the transmembrane and a portion of the PDGFβR cytoplasmic domain. The forward primer spanned the breakpoint, had a 5′-end EcoRI site, and incorporated an ATG at the breakpoint with an optimal Kozak consensus sequence (5′-CACTACGAATTCGCTGGTGTTGCTGAGGGCTGGGAAACCATGG-3′). The reverse primer, TPY1R (5′-ATGGCTCAGACCATGAGCTGTGGCCTC-3′) encodes the PDGFβR sequence just 3′ of the unique SacII site. The ATG truncation mutants between the EcoRI and NheI sites were constructed using the same 3′-primer (TPY1R), and the 5′-primers were engineered to have an EcoRI site and an ATG with an optimal Kozak consensus sequence at HIP1 amino acid positions 497, 599, 690, and 752. The 5′-primers were as follows: H/P(ATG497), 5′- CGGAAGAATTCAGAGGTGACCAAACAGGTGACCATGG-3′; H/P(ATG599), 5′-GAGGAATTCTCTGCTCTTCGGAAAACCATGGAGGAC-3′; H/P(ATG690), 5′-TGCCCAGAATTCATCAGTGGACTTCTCAACATGGTAACCCTG-3′; H/P(ATG752), 5′-AGCCTTGAGAATTCCGACAGCACAACCATGGGG-3′; H/P(ATG830), 5′-GTGAATGAATTCATCCTTGGTTGCTGTACCAGCACCATGGA-3′. The resultant PCR products were digested with EcoRI andSacII and ligated withEcoRI/SacII-digested H/P(RI) pcDNA3 vector. To construct the F8 mutant of HIP1/PDGFβR, the wild type PDGFβR F8 mutant was used and has been described previously (19Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). An F6 mutant bearing mutations in Tyr716, Tyr740, Tyr751, Tyr771, Tyr1009, and Tyr1021 was constructed by digesting the mutated F8 PDGFβR in pcDNA3 (kindly provided by Andrius Kazlauskas) withSacII and EcoRI and replacing the released fragment with the HIP1/PDGFβR EcoRI/SacII 2-kilobase fragment (Fig. 1). To make the most membrane-proximate mutations that would convert this F6 mutant to HIP1/PDGFβR(F8), an antisense oligonucleotide was designed to encode Tyr → Phe mutants at positions Tyr579 and Tyr581 of the PDGFβR. This oligonucleotide also contained the unique SacII site in the PDGFβR. This 3′-primer was then used with a sense oligonucleotide just 5′ of the unique NheI site of the HIP1 cDNA (nucleotides 2264–2284 of the HIP1 sequence) to amplify a PCR product using the “wild type” fusion cDNA as a template. The product was digested with SacII and NheI and subcloned into a NheI/SacII-digested HIP1/PDGFβR-bearing pcDNA3. The resultant mutant (H/P(F2)) was then digested withSacII and RI, and the fragment that was released was used to replace the wild type sequence in the H/P(F6)MSCVneo mutant as well as to replace the wild type sequence in the H/P.MSCVneo construct. Briefly, the nonmutated RI/SacII fragment was excised, and the vectors were ligated with the RI/SacII Tyr579- and Tyr581-mutated fragment. The amplified fragment was sequenced. In vitrotranscription/translation was performed using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (TNT system; Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine. One-half of the reaction was removed, and 2 μl of IgG specific for the C terminus of PDGFβR was used to immunoprecipitate translated products. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100). Total reaction mixtures and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were visualized by fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-1 cells were transfected with HIP1/PDGFβR using the DEAE-dextran method (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Press C.S.H.L. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The transfected COS-1 cells were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence antibody staining 48 h after transfection. At 24 h, cells were replated at 400,000 cells/ml onto glass coverslips. At 48 h, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked in 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline/1% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and then a 1:100 dilution of antiserum to the cytoplasmic tail of the PDGFβR (Pharmingen) was added for 1 h. After washing the cells, secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was added for 30 min. The cells were then washed, incubated with 1 μg/ml Hoechst dye 33258 for 1 min, and washed again, and then the coverslips were mounted on glass slides. The cells were visualized with an Olympus fluorescence microscope and photographed with Kodak Royal Gold II 400 print film. The full-length fusion HIP1/PDGFβR, R634K mutant (H/P(KI)), H/P(RI)(del)LZ, H/P(F2), H/P(F8), and the larger amino-terminal HIP1 deletion constructs were subcloned into the pMSCVneo vector (kindly provided by R. Hawley, University of Toronto). 293T cells (the kind gift of R. Mulligan, Harvard Medical School, Boston) were transfected via the calcium phosphate technique (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Press C.S.H.L. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 48-h supernatant (1 ml) was then added to 106 Ba/F3 cells (1 ml) in the presence of polybrene (4 μl) as described previously (21Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Cells with stable expression were selected in the presence of G418 and IL-3 as described (4Carroll M. Tomasson M.H. Barker G.F. Golub T.R. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14845-14850Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The extracts were either subjected to immunoprecipitation with antiserum to the cytoplasmic tail of the PDGFβR as described under the in vitro transcription/translation section and/or directly separated with 7% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected with the indicated antibodies as described (4Carroll M. Tomasson M.H. Barker G.F. Golub T.R. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14845-14850Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). When analyzing associated proteins, the immunoprecipitates were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 rather than the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100). When the Western blot was probed twice with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) followed by anti-PDGFβR tail antibodies, the blot was stripped of the 4G10 antibody by incubating it at 50 °C for 30 min in a solution of 2% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 84 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The blot was then washed with phosphate-buffered saline four times for 10 min prior to staining with the second antibody. EMSAs were performed as described previously (22Ilaria Jr., R.L. Van Etten R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31704-31710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In brief, nuclear extracts (6 mg) from control cells or cells expressing H/P and the various mutant fusion proteins were incubated (20 min) with a 32P-labeled and purified double-stranded oligonucleotide probe recognized by activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein complexes (γ-interferon-activated sequence based on the FcgRI gene promoter). For supershift analysis, anti-STAT antibodies (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); catalogue numbers as follows: STAT1, SC-346X; STAT3, SC-482X; STAT5b, SC-835X) were added. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% TRIS, acetate, EDTA-polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. Full-length HIP1/PDGFβR (10Ross T. Bernard O. Berger R. Gilliland D. Blood. 1998; 91: 4419-4426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to construct related mutants including H/P(KI), which contains a point mutation, R634K, known to inactivate PDGFβR kinase activity; H/P(RI)(del)LZ, which contains a 23-amino acid deletion of the leucine zipper motif as well as deletion of amino-terminal sequences up to the EcoRI site; a series of HIP1 amino-terminal deletion mutants; and the Tyr → Phe mutations in the PDGFβR portion of the fusion (Fig.1). The N-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by using the unique restriction enzyme sitesEcoRI (H/P(RI)) and NheI (H/P(NI)) to excise HIP1 5′ sequences or amplifying HIP1 and PDGFβR sequences of the fusion protein by PCR. All mutants were confirmed by sequence analysis. When selected constructs were translated in vitro, HIP1/PDGFβR and related mutants migrated at the expected sizes and were recognized by an antibody to the carboxyl terminus of the PDGFβR (Fig. 2). Utilization of the first ATG of the full-length HIP1/PDGFβR and truncated H/P(RI)(del)LZ yielded protein products with expected electrophoretic mobilities of 220 and 170 kDa, respectively (see legend to Fig. 2). H/P(NI) and H/P(del)H migrated as a 100-kDa doublet and a 90-kDa protein, respectively. The 100-kDa doublet is consistent with the presence of two ATG start sites in HIP1 after the NheI site at methionines 965 and 980 (Fig.1). Oligomerization of HIP1/PDGFβR and related mutants was tested byin vitro translation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments as described previously (4Carroll M. Tomasson M.H. Barker G.F. Golub T.R. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14845-14850Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In brief, an antibody to the carboxyl-terminal epitope of the PDGFβR was used to immunoprecipitate the protein complexes. The epitope recognized by this antibody is not present in the H/P(del)3 construct. Hence, the antibody can only immunoprecipitate the H/P(del)3 protein if there is association with the fusion proteins that contain this epitope. The H/P, H/P(RI)(del)LZ, H/P(KI), and H/P(NI) constructs all co-immunoprecipitated the H/P(del)3 protein, demonstrating that the leucine zipper motif was not necessary for oligomerization in this assay. In contrast, the deletion mutant without any HIP1 sequences (H/P(del)H) did not interact with the H/P(del)3 proteins (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal 55 amino acids of HIP1 (TALIN homology region) in the fusion protein are sufficient for oligomerization of HIP1/PDGFβR. Expression and transforming properties of HIP1/PDGFβR and selected mutants were tested in the IL-3-dependent, murine hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3. The HIP1/PDGFβR constructs were subcloned into the murine ecotropic retroviral vector MSCVneo. Viral supernatants were prepared by transient transfection of 293T cells and used to infect Ba/F3 cells (21Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Expression of the wild type and selected mutant proteins under control of the viral long terminal repeat was confirmed with antibodies directed against the PDGFβR carboxyl terminus (in cytoplasmic domain) (Fig. 3). HIP1/PDGFβR and all of the mutants were constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in stable Ba/F3 infectants, except for the kinase-inactive point mutant H/P(KI) (Fig.3). HIP1/PDGFβR, H/P(RI)(del)LZ and H/P(NI) had predicted electrophoretic mobilities of 220, 170, and 100 kDa, respectively. The phosphorylated band at 180 kDa in the HIP1/PDGFβR and H/P(RI)(del)LZ lanes is probably the result of an alternative start site at ATG497, the first ATG after the EcoRI site of HIP1, because on longer exposures this band is recognized by the anti-PDGFβR antibodies (data not shown and Fig. 1). Ba/F3 stable infectants of HIP1/PDGFβR and related mutants were seeded in 96-well trays at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/well and assayed for IL-3-independent proliferation as described (4Carroll M. Tomasson M.H. Barker G.F. Golub T.R. Gilliland D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14845-14850Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). HIP1/PDGFβR, H/P(RI) and H/P(RI)(del)LZ transformed Ba/F3 cells to IL-3-independent growth. In contrast, the H/P(NI) mutant, which also oligomerizes and is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, was incapable of conferring IL-3-independent growth. For control experiments, the kinase-inactive mutant H/P(KI) and insert-free MSCVneo did not confer IL-3-independent growth (Table I).Table IH/P and selected mutants transform Ba/F3 cells to IL-3-independent growthConstructNo. of wells/total wellsMSCVneo0 /96H/P96 /96H/P(RI)(del)LZ96 /96H/P(RI)96 /96H/P(KI)0 /96H/P(NI)0 /96The G418-resistant cells growing in IL-3 were seeded in 96-well trays with 2 × 104 cells/200 μl/well in RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal calf serum media with or without IL-3.

Open table in a new tab The G418-resistant cells growing in IL-3 were seeded in 96-well trays with 2 × 104 cells/200 μl/well in RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal calf serum media with or without IL-3. Cells were assessed for viability (trypan blue). Western blots of whole cell lysates of the stable cell lines with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies identified a consistent and prominent 130-kDa phosphoprotein in the H/P- and H/P(RI)(del)LZ-transformed cells but not the vector, H/P(KI), or H/P(NI) nontransformed cell lines (Fig. 3, right panel). There were no other consistent differences in the phosphorylation patterns of transformed cells compared with nontransformed cells other than autophosphorylated HIP1/PDGFβR and the related mutant fusion proteins. To further characterize HIP1 sequences required for p130 tyrosine phosphorylation, mutants were constructed with further amino-terminal truncations of H/P between the EcoRI and NheI sites of the HIP1 sequence (Fig. 1). These mutants were then tested for transforming ability (Table II) and ability to associate with and phosphorylate p130 (Fig.4). Extracts were immunoprecipitated with antiserum against the PDGFβR tail, followed by staining with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The results showed that the prominent 130-kDa phosphoprotein associated exclusively with the fusion proteins that transform the Ba/F3 cell line (Fig. 4). Of particular note, p130 was not detected and did not associate with the nontransforming H/P variants: H/P(ATG752), H/P(ATG830), or H/P(NI) (Figs. 3 and 4 and data not shown).Table IIHIP1 amino-terminal truncation mutants and PDGFβR Tyr → Phe mutants transform Ba/F3 cells to IL-3-independent growthConstructNo. of wells/total wellsH/P(ATG497)96 /96H/P(ATG599)96 /96H/P(ATG690)80 /96H/P(ATG752)0 /96H/P(ATG830)0 /96H/P(F2)56 /96H/P(F8)40 /96The G418-resistant cells growing in IL-3 were seeded in 96-well trays with 2 × 104 cells/200 μl/well in RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal calf serum media with or without IL-3.

Cells were assessed for viability (trypan blue). Since the only consistent difference between transformed and nontransformed cell extracts was an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p130, p130 tyrosine phosphorylation may be relevant to transformation. To determine the identity of p130, proteins involved in PDGFβR or IL-3 signal transduction that migrated in the 110–140-kDa molecular mass range were targeted. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates and supernatants were blotted first with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, stripped, and reprobed with the specific antibodies. p130 was not detected by the specific antibodies that efficiently cleared the extracts of the immunogens. This strategy was used to exclude CBL, RAS-GAP, CAS, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2, IL3βR, PLCγ, PtdIns 3-kinase, and focal adhesion kinase as candidates for p130 (data not shown). Since PtdIns 3-kinase and PLCγ activation are part of the mitogenic signal transduction of the native PDGFβR, we assessed their role in H/P transformation. To do this, Tyr → Phe point mutants in the known SH2 docking sites of the PDGFβR (Fig. 1) were constructed and then tested in the Ba/F3 cell system. Table II and Fig. 4 show that the H/P(F2)- and H/P(F8)-infected Ba/F3 cells are transformed and have hyperphosphorylated p130. Hence, none of the known SH2 docking sites are required for transformation or p130 phosphorylation. The F8 mutant remains tyrosine-phosphorylated despite abrogation of the major SH2 docking sites by tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations. These data demonstrate that there are additional sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on either the HIP1 or the PDGFβR moieties. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues has also been demonstrated in comparable Tyr → Phe mutants in the native PDGFβR (18Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The lack of phosphorylated SH2 interaction sites may lead to loss of association with tyrosine phosphatases, with concomitant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation at the residual sites. To probe the role of PtdIns 3-kinase and PLCγ in more detail, tyrosine phosphorylation of the 85-kDa subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase and PLCγ were measured in the H/P(F8)-transformed cells. It was hypothesized that by analogy to the native PDGFβR (19Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), the H/P(F8) mutant would not bind PtdIns 3-kinase or PLCγ. Ba/F3 cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PtdIns 3-kinase and anti-PLCγ antibodies and then immunoblotted with antibody against phosphotyrosine or the immunoprecipitating antibody (Fig.5, A and B). Cells expressing the wild-type H/P or the H/P(F2) mutant had increased phosphorylation of both proteins that were expressed at similar levels in each of these cell lines. As hypothesized, the H/P(F8) mutant, which has Tyr → Phe point mutations in all of the known SH2 docking sites has lost its ability to associate with and phosphorylate PtdIns 3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ. This finding together with the fact that the H/P(F8) variant with mutations in all known SH2 docking sites is transforming, suggests that signaling via the inositol phosphate-containing intermediates is unnecessary for Ba/F3 transformation. Since the mutant fusion protein H/P(F8) transforms Ba/F3 cells but lacks all of the known SH2 binding sites and is incapable of activating PtdIns 3-kinase or PLCγ (Table II and Figs. 4and 5), we analyzed other signal transduction pathways that might be activated by the PDGFβR portion of the fusion protein. In addition to PtdIns 3-kinase and PLCγ, STATs are reported to be activated by native PDGFβR (23Valgeirsdottir S. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hence, STAT1, -3, and -5, which are highly expressed in Ba/F3 cells, were analyzed for activation in transformed cells. Electromobility shift assay using a γ-interferon-activated sequence probe that binds to multiple activated STAT proteins demonstrated constitutive STAT5 activation in the transformed cells by both H/P and H/P(F8) (Fig. 6 A). A shifted doublet was detected using nuclear extracts from the various stably infected cell lines. The upper band of the doublet was constitutively supershifted with STAT5 antibody that recognizes both STAT5a and STAT5b. No supershift was detected when STAT1 or STAT3 antibodies were added to the binding reaction (data not shown). STAT5 was constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in transformed cells, consistent with the electromobility shift assay results (Fig. 6 B). These data demonstrate that although the transforming H/P(F8) mutant does not activate PtdIns 3-kinase or PLCγ, it is a potent activator of STAT5. Finally, immunofluorescent staining with the anti-PDGFβR antibody of HIP1/PDGFβR transiently transfected COS-1 cells showed the fusion protein was localized to the cytoplasm (Fig.7). Similar data were obtained for various HIP1 truncation mutants and in stably transfected Ba/F3 cells (data not shown). In summary, the H/P protein oligomerizes, has constitutive kinase activity, transforms Ba/F3 cells to IL-3-independent growth, and is localized to the cytoplasm. The properties of oligomerization, constitutive kinase activity, and transformation do not require the leucine zipper motif as a deletion mutant of the leucine zipper retains these properties. In contrast, a mutant containing only the 55 C-terminal amino acids of HIP1 fused to PDGFβR kinase (H/P(NI)) retains only the oligomerization and constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. When these 55 amino acids are deleted (H/P(del)H) oligomerization is abrogated. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the 55 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of HIP1 are sufficient for oligomerization and autophosphorylation but not for transformation of hematopoietic cells. In addition, transformation by HIP1/PDGFβR and related mutants correlates with constitutive STAT5 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p130. These three properties require HIP1 amino acids 690–752 but do not require any of the known SH2 signal transducing molecule docking sites in the PDGFβR portion of the fusion. This suggests that in addition to tyrosine kinase activation, HIP1 sequences that function in ways other than self-association may be relevant for transformation of Ba/F3 cells to IL-3-independent growth and that both p130 and the STAT5 are important targets of HIP1/PDGFβR in mediating transformation. HIP1/PDGFβR is a novel fusion protein associated with CMML and t(5;7)(q33;q11.2). HIP1/PDGFβR oligomerizes, is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, and transforms Ba/F3 cells to IL-3-independent growth. The transformed cells have a hyperphosphorylated p130 protein and constitutively activate STAT5. The kinase-inactive mutant H/P(KI) does not transform cells. As expected in H/P(KI) infected cells, neither it, p130, nor STAT5 are constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated. The contribution of HIP1 sequences to transformation and kinase activation of HIP1/PDGFβR is more complex. To assess the role of HIP1 in these functions, deletion mutants of HIP1 were prepared, including H/P(RI), H/P(RI)(del)LZ, H/P(NI), stepwise deletions between theEcoRI and NheI sites of the H/P fusion cDNA, and H/P(del)H. It was expected that the leucine zipper motif would be required for oligomerization and kinase activation by analogy with other transforming fusion proteins (2Golub T.R. Goga A. Barker G.F. Afar D.E.

Marynen P. Blood. 1997; 90: 2535-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In each of these examples, kinase activation is mediated by an oligomerization motif contributed by the non-tyrosine kinase fusion partner and is requisite for kinase activation and transformation. In the case of TPR/MET, the oligomerization motif is, in fact, a leucine zipper domain (6Park M. Dean M. Cooper C. Schmidt M. O'Brien S. Blair D. Vande Woude G. Cell. 1986; 45: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Hence, it was surprising that deletion of the leucine zipper motif in HIP1/PDGFβR had no effect on oligomerization, kinase activation or transformation. The H/P(RI), H/P(RI)(del)LZ, H/P(NI), and H/P(del)H deletion mutants were then constructed to identify HIP1 sequences sufficient for oligomerization, tyrosine kinase activation, and transformation. The H/P(NI) mutant contains only the 55 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of HIP1, including the TALIN homology region. H/P(NI) oligomerized and had tyrosine kinase activity, whereas the H/P(del)H mutant, which lacks any HIP1 sequences, did not oligomerize. These findings demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal 55-amino acid domain containing the TALIN homology region are sufficient for oligomerization and tyrosine kinase activation. Self-association is a function that, to our knowledge, has not previously been attributed to TALIN. Surprisingly, we found that although H/P(NI) oligomerizes and has tyrosine kinase activity, it is incapable of transforming cells. In light of this, we made more refined HIP1 amino-terminal deletions between the EcoRI and the NheI sites. These data suggest a critical role in transformation and p130 tyrosine phosphorylation for HIP1 amino acids 690–752. Unfortunately, there is no amino acid sequence homology to known functional motifs in this amino acid 690–752 polypeptide to suggest a biological role. There are several potential explanations for the lack of transformation but retention of constitutive tyrosine kinase activation by the H/P mutants that do not contain amino-terminal amino acids up to amino acid 752. One possible explanation for the lack of transformation by these H/P mutants is that there are subtle differences in tyrosine kinase specific activity that cannot be appreciated by assessment of autophosphorylation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Another possibility is that there is an altered subcellular localization of the nontransforming HIP1 deletion mutants compared with HIP1/PDGFβR, leading to sequestration of the constitutive tyrosine kinase from substrates whose phosphorylation is necessary for transformation. HIP1/PDGFβR is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of transiently transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 7) and Ba/F3 cells (data not shown). Because Ba/F3 cells have scant cytoplasm, it is not possible to exclude association with the plasma membrane or cytoskeletal elements. Further analysis using confocal microscopy of hematopoietic cells stably transfected with HIP1/PDGFβR, the nontransforming mutants, and mutants containing myristoylation signals or nuclear localization signals may definitively characterize the role of subcellular localization in transformation of relevant cell types by the fusion protein. The third possibility is that sequences amino-terminal to the TALIN homology region could, in addition to relocalization, mediate interaction with heterologous proteins involved in transformation. Candidates for the heterologous interaction include Huntingtin, HIP1 itself, and the unidentified 130-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein found in transformed cells. Since most candidate proteins in the 110–140 kDa molecular mass range have been excluded, identification of the 130-kDa protein will probably require biochemical purification and sequence analysis. Tyr to Phe mutational analysis of the PDGFβR portion of H/P demonstrates that PtdIns 3-kinase and PLCγ activation are dispensable for transformation in the Ba/F3 assay. These data contrast with the function of native receptor in HepG2 cells in which there is an absolute dependence on PLCγ and PtdIns 3-kinase activation for mitogenic signaling. STAT5 is activated by the native PDGFβR, is known to transmit mitogenic signals, and is activated by IL-3 stimulation of Ba/F3 cells. We have demonstrated that although H/P(F8) does not activate PLCγ or PtdIns 3-kinase, it retains the ability to activate STAT5 as assessed by Western blot analysis for phosphotyrosine and electromobility shift assay analysis. These data, together with the known activation of STAT5 in hematopoietic cells by BCR/ABL (22Ilaria Jr., R.L. Van Etten R.A. J. Biol.

In summary, we have completed a detailed analysis of the transforming properties of H/P. HIP1 contributes at least two functional domains necessary for transformation: first, a critical oligomerization motif within the TALIN homology region required for kinase activation and transformation of hematopoietic cells and, second, a domain from amino acid 690 to 752 that is required for transformation and association and phosphorylation of p130. Furthermore, p130 phosphorylation and association correlates with transforming ability of H/P. PDGFβR contributes tyrosine kinase activity, which is necessary but not sufficient for transformation. Although PtdIns 3-kinase and PLCγ activation are dispensable for transformation, H/P shares a feature common to other tyrosine kinase fusion in its ability to activate STAT5. Identification of p130 and STAT5 target genes should provide further insight into the pathogenesis of CMML.

P., Dimitry, J. M., Brown, E. J., and Frazier, W. A. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 135, 533–544). Here we show that peptides from the type 1 repeats of TSP1 also stimulate αvβ3 integrin function in melanoma cells. Addition of soluble peptide 246 (KRFKQDGGWSHWSPWSS) enhances spreading of A2058 melanoma cells on several αvβ3integrin ligands, including vitronectin, recombinant TSP1 fragments containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, and native TSP1. This activity requires the Trp residues and is independent of CD36-binding sequences in the type 1 repeats. Recombinant type 1 repeats expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein also enhance spreading on vitronectin and TSP1. Activation of αvβ3 integrin by the soluble peptide 246 stimulates organization of F-actin and increases tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. In contrast, direct adhesion of melanoma cells on immobilized peptide 246 inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. Stimulation of αvβ3 integrin function by the type 1 repeat peptide differs from that induced by CD47-binding TSP1 peptides in that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are required and pertussis toxin does not inhibit the former activity. Thus, the type 1 repeats contain a second sequence of TSP1 that can enhance αvβ3integrin signaling, and these two sequences stimulate recognition of both vitronectin and TSP1 by the αvβ3integrin.

Cell spreading was assessed microscopically by counting >100 cells per experimental point using a calibrated reticle to determine the cells/unit area. Cell spreading on vitronectin or TSP1 was quantified by counting cells with a typical polygonal or spindle morphology. Cells spreading on peptides 246 and 7N3 typically did not organize actin filaments but were scored as spread if they increased their diameter more than 3-fold. Statistical significance of pairwise comparisons was assessed using a two-tailed Student's ttest. Inhibition of glycosaminoglycan sulfation was achieved by growth of the cells in a sulfate-free Ham's F12 medium containing sodium chlorate as described previously (28Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Vogel T.

Briefly, A2058 cells were plated in four dishes using complete RPMI medium without antibiotics and containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. After 3 h, media in three of the dishes were changed to Ham's F12 containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum with no antibiotics. After 24 h, the medium in the control dish was changed to fresh RPMI medium with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and the media in the remaining three dishes were replaced with Ham's F12, 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, the same medium with 10 mm sodium chlorate, or with 10 mm sodium chlorate and 1 mm sodium sulfate. Cells were harvested 24 h later by dissociation with EDTA and used for adhesion assays. Involvement of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in peptide responses was examined by pretreatment of melanoma cells with heparitinase or chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America, Ijamsville, MD) as described previously (29Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6785-6793PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Falcon 1008 bacteriological dishes were coated overnight at 4 oC with 10 μg/ml vitronectin or 5 μg/ml type I collagen. The solution was aspirated, and the dishes were blocked using 1% BSA in Dulbecco's PBS for 1 h. A suspension of A2058 cells, detached using EDTA, was diluted to 2 × 106/ml in RPMI, 0.1% BSA and treated with 0.015 units/ml heparitinase, 0.1 units/ml chondroitinase ABC, or medium alone for 30 min at 25 oC with rocking. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS, and tested for adhesion to both proteins. Adhesion to collagen was used as a control for viable cell number and did not differ significantly among the samples. 1008 or 1029 Falcon bacteriological dishes were coated with vitronectin, fibronectin, T7-RGD fusion protein (expressing TSP1 amino acids 879–947) or TSP1 peptides (388, 7N3, or 246) in Dulbecco's PBS with divalent cations, pH 7.4, overnight at 4 °C. The dishes were aspirated and blocked with Dulbecco's PBS, 1% BSA for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were detached with Dulbecco's PBS containing 2.5 mm EDTA and added to coated dishes in RPMI, 0.1% BSA with or without TSP1 peptides 388, 7N3, or 246 at the indicated concentrations and incubated 20 to 60 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The plates were chilled on ice for 5 min, and all cells were recovered for phosphotyrosine assays. The cell medium was pipetted into chilled tubes and centrifuged for 3 min to pellet any unbound cells.

After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C with modified RIPA buffer, lysed cells were scraped from the dishes and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed from the cell pellet, and 30 μl of the sample was heated at 95 °C with 2× β-mercaptoethanol/SDS sample buffer and held for Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated with monoclonal anti-FAK antibody (mouse IgG, Transduction Laboratories) for 3 h at 4 °C. 2.5 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG-agarose was added, and the samples were briefly vortexed and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed and centrifuged three times for 5 s in 1× modified RIPA buffer before resuspending the pellets in 30 μl of 2× β-mercaptoethanol/SDS sample buffer and boiling. Samples were run on 4–15% gradient Tris glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in a semi-dry Western blot apparatus. The membrane was blocked with 1% BSA in TBST (0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.10 m NaCl) for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated RC-20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was added and incubated in TBST-0.1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed in TBST, 0.1% BSA for 30 min, changing the TBST, 0.1% BSA every 5 min. Antibody binding was detected using ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as directed by the manufacturer. Lab-Tek 177402 glass chamber slides were coated with human vitronectin, fibronectin, TSP1, or TSP1 peptides in Dulbecco's PBS with divalent cations and incubated overnight at 4 °C. A2058 cells, grown to 65% confluence, were preincubated for 3 h at 37 °C with complete RPMI (10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine) with or without 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin (Sigma). The slides were aspirated and blocked with Dulbecco's PBS, 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were detached with PBS containing 2.5 mm EDTA and added to the slides at 2 × 105 cells per ml in 200 μl of RPMI, 0.1% BSA, with or without 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin, and with or without TSP1 peptides at 3 μm final concentration. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the slides were gently aspirated, washed twice in warm Dulbecco's PBS, and fixed in Dulbecco's PBS with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After washing twice in Dulbecco's PBS, the slides were placed in Dulbecco's PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 4 min at room temperature. The slides were washed twice in Dulbecco's PBS and stained with BODIPY TR-X Phallacidin (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Slides were photographed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope using a × 63 oil immersion objective. Peptides containing the two VVM sequences from the carboxyl-terminal domain of TSP1 that bind to CD47 stimulate spreading of melanoma cells on substrates coated with low densities of vitronectin (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This stimulation was concluded to be specific based on lack of activity of the Mal III and Hep III peptides derived from two other domains of TSP1. Although the CD36-binding Mal III peptide from the type 1 repeats was inactive in the previous study (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a second peptide from the type 1 repeats, peptide 246, strongly induced spreading of melanoma cells on vitronectin (Fig.1 A). The stimulation of spreading was comparable for peptide 246 and the CD47-binding peptide 7N3, and both peptides were active at low micromolar concentrations (Fig. 1 B). The activity of peptide 246 was maximal at 3 μm but reproducibly decreased at higher concentrations. The stimulation of spreading on vitronectin by peptide 246 required the Trp residues, as peptide 388, with the three Trp residues replaced by Ala residues, was inactive at all concentrations tested (Fig. 1,A and B). Two control peptides for 7N3 with the VVM sequence altered to GGM (604) or VAI (605) were also inactive. The known cell surface ligands for the type 1 repeat peptides containing the WSXW motif are HSPGs and sulfated glycolipids (21Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Nègre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, at least two adjacent sequences in the type 1 repeats have been reported to bind to CD36 (13Dawson D.W. Pearce S.F. Zhong R. Silverstein R.L. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 30Asch A.S. Silbiger S. Heimer E. Nachman R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Li W.X. Howard R.J. Leung L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16179-16184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify that the activity of peptide 246 is independent of CD36 binding, we compared the response of A2058 melanoma cells to that of two other melanoma cell lines that are known to express (C32) or lack expression (G361) of CD36 (32Barnwell J.W. Ockenhouse C.F. Knowles D.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3494-3497PubMed Google Scholar, 33Panton L.J. Leech J.H. Miller L.H. Howard R.J. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The VVM and WSXW peptides both stimulated spreading of the melanoma cells on vitronectin, regardless of their CD36 phenotype (Fig. 1 C, p < 0.003 for each peptide treatment compared with control for all three cell lines). The type 1 repeat peptide induced cells plated on a limiting concentration of vitronectin to adopt a similar morphology (Fig.2 C) as induced by the CD47-binding peptide 7N3 (Fig. 2 B). Both peptides stimulated spreading on vitronectin and increased the organization of F-actin. The spreading response induced by CD47-binding peptides was reported to be pertussis toxin-sensitive (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We observed a 63 ± 10% inhibition of the A2058 cell spreading induced by the VVM peptide 7N3 in the presence of pertussis toxin (Fig. 2 E and data not shown). However, stimulation by the type 1 repeat peptide 246 was not inhibited (104 ± 3% of control) in the presence of pertussis toxin (Fig.2 F and data not shown). The differential sensitivity to pertussis toxin of the responses to peptide 246 and 7N3 combined with the known ligand binding specificities of these peptides (14Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Nègre E. Zabrenetzky V.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19349-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gao A.-G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) suggested that different receptors mediate their effects on αvβ3integrin function. Because 246 is a heparin-binding peptide (14Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Nègre E. Zabrenetzky V.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19349-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TSP1 binds to HSPGs expressed by melanoma cells (29Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6785-6793PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the role of glycosaminoglycans in mediating the stimulatory activity of peptide 246. Inhibition of sulfation by preincubating A2058 melanoma cells with the inhibitor of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate synthesis sodium chlorate at 10 mm ablated the stimulatory activity of peptide 246 but not that of peptide 7N3 (Fig.3 A). This concentration of chlorate inhibited glycosaminoglycan sulfation by 95% in A2058 cells (28Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Vogel T. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17743-17747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A partial inhibition of the response to peptide 246 but not of the response to peptide 7N3 was also observed by simply growing the cells in a sulfate-free Ham's F12 medium (Fig. 3 A). The inhibitory activity of chlorate was verified to be mediated through sulfation inhibition by restoring the stimulating activity of peptide 246 in the presence of both chlorate and 1 mm sulfate (Fig.3 A). Melanoma cells express both chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and HSPGs. To determine which mediated the response to peptide 246, A2058 melanoma cells were treated with heparitinase or chondroitinase ABC, and their spreading on vitronectin was assessed in the absence and presence of peptides (Fig. 3 B). Chondroitinase treatment did not significantly alter responses to peptide 246 or 7N3 (p > 0.1 for both peptides versus treatment control), whereas heparitinase strongly and selectively inhibited the enhancement of spreading simulated by peptide 246 (p = 0.0004 versus treatment control). Therefore, HSPGs are required for the response to peptide 246 but not for the response to the CD47-binding peptide 7N3. Because TSP1 is also an αvβ3 integrin ligand (9Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), we examined whether these TSP1 peptides modulated A2058 cell adhesion to TSP1. A2058 melanoma cells express αvβ3 (34Aznavoorian S. Stracke M.L. Parsons J. McClanahan J. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3247-3254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and their adhesion on TSP1, a recombinant T7 fusion protein expressing the type 3 repeat modules of TSP1 containing the RGD sequence, or vitronectin was inhibited by an αvβ3 integrin antagonist SB223245 but not by the αIIbβ3 integrin antagonist SB208651 (Fig. 4 A). The partial (32%) resistance of TSP1 adhesion to the αvβ3antagonist suggested that additional TSP1 receptors may contribute to adhesion to the intact protein. We observed induction of spreading on TSP1 by both the VVM peptide 7N3 and the type 1 repeat peptide 246 (Fig. 4 B). This induction was specific for the αvβ3 integrin ligands in A2058 melanoma cells, however, because spreading on the α2β1 integrin ligand type I collagen was not stimulated by either peptide 246 or 7N3 (Fig. 4 B). Enhancement of spreading on TSP1 was also specific for peptides 246 and 7N3 in that the TSP1 peptides Mal II from the second type 1 repeat, peptide Hep1 from the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain, and two analogs of peptide 7N3 with the VVM sequence disrupted (peptides 604 and 605) failed to stimulate spreading on TSP1 (Fig. 4 B). Peptide 246 was more potent than peptide 7N3 for inducing spreading of A2058 melanoma cells on TSP1 (Fig. 4 C). The activity of peptide 246 to enhance melanoma cell spreading on TSP1 also required the Trp residues, as peptide 388 was inactive at all concentrations examined. Based on the activities of recombinant TSP1 fragments, the RGD sequence in the type 3 repeats of TSP1 are primarily responsible for adhesion of A2058 melanoma cells on this protein (Fig.5 A). The entire type 3 repeats are not required, as a GST fusion protein expressing only the last type 3 repeat and the carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 877–1152) promoted strong adhesion, whereas a GST fusion protein expressing a part of the type 3 repeats without the RGD sequence (residues 784–824) was inactive. The RGD sequence in the type 3 repeats also mediated enhancement of spreading induced by the TSP1 peptides (Fig.5 B). On an intact TSP1 substrate, enhancement of spreading by soluble TSP1 peptides was observed only at limiting concentrations of TSP1. At higher concentrations of TSP1, additional TSP1 receptors may permit αvβ3 integrin-independent spreading. The amino-terminal heparin binding domain may mediate this peptide-independent spreading, because melanoma cells spread on a proteolytic 140-kDa fragment of TSP1 only in the presence of the activating peptides. The CD47-binding site in the carboxyl terminus may not contribute to this response, because the GST-type 3 fusion protein (residues 674–925) and the RGD + carboxyl-terminal domain fusion protein (residues 877–1152) both promoted spreading only in the presence of the activating peptides. Although the RGD + carboxyl-terminal domain fusion protein contains both VVM sequences, these immobilized VVM sequences did not enhance recognition of the RGD in the same protein. Enhancement of spreading on TSP1 and vitronectin are mediated by αvβ3 integrin, because responses to both peptides were reversed by the αvβ3antagonist SB223245 (Fig. 6,p < 0.05 for all conditions treated with SB223245versus the respective controls). Thus, both the type 1 repeat peptide containing the WSXW motif and the CD47-binding peptide from the carboxyl-terminal domains of TSP1 can synergize with the RGD domain of TSP1 to promote αvβ3-dependent spreading of melanoma cells. A soluble GST fusion protein that expressed the type 1 repeat modules containing the TSP1 peptide 246 sequence (residues 385–522) also significantly stimulated αvβ3 activity (Fig. 7). The stimulating activity of the recombinant type 1 repeats was observed using either vitronectin (Fig.7 A) or TSP1 as substrates (Fig. 7 B) and was specific in that GST alone or a GST fusion protein expressing the type 2 repeats of TSP1 (residues 559–669) at the same concentration was inactive. Therefore, the activity of the peptide 246 sequence is replicated by a recombinant fusion protein containing this TSP1 sequence. As reported previously for the CD47-binding sequences of TSP1 using C32 melanoma cells (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), addition of soluble peptide 246 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein comigrating with FAK in A2058 melanoma cells plated on a vitronectin substrate (Fig.8 A). The control peptide 388 did not significantly enhance phosphorylation. The response to peptide 246 was maximal at 15 μm and decreased at higher concentrations in parallel with the decrease in spreading (Fig.1 B). Soluble peptide 246 stimulated a similar level of tyrosine phosphorylation in A2058 cells on a TSP1 substrate (Fig.8 B) that was maximal after 40–60 min. The phosphorylated protein was confirmed to be FAK by immunoprecipitation using a specific antibody (Fig. 8 B). Because the type 1 repeat peptides displayed a strong adhesive activity for melanoma cells (14Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Nègre E. Zabrenetzky V.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19349-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Nègre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that the peptide 246 response results from a pro-adhesive activity of the soluble peptide following its adsorption onto the substrate. If so, then direct coating of the peptides should induce the same cell spreading and tyrosine phosphorylation responses as the soluble peptide. Co-immobilization of the peptides with vitronectin was compared with addition of the same peptides in solution for induction of FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 8 C). Immobilized peptide 7N3 was more active than the soluble peptide for inducing FAK phosphorylation, but peptide 246 was more active when added in solution. We compared the morphology and F-actin organization in cells directly attached on the TSP1 peptides to that of cells attached on vitronectin or TSP1 substrates in the presence or absence of the same peptides. Although the cells spread on peptides 246 and 7N3 (Fig.9, A and B), their morphologies were different from that induced by the soluble peptides added to cells on vitronectin or TSP1 substrates (compare Fig. 9 with Fig. 2, B and C) or by direct adhesion on fibronectin (Fig. 9 C). Actin organized only in the periphery of cells on the peptides (Fig. 9, A and B). Although both the 7N3 and 246 substrates promoted some cell spreading, adhesion of cells on peptides 7N3 or 246 rapidly decreased FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 9 D). Thus, the direct response of A2058 melanoma cells to these immobilized peptides in the absence of an αvβ3 integrin ligand was inhibition rather than stimulation of FAK phosphorylation. We have identified the WSXW peptides in the type 1 repeats as a second TSP1 motif that stimulates αvβ3 integrin function in melanoma cells. Stimulation of αvβ3 integrin by both peptides results in similar enhancement of FAK phosphorylation. This response is sulfation-dependent and is mediated by binding of peptide 246 to HSPGs, which are expressed by the melanoma cells and were shown previously to bind TSP1 (29Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6785-6793PubMed Google Scholar). This activity is expressed both by the synthetic peptide and a recombinant fusion protein containing the type 1 repeats of TSP1. In contrast to the CD47-mediated enhancement by the TSP1 carboxyl-terminal peptides (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), this signal does not require pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Thus, TSP1 contains two independent sequences that can stimulate function of the αvβ3 integrin to interact with ligands including TSP1 itself. This suggests that both the VVM and WSXW motifs may function as synergy sites (35Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for αvβ3-mediated melanoma cell adhesion to TSP1 (Fig. 10). Although soluble TSP1 shows some stimulatory activity for melanoma cell adhesion to immobilized αvβ3 integrin ligands, it is not known which of these two sequences is/are responsible for the activity of the soluble intact protein. Interactions with other extracellular matrix components may also alter the accessibility of both sites in TSP1. The manner in which the type 1 sequences are presented to the melanoma cells appears to be critical for the resulting signal. Soluble peptide 246 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK induced by αvβ3 ligands, but direct adhesion to the immobilized peptide inhibits the same response. Immobilized peptide 246 stimulates melanoma cell adhesion, but the resulting cell morphology differs from that induced on immobilized αvβ3 ligands by addition of the same peptide in solution. These differential responses may have biological significance, because TSP1 is found both as a soluble protein and immobilized in extracellular matrix. TSP1 effects on melanoma behaviorin vivo show a similar dichotomy. Addition of soluble TSP1 to melanoma cells prior to injection in an experimental metastasis assay stimulated lung colonization (36Tuszynski G.P. Gasic T.B. Rothman V.L. Knudsen K.A. Gasic G.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4130-4133PubMed Google Scholar), whereas subclones of a murine melanoma cell line with increased TSP1 expression, which may accumulate in an immobilized state in the matrix, were less metastatic in a spontaneous metastasis assay (37Zabrenetzky V. Harris C.C. Steeg P.S. Roberts D.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These opposing effects on melanoma tumor progression could also arise from differences in the animal models used (38Roberts D.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) but are consistent with the differential activities of soluble versus immobilized TSP1 peptides in vitroto modulate adhesive responses of melanoma cells. Gao et al. (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) reported that stimulation of adhesion by VVM peptides from TSP1 was not limited to vitronectin. TSP1 is another αvβ3 ligand for which recognition is enhanced by 246 and the VVM peptides. However, the α2β1 integrin is not stimulated by either the WSXW or the CD47-binding peptides in A2058 melanoma cells. This result contrasts with smooth muscle cells, in which VVM peptides enhanced α2β1 integrin function (39Wang X. Frazier W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Several results indicate that adhesive activity is not sufficient for a peptide to stimulate αvβ3 integrin activity in melanoma cells. The Mal II peptide promotes adhesion of these cells (23Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), but it does not activate αvβ3integrin. Direct adhesion to peptides 246 and 7N3 in the absence of an αvβ3 integrin ligand induces a signal that opposes that induced by the same peptide when added in solution. Adhesion to immobilized peptides results in inhibition rather than stimulation of FAK phosphorylation, and co-immobilization of peptide 246 with vitronectin did not stimulate FAK phosphorylation as well as addition of the same peptide in solution. Although the effects of pertussis toxin indicate that a different signaling pathway links peptide 246 binding to integrin activation than that utilized by the CD47-binding peptides, the details of this pathway remain unknown. Lack of pertussis toxin sensitivity for the αvβ3 integrin response to peptide 246 is consistent with our previous report (20Guo N. Zabrenetzky V.S. Chandrasekaran L. Sipes J.M. Lawler J. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3154-3162PubMed Google Scholar) that chemotactic and antiproliferative activities of the same peptide for A2058 cells were not inhibited by pertussis toxin.

A similar mechanism for cooperation between integrins and proteoglycans has been proposed to promote interactions of melanoma cells with both fibronectin and type IV collagen (45Knutson J.R. Iida J. Fields G.B. McCarthy J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 46Iida J. Meijne A.M. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1583-1590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggest that cell surface proteoglycans can also induce intracellular signals that modulate integrin function. Protein kinase C is implicated in signaling through syndecan 4 (48Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), regulates stimulation of melanoma cell chemotaxis by TSP1 (20Guo N. Zabrenetzky V.S. Chandrasekaran L. Sipes J.M. Lawler J. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3154-3162PubMed Google Scholar), and can increase integrin activation (reviewed in Ref. 49Kolanus W. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase C using phorbol ester also induced spreading of A2058 melanoma cells on vitronectin, low concentrations of TSP1, and recombinant fragments of TSP1 containing the RGD sequence. 2D. D. Roberts, unpublished results. Thus, the stimulatory effect of peptide 246 on αvβ3may be mediated by protein kinase C. TSP1 interacts with syndecans as well as other HSPGs on melanoma cells (29Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6785-6793PubMed Google Scholar, 50Sun X. Mosher D.F. Rapraeger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2885-2889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions of TSP1 with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans may also promote cell spreading or formation of microspikes (51Adams J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2345-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although TSP1 bound to HSPGs but not chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans extracted from melanoma cells (29Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6785-6793PubMed Google Scholar), and our data demonstrate that an HSPG is required for stimulation of αvβ3integrin function by peptide 246. Based on the activity of this heparin-binding peptide, simultaneous engagement of the heparan sulfate and αvβ3 integrin-binding sites of intact TSP1 may induce synergistic signaling responses in cells that express both classes of receptors. We thank Dr. William H. Miller for providing the integrin antagonists."

These channels are important in physiological processes such as insulin release and they are an important site of drug action.

We have investigated the nature of the interaction between SUR1 and Kir 6.2 and the domains on the channel responsible for the biochemical and functional manifestations of coupling. The results point to the proximal C terminus determining biochemical interaction in a region that also largely governs homotypic and heterotypic interaction between different Kir family members.

Furthermore, this inhibitory action of ATP is antagonized by increasing ADP concentrations. In addition, these channels are the target for a number of therapeutically significant agents. The sulfonylurea class of drug, such as tolbutamide and glibenclamide, inhibit the activity of the channel and form the mainstay of pharmacological therapy of Type II diabetes mellitus, while a chemically diverse group of drugs known as potassium channel openers increase the activity of these channels. This has clinical relevance as a major limiting factor in the use of the antihypertensive agent diazoxide is hyperglycaemia. At the molecular level, the channel is a complex of at least two subunits namely the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), 1The abbreviations used are: SUR, sulfonylurea receptor 1The abbreviations used are: SUR, sulfonylurea receptor a member of the “ATP-binding cassette” (ABC) family of proteins, and a pore forming subunit (Kir 6.0), a member of the inwardly rectifying family of potassium channels. The sulfonylurea receptor was first cloned from pancreatic tissue (SUR1) but a number of other isoforms, occurring predominantly in cardiac (SUR2A) and smooth muscle (SUR2B), have now been characterized (3Aguilar Bryan L.

Two members of Kir 6.0 have so far been isolated (Kir 6.1 and 6.2) and topology models predict an intracellular N and C terminus with two transmembrane domains (M1 and M2) and a pore forming hairpin loop (H5). Heterologous expression of the cloned SUR1 and Kir 6.2 in mammalian cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes reconstitutes the properties of the analogous native current seen in pancreatic beta cells (3Aguilar Bryan L.

The channel is thought to be an octomeric complex made up of four SUR1 subunits and four Kir 6.2 subunits (12Shyng S. Nichols C.G. J. Gen.

Evidence has accumulated indicating that activation by ADP and diazoxide and inhibition by the sulfonylurea class of drug is a property conferred by the sulfonylurea receptor on the channel complex, while the site for ATP inhibition resides on the pore forming Kir 6.2 subunit (9Babenko A.P. Aguilar Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 15Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the combined expression of the two proteins is required to generate current. An unresolved and critical question then is how the sulfonylurea receptor “talks” in molecular terms to the ion conducting subunit Kir 6.2. Such information would be invaluable in building a molecular model of how the ATP-sensitive potassium channel works. Recent studies indicate that other ABC transporters are able to interact with other members of the Kir 6.0 family and other Kir family members. A functional interaction between Kir 6.1 and Kir 1.2 and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator has been demonstrated (19McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Ruknudin A. Schulze D.H. Sullivan S.K. Lederer W.J. Welling P.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 23-30Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and it has been suggested that SUR1 is able to couple with other Kir subfamily members, namely Kir 1.0 and an inward rectifier endogenous to the cell line studied (22Ammala C. Moorhouse A. Gribble F. Ashfield R. Proks P. Smith P.A. Sakura H. Coles B. Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Additionally, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator can interact with the amiloride-sensitive Na+channel and an outwardly rectifying Cl− channel (23Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The association between ABC transporters and potassium channels may be a general biological motif manifest in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (23Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar,24Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Thus the elucidation of this problem may shed light on the general question of how ABC transporters interact with the ion channels and the mechanisms governing the selectivity of this interaction. The data in this study establishes a methodology to examine the interaction between SUR1 and Kir 6.2 and how this relates toK ATP channel physiology and pharmacology. We identify a domain in the proximal C terminus on the pore forming subunit that is responsible for biochemical interaction. Moreover functional studies indicate that while this domain may be necessary for the full reconstitution of I K,ATP drug responsiveness and nucleotide regulation, it is not sufficient. The presence of both regions in the N and distal C terminus is required. Standard molecular cloning and mutagenesis techniques were used. For cell transfections all sulfonylurea receptor cDNAs (hamster clone) were subcloned into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and all channel/channel chimera cDNAs into pcDNA3.1+/Zeo (Invitrogen). Tagged and chimeric proteins were sequenced to confirm their identity. In addition, the sequencing data were complemented by biochemical and functional studies further confirming the intended changes. During the planning of these experiments a strategy was devised so that a number of different biochemical approaches could possibly be used. As a result, ChmD and Chm E were tagged with six histidines at the N terminus and FLAG at the C terminus and Chm F was tagged six histidines at the C terminus and FLAG at the N terminus. Channel chimaeras A, B, and C were generated later in the study when an antibody to Kir 6.2 had been characterized and a strategy settled on. Thus these chimaeras were not epitope tagged. HEK293 cells (a human embryonic kidney cell line) were cultured in minimal essential medium with Earle's Salts,l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (from a stock of 10,000 units/ml penicillin and 1 mg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines were established using the appropriate antibiotic selection with 727 μg of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 364 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). For the establishment of polyclonal lines, cells were grown under selective pressure (727 μg of G418) for 3 weeks after transfection and then frozen down in aliquots for subsequent growth and use in binding studies. For the establishment of monoclonal lines, single colonies were picked after growth under selective pressure (727 μg of G418 and/or 364 μg/ml Zeocin) 3–4 weeks after transfection and propagated to establish monoclonal stable cell lines. The presence of the components in the cell line was established by Western blotting and/or patch clamping. A number of different monoclonal cell lines were isolated for Chms A through E + SUR1-Myc. However, only one line of Chm F + SUR1-Myc could be isolated and then only with an N-terminal FLAG-tagged version. The Myc antibody was used from a hybridoma cell line (9E10 epitope, a gift from Dr. S. Moss). The Myc antibody was coupled to protein A under high salt condition. Kir 6.2 antisera were raised in rabbits to peptides linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin corresponding to sequences in the distal C terminus (peptide sequence RQLDEDRSLLDALTLASSRGPLRKRSC, cysteine added for coupling purposes). Kir 2.1 antisera (a gift of Dr LY Jan) was used as in a previous study (25Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were grown to 100% confluence in a 600-cm2 area dish, washed, and harvested in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Approximately 0.8 mg of protein was homogenized using a 1-ml tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Approximately 80 μg of protein sample from the homogenate was lysed using an equal volume of 2% SDS in upper gel buffer, sonicated, and denatured (94 °C for 3 min) prior to being analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel as a check for expression of the appropriate protein(s). The rest of the homogenate was solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C before centrifugation to remove the unsolubilized material. Approximately 3 mg of Protein A-Sepharose-4B (Pharmacia) was added to the supernatant and incubated with gentle rotation for 2 h at 4 °C to preclear the sample. A 1:1 suspension of Myc antibody coupled to Protein A-Sepharose in TBS + 1% Triton (10 μl) was subsequently applied to the precleared sample and incubated for at least 8 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. After incubation with Myc-Sepharose the sample was washed 4 times with 1 ml of TBS + 1% Triton and once in a final wash with 1 ml of TBS. Bound protein was eluted with 100 μl of 2 times loading buffer and denatured (94 °C for 3 min) prior to analysis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Cells were harvested, homogenized, and solubilized as above. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation and 50 μl of a 50% slurry of Talon resin (CLONTECH) added to the supernatant. The Talon-binding resin is a Co2+-charged tetradentate chelator coupled to Sepharose beads. The sample was exposed to the resin for at least 2 h with gentle rotation at room temperature and subsequently washed 5 times with 1 ml of 20 mm imidazole + 1% Triton in TBS and once in a final wash with 1 ml of 20 mm imidazole in TBS alone. The bound protein was eluted from the resin with 100 μl of 1 m imidazole in TBS, diluted with an equal volume of 2 times gel loading buffer and denatured as described above prior to analysis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes was carried out using the minigel system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were probed as appropriate with Myc antibody (9E10) obtained directly from mouse hybridoma cells, Kir6.2 antibody, or Kir2.1 antibody and the corresponding secondary antibodies before bands were visualized using the ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions. A number of practical problems were encountered with the implementation of the intended strategy. Initially, attempts were made to work with transiently transfected cells, however, it was difficult to express sufficient protein for good biochemical studies and a stable transfection approach was adopted. At the start of the study the intention was to use a commercially available FLAG antibody to detect interactions with Kir 6.2-FLAG. However, the product appeared to be a thousand-fold less sensitive than indicated on the data sheet as determined from dot blots to control fusion protein. Detection of Kir 6.2 by this method was poor and variable. A specific antisera to Kir 6.2 was thus generated. The coimmunoprecipitation strategy using Myc monoclonal antibody harvested from hybridoma cells cultured directly in the laboratory proved robust. A copurification strategy based on purification of a His6-tagged Kir 6.2 and copurification of SUR1-Myc proved more troublesome. Of Kir 6.2-His6, Kir 6.2-FLAGHis6 and Kir 6.2-mycHis6 only the latter would purify with metal chelate affinity chromatography. In addition, a nonspecific interaction of SUR1-Myc with the resin was encountered requiring high imidazole wash concentrations to remove. Because of these factors an interaction was detectable using this method but the final signal was weaker. Cells were grown, washed, harvested, and homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors (as described previously) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). A small fraction of this crude homogenate was used directly in each binding reaction (approximately 60 μg of protein). Incubations were done in the presence of [3H]glibenclamide (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) to assess specific binding. Nonspecific binding was determined by parallel incubations in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled glibenclamide. Binding reactions were incubated for at least 2 h at room temperature before the reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Immediately after stopping the reaction bound ligand was separated from unbound ligand by vacuum filtration onto Whatman GF/B filters. Filters were washed 4 times with 2 ml of ice-cold binding buffer before bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting using Ultima Gold MV (Packard) and a Beckman LS6000TA liquid scintillation counter. Points were determined in triplicate. Radioligand equilibrium binding data were fitted using nonlinear regression (GraphPad Inplot 4.03). Ligand depletion was estimated empirically using a centrifugation binding assay (26Hulme E.C. Hulme E.C. Receptor-Ligand Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992Google Scholar) at a low concentration point and was generally less than 20%. In this case data were fitted to the curve, y=Bmaxx(KD+x)Equation 1 where K D is the binding affinity,B max is the maximal amount bound, yis the amount of tritiated glibenclamide bound per milligram of total protein, and x is the concentration of tritiated glibenclamide in the incubation. Whole cell and inside-out patch clamp recordings of HEK293 cells were performed using the Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) with glass pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass. For whole cell recordings pipettes were pulled with resistance of approximately 1.5–2.5 megohm. For inside-out patches pipettes were pulled with a resistance of approximately 6 megohm. Pipettes were coated with a parafilm/mineral oil suspension after filling. Data were acquired and analyzed using the Digidata 1200B interface and the pClamp 5 and 6 suites of programs. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5–10 kHz. Cells had a capacitance of approximately 15 pF and series resistance was at least 80% compensated. Solutions contained in mm, 107 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 Hepes (KOH to pH 7.2 ∼ 140 mmK+) used as the pipette solution in whole cell studies and the bath in inside-out studies and another that contained 140 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 Hepes (pH 7.4) was used as the bath solution in whole cell studies and pipette solution in the inside-out configuration. ATP containing solutions (magnesium salt) were made up daily from frozen aliquots of concentrated (pH adjusted to 7.2) in 20 mm stock solution in the above whole cell/inside-out solution. ADP (sodium salt, note solutions contain 1.2 mm MgCl2) was added from a concentrated stock. Tolbutamide containing solutions were made up from a concentrated stock in dimethyl sulfoxide and the final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration was at most 0.1%. Diazoxide containing solutions were made up from a concentrated stock in dimethyl sulfoxide and the final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration was 0.2%. When experiments were undertaken with transiently transfected cells (only a small number of experiments here), 50 ng of an enhanced variant of the green fluorescent protein (EGFPN1, CLONTECH) was co-tranfected with the relevant clone. Transfected cells were identified by epifluorescence and patched as above. Current expression was screened for using the whole cell configuration in a pipette solution containing 0 ATP. In our hands whole cell currents did not run down so that we were able to detect small levels of channel expression. The pipette was supplemented with 0.3, 0.6, and 3 mm ATP depending on the current density and the nature of the experiment being undertaken. For example, with the SUR1 + Kir 6.2 line used in Fig. 1 currents were so large with 0 and 0.3 mm ATP that they were difficult to adequately voltage clamp and therefore 0.6 mm ATP was used. Dose-response curves were constructed with application of a dose of drug with wash off to steady-state at each dose. The application of one dose after another was randomly chosen. Curves were fitted using non-linear regression (GraphPad Inplot v4.03) to, IIc=(b−a)11+xEC50nHaEquation 2 where x is the concentration of drug or nucleotide,I/Ic is the effect measured relative to control, the EC50 is the point of 50% effect,n H is the Hill coefficient, b is the maximum effect (in this study the curves are all inhibitory andI/Ic is measured thus b = 1.0), and a is the minimum effect (generally constrained to 0 but allowed to vary for the Chm A + SUR1-Myc tolbutamide dose-response curve). The data were fitted and displayed with the x axis log transformed. In whole cell studies the cell was dialyzed with the relevant ATP concentration until a steady state was reached generally within 5–10 min. Where necessary nonspecific leak was distinguished from K selective current by the use of 10 mm Ba2+ in the bath to block the currents. Currents were measured 20 ms after the voltage was stepped into the relevant pulse. The situation was more complex with inside-out studies. Chm B + SUR1-Myc ran down very quickly and it was impossible to establish stable current recording conditions in this mode. Therefore, single-channel conductance was measured in the cell-attached configuration. Upon patch excision with the other cell lines the data were analyzed in two ways. In the majority of current containing patches a large number of channels were present and macroscopic currents were recorded. Five current-voltage relationships were averaged and current was measured 100 ms into the step pulse. Sometimes only 5 or less channels were present in the patch. We never observed a case where we were convinced of the presence of a single channel with the current densities achieved in this study. Data were analyzed by determining NPo from 30-s sweeps of data. It is possible to produce monoclonal cell lines stably transfected with SUR1 and Kir 6.2 in HEK293 cells by using a dual selection strategy (see “Experimental Procedures”). Studies using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique revealed the presence of a K+ selective current that was inhibited by tolbutamide and activated by diazoxide. In addition, by excising inside-out patches and studying macroscopic currents in this stable line, it is possible to show that the currents are inhibited by ATP and stimulated by MgADP in the bath solution (see below). Thus it is possible to stably express SUR1 and Kir 6.2 in HEK293 cells and functionally recapitulate the properties of the equivalent native channel found in pancreatic beta cells. In order to explore biochemically the interaction between SUR1 and Kir 6.2, these proteins have been tagged with short amino acid sequences that are recognized by an antibody or by a metal chelate affinity resin. Using such approaches it is possible to use a co-immunoprecipitation or co-purification strategy to explore protein-protein interactions (27Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Xu J. Li M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Using standard molecular techniques a series of epitope tags, including six histidines (His6), Myc, and FLAG epitopes, were introduced onto the C terminus of SUR1 (SUR1-Myc, SUR1-MycHis6) and Kir 6.2 (6.2-His6, 6.2-FLAG, 6.2-MycHis6). Kir 2.1 was tagged at the N terminus with six histidines (Kir 2.1-His6) (25Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of such modification of the proteins was first assessed. Radioligand binding using tritiated glibenclamide was performed on homogenates of polyclonal cell lines expressing SUR1, SUR1-Myc, SUR1-MycHis6, and a monoclonal cell line expressing Kir 6.2 and SUR1. The binding parameters (±S.E.,B max in pmol/mg of protein) determined from a number of such experiments were as follows. For SUR1 (n= 4) K D = 1.30 ± 0.05 nm,B max = 14.09 ± 2.21 andn H = 0.97 ± 0.08. For SUR1-Myc (n = 4) K D = 1.25 ± 0.17 nm, B max = 20.43 ± 9.29, andn H = 1.0 ± 0.13. For SUR1-MycHis6 (n = 4) K D= 1.95 ± 0.79 nm, B max = 19.15 ± 6.33, and n H = 0.90 ± 0.11. For Kir 6.2 + SUR (n = 5) K D = 1.41 ± 0.35 nm, B max = 43.1 ± 9.98, and n H = 0.93 ± 0.13. Thus epitope tagging does not affect the ability of the sulfonylurea receptor to bind tritiated glibenclamide with low nanomolar affinity. A number of monoclonal stable lines were established expressing various combinations of tagged and untagged proteins. The qualitative response of some of these to diazoxide and tolbutamide was tested and the mean data obtained at −100 mV (nA, ±S.E.) were as follows. For SUR1 + Kir 6.2: control = 2.99 ± 0.51 (n = 11), addition of 0.5 mm tolbutamide = 0.53 ± 0.08 (n = 9), and addition of 0.4 mmdiazoxide = 6.70 ± 1.53 (n = 5). For SUR1-Myc + 6.2-MycHis6: control = 3.42 ± 0.48 (n = 12), addition of 0.5 mmtolbutamide = 0.71 ± 0.23 (n = 7), and addition of 0.4 mm diazoxide = 6.34 ± 0.77 (n = 6). For SUR1-MycHis6 + 6.2-FLAG: control = 3.8 ± 0.43 (n = 13), addition of 0.5 mm tolbutamide = 0.84 ± 0.16 (n = 8), and addition of 0.4 mmdiazoxide = 7.69 ± 1.78 (n = 8). Thus epitope tagging does not dramatically alter the drug responsiveness. In contrast in a monoclonal line coexpressing SUR1-Myc and Kir 2.1-His6, the strongly rectifying currents of Kir 2.1 were not affected by tolbutamide and diazoxide. The mean data obtained for SUR1-Myc + Kir 2.1-His6 (nA, ±S.E.): control = 8.49 ± 0.76 (n = 17), addition of 0.5 mm tolbutamide = 7.52 ± 0.88 (n= 12), and addition of 0.4 mm diazoxide = 6.93 ± 0.98 (n = 11). Therefore, Kir 2.1-His6 is not functionally modulated by the sulfonylurea receptor. The biochemical characteristics of these cell lines were investigated and Fig. 1 A shows Western blots with the various antibodies and antisera used. The immunoblots show that the antibody and antisera recognize a specific band of the approximately correct molecular weight present in stably transfected but not wild type HEK293 cells for SUR1-Myc, Kir 2.1, and Kir 6.2. SUR1-Myc was generally identified as a doublet of approximately 170 and 140 kDa in size. This is likely to represent differences in post-translational modification especially glycosylation (29Nelson D.A. Bryan J. Wechsler S. Clement IV, J.P. Aguilar Bryan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14793-14799Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Kir 2.1-His6 was recognized as a single band with a slightly higher molecular weight than might be expected from its primary sequence as noted previously (25Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Kir 6.2 was identified as a single band of approximately 44 kDa. Using this antibody occasional background bands were noted. Fig. 1 B shows the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the Myc antibody against SUR1-Myc in the lines SUR1-Myc + Kir 6.2-FLAG and SUR1-Myc + Kir 6.2-His6. Immunoprecipitation of SUR1-Myc results in the coimmunoprecipitation of 6.2-FLAG and 6.2-His6. This result is likely to be due to a specific protein-protein interaction as Kir 6.2 does not copurify in immune complexes if SUR1 is not tagged with Myc and Kir 2.1-His6 does not co-immunoprecipitate with SUR1-Myc. These experiments were repeated on at least two other occasions with similar results. Fig. 1 C shows the result of a co-purification strategy based on metal chelate affinity chromatography recognizing a hexahistidine tag in the line SUR1-Myc + Kir 6.2-MycHis6. Purification of 6.2-MycHis6 leads to the copurification of SUR1-Myc. This result is likely to indicate a specific protein-protein interaction. The wash conditions are adequate because SUR1-Myc does not purify when expressed alone. Additionally, the purification of Kir 2.1-His6 does not lead to the co-purification of SUR1-Myc. These experiments were repeated on at least two other occasions with similar results. Of the two strategies, that based on immunoprecipitation proved the most robust and was used to explore the interaction domain. In order to explore the domains responsible on the channel for the biochemical interaction with the sulfonylurea receptor, a chimeric analysis was undertaken between a channel that does not interact with SUR1, namely Kir 2.1 and one that does Kir 6.2.

https://openalex.org/W2090464941,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been suggested to function in remodeling of the arterial wall, but no information is available on their possible role in early atherogenesis, when cholesterol accumulates in the cells of the arterial intima, forming foam cells. Here, we incubated the major component responsible for efflux of cholesterol from foam cells, high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3), with MMP-1, -3, -7, -9, or -12 at 37 °C before adding it to cholesterol-loaded human monocyte-derived macrophages. After incubation with MMP-3, -7, or -12, the ability of HDL3 to induce the high affinity component of cholesterol efflux from the macrophage foam cells was strongly reduced, whereas preincubation with MMP-1 reduced cholesterol efflux only slightly and preincubation with MMP-9 had no effect. These differential effects of the various MMPs were reflected in their differential abilities to degrade the small pre-β migrating particles present in the HDL3 fraction. NH2-terminal sequence and mass spectrometric analyses of the apolipoprotein (apo) A-I fragments generated by MMPs revealed that those MMPs that strongly reduced cholesterol efflux (MMPs-3, -7, and -12) cleaved the COOH-terminal region of apoA-I and produced a major fragment of about 22 kDa, whereas MMPs-1 and -9, which had little and no effect on cholesterol efflux, degraded apoA-I only slightly and not at all, respectively. These results show, for the first time, that some members of the MMP family can degrade the apoA-I of HDL3, so blocking cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells. This expansion of the substrate repertoire of MMPs to include apoA suggests that these proteinases are directly involved in the accumulation of cholesterol in atherosclerotic lesions. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been suggested to function in remodeling of the arterial wall, but no information is available on their possible role in early atherogenesis, when cholesterol accumulates in the cells of the arterial intima, forming foam cells. Here, we incubated the major component responsible for efflux of cholesterol from foam cells, high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3), with MMP-1, -3, -7, -9, or -12 at 37 °C before adding it to cholesterol-loaded human monocyte-derived macrophages. After incubation with MMP-3, -7, or -12, the ability of HDL3 to induce the high affinity component of cholesterol efflux from the macrophage foam cells was strongly reduced, whereas preincubation with MMP-1 reduced cholesterol efflux only slightly and preincubation with MMP-9 had no effect. These differential effects of the various MMPs were reflected in their differential abilities to degrade the small pre-β migrating particles present in the HDL3 fraction. NH2-terminal sequence and mass spectrometric analyses of the apolipoprotein (apo) A-I fragments generated by MMPs revealed that those MMPs that strongly reduced cholesterol efflux (MMPs-3, -7, and -12) cleaved the COOH-terminal region of apoA-I and produced a major fragment of about 22 kDa, whereas MMPs-1 and -9, which had little and no effect on cholesterol efflux, degraded apoA-I only slightly and not at all, respectively. These results show, for the first time, that some members of the MMP family can degrade the apoA-I of HDL3, so blocking cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells. This expansion of the substrate repertoire of MMPs to include apoA suggests that these proteinases are directly involved in the accumulation of cholesterol in atherosclerotic lesions. One key factor in the prevention of atherosclerosis is considered to be the ability of high density lipoproteins (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; apo, apolipoprotein; CETP, cholesterol ester transfer protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PLTP, phospholipid transfer protein; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; apo, apolipoprotein; CETP, cholesterol ester transfer protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PLTP, phospholipid transfer protein; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid to remove excess cholesterol from cholesterol-loaded macrophage foam cells. This is the initial step of reverse cholesterol transport, along the pathway by which cholesterol is carried from the peripheral tissues back to the liver (1Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 2Barter P. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 210-217Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The major component of HDL is apoA-I, which, in addition to a structural role, also has a biological function, playing the key role in the initiation of reverse cholesterol transport (3Tailleux A. Fruchart J.-C. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 33: 163-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mature form of the apoA-I, a 243-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 28 kDa, can combine with lipids to form stable structures of three types: (i) small lipid-poor complexes; (ii) flattened discoidal particles containing only polar lipids; and (iii) spherical particles containing both polar and nonpolar lipids (as reviewed in Ref. 4Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the lipid-poor complexes with lipid contents of 10–40%, each particle contains only one apoA-I molecule, and this has a unique conformation with a much lower α-helical content than the apoA-I in particles of the other types. The discoidal particles consist of a single lipid bilayer with repeating 22-amino acid helices of apoA-I which are suggested to run around the disc in a belt-like fashion. In the spherical particles, in contrast, the organization of apoA-I is suggested to be disordered: β turns of different apoA-I molecules may be in contact with each other on the surface of the sphere.The HDLs are a highly heterogeneous family of particles that have been classified into several subgroups according to their density (HDL2, HDL3), apolipoprotein (apo) composition (apoA-I without A-II, apoA-I with apoA-II), or electrophoretic mobility (α-migrating HDL, pre-β-migrating HDL) (5von Eckardstein A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In recent years, much attention has been focused on the small fractions of lipid-poor HDL particles (the small lipid-poor complexes; see above) that exhibit electrophoretic pre-β mobility (pre-β HDL), in contrast to the major spherical components of HDL, which exhibit α mobility. The total efflux of cholesterol from cells is believed to depend on two components: one that is nonspecific, based on aqueous diffusion of cholesterol from the cell's plasma membrane to fully lipidated apoA-I, such as the mature HDL3 particles, and the other that is specific and depends on interaction between lipid-poor apoA-I (pre-β HDL) and particular domains or proteins of the cell membrane (6Phillips M.C.

Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The pre-β has been suggested to act as a shuttle, transporting free cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the fully lipidated mature HDL species (8Miida T. Kawano M. Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11112-11117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Francone O.L. Fielding C.J. Eur. Heart J. 1990; 11: 218-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rodrigueza W.V.

Biol. 1997; 17: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).A prerequisite for the action of HDL particles as efficient acceptors of cellular cholesterol is their integrity. Thus, chemical modifications of HDL in vitro, such as copper-mediated oxidation, treatment with trypsin or pronase, or glycation, all reduce the efficiency with which HDL induce cholesterol efflux from cells (11Nagano Y. Arai H. Kita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6457-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Oram J.F. Mendez A.J. Slotte J.P. Johnson T.F. Arterioscler.

In a more physiological system, we have observed that mast cells reduce a high affinity component of the cholesterol efflux promoted by HDL3 from cholesterol-loaded macrophages in culture (14Lee M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lindstedt L. Lee M. Castro G.R. Fruchart J.-C. Kovanen P.T. J. Clin.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This mast cell-mediated mechanism was found to be due to proteolytic degradation of HDL3 apoproteins by the neutral protease chymase, which is present in the exocytosed mast cell granules also found in atherosclerotic lesions. Most importantly, HDL3 function was lost after only a minimal degree of proteolysis, suggesting that the high affinity process involves a minor subfraction of HDL particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage (14Lee M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are also present in atherosclerotic lesions. These proteinases are a family of at least 16 distinct, but structurally related, neutral proteases which are specialized in degrading the various components of the extracellular matrix (17Dollery C.M. McEwan J.R. Henney A.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 18Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp.

MMPs can be divided, according to their substrate specificity, into four subgroups: collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, and membrane-type MMPs. Here, we have examined the effects of some members of the first three subgroups of MMPs: the fibroblast type collagenase (MMP-1) of the group of collagenases; stromelysin (MMP-3), matrilysin (MMP-7), and human metalloelastase (MMP-12) of the group of stromelysins (or stromelysin-like MMPs); and 92-kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) of the group of gelatinases (18Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 19Shapiro S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Lipid-laden macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions have been shown to produce several members of the MMP family. These include MMPs-1, -2, -3, -7, - 9, and -12 (20Nikkari S.T. O'Brien K.D.

Invest. 1994; 94: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2183) Google Scholar). As demonstrated by Galis et al. (23Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (2183) Google Scholar), at least some of these MMPs are proteolytically active in atheromas. However, nothing is known about their possible involvement in cellular cholesterol accumulation. Here we show that MMPs-1, -3, -7, and -12, but not MMP-9, can degrade the apoA-I of HDL3, and so block cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded human macrophages in vitro.RESULTSTo generate [3H]cholesteryl ester-containing foam cells, human monocyte-derived macrophages were incubated with3H-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein (25 μg/ml) for 48 h. During incubation, the content of cholesteryl esters in the macrophages increased from ∼3 μg to ∼90 μg/mg cell protein. Subsequent incubation of the cells with HDL3 resulted in a constant efflux of 3H radioactivity into the incubation medium for at least 6 h, the time interval chosen for the efflux experiments. We then preincubated HDL3 with MMP-3, -7, or -12 for up to 2 h or with MMP-1 or -9 for up to 72 h, and added the variously treated HDL3 preparations to human macrophage foam cells (Fig. 1). After pretreatment with any of the first three MMPs for only 30 min, HDL3 rapidly lost its ability to induce cholesterol efflux, which had fallen to about 20% of the initial value. In contrast, the effect of MMP-1 on the efflux-inducing function of HDL3 was much weaker. After incubation for 2 h, cholesterol efflux was only slightly reduced, and the rate of efflux was significantly reduced only after 72 h. Finally, when HDL3 was pretreated with MMP-9, its ability to promote cholesterol efflux did not decrease even after prolonged treatment with the active enzyme (12.5 units/300 μl). When the variously pretreated HDL3 particles were added to cholesterol-loaded mouse peritoneal macrophages, the results were identical (not shown).Fig. 2 compares the relation between the concentration of HDL3 and the rate of [3H]cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells. If native HDL3 was added to the incubation medium, the rate of cholesterol efflux rose rapidly at low concentrations of HDL3. In striking contrast, addition of MMP-3-treated HDL3 to the incubation system led to only a minimal increase in cholesterol efflux, and this increase was not dose-dependent at the HDL3 concentrations tested. Thus, proteolytic treatment of HDL3 appeared to abolish the high affinity component responsible for the rapid efflux of cholesterol at low HDL3 concentrations.Figure 2Relation of [3H]cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells to the concentrations of HDL3 and MMP-3-treated HDL3.[3H]Cholesterol-loaded foam cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of control HDL3 or with HDL3, which had been treated with MMP-3 (0.02 mg/ml) for 2 h. After incubation of the cells with the HDL3preparations at 37 °C for 6 h, the 3H radioactivities found in the culture media were determined and plotted as functions of HDL3 concentration. Values are mean ± S.E. (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Gel filtration of HDL3 on a Superose 12 column and analysis of the eluate showed not only a major HDL peak, but also a minor peak of small-sized particles (Fig.3 A). In cellulose acetate electrophoresis, these smaller particles showed pre-β mobility, and immunoblotting of the isolated particles after SDS-PAGE confirmed that they contained apoA-I (not shown). We then treated aliquots of HDL3 for 2 h with each of the MMPs separately. Treatment with MMP-3, -7, or -12, i.e. with those MMPs that had caused loss of the cholesterol efflux-inducing capacity of HDL3, also resulted in disappearance of the small particles (Fig. 3 A). MMP-1, which had only a slight effect on the cholesterol efflux-inducing capacity of HDL3, caused a slight shift to the right in the elution of the small particles, reflecting an apparent decrease in their size. But MMP-9, which did not reduce the cholesterol efflux inducing capacity of HDL3, also failed to reduce the quantity of the small particles. In a separate experiment (Fig. 3 B), HDL3 and MMP-3-treated HDL3 were electrophoresed on a cellulose acetate membrane, and this experiment also revealed the absence of pre-β particles from the MMP-3-treated HDL3 (Fig.3 B, lower panel). Finally, when purified apoA-I was treated with MMP-7, which, like MMP-3, caused complete loss of the small particles, its ability to promote cholesterol efflux was rapidly and strongly reduced (Fig. 4)Figure 3Analysis of matrix metalloproteinase-treated HDL3 by gel filtration (A) and cellulose acetate electrophoresis (B). HDL3were incubated for 2 h with matrix metalloproteinases as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” and applied to a Superose 12-gel filtration column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min (A).

[3H]Cholesterol-loaded foam cells were incubated with apoA-I (25 μg/ml) which had been treated with MMP-7 for the indicated times. After incubation of the cells with the various apoA-I preparations at 37 °C for 6 h, the 3H radioactivity found in the culture medium was determined and plotted as a function of duration of apoA-I exposure to MMP-7. Each point represents a mean of triplicate incubations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Gel filtration study of HDL3 revealed that treatment of HDL3 with those MMPs (MMPs-3, -7, and -12) that cause loss of its cholesterol efflux-inducing capacity also caused loss of the minor peak having pre-β mobility. We therefore made a separate study of the capacities of the major and the minor peak to induce cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells. As shown in TableI, with the material eluting in the minor peak (1750 dpm) the ability to induce cholesterol efflux was slightly less than half of that of the material eluting in the major peak (3990 dpm). The ability of the material in the minor peak to induce cholesterol efflux was particularly high, considering that in the HDL3 fraction the mass ratio of the minor to the major peak was 1:10, and accordingly, in the incubation medium, the protein concentration of the material derived from the minor peak was 2 μg/ml and that of the material derived from the major peak was 20 μg/ml. This result also demonstrated that, despite its high specific activity, the material eluting in the minor peak did not account for the full efflux capacity of the HDL3 fraction. Furthermore, as shown in Table I, treatment of the material from the minor and the major peaks with MMP-3 reduced their ability to induce cholesterol efflux to similar extents. SDS-PAGE analysis of the major and the minor peaks revealed that MMP-3 treatment resulted in almost complete degradation of the apoA-I in the minor peak, but in only a minor degree of degradation of the apoA-I in the major peak (Fig.5).Table IEffect of MMP-3 on the capacities of HDL3 size fractions to induce cholesterol efflux from human monocyte-derived macrophage foam cells[3H]Cholesterol efflux, fractionated HDL3Major peak (20 μg/ml)Minor peak (2 μg/ml)dpm/6h/dishControl HDL33990 ± 3301750 ± 480MMP-3-treated HDL3780 ± 90ap < 0.05 versus control.361 ± 190ap < 0.05 versus control.HDL3 was fractionated on a Superose 12 column into a major and a minor peak (see Fig. 3).

[3H]Cholesterol-loaded foam cells were then incubated with material from the major peak (20 μg/ml) or the minor peak (2 μg/ml), i.e. using quantities reflecting their approximate proportion in the bulk HDL3.

Each value represents a mean ± S.E. of triplicate incubations of macrophages obtained from two different buffy coats (n = 6). Thep value (0.05) was determined by Student's ttest for paired samples, and was considered statistically significant. Note that the major peak of control HDL3 contains particles with both α and pre-β mobility, whereas the major peak of MMP-3-treated HDL3 contains only particles with α mobility.a p < 0.05 versus control.

The materials from the major and the minor peaks (each 1 mg/ml) were incubated separately at 37 °C with MMP-3 (0.02 mg/ml) for 2 h. Aliquots were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To study further this unexpected observation that apoA-I degradation of the major peak, even though of minor degree, caused a significant loss (by half) of its cholesterol inducing ability, we reanalyzed the material from the major peak of the control samples by cellulose acetate electrophoresis and found that, in addition to the α band, it also contained a pre-β band, revealing regeneration of pre-β particles. In sharp contrast, no pre-β band was observed in the MMP-3-treated material collected from the major peak. The regeneration of pre-β particles by the material eluting in the major peak, and loss of this pre-β regenerating ability after MMP-3 treatment, provide plausible explanations for the observation that MMP-3 treatment caused a dramatic loss of the cholesterol efflux inducing capacity, which equaled the loss observed when the material eluting in the minor peak was treated with MMP-3.SDS-PAGE analysis of MMP-treated HDL3 revealed rapid degradation of apoA-I during incubation with MMP-3, -7, or -12,i.e. with the enzymes that inhibited HDL3-dependent cholesterol efflux from foam cells (Fig. 6). These enzymes degraded apoA-I (28 kDa) to forms with apparent molecular mass of 24–26 kDa and to smaller fragments of approximately 14 and 6 kDa. In contrast, when HDL3 was incubated with MMP-1, degradation products appeared much less rapidly and, when HDL3 was incubated with MMP-9, no degradation products appeared. In another experiment, proteolysis with the various MMPs was continued for 72 h. SDS-PAGE analysis of the degraded HDL3 preparations revealed the following bands (Fig. 7): MMP-3 had degraded almost all of the apoA-I without causing any apparent change in apoA-II, the ∼14-kDa fragment being strongly accumulated. Similarly, the ∼14-kDa fragment was enriched when HDL3was incubated with two other efflux decreasing MMPs (7 or 12). MMP-1, which decreased the HDL3-induced efflux only after prolonged incubation with HDL3, also caused enrichment of the ∼14-kDa fragment, and, in addition, smaller degradation products became visible. In contrast to MMPs-3, -7, and -12, MMP-1 also appeared to degrade apoA-II. MMP-9, which had no effect on HDL3-induced efflux even after incubation for 72 h (see Fig. 1), appeared to degrade only apoA-II. A similar degradation pattern was seen with another gelatinase, MMP-2, which also failed to decrease HDL3-induced cholesterol efflux significantly after incubation with HDL3 for 72 h (not shown). In summary, the SDS-PAGE analysis suggests that apoA-II is more vulnerable to gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) than apoA-I, but that this proteolysis alone does not significantly reduce HDL3-induced cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells.Figure 6Proteolytic degradation of HDL3by matrix metalloproteinases.

We therefore chose the larger fragments for more detailed analysis. Using strategies based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry combined with NH2-terminal sequencing, we identified the MMP cleavage sites in apoA-I that produce fragments larger than 14 kDa. The major fragments of apoA-I (14–26 kDa) from the MMP-3, -7, and -12-treated HDL3, when subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing, were all found to have the NH2-terminal sequence of apoA-I (DEPPQ … ) intact, thus confirming that, with these MMPs, breakdown of apoA-I occurs at its COOH terminus. Mass analysis (TableII) of MMP-3-treated HDL3yielded major signals at three m/z values over 14,000: m/z 28,080, 22,220, and 14,723 [M + H]+, corresponding to intact apoA-I, apoA-I cleaved at the Glu191-Tyr192 bond, and apoA-I cleaved at the Glu125-Leu126 bond, respectively.

Mass analysis of MMP-12-treated HDL3 yielded major signals at six m/z values over 14,000:m/z 28,079, 25,989, 24,637, 23,155, 22,211, and 14,254 [M + H]+, corresponding to intact apoA-I and apoA-I cleaved at the Phe225-Lys226, Asp213-Leu214, His199-Leu200, Glu191-Tyr192, and Pro121-Leu122 bonds, respectively.Table IIFragmentation of apoA-1 by MMPs-3, -7, and -12Fragment massCounterpart massObservedAssignmentCalculatedCalculatedObservedMMP-328,080D1-Q24328,08022,220D1-E19122,2235,8755,87614,723D1-E12514,72713,371MMP-728,079D1-Q24328,08024,650D1-D21324,6453,45323,452D1-T20223,4624,6364,64014,259D1-P12114,25913,839MMP-1228,079D1-Q24328,08025,989D1-F22525,9983,45324,637D1-D21324,6454,9384,93723,155D1-H19923,1605,8755,87622,211D1-E19122,22313,83914,254D1-P12114,259Using strategies based on MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy combined with NH2-terminal sequencing, MMP cleavage sites in apoA-I that produced fragments larger than 14 kDa were identified. Open table in a new tab Using gel filtration through a Superose 12 column, we then isolated from HDL3 the minor peak of small sized particles, which showed pre-β mobility in cellulose acetate electrophoresis (see Fig.3, A and B), and separately treated aliquots of this fraction with MMP-3 for 2 h. Importantly, after incubation for as little as 15 min, 90% of the intact apoA-I in these small particles had been converted into 24-kDa sized fragments, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 8). Mass analysis of the MMP-3-treated pre-β particles yielded major signals at threem/z values over 14,000: m/z28,080, 22,220, and 14,723 [M + H]+, corresponding to intact apoA-I, apoA-I cleaved at the Glu191-Tyr192 bond, and apoA-I cleaved at the Glu125-Leu126 bond, respectively. The spectrum was identical with that of MMP-3-treated total HDL3. In sharp contrast, free apolipoprotein A-I isolated from lipoproteins was rapidly degraded by MMP-3 without apparent preference of cleavage sites (not shown).Figure 8Proteolytic degradation by MMP-3 of material contained in HDL3 and eluting from a Superose 12 column as a minor peak. The material from the minor peak (0.9 mg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C with MMP-3 (0.02 mg/ml) for the indicated time periods. Aliquots were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since proteolytic breakdown occurred at the COOH terminus of the apoA-I, determination of the cleavage sites by direct sequence analysis was not possible. The cleavage sites had to be deduced from the combined information afforded by the NH2-terminal sequences and the masses of fragments. The assignment of the cleavage sites determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry can be considered reliable, since the accuracy of the instrument in the mass range studied is better than 0.05% (error less than ± 14 Da for 28 kDa protein). Thus, a combination of the known NH2-terminal sequences, the protein sequences, and the fragment masses with the information that the apoA-I did not contain post-translational modifications provides sufficient data for deducing the COOH-terminal sequences by mere calculation (see Table II).DISCUSSIONThe present study shows that several members of the MMP family are able to degrade human HDL3, thereby dramatically decreasing its capacity to promote cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded human monocyte-macrophages. MMPs-3, -7, and -12, which have broad substrate specificity (18Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), were the most efficient in degrading apoA-I; MMP-1, which has a more restricted substrate specificity, did so far less efficiently, and MMP-9, which also possesses r"
https://openalex.org/W2006997174,"Type 2 diabetes is characterized by decreased rates of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and utilization, reduced hexokinase II mRNA and enzyme production, and low basal levels of glucose 6-phosphate in insulin-sensitive skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Hexokinase II is primarily expressed in muscle and adipose tissues where it catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate, a possible rate-limiting step for glucose disposal. To investigate the role of hexokinase II in insulin action and in glucose homeostasis as well as in mouse development, we generated a hexokinase II knock-out mouse. Mice homozygous for hexokinase II deficiency (HKII−/−) died at approximately 7.5 days post-fertilization, indicating that hexokinase II is vital for mouse embryogenesis after implantation and before organogenesis. HKII+/− mice were viable, fertile, and grew normally. Surprisingly, even though HKII+/− mice had significantly reduced (by 50%) hexokinase II mRNA and activity levels in skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue, they did not exhibit impaired insulin action or glucose tolerance even when challenged with a high-fat diet.

Type 2 diabetes is a common disorder affecting about 3–5% of Western populations. Although the etiology of Type 2 diabetes has remained largely unknown, impaired insulin action in peripheral tissues coupled with a defect in insulin secretion capacity of the pancreatic β cells play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disease (1DeFronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). Type 2 diabetes is characterized by decreased rates of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and utilization (2Moller D.E. Flier J.S. New Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 938-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The causes for impaired insulin action can be multiple, ranging from defects in insulin's binding to its receptor to the final steps of insulin's action on carbohydrate metabolism. Mutations in the insulin and insulin receptor genes are uncommon causes for insulin resistance (3Steiner D.F. Tager H.S. Chan S.J. Nanjo K. Sanke T. Rubenstein A.H. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Taylor S.I. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1473-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The major site of impaired insulin action in Type 2 diabetes locates at the post-receptor level and remains to be determined. Insulin binding to its receptor activates a cascade of intracellular events. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-subunit of the insulin receptor activates insulin receptor substrates which mediate multiple insulin actions (5Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 643-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first step in glucose metabolism is its transport into cells where it is rapidly phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) 1The abbreviations used are: Glu-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; Glu-6-P isomerase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; neo, neomycin phosphotransferase; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ES, embryonic stem by hexokinases. In mammalian tissues the phosphorylation of glucose to Glu-6-P is catalyzed by the four members of an isoenzyme family of hexokinases (ATP:d-hexose-6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) (6Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 126: 65-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hexokinases I-III (100 kDa) exhibit high affinity to glucose and are subject to feedback inhibition by Glu-6-P. Glucokinase (50 kDa) exhibits low affinity to glucose and is not inhibited by physiological concentrations of Glu-6-P. It has been suggested that hexokinases I-III arose from an ancestral gene similar to glucokinase or yeast hexokinase by gene duplication and tandem ligation (7Easterby J.S. O'Brien M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Ureta T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1982; 71: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A defect in phosphorylation of glucose by the glucokinase gene (= hexokinase IV) results in impaired insulin secretion and maturity onset diabetes of the young (9Hager J. Blanche H. Sun F.

Glucose transport is commonly viewed as the rate-limiting step for insulin-mediated glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (11Ziel F.H. Venkatesan N. Davidson M.B. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 885-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, glucose phosphorylation could be a rate-limiting step under hyperglycemia (12Chang P.Y. Jensen J. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14834-14839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Indeed, reduced hexokinase II mRNA and enzyme production and low basal levels of Glu-6-P in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, where hexokinase II is mainly expressed (13Printz R.L. Koch S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5209-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have been found in Type 2 diabetic patients (14Shulman R.G. Rothman D.L. Price T. Diabetes. 1996; 45 Suppl 1: S93-S98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kruszynska Y.T. Mulford M.I. Baloga J. Yu J.G. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hence, hexokinase II is a promising candidate gene for insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Indeed, mutations in the coding region of hexokinase II gene have been observed in approximately 6% of Finnish Type 2 diabetic patients (16Laakso M. Malkki M. Deeb S.S. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The generation of mice lacking hexokinase II can give a definite answer as to whether or not diminished levels of hexokinase II can cause Type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance. Previous studies, where mice homozygous for the null allele of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Glu-6-P isomerase) were embryonic lethal, have indicated that anaerobic glycolysis is the predominant energy delivering pathway in early post-implantation embryos (17West J.D. Flockhart J.H. Peters J. Ball S.T. Genet. Res. (Camb.). 1990; 56: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Merkle S. Pretsch W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1992; 101: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that glycolysis is critical for normal gastrulation in the mouse. Because hexokinase II regulates the key enzyme of glycolysis, targeted disruption of this gene provides information also on critical steps in mouse embryonic development. In this paper we report the generation of a hexokinase II-deficient mouse. We demonstrate that, whereas homozygosity for the disrupted hexokinase II gene causes embryonic lethality, heterozygosity is not associated with abnormalities in glucose tolerance or insulin action. Animals were kept at the National Laboratory Animal Center of the University of Kuopio on a 12-h day/night cycle and were fed regular chow. Housing and procedures involving experimental animals were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Welfare and Use Committee of the University of Kuopio, Finland. To clone the mouse hexokinase II gene, 129/SvJ mouse genomic library (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) was screened with rat hexokinase II cDNA (gift from Dr. J. E. Wilson, Michigan State University). The region of hexokinase II enzyme encoded by exon 4 and onwards has been shown to contain glucose and ATP-binding sites (6Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 126: 65-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two DNA sequences containing mouse hexokinase II exon 4 (XbaI fragment) and exons 5–10 (XbaI-XhoI fragment) were subcloned to pUC19 cloning vector, yielding p8X4 and p2XS1, respectively. The mouse hexokinase II gene was disrupted by inserting a positive selection cassette from pTV-0 (gift from Dr. H. van der Putten), including a gene for neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) driven by herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, into a BsmI site of exon 4 in p8X4 via an oligonucleotide linker containing a XhoI site, yielding p8X4Neo. The XbaI fragment of p8X4Neo was then inserted into the XbaI site of p2XS1, yielding the final targeting vector, pHK2Neo (Fig. 1 A), having 0.6-kb 5′ and 9.2-kb 3′ homology arms. Thirty micrograms of agarose gel purified VspI fragment from pHK2Neo was introduced to 129/Ola mouse E14 embryonic stem cells (19Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) by electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad Life Science Group, Hercules, CA) essentially as described previously (20Joyner A.L. Gene Targeting: A Practical Approach. First Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). To screen for the correctly targeted hexokinase II gene, the cell clones surviving neomycin selection were analyzed by PCR under standard conditions using a forward primer within the 5′-region outside of the targeting vector (HK2KO-F1, 5′-AACCACGACGCCCAATGATTTAG-3′) and a reverse primer within the neo cassette (Neo-R1, 5′-GTGCCCAGTCATAGCCGAATAGC-3′), as indicated in Fig. 1 A. To verify the correct targeting, 10-μg aliquots of genomic DNA from PCR-positive clones were digested either with XbaI orBamHI and subjected to Southern blot analysis using thePstI-XbaI (Fig. 1 A, probe a) or XbaI-VspI (Fig. 1 A, probe b) fragments of the mouse HKII gene, respectively, as probes. Blots of XbaI-digested DNA were also probed for neo (Fig.1 A, probe c) in order to verify the lack of additional random integration of the targeting vector. ES cells carrying the correctly disrupted hexokinase II gene were aggregated with BALB/c × DBA/2 morulae (21Wood S.A. Allen N.D. Rossant J. Auerbach A. Nagy A. Nature. 1993; 365: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Morula aggregates were transferred into pseudopregnant BALB/c × DBA/2 foster mothers. The resulting chimeric males, identified by the presence of agouti coat pigmentation, were bred to BALB/c × DBA/2 females to establish germline transmission of the disrupted allele. The offspring carrying disrupted hexokinase II alleles was identified by PCR as described for ES cells. Further verification of correct targeting was accomplished by PCR amplification with forward primer HK2KO-F2 (5′-ACTCTCCTGCCGCCCTGC-3′) and reverse primers Neo-R1 and HK2KO-R1 (Fig. 1 A). This allele discriminating PCR scheme allowed convenient detection of both wild type and disrupted hexokinase II alleles in one PCR reaction. The established mouse lines carrying the disrupted hexokinase II allele were identified as Ukko1, 2Ukko is an abbreviation designated for knock-out mouse lines generated at the University of Kuopio, Finland. -2, and -3. HKII+/− male mice were further backcrossed to BALB/c × DBA/2 females to dilute the 129/Ola genetic background originating from the embryonic stem cells. 3The number of preceding backgrosses to BALB/c × DBA/2 females is indicated as a subscript number (x) in Fx following the line name (for example, Ukko1F2 mice result from the second backgross). An attempt was also made to breed the chimera directly with the 129/Ola mouse line (Harlan UK Limited, Blackthorn, UK), but this proved to be virtually impossible due to the very poor reproduction capacity of 129/Ola mice. HKII+/− mice were mated and the offspring was analyzed by allele discriminating PCR, and by Southern blotting, as described above. Since no HKII−/− offspring was detected, the embryos at selected developmental stages were analyzed. To analyze blastocysts, morulae were flushed from the oviducts at the third day of the pregnancy and grown in M16 medium overnight. Blastocysts detected visually as viable were washed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and transferred individually to 3 μl of 1 × PCR buffer containing 50 μg/ml proteinase K, lysed for 2 h at 55 °C, and subjected to allele discriminating PCR as described above. To analyze gastrulae, embryos were dissected at 7.5 and 8.5 days post-coitum from pregnant mothers in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, photographed, and analyzed by allele discriminating PCR as described above. Total RNA was isolated from hind limb muscle, heart, and adipose tissue of 10-week-old HKII+/+ and HKII+/− male Ukko1F2 mice by the acidic guanidinium thiocyanate method (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). Fifteen to 20 μg of total RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gel under denaturing conditions, transferred onto positively charged nylon membrane, and hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled mouse hexokinase II cDNA probe encompassing exons 11 to 13. The blots were visualized on autoradiography film, and hexokinase II mRNA expression levels were determined from scanned images of the blots. Equal loading of RNAs was verified by methylene blue staining of the membrane. HKII+/+ and HKII+/− male Ukko1F2 hind limb muscle, heart, and adipose tissue, 50–300 mg each, were homogenized on ice for 45 s with Teflon pestle in 4–5 volumes of TEN buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with 10 mmmonothioglycerol. Homogenates were sonicated for 20 s, kept on ice for 30 min, and subjected to 1 h, 13,000 rpm centrifugation at +4 °C. One aliquot of the soluble fraction was used to assay total hexokinase activity, and another was heat-treated at +45 °C for 1 h and assayed for the heat stable hexokinase activity, mainly hexokinase I (23Wilson J.E. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Grossbard L. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3546-3560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hexokinase activity was determined at room temperature by measuring the formation of coenzyme NADPH in a coupled enzyme assay system containing Glu-6-P dehydrogenase fromLeuconostoc mesenteroides (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzyme activities for hexokinase I and II are expressed as milliunits per minute per milligram protein, where 1 unit equals to the amount of enzyme activity forming 1 μmNADPH in 1 min at 23 °C and pH 8.0. For the insulin tolerance test, 5 HKII+/+ and 5 HKII+/−female, 16-week-old Ukko1F2 mice were fasted for more than 12 h, anaesthetized with fentanyl-fluanisone (Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium) and midazolam (Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland), and placed on a warm (37 °C) surface. After intraperitoneal injection of 0.75 milliunits/g (body weight) insulin (Actrapid, Novo Nordisc, Denmark), samples of blood were drawn at different time points (0, 15, 30, and 60 min) from the tail vein. Plasma glucose concentrations were determined by Glucose & Lactate Analyzer 2300 Stat Plus (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH). For the glucose tolerance test, 10 HKII+/+ and 10 HKII+/−male, 11-week-old Ukko1F2mice were prepared as described above, and intraperitoneally injected with 1 mg/g (body weight) d-glucose. Blood samples were drawn at different time points (0, 15, 30, and 60 min) from the tail vein. Insulin levels were determined using a rat insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicago, IL) with mouse insulin as a standard. Plasma glucose concentrations were determined as described above. Six HKII+/+, 5 HKII+/− male and 5 HKII+/+, 6 HKII± female Ukko1F4 mice were fed from the age of 4 weeks onwards a Western type diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI), where 42% of the calories were from fat. Four HKII+/+, 4 HKII+/− male and 5 HKII+/+, 4 HKII+/− female littermates were fed a regular low-fat diet (4% fat). At 0, 4, and 8 weeks of feeding the mice were weighed and blood samples were drawn from the saphenous vein (25Hem A. Smith A.J. Solberg P. Lab. Anim. 1998; 32: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) after a 4–6 h fast (H2O ad libitum). Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured as described above. After 14 weeks, insulin tolerance test was performed as described above, except that a 4-h fast was used. Blood was drawn from the saphenous vein and blood glucose concentrations were determined by Precision Q.I.DTM blood glucose sensor with Precision Plus electrodes (MediSense, Abbott Laboratories Ltd., Birmingham, UK). Fasting plasma from the first time point was also assayed for the triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations by kits purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. After the last sample was collected the mice were intraperitoneally injected with approximately 0.5 mg/g (body weight) d-glucose and allowed to recuperate. After 16 weeks, a glucose tolerance test was performed as described above, except that a 4-h fast was used and blood was collected from the saphenous vein. Calculations were performed with the SPSS for Windows programs (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses of data were performed with Student's t test for independent samples, Chi-square, or ANOVA, when appropriate. Glucose and insulin values in the initial glucose tolerance test were analyzed by the linear regression method and adjusted for the difference in fasting weight between the groups prior to comparison with Student's t test. Insulin levels were logarithmically transformed for statistical analyses. The mouse hexokinase II gene was inactivated using a replacement type targeting vector containing 9.8 kb of isogenic DNA in which the neo gene was inserted into exon 4 of the mouse hexokinase II gene (Fig.1 A). The targeting construct was electroporated into E14 embryonic stem cells (genetic background 129/Ola). 138 stable neomycin-resistant clones were first analyzed by PCR with primers HK2KO-F1 and Neo-R1 (Fig. 1 A). To verify the correct targeting of the hexokinase II gene, the PCR-positive clones were further analyzed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA using probes a or b, and c (Fig. 1 A). Nine clones displayed the expected DNA restriction fragments without any evidence for additional integrations of the targeting construct. A Southern blot ofBamHI-digested embryonic stem cell DNA probed with probe a is presented in Fig. 1 B. Cells from three correctly targeted clones (ES4, ES9, and ES10) were aggregated with BALB/c × DBA/2 morulae. Aggregated chimeric morulae were placed into the oviducts of pseudopregnant BALB/c × DBA/2 females resulting in a total of 11 mice with chimeric coat color pattern. Upon mating to BALB/c × DBA/2 mice, germline transmission was achieved with three chimeric (20%, ≤100%) male mice derived from two different mutant ES clones (ES9 and ES10). The near 100% chimera derived from ES10 was somewhat retarded, achieving fertility as late as at 20 weeks of age. This line (Ukko3) was not studied further. Both Ukko1 and 2 lines, derived from mutant ES9 and ES10 clones, respectively, were used for observations on viability, fertility, and growth. For further characterization of biochemical and metabolic consequences of the hexokinase II-deficiency, only the Ukko1 line, originating from clone ES9, was used. Both male and female HKII+/− mice were fertile and produced viable offspring with BALB/c × DBA/2 at approximately 1:1 ratio of females to males. However, the matings of HKII+/− males with HKII+/− females produced no HKII−/−offspring. Of the 64 born mice, 21 were HKII+/+ (32.8%) and 43 were HKII+/−(67.2%), but no HKII−/−mice were found. Hence the HKII−/− genotype was assumed to be embryonic lethal. This was confirmed by the nonsignificant difference (p = 0.934) between the observed HKII+/+:HKII+/− ratio and the expected 1:2 ratio in the Chi-square test. To compare the growth of HKII+/+ and HKII+/−mice, they were first weighed at weaning (3 weeks of age) and at 1–2 week intervals for up to 6 months. Among the progeny of the first backgross (BALB/c × DBA/2), male, but not female, HKII+/− mice (n = 8 or 15 per time point) weighed less than HKII+/+ littermates (n = 7 or 15) (p = 0.12 to p < 0.01). Further backgrosses to BALB/c × DBA/2 were made to dilute the embryonic stem cell-derived genetic background (129/Ola). Among the progeny of the third backgross, where approximately 90% of the 129/Ola genome is removed, no weight difference was observed between HKII+/+ and HKII+/− mice of either sex between weaning and 27 weeks of age. In addition, growth in uterowas not affected by heterozygous hexokinase II deficiency, since the body weight of both female and male newborn offspring of F1backgross parents were similar: 1.35 ± 0.03 g (n = 24) for HKII+/+ femalesversus 1.32 ± 0.03 g (n = 12) for HKII+/− females (p = 0.49), and 1.36 ± 0.05 g (n = 16) for HKII+/+ malesversus 1.31 ± 0.04 g (n = 18) for HKII+/− males (p = 0.42). As an initial step to investigate the stage of prenatal death, morulae were flushed 2.5 days post-coitum from the oviducts of pregnant HKII+/− females (mated with HKII+/−males), and grown in culture medium overnight. Resulting 33 viable blastocysts were genotyped as HKII+/+ (21.2%), HKII+/− (51.5%), and HKII−/− (27.3%) (E3.5 in Table I). A typical PCR result is shown in Fig. 1 C. Viable blastocysts showed a Mendelian distribution of wild type and targeted genotypes by the Chi-square test (p = 0.873).Table IDistribution of hexokinase II genotypes of Ukkol mice at different stages of developmentAge of embryos or miceHKII+/+HKII+/−HKII−/−E3.57 (21.2%)17 (51.5%)9 (27.3%)E7.59 (28.1%)16 (50.0%)7 (21.9%)aThree out of the 7 E7.5 HKII−/− embryos were retarded in growth.E8.56 (31.6%)8 (42.1%)5 (26.3%)bAll of the E8.5 HKII−/− embryos were severely retarded in growth.D21cBy the Chi-square test, the ratio HKII+/+: HKII+/− does not differ from the expected 1:2 when HKII−/− are assumed absent.21 (32.8%)43 (67.2%)0 (0%)HKII+/− mice were mated and resulting embryos (E) orpost partum mice (D) were genotyped at indicated time points (days) with allele discriminating PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are presented as a number of embryos followed by percentage in parentheses.a Three out of the 7 E7.5 HKII−/− embryos were retarded in growth.b All of the E8.5 HKII−/− embryos were severely retarded in growth.c By the Chi-square test, the ratio HKII+/+: HKII+/− does not differ from the expected 1:2 when HKII−/− are assumed absent.

Since previous studies on Glu-6-P isomerase-deficient mice have suggested that functional glycolysis is vital for mouse gastrulation (17West J.D. Flockhart J.H. Peters J. Ball S.T. Genet. Res. (Camb.). 1990; 56: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Merkle S. Pretsch W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1992; 101: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), this stage was investigated next. Embryos were dissected 7.5 and 8.5 days post-coitum from the uteri of pregnant HKII+/− females mated with HKII+/− males and genotyped. Among the 32 E7.5 embryos, 28.1% were HKII+/+, 50.0% were HKII+/−, and 21.9% were HKII−/−(Table I). However, 3 out of 7 HKII−/− embryos at this stage were visibly retarded in size. Among the 19 E8.5 embryos, all 5 HKII−/− embryos were severely retarded in growth. Three of them are shown in Fig. 2 along with an HKII+/− E8.5 embryo that had developed normally. Hexokinase II mRNA levels of 5 HKII+/+ and 4 HKII+/−male Ukko1F2 mice were assayed by Northern analysis in insulin-responsive skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue, previously demonstrated to be the main hexokinase II expressing mammalian tissues. Expression levels were determined from scanned autoradiographs of the blots. The steady state level of hexokinase II mRNA expression in tissues of HKII+/− mice was clearly lower (adipose, 41.1%, heart, 49.6%, and muscle 37.9% of the wild type hexokinase II expression) than in the HKII+/+littermates (Fig. 3). Next, hexokinase II enzyme activity was determined in the soluble fraction of the skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue of 5 HKII+/+ and 4 HKII+/− male Ukko1F2mice. The total and heat stable hexokinase activity were measured by the NADPH-coupled assay. As described previously (24Grossbard L. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3546-3560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hexokinase I is mainly responsible for the heat stable activity while hexokinase II is mostly inactivated by heat (1 h in 45 °C). Thus, the heat stable activity represents hexokinase I activity in tissues whereas total minus heat stable hexokinase activity represents hexokinase II activity. This was recently verified for the soluble fraction of the heart tissue by Wilson (23Wilson J.E. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), although the heat stability of hexokinase I was shown to vary substantially depending on the tissue and subcellular fraction used. Enzyme activities of hexokinase I and II of HKII+/− mice were compared with activities of HKII+/+ littermates, and all tissues studied showed significantly reduced hexokinase II activity (adipose, 53.3%, heart, 44.0%, and muscle 49.5% of the wild type hexokinase II activity) but unaltered hexokinase I activity (adipose, 118.6%, heart, 79.2%, and muscle 111.7% of the wild type hexokinase I activity) (Fig.4). To determine whether the approximate 50% loss of hexokinase II activity in insulin-sensitive tissues results in insulin resistance or diabetes, mice were subjected to insulin and glucose tolerance tests. In the insulin tolerance test, 0.75 milliunits/g of insulin was given intraperitoneally to 16-week-old weight-matched fasted female Ukko1F2 littermates (5 HKII+/+ and 5 HKII+/−). The glucose lowering effect of insulin was determined at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after insulin injection. Glucose values did not differ significantly between the HKII+/+ and HKII+/− mice (Fig.5 A). The glucose tolerance test was performed with fasted Ukko1F2 male mice (10 HKII+/+ and 10 HKII+/−). Intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg/g of glucose was administered and the levels of glucose and insulin were determined at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min after glucose injection. After correction for differences in fasting weight (p < 0.05), the groups had similar glucose and insulin values, although at 60 min HKII+/− mice had significantly lower glucose and insulin (p < 0.05) levels compared with those of HKII+/+ mice (Fig. 5 B). To verify the lack of association between reduced hexokinase II activity and abnormalities in insulin action or glucose tolerance, the mice were challenged with high-fat diet to induce insulin resistance. After 14 weeks of feeding a high-fat diet, HKII+/+ and HKII+/− mice had over 2-fold higher total plasma cholesterol concentrations (4.37 ± 0.35 and 4.11 ± 0.24 mm, respectively) than those fed a low-fat diet (1.88 ± 0.13 and 2.03 ± 0.22 mm, respectively) (p = not significant between the genotypes). Plasma triglycerides did not change significantly. Feeding a high-fat diet increased body weight (TableII), although the difference in body weight between the diets was not statistically significant. In addition, the feeding with high-fat diet raised plasma insulin concentrations of HKII+/+ mice after 16 weeks (p < 0.05) and of HKII+/− mice after 4, 8, and 16 weeks (p < 0.01 each) indicating the induction of insulin resistance in both groups (Table II). However, no statistically significant differences in insulin levels were observed between HKII+/+ and HKII+/− mice, either on low-fat or high-fat diet. Insulin tolerance test showed a tendency toward insulin resistance in mice fed with high-fat diet without significant differences between HKII+/+ and HKII+/− mice (Fig.6 A). Similarly, the glucose tolerance test (Fig. 6 B) did not reveal differences in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations between HKII+/+and HKII+/− mice. Both HKII+/+ and HKII+/− mice fed a high-fat diet had increased insulin levels at 0, 15, and 30 min after glucose injection compared with corresponding insulin levels of HKII+/+ and HKII+/− mice fed a low-fat diet. Glucose concentration at 60 min was higher on high-fat"
https://openalex.org/W2080923116,"We have isolated the 5′ region of the ecto-5′-nucleotidase (low K m 5′-NT) gene and established that a 969-base pair (bp) fragment confers cell-specific expression of a CAT reporter gene that correlates with the expression of endogenous ecto-5′-NT mRNA and enzymatic activity. A 768-bp upstream negative regulatory region has been identified that conferred lymphocyte-specific negative regulation in a heterologous system with a 244-bp deoxycytidine kinase core promoter. DNase I footprinting identified several protected areas including Sp1, Sp1/AP-2, and cAMP response element (CRE) binding sites within the 201-bp core promoter region and Sp1, NRE-2a, TCF-1/LEF-1, and Sp1/NF-AT binding sites in the upstream regulatory region. Whereas the CRE site was essential in mediating the negative activity of the upstream regulatory region in Jurkat but not in HeLa cells, mutation of the Sp1/AP-2 site decreased promoter activity in both cell lines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of proteins binding to the CRE site identified both ATF-1 and ATF-2 in Jurkat cells. Finally, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased the activity of both the core and the 969-bp promoter fragments, and this increase was abrogated by mutations at the CRE site. In summary, we have identified a tissue-specific regulatory region 5′ of the ecto-5′-NT core promoter that requires the presence of a functional CRE site within the basal promoter for its suppressive activity.

The enzyme dephosphorylates purine and pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates to the corresponding nucleosides and generates adenosine from extracellular AMP. Adenosine may then interact with a family of cognate receptors to produce a wide range of physiological effects that include the regulation of cardiovascular and cerebral blood flow (1Belardinelli L. Linden J. Berne R.M. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1989; 32: 73-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), cytoprotection in myocardial and cerebrovascular ischemia (2Ely S.W. Berne R.M. Circulation. 1992; 85: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and inhibition of many aspects of immune function (3Cronstein B.N. Levin R.I. Belanoff J. Weissmann G. Hirschhorn R. J.

Adenosine, which may accumulate to high concentrations in solid tumors, has also been postulated to be an important factor in stimulating angiogenesis (7Meininger C.J. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H198-H206PubMed Google Scholar), cancer growth through the increased expression of A1adenosine receptors (8Khoo H.E. Ho C.L. Chhatwal V.J. Chan S.T. Ngoi S.S. Moochhala S.M.

Therefore, investigating the regulation of adenosine-metabolizing enzymes may have important impact on the understanding of tumor biology. The activity of ecto-5′-nucleotidase, although variable, is frequently decreased as a result of neoplastic transformation of cells of hematopoietic origin (10Gutensohn W. Thiel E. Cancer. 1990; 66: 1755-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, elevated activity of ecto-5′-NT has been found in breast carcinoma (11Canbolat O. Durak I. Cetin R. Kavutcu M.

Human renal carcinoma cell lines induced to differentiate by butyric acid have demonstrated both an increase (Cur cell line) and a decrease (Caki cell line) in ecto-5′-NT activity (17Prager M.D. Kanar M.C. Cancer Lett. 1984; 24: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), demonstrating a complex, and perhaps context-dependent, pattern of ecto-5′-NT expression in differentiation and malignant transformation. The expression of ecto-5′-NT in thymocytes, lymphocytes, granulocytes, and undifferentiated myeloid cells is very low. However, differentiation of myeloid precursors along the monocytic lineage into macrophages results in a sharp increase in activity (18Thompson L.F. Saxon A. O'Connor R.D. Fox R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Thompson L.F. Ruedi J.M. O'Connor R.D. Bastia J.F. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2496-2500PubMed Google Scholar, 20Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. Barankiewicz J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4947-4952PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activity is lower than normal or undetectable in lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and infectious mononucleosis (21Quagliata F. Faig D. Conklyn M. Silber R. Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 3197-3202PubMed Google Scholar) and in CD8+ lymphocytes from AIDS patients (22Salazar-Gonzales J.F. Moody D.J. Giorgi J.V. Martinez-Maza O. Mitsuyasu R.T. Fahey J.L. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1778-1787PubMed Google Scholar). Given the strong immunosuppressive activity of adenosine, it seems likely that the variability in expression of this enzymatic activity among lymphoid cell populations has functional significance. In order to characterize the regulatory elements that contribute to the transcriptional regulation and tissue-specific expression of ecto-5′-NT, we have characterized the core promoter and upstream regulatory regions of the human gene. Fetal calf serum was obtained from HiClone and Sigma. TRI Reagent, a high efficiency hybridization system, and Northern/Southern transfer solution were obtained from Molecular Research Center Inc. (Cincinnati, OH). Restriction enzymes, Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, Taq polymerase, and polynucleotide kinase were from Promega (Madison, WI). Reverse transcriptase was from Life Technologies, Inc.d-threo[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol (56 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The T-lymphoblast cell line K-T1 (23Smith S.D. Morgan R. Link M.P. McFall P. Hecht F. Blood. 1986; 67: 650-659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. D. Sorscher (University of North Carolina). The K562 erythroleukemia cell line (ATCC CCL-243), Jurkat T-cell line (T-ALL origin), U937 cell line, PC-12 pheochromocytoma, HeLa S3 cervical carcinoma, and WI-38 fibroblasts were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Jurkat, K-T1, K562, and U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. WI-38, PC-12, and HeLa S3 cell lines were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin, and streptomycin. Total cellular RNA (20 μg) purified by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar) was electrophoresed in 1% agarose with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 1 m formaldehyde buffer. The RNA was transferred to Nytran nylon membranes overnight, fixed in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 30 min, and probed with a randomly primed 1660-bpAvaI/HindIII cDNA fragment extending from bp 8 to 1668 of the ecto-5′-NT coding region (25Misumi Y. Ogata S. Hirose S. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2178-2183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed in high efficiency hybridization solution with 50% formamide, with a nylon membrane sandwiched between two Whatman 3MM papers, in a rotating incubator at 42 °C for 24 h. Blots were washed twice in 1× SSC, 0.2% SDS at room temperature and once at 60 °C and exposed overnight at −80 °C. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) vector pCAT-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) was used in reporter gene assays to examine ecto-5′-NT promoter activity. The corresponding promoter fragments were generated by restriction digests or by PCR as described previously (26Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 370: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PCR was performed usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) followed by five cycles with Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR products were cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. The heterologous ecto-5′-NT/deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) promoter construct was produced by replacing aPstI/NdeI fragment encompassing the 5′-NT proximal promoter fragment and part of the CAT gene from pCAT-Basic with the corresponding dCK-244 PstI/NdeI fragment containing the 244-bp dCK promoter (27Chen E.H. Johnson E.E. Vetter S.M. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA used for transfections was purified using Quiagen Maxi columns, and isopropyl alcohol-precipitated plasmid DNA preparations were further deproteinated by the sequential treatment with equal volumes of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1) and twice with chloroform. Final plasmid DNA preparations were precipitated in the presence of 0.1m sodium acetate with 70% ethanol, washed with 75% ethanol, and suspended in H2O at 2 mg/ml. The quality of DNA was tested on agarose gel electrophoresis with and without treatment by HindIII and XbaI. Cells were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser. Approximately 6.0 × 106 Jurkat, K-T1, K562, or U937 cells; 3.0 × 106 HeLa cells; and 1.0 × 106 fibroblasts were transfected at room temperature in RPMI 1640 medium with equimolar amounts of the promoter constructs corresponding to 20 μg of control pCAT-Basic plasmid. Herring sperm DNA was added to a total quantity of 50 μg of DNA/electroporation. Electroporation efficiency was determined by transfecting separate aliquots of cells with 20 μg of β-galactosidase plasmids driven by β-actin promoter and 30 μg of herring sperm DNA. When the effect of PMA was tested on ecto-5′-NT promoter activity, co-transfection of β-galactosidase and CAT constructs was performed to account for variable cell growth rates in the presence of PMA. Electroporations were performed at 300 V and 960 microfarads (330 V and 960 microfarads for HeLa cells), and cells were subsequently suspended in 12 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% horse serum. After 44–48 h, cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and freeze-thawed three times with 80 μl of 0.25 mTris, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml pepstatin and leupeptin. CAT activity assays were performed on supernatants following treatment of extracts at 62 °C for 10 min. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was measured at 37 °C in a reaction medium containing 1 mm dibutyryl CoA (25 μg/assay), 10 μmd-threo[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol (56 mCi/mmol, 0.25 μCi/assay) in 0.25 m Tris, pH 8.0, buffer. The incubation was initiated by the addition of 2–50 μl of cell extract in a total volume of 125 μl and terminated after 1–6 h with the addition of 300 μl of xylenes. Following three extractions, reaction products in the organic phase were counted in a scintillation counter. Reaction velocity was expressed as cpm converted/h/mg of protein. Reaction time and extract amount were adjusted so that no more than 30% of substrate was utilized. The final results are expressed as the -fold increase or decrease over values obtained with the pCAT Basic vector alone. To normalize for transfection efficiency, the CAT activity was divided by the β-galactosidase activity of simultaneous transfections. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 564 nm in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mg/ml chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5–25 μl of cell extract and analyzed for 1 min. The linear portion of the curve was used to compute 0 order reaction rate and expressed as μmol of substrate used/min/mg of protein. The β-galactosidase activity varied by less than 20% in duplicate cell samples. Protein concentration was assayed by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211925) Google Scholar). Extracts were made from logarithmically growing Jurkat T cells according to the method of Dignam et al. (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar) with modifications as described by Blakeet al. (30Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 nm ocadaic acid), and the nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 s. Nuclear factors were extracted in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.75 mm spermidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 m NaCl, 100 nm ocadaic acid), followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was dialyzed in buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12.5 mm MgCl2), aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C (31Zimmermann A. Gu J.J. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Two DNA probes encompassing the 378-bp fragment (from −48 to −426 from the ATG site, cluster I and II, Fig.4) and 406-bp fragment (from −425 to −832, cluster III) were generated by PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase. Resulting fragments were incubated with the Taq polymerase, subcloned into the pCR 2.1 vector, and digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes to create a 5′-overhang on the noncoding strand at the 3′-end. The 3′- ends of the coding strands were filled in with radiolabeled dCTP using DNA polymerase large Klenow fragment. The resulting probes were digested at the opposite end to ensure one-strand labeling, gel-purified on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and eluted by the “crush and soak” method (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was performed according to Blake et al.(30). Ten ng of32P-labeled DNA were incubated with 120 and 240 μg of Jurkat and HeLa cell nuclear extracts in the presence of 15 μg of poly(dI-dC), 6.1% glycerol, 0.07 mm EDTA, 0.07 mm EGTA, 7.2 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 39 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.7 mm DTT. The binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min, after which CaCl2 (2 mmfinal concentration) was added, and the probe was digested with DNase I (Worthington) at room temperature for 3 min. Digestions were terminated by the addition of 2 volumes of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, and 100 μg/ml glycogen. After an incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in formamide loading dye, and analyzed on an 8m urea, 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Wild-type and mutant double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by annealing complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides yielding 5′-overhangs; 100 ng was labeled by fill-in using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Labeled probes were purified on 1 ml of Sephadex-G50 (Sigma) columns. The flow-through was precipitated with 110 volume of 3m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, washed with 75% ethanol, and resuspended at 20,000 cpm/μl. For competition experiments, unlabeled wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides were prepared by using unlabeled deoxynucleotides for fill-in and precipitated as described above. One μl of probe (approximately 0.1 ng of DNA) was incubated with 8 μg of nuclear extract in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). Reactions were preincubated on ice for 10 min in the presence of competitor or for 30–60 min in the presence of antibodies. Probe was added to the mixture, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on native 4% polyacrylamide (30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide), 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA minigels at 100 V, dried, and autoradiographed. EMSA supershift experiments were performed with 1 μg of each of the following antibodies: ATF-1 antibody (sc-241X), ATF-2 (sc-242X), CREB-1 (sc-186X), CREB-2 (sc-200), CREM-1 (sc-440X), c-Jun (sc-1694X), and c-Fos (sc-413) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Ecto-5′-NT activity in cell extracts was measured in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, buffer containing 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmerythro-9(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA; inhibitor of adenosine deaminase), and 20 μm [8-14C]AMP. Reaction products were separated on plastic-supported cellulose (Kodachrome; Eastman Kodak Co.) in ammonia/butanol/methanol/H20 (1:20:20:60), and corresponding spots were visualized under UV light, excised, and counted in a scintillation counter. To determine the level of ecto-5′-NT mRNA in human cell lines, Northern blot analysis was performed (Fig.1). A high level of expression of a single 4.1-kilobase mRNA was observed in cultured human fibroblasts (WI38), whereas HeLa cells expressed an intermediate level, and PC-12, U937, Jurkat, K562, and K-T1 cells had low or undetectable levels. The corresponding ecto-5′-NT enzyme activities in cell homogenates were 319.3 ± 20.6, 29.9 ± 6.1, 6.3 ± 2.4, 2.40 ± 0.62, 0.37 ± 0.17, 0.12 ± 0.14, and 0.40 ± 0.22 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively (±S.D., 3–5 independent measurements). There was a 863-fold difference in 5′-nucleotidase activity between fibroblasts and the Jurkat T-cell line, and relative enzyme activities in different cell lines corresponded with differences in the levels of mRNA expression. In order to determine the relative levels of ecto-5′-NT promoter activity, we transiently transfected several cell lines with the pCAT-Basic reporter construct containing 969, 371, or 201 bp of the promoter. As shown in Fig. 2, the full-length 969-bp promoter fragment yielded CAT activity that was consistently lower than the marginal activity of the pCAT-Basic vector in Jurkat, K-T1, and K562 cell lines, whereas relative CAT activity in U937, HeLa, and WI-38 cells was increased by 10–25-fold. Two further deletions of 5′-sequences, producing 371- and 201-bp promoter fragments, caused moderate increases in promoter activity in Jurkat T-cells and K562 cells, no significant changes in U937 and HeLa cells, and a significant decrease in promoter activity in WI38 fibroblasts (Fig. 2). These data suggest that the distal 768-bp fragment contains tissue-specific regulatory elements that function to repress the core promoter activity in lymphoid (Jurkat and K-T1) and erythroid (K562) cell lines while enhancing the activity in WI-38 fibroblast. In general, the promoter activity in transient transfection assays correlated well with the levels of mRNA and ecto-5′-NT enzymatic activity in a majority of cell lines. To identify regulatory elements that interact with cognate transcription factors, we performed in vitro DNase I footprinting analysis using Jurkat T-cell and HeLa nuclear extracts. Four clusters of putative transcription factor binding sites were identified within the proximal 770 bp of the ecto-5′-NT promoter (Fig. 3). We have generated two DNA probes that encompass cluster I/II and cluster III and used them in DNase I footprinting analysis with Jurkat T-cell and HeLa nuclear extracts. Results presented in Fig.4 demonstrate that within the core promoter region (cluster I/II) both Jurkat (A) and HeLa (B) nuclear extracts produce similar protected areas that coincide with Sp1, Sp1/AP-2, and CRE transcription factor binding sites. However, within cluster III, a strong protected area coincident with a TCF-1/LEF-1 consensus binding site (32Waterman M.L. Jones K.A. New Biol. 1990; 2: 621-636PubMed Google Scholar, 33van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Dooijes D. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 34Giese K. Amsterdam A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) is present with extract from Jurkat cells but is absent with HeLa nuclear extracts. Further upstream, an extensive 22-bp protected area that coincides with adjacent NF-AT and Sp1 binding sites in Jurkat corresponds to a more restricted 16-bp protected area representing a single Sp1 site in HeLa extracts. An additional protected area further upstream coincides with a NRE-2a/2b transcription factor binding site (35Oh C.K. Neurath M. Cho J.J. Semere T. Metcalfe D.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and is also more pronounced with the Jurkat T-cell nuclear extract. A protected area that does not correspond to a known consensus transcription factor binding site is present at bp −579 to −599 only with Jurkat T-cell nuclear extract. To determine whether the silencing/enhancing activity of the upstream regulatory region is specific for the ecto-5′-NT promoter or could be reproduced in a heterologous system, we generated a chimeric promoter construct containing the distal 768 bp of the regulatory region ligated to the 244-bp core promoter of the human dCK gene (27Chen E.H. Johnson E.E. Vetter S.M. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the 5′-NT upstream promoter fragment decreased CAT expression mediated by the dCK promoter alone in Jurkat and K-T1 cells by 78%, whereas it had a lesser suppressive effect on dCK promoter-mediated CAT expression in HeLa cells (decrease by 40%) and no effect in WI38 fibroblasts. The lack of enhancer activity in fibroblasts, as seen with the native ecto-5′-NT core promoter (Fig. 2), suggests that either the dCK core promoter activity was already maximal or that the function of the enhancer is promoter-specific. To further investigate the importance of the Sp1, AP-2, and CRE transcription factor binding sites within the core promoter region, we mutated these sites as illustrated in TableI and tested the respective mutants individually in transient transfection assays. Data presented in Fig.6 show that none of the mutations in the context of the 201-bp core promoter region had any significant effect in either Jurkat or HeLa cells. However, within the context of the 969-bp promoter fragment, mutation of the CRE site at bp 184–185 produced a dramatic increase of the promoter activity to the level found with the wild-type 201-bp core promoter region alone in Jurkat cells, while resulting in a 50% decrease in HeLa cells (Fig. 6). Mutations at the Sp1 and especially at the Sp1/AP-2 site brought about significant decreases in promoter activity in both Jurkat and HeLa cells. In Jurkat T-cells, the wild-type 969-bp promoter activity was strongly suppressed to a level of 40 ± 10% of pCAT-Basic vector alone (Fig. 2) and decreased further to 15 ± 10% (± S.D. from four experiments) of pCAT-Basic with mutation at the Sp1/AP-2 site. These data suggest that transcription factors binding to the CRE and Sp1/AP-2 sites may influence the activity of the upstream regulatory region.Table ISequences of mutated CRE, Sp1, and Sp1/AP-2 sites and of oligonucleotides used in EMSASiteWild typeMutatedaMutated nucleotides are underlined.For EMSA (wild type)CRETGACGTCGTGAACTCGGGTCGGATCGGGTGACGTCGCGAACTTGCGCCTGGSp1/AP-2CCCGCCCCGGCCCCAACCTTGCSp1CCCGCCCCCAACCAACTCF/LEFTCTTTGAATATTCCAAa Mutated nucleotides are underlined. Open table in a new tab We next employed EMSAs with a probe encompassing the CRE site to identify cognate transcription factors (Table I). We used a panel of antibodies recognizing members of the CREB and ATF family of proteins and c-Fos and c-Jun transcription factors known to dimerize with members of the CREB family. Results shown in Fig.7 demonstrate that antibodies recognizing CREB-1, CREB-2, CREM-1, c-Fos, and c-Jun were not able to supershift the DNA-protein complexes, whereas antibodies against ATF-1 and ATF-2 caused distinctly decreased intensities of the corresponding lower band coincident with the appearance of a more pronounced (ATF-1) or a new (ATF-2) upper band (Fig. 7, A and D). The intensity of the supershifted band with ATF-2-specific antibody was similar with nuclear extracts prepared from control and PMA-treated cells; however, there was a somewhat less pronounced decrease in ATF-2-specific lower complex intensity with PMA-treated nuclear extracts (Fig. 7 D). Similar results were obtained with polyclonal antibody against ATF-2 (data not shown). Mutated CRE probe did not produce specific band shifts (Fig. 7 C). These results suggest that ATF-1 and ATF-2 or closely related proteins specifically interact with the CRE site in the ecto-5′-NT core promoter in Jurkat T-cells. In contrast, in HeLa nuclear extract, despite the presence of strong gel shifts, none of the specific antibodies described above resulted in a supershifted complexes (data not shown). We have previously shown that induction of promyelocytic HL60 cells to differentiate with PMA coincided with a dramatic increase in ecto-5′-NT mRNA level (20Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. Barankiewicz J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4947-4952PubMed Google Scholar). Since the CRE site has been identified as a PMA-responsive element through the modulation of the ATF-2 transcription factor (36Costa M. Medcalf R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 37Jiang K. Spyrou G. Rokaeus A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that in Jurkat T-cells PMA might increase ecto-5′-NT promoter activity through activation of a transcription factor binding to this site. Results presented in Fig. 8 show that activity of the 201-bp promoter fragment was induced up to 3-fold by a 20-h treatment with 20 nm PMA, whereas the same promoter fragment with a mutated CRE site was not affected. Furthermore, the 969-bp promoter fragment was activated approximately 17-fold by PMA. Mutation of the CRE site in the 969-bp fragment increased the promoter activity"
https://openalex.org/W1992318151,"Targeted recruitment of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activities by sequence-specific transcription factors, including the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), has been proposed to lead to destabilization of nucleosomal cores by acetylation of core histones. However, biochemical evidence indicates that destabilization and depletion of linker H1 histones must also occur at the promoter regions of actively transcribing genes. Mechanisms by which nuclear receptors and other transcription factors affect the removal of histone H1 from transcriptionally silent chromatin have not been previously described. In this report, we show that RARs interact in a ligand-dependent manner with HMG-I, which is known to displace histone H1 from chromatin. We further show that HMG-I and a novel related protein, HMG-R, also interact with other transcription factors. Using sense and antisense constructs of HMG-I/R in transient transfection assays with a retinoid responsive reporter, we also demonstrate that HMG-I/R is important for retinoid dependent transcriptional activity of RAR. These findings suggest a step wise mechanism by which RARs and other transcription factors can cause a targeted unfolding of compact chromatin as a first step in transcriptional activation, which would then be followed by recruitment of HAT activity and subsequent events.

Retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptors (RAR and RXR α, β, and γ) are sequence-specific, ligand-dependent transcription factors belonging to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid/vitamin D3 nuclear receptors (1Chambon P.

Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Recently, CBP/p300, Sug1/Trip1, TIF1, SRC-1/N-CoA1, TIF2/GRIP1, and ACTR have been identified as co-factors, which interact with RARs and other nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent manner (3Glass C.K. Rose D. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 4Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence supports models involving depletion of the nucleosomal core as well as H1 histones at the promoter regions of actively transcribing genes. CBP/p300, its associated protein p/CAF, SRC-1, and ACTR have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (5Bannister A. Kouzaides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 6Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.-I. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that recruitment of HAT activity by sequence-specific transcription factors leads to acetylation of core histones and a destabilization of the nucleosomal core, thereby facilitating transcriptional activation (8Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 9Wolffe A.P. Pruss D.

However, an earlier obligatory step in transcriptional activation involves an unfolding of the compact, 30-nm chromatin fiber, which results only from a displacement of the potent transcriptional repressor, histone H1, from chromatin (11Croston G.E. Kerrigan L.A. Lira L.M. Marshak D.R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Laybourn P.J. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 254: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Mechanisms by which nuclear receptors and other transcription factors affect this obligatory removal of histone H1 from transcriptionally silent chromatin have not been described previously. In this report, we provide evidence that RARs interact in a ligand-dependent manner with HMG-I, which is known to displace histone H1 from chromatin (13Zhao K. Kas E. Gonzalez E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3237-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Additionally, we identify an HMG-I-related protein, HMG-R, which also interacts with RARs in a ligand-dependent manner. We further show that HMG-I and HMG-R interact with RXRα, PPARγ, c-Jun, and CBP, thus indicating recruitment of HMG-I/R by various transcription factors as a common mechanism for enhancer-dependent transcriptional activation. Finally, using transient transfections, we demonstrate that HMG-I/R is required for retinoid-dependent transactivation of a reporter construct by RAR, thus showing the functional consequences of RAR-HMG-I/R interactions. In yeast two-hybrid screening, the bait (pAS2-RARγΔAB) consisted of the Gal4-DBD and the human RARγ coding sequence spanning C–F regions (amino acids 90–454). pAS2-RARγΔAB was constructed by PCR amplification of RARγΔAB from an RARγ expression vector using primer pairs 5′-AGGAATTCTGCTTCGTGTGCAATGACAAGT-3′ and 5′-AGGGATCCTCAGGCTGGGGACTTCAGGCC-3′ and subsequently cloning the amplified product into EcoRI-BamHI sites of pAS2-1 (CLONTECH). pAS2-RARγ was prepared by PCR amplification of RARγ using primer pairs 5′-ACCGCAGGGATCCTGGCCACCAATAAGGAGCGC-3′ and 5′-TAATGGATCCTGGTCAGGCTGGGGACTT-3′ and cloning the amplified product into BamHI site of pAS2-1. pGBT-RARγDEF was prepared by PCR amplification of RARγDEF using primer pairs 5′-TTCGAAGTGGAATTCTCCAAGGAAGCTGTG-3′ and 5′-TAATGGATCCTGGTCAGGCTGGGGACTT-3′ and cloning the amplified product into EcoRI-BamHI sites of pGBT9. pACT2-Sug1 was isolated during the screening procedure. pAS2-RARαΔAB and pAS2-RARβΔAB were constructed by PCR amplification of C–F regions of RARα (amino acids 88–462) and RARβ (amino acids 81–448). Primer pairs used for PCR amplification of RARαΔAB were 5′-AGGAATTCTGCTTTGTCTGTCAGGACAAGT-3′ and 5′-AGGGATCCTCACGGGGAGTGGGTGGCCGGG-3′. The amplified product was cloned into EcoRI-BamHI sites of pAS2-1. Primer pairs used for PCR amplification of RARβΔAB were 5′-AGCCCGGGGTGCTTCGTCTGCCAGGACAAATCAT-3′ and 5′-AGGGATCCTTATTGCAGGAGTGGTGACTGACTG-3′. The amplified product was cloned into SmaI-BamHI sites of pAS2-1. pGBT-RXRα was constructed by PCR amplification of RXRα from an expression vector using primer pairs 5′-AGGAATTCATGGACACCAAACATTTCCTGCCG-3′ and 5′-AGCTGCAGCTAAGTCATTTGGTGCGGCGCCTC-3′ and subsequently subcloning the amplified product into EcoRI-PstI sites of pGBT9 (CLONTECH). pAS2-Jun, pAS2-PPARγ, and pAS2-CBP were constructed by PCR amplification of wild type c-Jun, PPARγ1, and 1–840 amino acids of CBP and subsequently cloning them into appropriate sites of pAS2-1. Primer pairs used for PCR amplification of c-Jun were 5′-AGGAATTCATGACTGCAAAGATGGAAACGACC-3′ and 5′-AGGGATCCTCAAAATGTTTGCAACTGCTG-3′. The amplified product was cloned into EcoRI-BamHI sites of pAS2-1. Primer pairs used for PCR amplification of PPARγ1 were 5′-AGCATATGACCATGGTTGACACAGAGATC-3′ and 5′-AGGTCGACCTAGTACAAGTCCTTGTAGATCTC-3′. The amplified product was cloned into NdeI-SalI sites of pAS2-1. Primer pairs used for PCR amplification of CBP were 5′-AGAAGCTTATGGCCGAGAACTTGCTGGAC-3′ and 5′-AGGGATCCCTAGGGTGCCAGCATGTTCAGAGGGTT-3′. The amplified product was cloned into HindIII-BamHI sites of pAS2-1. A schematic representation of all the bait constructs is presented in Fig. 1. For transient transfections, the RA-responsive reporter, RARE3-tk-CAT, containing three copies of the canonical DR5 motif in pBLCAT8+, was kindly provided by Dr. S. Mader. The HMG-I sense, pHMG-I(S) and HMG-I antisense (pHMG-I(AS)) expression vectors were prepared by PCR amplification of HMG-I cDNA from pACT2-HMG-I using primer paires 5′-AGGGATCCACCATGAGTGAGTCGAGCTCGAAG-3′ and 5′-AGGAATTCTCACTGCTCCTCCTCCGAGGA-3′. The PCR-amplified product was cloned into T overhangs of pTarget expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and sense and antisense expression vectors were obtained by sequencing the cloned fragments to determine their directionality. Similarly, HMG-R sense, pHMG-R(S) and HMG-R antisense, pHMG-R(AS), expression vectors were prepared by PCR amplification of HMG-R cDNA from pACT2-HMG-R using primer pairs 5′-AGGGATCCACCATGAGTGAGTCGAGCTCGAAG-3′ and 5′-AGGAATTCAGTGGGATGTTAGCCTTGTCCAGG-3′ and subsequently cloning the PCR-amplified product into T overhangs of pTarget expression vector. The directionality of the expression vectors was determined by sequencing the cloned fragment. pACT2-HMG-I and pACT2-HMG-R were identified as RAR interacting proteins from HaCaT keratinocyte cDNA library. HMG amplification was performed on keratinocyte cDNA library and reverse transcribed keratinocyte and skin raft RNA using the primer pairs 5′-AGGGTACCATGAGTGAGTCGAGCTCGAAGTCC-3′ and 5′-AGAAGCTTTCACTGCTCCTCCTCCGAGGACTC-3′ encompassing HMG-I from the ATG to the stop codon. The amplified products were resolved on a NuSieve gel (4%), visualized by ethidium bromide staining, excised, cloned into TA cloning plasmid, and sequenced. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast stain Y190 (MATa, ura 3–52, his 3–200, ade 2–101, lys 2–801, trp 1–901, leu 2–3, 112, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, cyh 2, LYS2::GAL1UAS −HAS3 TATA −HIS3, URA3::GAL1 UAS −GAL1 TATA −lacZ) (CLONTECH Match-maker system II) was grown at 30 °C in either YPD medium or synthetic defined dropout yeast medium lacking the appropriate amino acids, i.e. tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (CLONTECH). All the media contained glucose (2%) as a source of carbon. Transformation of yeast was carried out by using the lithium acetate method (14Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). pAS2-RARγΔAB-transformed yeast strain Y190 was further transformed with a HaCaT keratinocyte cDNA library in pACT2 expressing Gal4-AD chimeras using lithium acetate (14Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2903) Google Scholar). HaCaT library was purchased (CLONTECH) and amplified according to the GeneTrapper protocol for semisolid amplification of plasmid cDNA libraries (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately, 600,000 double transformants were screened on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (−Trp, −Leu, −His) containing 25 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole in the presence of retinoid agonist, TTNPB (1 μm). Positive clones were tested for β-galactosidase activity using two different methods. For qualitative evaluation of RAR interactions, β-galactosidase filter lift assays were carried out. Yeast colonies that grew on selective media were streaked on fresh selective plates in the presence of the retinoid for 3 days at 30 °C. Cells were transferred onto Whatman No. 5 paper, submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10 s, placed on a filter paper presoaked in Z buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm MgSO4) supplemented with 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.07 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Filters were then incubated at 30 °C and checked for the appearance of blue colonies, thus indicating interacting proteins. For quantitative studies, yeast colonies, positive in lift assay, were grown in −Leu, −Trp medium (5 ml) overnight at 30 °C. Overnight cultures (2 ml) were inoculated in fresh YPD medium (8 ml) in the presence or absence of the retinoid, TTNPB (1 μm), grown for 5 h at 30 °C, and A 600 recorded. Cells (1 ml) were pelleted, suspended in Z buffer (100 μl) and lysed by freeze-thawing. Z buffer (700 μl) containing β-mercaptoethanol was added, followed by addition of 4 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (160 μl) and the mixture incubated for 5 min to 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mNa2CO3 (400 μl) andA 420 recorded. β-Galactosidase activity was calculated using the formula, 1000 ×A 420/time (minute) ×A 600. Interacting protein expression vector was isolated, cDNA sequenced, and compared with the BLAST algorithm. CBP or p300 antibodies (Santa Cruz) were added to HeLa cell nuclear extract and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A/G-Sepharose (1:1 mix, 25 μl) was added and the tubes rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated CBP or p300 were pelleted and washed thrice with 1 ml lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin). After the final wash, 25 μl of lysis buffer was added along with 1 μl of bovine serum albumin, calf thymus histones (Sigma) or recombinant, purified HMG-I (10 μg each), and 1 μl of [3H]acetyl-CoA, and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. Acetylation was quantitated using P-81 filters as described previously (5Bannister A. Kouzaides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Baculovirus produced RARα or RARγ were immunoadsorbed on protein A/G-Sepharose beads (1:1 mix, 10 μl) using RARα or -γ antibodies or normal rabbit IgG as nonspecific antibodies (Santa Cruz). 35S-Labeled Gal4-HMG-I was synthesized by transcription and translation in vitroand incubated with immobilized RARα or -γ. After washing with radioimmune precipitation buffer, the labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager. HeLa cells, grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (10%), were transfected using the GenePORTER transfection procedure (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Cells were plated 18 h before transfection at 40% confluence (40,000 cells/well) in a 24-well plate. The cells were transfected with the RA-responsive reporter, RARE3-tk-CAT (1 μg), and 0.1 μg of either pHMG-I(S) or pHMG-R(S) or varying concentrations of pHMG-R(AS) expression vector, along with 5 μl of GenePORTER reagent for each well in a total volume of 0.5 ml. For assays involving co-transfections of pHMG-R(S) and pHMG-R(AS) expression vectors, HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of RARE3-tk-CAT and 0.01 μg of each of the expression vector constructs. A renilla luciferase expression vector, pRL-SV40 (10 ng) (Promega), was used as an internal control in transfections to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency. The cells were transfected in quadruplicate for 5 h, and retinoids were added 18 h post-transfection. The CAT activity was quantified by counting the amount of 3H-acetylated forms of chloramphenicol using a liquid scintillation counter. The renilla luciferase activity was quantified using dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of retinoid action, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify and characterize proteins that interacted with human RARγ in a ligand dependent manner. RAR is a modular protein containing six functional regions, namely, A through F. A/B region contains a ligand-independent transactivation function, C region contains two zinc fingers and corresponds to the core of the DBD, and E region contains the ligand binding domain (LBD), heterodimerization domain, and ligand-dependent transactivation function. The sequence of RARγ encompassing the C–F regions (amino acids 90–454) was used as bait (Fig. 1) to isolate cDNAs encoding interacting proteins from a HaCaT keratinocyte cDNA library. Thus, the bait construct (pAS2-RARγΔAB) contained both the DBD and the LBD of RAR fused to the Gal4-DBD in an yeast expression vector pAS2-1. A schematic representation of all the bait constructs used herein is presented in Fig. 1. Stably transfected pAS2-RARγΔAB yeast cells were transformed with the second vector that expressed the Gal4-AD fused to HaCaT keratinocyte library cDNAs. In addition to known RAR interacting proteins, such as RXRs, Sug1, and RIP 140, we isolated complete cDNAs for HMG-I protein and a novel HMG-I-related protein (HMG-R). Neither pAS2-RARγΔAB nor pACT2-HMG-I/HMG-R was active when expressed alone (Fig.2 A). Interaction in yeast cells was observed only when pAS2-RARγΔAB was expressed with HMG-I/HMG-R cDNA fused to the Gal4-AD. HMG-I and HMG-R proteins interacted specifically with RARγΔAB in the presence but not in the absence of the RAR-specific agonist, TTNPB (15Nagpal S. Athanikar J. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 923-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating the ligand dependence of RAR/HMG interaction. TTNPB-induced RARγΔAB interaction with both HMG-I and HMG-R was dose-dependent (data not shown). Upon sequencing, HMG-R was found to be a variant of HMG-I and showed a deletion of a stretch of 67 nucleotides from the HMG-I sequence. This deletion resulted in a frameshift so that the two proteins are identical in their first 65 amino acids but differ thereafter. A comparison of the putative amino acid sequence of HMG-R with those of HMG-I and another related member HMG-Y (16Karlson J.R. Mork E. Holtlund J. Laland S.G. Lund T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 2 B. To prove that HMG-R species is present in other RNA samples apart from the HaCaT cDNA library from where it was isolated, RT-PCR was performed on total RNA prepared from cultured keratinocytes and skin rafts (three-dimensional cultures of fibroblasts and keratinocytes). In addition to a major amplified fragment of 320 base pairs (HMG-I), another amplified fragment of 250 base pairs (HMG-R) was observed in all the samples (Fig. 2 C). The identity of these bands was confirmed by sequencing the TA-cloned PCR fragments. HMG-R is a novel form, which appears to be produced from the HMG-I/Y gene by alternative splicing using noncanonical splice donor and acceptor sites. To demonstrate that the full-length RARγ also interacts with HMG-I/HMG-R in a ligand-dependent manner in vivo, stably transformed RARγ (pAS2-RARγ) yeast cells were further transformed with pACT2-HMG-I/HMG-R and assayed for β-galactosidase activity in the absence or presence of TTNPB. Full-length RARγ, by virtue of its intrinsic activation functions (2Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), elicited a low level of β-galactosidase activity in the presence of TTNPB, which was further induced approximately 25-fold in the presence of pACT2-HMG-I and pACT2-HMG-R (Fig.3 A). pACT2-HMG-I/R also showed ligand-dependent interaction with RARα and RARβ (Fig.3, B and C). RARγ full-length protein interacted more avidly with HMG-I/R than RARγΔAB (Fig. 3,B and C). To determine the regions of RAR involved in interaction with HMG in vivo, pGBT-RARγ-DEF, pAS2-RARγΔAB, and pAS2-RARγ transformed yeast cells were used. pACT2-HMG-R interacted poorly with RARγDEF and RARγΔAB but interacted strongly with RARγ (Fig. 3 D). These results demonstrate that the LBD, which is present in the E region of RAR, alone is not sufficient for interaction with HMG, but the ligand-independent A/B transactivation function, AF-1 (2Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), is also required for full interaction. Full-length RARγ interacted with both HMG-I and HMG-R in a retinoid dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 E). Similar dose responsiveness has been observed for the retinoid-dependent induction of a number of endogenous RA-responsive genes. HMG-I/Y are non-histone chromosomal proteins that bind to A/T-rich sequences in the minor groove of the DNA helix, through a DNA binding motif called the “A·T hook” (17Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol.

Three A·T hook motifs are present in the HMG-I sequence (amino acids 21–31, 53–63, and 78–88), whereas HMG-R contains the first two A·T hook motifs of HMG-I. Linker histone H1 is a generalized repressor, which plays a pivotal role in compaction of chromatin into transcriptionally silent fiber (13Zhao K. Kas E. Gonzalez E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3237-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19Davie J.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162A: 191-250PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation involves remodeling of the silent chromatin fiber through a reduction in the associated H1 complement (20Ericsson C. Grossbach U. Bjorkroth B. Daneholt B. Cell. 1990; 60: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Kamakaka R. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). HMG-I/Y proteins, by virtue of their ability to displace H1 from their binding sites in scaffold-associated regions, can derepress the H1-mediated inhibition of transcription (13Zhao K. Kas E. Gonzalez E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3237-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). HMG-I/Y proteins are associated with transcriptionally active H1-depleted chromatin (13Zhao K. Kas E. Gonzalez E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3237-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and are overexpressed in hyperproliferative cancer cells as compared with normal cells (22Johnson K.R.

In accordance with its role in active transcription, HMG-I has been shown to interact with a number of other transcription factors such as NF-κB, ATF-2, Elf-1, Oct-2, Oct-6/Tst-1, and PU.1 (26Du W.

Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3738-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition to RAR, HMG-I and HMG-R also interacted with RXRα (Fig.4 A), PPARγ (Fig.4 B), c-Jun (Fig. 4 C), and CBP (Fig.4 D). Unlike in the case of RARs, the interaction between PPARγ and HMG-I/R was PPARγ agonist-independent (Fig.4 B). These data taken together suggest that transcription factors in general may direct HMG-I to promoter regions of target genes. Since acetylation of HMG would destabilize its interaction with DNA, and RARs associate with HATs, we asked the question whether CBP/p300 could potentially acetylate HMG-I. Our data demonstrate that although HMG-I interacted with CBP, it was not acetylated by either CBP or p300 (Fig. 5 A), demonstrating its potential to bind to its DNA site in the context of the RAR-CBP/p300 complex.Figure 5HMG-I acetylation and in vitroassociation between RAR and HMG-I. A, HMG-I is not acetylated by CBP/p300. CBP or p300 antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate CBP (open bars) or p300 (solid bars) from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The immune complexes were tested for their ability to acetylate bovine serum albumin, free histones, or HMG-I. B, in vitro interaction of HMG-I with wild type RARs. RARα or RARγ proteins were immobilized on protein A/G-Sepharose using either specific or nonspecific antibodies as shown. The immune complexes were incubated with in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled Gal4-HMG-I in the presence or absence of ligand TTNPB (1 μm). The beads were washed and bound proteins eluted and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further characterize the RAR-HMG interaction observed in the yeast two-hybrid system, we studied their association in vitro. RAR antibodies were immobilized on protein A- and G-Sepharose beads and used for adsorbing baculovirus-produced RARs. The RAR-bound beads were then mixed with radiolabeled in vitro translated Gal4-HMG-I in the presence or absence of TTNPB (1 μm). RARα and RARγ antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated HMG-I in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). If HMG-I/R proteins are important in nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transcription, then their effects should be quantifiable in transient transfection experiments. Accordingly, we next examined the effect of HMG-I/R on the transcriptional activity of RAR. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with RARE3-tk-CAT, an RA-responsive reporter, with or without HMG-I or HMG-R expression vectors in the presence or absence of the retinoid agonist, TTNPB (1 μm). Transfection with either HMG-I or HMG-R sense expression vector resulted in approximately 2-fold induction in the retinoid-dependent expression of RARE3-tk-CAT (Fig.6 A). Since HMG-I is already highly expressed in transformed cells (22Johnson K.R. Disney J.E. Wyatt C.R. Reeves R. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Ram T.G.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1896-1901PubMed Google Scholar), the observed modest induction of retinoid-dependent expression of RARE3-tk-CAT by HMG-I/R co-transfection is an expected outcome. In order to abrogate the levels of endogenous HMG-I/R proteins, an antisense HMG-R expression vector, pHMG-R(AS), was constructed and transiently transfected into HeLa cells with the reporter, RARE3-tk-CAT, in the presence of TTNPB. As shown in Fig. 6 B, TTNPB (1 μm) induced the expression of RARE3-tk-CAT, and this activity was inhibited by co-transfection with pHMG-R(AS) in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, we tested whether co-transfection with pHMG-R(S), the HMG-R sense expression vector, rescues the pHMG-R(AS)-mediated inhibition of RARE3-tk-CAT expression. As shown in Fig. 6 C, TTNPB (1 μm) induced the expression of RARE3-tk-CAT through the endogenous repertoire of RARs present in HeLa cells, and this activity was inhibited by approximately 50% by co-transfection with 0.01 μg of pHMG-R(AS). Furthermore, co-transfection with pHMG-R(S) relieved the inhibitory activity of pHMG-R(AS) on RARE3-tk-CAT expression. These results demonstrate that HMG-I/R is involved in RAR-mediated transactivation in cells. RARs and other nuclear receptors recruit HAT activities to their site of action by interacting with CBP/p300, ACTR, and SRC-1 (3Glass C.K. Rose D. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 4Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

These enzymatic activities would acetylate histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (5Bannister A. Kouzaides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar) and thus partially release the constrained negative DNA supercoiling of the nucleosomal core. However, these activities should be preceded by removal of the linker histone (H1), which constrains the active 10-nm chromatin fiber containing nucleosomal cores into a compact and transcriptionally silent 30-nm fiber. Histone H1 is not acetylated in its DNA binding N- or C-terminal tails (19Davie J.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162A: 191-250PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that its affinity to DNA cannot be reduced by HAT activity and that removal of H1 has to be effected by an alternate mechanism. Our data indicate that RARs and other transcription factors are capable of recruiting the H1 displacing activities of HMG-I/HMG-R in a targeted and ligand-dependent manner (Fig.7). Since HMG-I protein has 19 putative acetylation sites (lysine residues), including two in the DNA binding A·T hook domain (Fig. 2 B), the acetylation of HMG-I by CBP/p300 could potentially decrease its ability to displace H1. However, in accordance with its proposed role as a H1 displacement factor, either CBP or p300 (Fig. 5 A) did not acetylate HMG-I. In order to destabilize compact higher order chromatin structures and to liberate DNA from the nucleosome at the site of active transcription and facilitate RNA polymerase II complex assembly, both linker and chromosomal histones need to be released by transcription factors. Our model predicts that nuclear receptors and other transcription factors may recruit HMG-I/HMG-R and HATs in a targeted step wise manner, thereby unraveling linker and core histone assembly and facilitating the formation of transcriptionally competent DNA in the promoter regions of target genes.

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes as in other cell types, the receptor is synthesized as a single polypeptide consisting of uncleaved α- and β-subunits, migrating as a 190-kDa glycoprotein. To examine the importance of N-linked glycosylation on insulin receptor processing, we have used glucose deprivation as a tool to alter protein glycosylation. Western blot analysis shows that glucose deprivation led to a time-dependent accumulation of an alternative proreceptor of 170 kDa in a subcellular fraction consistent with endoplasmic reticulum localization. Co-precipitation assays provide evidence that the alternative proreceptor bound GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum molecular chaperone. N-Glycosidase F treatment shows that the alternative proreceptor contained N-linked oligosaccharides. Yet, endoglycosidase H insensitivity indicates an aberrant oligosaccharide structure. Using pulse-chase methodology, we show that the synthetic rate was similar between the normal and alternative proreceptor. However, the normal proreceptor was processed into α- and β-subunits (t 12 = 1.3 ± 0.6 h), while the alternative proreceptor was degraded (t 12 = 5.1 ± 0.6 h). Upon refeeding cells that were initially deprived of glucose, the alternative proreceptor was processed to a higher molecular weight form and gained sensitivity to endoglycosidase H. This “intermediate” form of the proreceptor was also degraded, although a small fraction escaped degradation, resulting in cleavage to the α- and β-subunits. These data provide evidence for the first time that glucose deprivation leads to the accumulation of an alternative proreceptor, which can be post-translationally glycosylated with the readdition of glucose inducing both accelerated degradation and maturation.

Cell surface receptors bind extracellular insulin, which leads to autophosphorylation and activation of its tyrosine kinase, resulting in downstream activation of glucose uptake as well as glycogen, fatty acid, and DNA synthesis (1White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mature receptor is a heterotetramer composed of two α-subunits (135 kDa) and two β-subunits (95 kDa). However, the receptor is initially synthesized as a single polypeptide containing both the α- and β-subunits (2Knutson V.P. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2130-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the proreceptor is co-translationallyN-glycosylated on both the α- and β-subunits as shown by the incorporation of metabolically labeled monosaccharides, sensitivity to glycosidase digestions, and binding to specific lectins (3Herzberg V.L.

Ultimately, the N-linked oligosaccharide structures are composed of both high mannose and complex types, the latter of which contains galactose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and sialic acid. Elucidation of the primary sequence of the IR has identified 14 potential N-linked glycosylation sites on the α-subunit and four potential N-linked glycosylation sites on the β-subunit (5Ebina Y.

In addition, the β-subunit has also been shown to contain an O-linked carbohydrate (3Herzberg V.L. Grigorescu F. Edge A.S.B. Spiro R.G. Kahn C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Collier E. Gorden P. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,8Leconte I. Carpentier J.-L. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18062-18071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IR has been extensively used as a model to examine the effect of glycosylation on processing and function. Initial studies were performed using tunicamycin treatment, which inhibitsN-linked glycosylation and leads to the accumulation of an aglyco-proreceptor in an intracellular compartment (9Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4704-4707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Reed B.C. Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The use of castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin (glucosidase inhibitors) also leads to accumulation rather than processing (13Arakaki R.F. Hedo J.A. Collier E. Gorden P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11886-11892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A direct correlation between aberrant glycosylation and processing/function has recently been addressed using site-directed mutagenesis of individualN-linked glycosylation sites. Mutation of the asparagines within the four N-linked consensus sequences of the β-subunit has no effect on processing but inhibits signaling because of defective autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity (8Leconte I. Carpentier J.-L. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18062-18071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Leconte I. Auzan C. Debant A. Rossi B. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17415-17423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, only the third and fourth N-linked sites regulate the functional status of the receptor. In the α-subunit, mutation of the first four N-linked glycosylation sites (16Collier E. Carpentier J.-L. Beitz L. Caro L.H.P. Taylor S.I. Gorden P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or mutation of the first or second pair of sites (17Caro L.H.P. Ohali A. Gorden P. Collier E. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 240-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) leads to accumulation of the proreceptor in the ER. Individual mutations have no effect on processing or function (17Caro L.H.P. Ohali A. Gorden P. Collier E. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 240-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bastian W. Zhu J. Way B. Lockwood D. Livingston J. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that specific N-linked oligosaccharide sites (both location and number) in the IR differentially affect processing and gain of function. Cells possess a number of survival mechanisms to cope with adverse changes in their environment. One stress-related response mechanism is termed the unfolded protein response. The unfolded protein response is induced by a variety of stress conditions, such as glucose or amino acid deprivation, tunicamycin treatment, or sulfhydryl-reducing agents, all of which affect protein folding in the ER (19Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 50-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The induction of the unfolded protein response leads to the transcriptional activation of several molecular chaperones, including GRP78 (also known as BiP). GRP78 is an ER-resident molecular chaperone, which is hypothesized to play an important role in “quality” control in the ER (20Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, GRP78 binds transiently to newly synthesized proteins, releasing properly folded proteins for processing to the Golgi. Misfolded proteins remain bound to GRP78 and are eventually degraded by cytoplasmic proteosomes (21Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 22Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Only two studies have examined the interaction of the insulin receptor with GRP78. In each case, overexpression of mutated receptors was necessary to examine this interaction (23Accili D. Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Mosthaf L. Ullrich A. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 586-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sawa T. Imamura T. Haruta T. Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Takata Y. Takada Y. Morioka H. Ishihara H. Usui I. Kobayashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our goal was to use glucose deprivation as a reversible tool to influence insulin receptor processing in a physiological setting. We show for the first time that glucose deprivation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes causes an accumulation of the insulin proreceptor in the ER as a result of interaction with GRP78. Both accumulation and interaction can be reversed with glucose readdition. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and glucose-free DMEM were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Calf serum (lot S11450) was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA). Fetal bovine serum (lot 1020-90) was purchased from Intergen (Purchase, NY).

The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against the IR β-subunit, IRβ (SC-711) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For immunoblot analysis of GRP78, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a peptide corresponding to the first 12 amino acids from the N terminus. For immunoprecipitation of GRP78, we purchased a polyclonal antibody generated against the C terminus of GRP78 (PA1–014) from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown and differentiated in 100-mm plates according to the procedure of Frost and Lane (25Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four h prior to the start of a protocol, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were provided with fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium). This brings cells to a common starting point and provides the basis for reproducible data. Cells were then either fed complete medium or incubated in glucose-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (glucose-free medium) for the times indicated. Plasma membrane (PM), high density membranes (HDM), and low density membranes (LDM) were isolated from cell homogenates using a technique described by Fisher and Frost (26Fisher M.D. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11806-11809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (128 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mmMgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 5.0 mm Na2HPO4, and 5.0 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4) and collected in TES (20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 255 mmsucrose, pH 7.4) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 18 °C. The cells were then passed through a steel block homogenizer at 18 °C with a fixed clearance of 0.0025 inch. PM, HDM, and LDM fractions were collected by a combination of differential and sucrose gradient centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry assay (27Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Lieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). Fifty μg of protein was solubilized in Laemmli sample dilution buffer (62 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 3 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol), containing 6 m urea. Proteins were resolved on a 5.0 or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose, IR and GRP78 were detected by immunoblot analysis using chemiluminescence as described previously (28Kitzman Jr., H.H. McMahon R.J. Williams M.G. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1320-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands were quantitated by video densitometry on a Visage bioscan (Millipore, Corp.) in the linear range of the film. Fifty μg of membrane protein or radiolabeled IR immunoprecipitated from 1.4–1.6 mg of membrane protein (see below) was digested with N-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H. Specifically, samples were incubated in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min at 100 °C. For N-glycosidase F digestion, samples were brought to 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 1% Nonidet P-40. For endoglycosidase H digestion, samples were brought to 50 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.5. Then, 1 μl (500 units) of eitherN-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H was added and incubated for 1–2 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, sample dilution buffer containing 6 m urea was added and proteins separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were dried for autoradiography (see below), or proteins in the gels were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in 8 ml of complete medium or glucose-free medium for appropriate times. For labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine, cells were then incubated in 8 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM with or without 25 mm glucose for 1 h to deplete intracellular pools. The depletion medium was replaced with 2 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM containing 400 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine with or without 25 mm glucose for specific times (10–180 min). For labeling with [3H]mannose, glucose-deprived cells were placed in 2 ml of glucose-free DMEM containing 420 μCi of [3H]mannose for 3 h. For chase periods, the labeling medium was replaced with 8 ml of complete medium or glucose-free medium for the indicated times. Cells were collected in TES with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized with 20 strokes using a motor-driven pestle. Total membrane fractions were collected by centrifugation at 212,000 × g for 1 h, and the final pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of TES with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Membrane protein (1.4–1.6 mg) was solubilized in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 9.1 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.7 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Extracts were then precleared with 25 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose and 5 μl of preimmune serum for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Protein A-Sepharose was collected by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube. This process was repeated. The final supernatant was transferred to a new tube with 5 μg of anti-IRβ antibody and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The immune complex was collected with protein A-Sepharose by incubation for 2 h followed by brief centrifugation. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed twice with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer, four times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation with 1 m NaCl, and once with 1 ml of TES. Immunoprecipitates were released in 50 μl of sample dilution buffer containing 6 m urea, boiled for 5 min, and run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel overnight at 50 V. For fluorography, the gels were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 40% MeOH for 30 min, soaked in water for 30 min, and then soaked in 1 m sodium salicylate for 1 h before drying at 60 °C under vacuum. Dried gels were exposed to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Hyperfilm for 1–3 days. Densitometry was performed in the linear range of the film. IR or GRP78 was immunoprecipitated as above. IR and GRP78 were released from the protein A-Sepharose·IgG complex with 100 μl of 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.8, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were neutralized with 10 μl of 1m Tris-base. The IgG·protein A-Sepharose complex was removed by centrifugation. The eluates (100 μl) were transferred to glass tubes containing 100 μl of isoelectric focusing sample solution (6.4% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and 6.5 mm dithiothreitol). These samples were then mixed, with 4% acrylamide containing 9 murea, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 2% carrier ampholytes (pH 3.5–10) and were polymerized for 1 h in glass rods (13 cm × 3.4 mm inner diameter). The first dimension (isoelectric focusing) was run at 350 V for 18 h, followed by 800 V for 2.5 h according to procedures by Semple-Rowland et al. (29Semple-Rowland S.L. Adamus G. Cohen R.J. Ulshafer R.J. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The rod gels were removed from the glass tubes and equilibrated in isoelectric focusing equilibration buffer (5% β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.3% SDS, and 10% glycerol) for 30 min before loading onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE for protein separation by mass (second dimension). The slab gels were then dried and exposed to film for autoradiography. Using a subfractionation procedure developed in our laboratory (26Fisher M.D. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11806-11809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we examined the distribution of the insulin receptor in control (F) adipocytes. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against the IR β-subunit revealed two forms of the receptor: the proreceptor, which migrated as a 190-kDa protein, and the mature receptor, represented by the β-subunit, which migrated as a 95-kDa protein (Fig. 1,upper panel). Both the proreceptor and mature receptor were found in the HDM fraction, which we have shown is composed of both ER and Golgi membranes (26Fisher M.D. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11806-11809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Only mature receptor was localized to the PM fraction, which represented about 70% of the total IR pool (Table I). No IR was found in the LDM fraction, which we and others have shown contains the translocatable pool of GLUT4 (30James D.E. Lederman L. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11817-11824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Thomson M.J.

In glucose-deprived cells (S), the proreceptor migrated as a 170-kDa species (Fig. 1,upper panel). This “alternative” proreceptor represented nearly 25% of the total IR pool, which was 6-fold more than the normal proreceptor in control cells (Table I). Mature receptor was noted in both the HDM and PM fraction of glucose-deprived cells, although expression was somewhat reduced relative to controls.Table ISubcellular distribution of IRPMaValues shown are percentage of the maximum.

Units are represented as the average percentage ± S.D. of the total IR pool (PM + HDM). The LDM fraction is not considered in this calculation, since it contains no IR. We also examined the expression of GRP78, an ER molecular chaperone. Confirming our earlier work (26Fisher M.D. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11806-11809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Kitzman H. McMahon R.J. Aslanian A.M. Fadia P.M. Frost S.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 162: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we show that GRP78 is found predominantly in the HDM fraction and significantly elevated in glucose-deprived cells. The apparent localization of GRP78 to the PM is due to the 10% contamination of ER membranes, an artifact of subfractionation in both control and glucose-deprived cells (26Fisher M.D. Frost S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11806-11809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In glucose-fed cells, the level of normal proreceptor and β-subunit remained relatively constant over time (Fig.2, A and B). In contrast, glucose deprivation led to the appearance of the alternative proreceptor by 12 h with continued accumulation through 24 h. The 24- and 48-h time points showed nearly identical accumulation denoting a new steady state. With the increase in the alternative proreceptor, a decrease in the level of IRβ in both the HDM and PM fractions was noted. By 48 h of glucose deprivation, the alternative proreceptor represented the major insulin receptor species, suggesting that the alternative proreceptor is not processed but is rather retained in the ER compartment. Because the alternative proreceptor migrated more rapidly than did the normal proreceptor, we tested whether the alternative proreceptor was glycosylated. Cells treated withN-glycosidase F, which removes all N-linked sugars, resulted in an aglyco-proreceptor species that migrated identically whether from glucose-fed or glucose-deprived cells (comparelanes 1 and 4 in the upper panel of Fig. 3). While we expected that N-glycosidase F treatment of the normal proreceptor would result in accelerated migration, we were surprised that the same occurred in glucose-deprived cells. This implies the attachment of a unique N-linked oligosaccharide core structure to the alternative proreceptor. This is supported by the fact that the alternative proreceptor was resistant to endo H treatment (lane 5), which is in contrast to the sensitivity of the normal proreceptor to endo H (lane 2). Sensitivity to endo H treatment indicates that the normal proreceptor contains high mannose oligosaccharides, which is consistent with earlier work (11Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Kohanski R.A. Simpson T.L. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4566-4575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-subunit also showed sensitivity to endo H, indicating that at least some of the N-linked sites remain as high mannose structures. Note that the β-subunit behaves similarly in control and glucose-deprived samples. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the steady state level of the mature receptor changes by only 10% at 24 h of deprivation and derives from normal proreceptor. To confirm that the alternative proreceptor is not processed with glucose deprivation, glucose-fed and glucose-deprived cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 A). Densitometric analysis of these data is shown in Fig. 4 B. In both the glucose-fed and glucose-deprived cells, the normal and alternative proreceptors, respectively, were visible by 10 min of labeling. The intensity of this labeling increased through the 3-h pulse for both the normal and alternative proreceptors. In control cells, both α- and β-subunits became clearly visible by 1 h of pulse. This indicates that the normal proreceptor was processed into mature receptor. Over the 3-h pulse, no mature receptor was generated from the alternative proreceptor in glucose-deprived cells. Because the alternative proreceptor was not processed, we examined its rate of degradation. Glucose-fed or glucose-deprived cells were pulsed for 1 h and chased for specific times in the presence or absence of 25 mm glucose, as appropriate, before immunoprecipitating IR from total membrane fractions. As shown in Fig.5 A, the normal proreceptor was processed into the α- and β-subunits by 1 h of chase and reached a maximum by 3 h. The half-life of the normal proreceptor was 1.3 ± 0.6 h (n = 3), as determined by first order regression of densitometric data. In contrast, the alternative proreceptor was not processed but rather degraded slowly with a half-life of 5.1 ± 0.6 h (n = 3). To determine if the alternative proreceptor interacts with GRP78, we performed co-precipitation assays. Fig. 6compares those proteins that co-precipitate with IR in the fed and deprived states. In Fig. 6 A, only three proteins were precipitated by the β-subunit antibody: the normal proreceptor, the α-subunit, and the β-subunit. Note that immunoprecipitation with anti-GRP78 antibodies identified no radiolabeled protein, consistent with the low synthetic rate of GRP78 observed by others in the glucose-fed state (34Pouyssegur J. Shiu R.P.C. Pastan I. Cell. 1977; 11: 941-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 35Shiu R.P.C. Pouyssegur J. Pastan I.

With glucose-deprived cells, the β-subunit antibody precipitated not only the alternative proreceptor but also a band that migrated as the 72-kDa protein (Fig.6 B). GRP78, immunoprecipitated from an identical sample, migrated in identical fashion as a 72-kDa protein. Note that GRP78 co-precipitated a number of proteins, including a faint band that migrated like the alternative proreceptor. To further analyze the specificity of interaction, we took advantage of the ATP-dependence of GRP78 binding (37Carlino A. Toledo H. Skaleris D. DeLisio R. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2081-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Toledo H. Carlino A. Vidal V. Redfield B. Nettleton M.Y. Kochan J.P. Brot N. Weissbach H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fig.7 shows that 50 μm ATP was sufficient to release GRP78 from the IR immune complex collected from glucose-deprived cells. Neither high salt wash (1 m NaCl) nor ADP treatment was able to dissociate the 72-kDa protein from the IR (data not shown). Finally, we used the isoelectric point of GRP78 to verify the identity of the 72-kDa protein. Shown in Fig. 8are two-dimensional gels that compare the migration pattern of the 72-kDa protein (Fig. 8 A) with that of authentic GRP78 (Fig.8 B). Antibodies against GRP78 precipitated two forms of the protein. It is likely that one of these isoforms is ADP-ribosylated and/or phosphorylated, which causes homodimerization with itself (40Freiden P.J. Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Only in the unmodified state does GRP78 dissociate from itself to interact with misfolded proteins. Anti-β-subunit antibodies co-precipitated only one form of GRP78 (Fig. 8 A) that aligned with the more basic, unmodified isoform of GR"

Ultimately, this can lead to the double strand break formation and subsequent cell death. To understand the molecular mechanisms of replication fork arrest by the ternary complexes, we have investigated molecular events during collisions between DNA helicases and topoisomerase-DNA complexes. A strand displacement assay was employed to assess the effect of topoisomerase IV (Topo IV)-norfloxacin-DNA ternary complexes on the DnaB, T7 gene 4 protein, SV40 T-antigen, and UvrD DNA helicases. The ternary complexes inhibited the strand displacement activities of these DNA helicases. Unlike replication fork arrest, however, this general inhibition of DNA helicases by Topo IV-norfloxacin-DNA ternary complexes did not require the cleavage and reunion activity of Topo IV. We also examined the reversibility of the ternary complexes after collisions with these DNA helicases. UvrD converted the ternary complex to a nonreversible form, whereas DnaB, T7 gene 4 protein, and SV40 T-antigen did not. These results suggest that the inhibition of DnaB translocation may be sufficient to arrest the replication fork progression but it is not sufficient to generate cytotoxic DNA lesion.

Topoisomerases are the essential enzymes found in all living cells. They are responsible for altering the topology of DNA by catalyzing the passage of DNA strands and helices through each other. These enzymes are required for DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. Topoisomerases also play critical roles in chromosome structure, condensation/decondensation, and segregation (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). The importance of these enzymes is underscored by the fact that they are the primary cellular targets for many clinically important antibacterial and anticancer drugs. In eukaryotes, these enzymes are the cellular targets of potent anticancer drugs, whereas in prokaryotes both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) 1The abbreviations used are: Topo, topoisomerase; bp, base pair(s); BSA, bovine serum albumin; DSB, double strand break; DTT, dithiothreitol; nt, nucleotide(s); SSB, single strand break; Norf, norfloxacin; T-ag, T-antigen; m-AMSA, 4′-(9-acridinylamino)methanesalfon-manisidide are targets of the quinolone antibacterial agents (2Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 191-218Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Topoisomerases break and rejoin DNA strands by forming a covalent linkage between the enzyme and the DNA at the site of the strand breakage (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). This covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex (often referred to as a “cleavable complex”) is normally a fleeting catalytic intermediate. The DNA helix is thought to be broken in the cleavable complex with the linear integrity of the DNA maintained by the topoisomerase bridge. Some topoisomerase inhibitors convert these essential enzymes into cellular poisons by trapping a cleavable complex as a topoisomerase-drug-DNA ternary complex. Because of this unique mode of action, these topoisomerase inhibitors are often called “topoisomerase poisons” (2Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 191-218Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 4Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The poisoning of topoisomerases results in the inhibition of chromosomal DNA replication, formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), and subsequent cell death. Although the formation of the ternary complex is critical for cytotoxicity, these complexes are completely reversible, and the DNA strands can be religated. It has been proposed that an active DNA transaction, such as passage of the DNA replication fork, is required for disruption of the ternary complex to generate a nonreversible cytotoxic DNA lesion, a DSB (2Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 191-218Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 4Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms of the replication fork arrest and the DSB formation are not yet clear. We have modeled the collision between a Topo IV-norfloxacin (Norf)-DNA ternary complex and a replication fork in vitro, using theoriC replication system and either wild type or mutant Topo IV proteins (5Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An active strand cleavage and reunion activity of Topo IV is required for the formation of a ternary complex that can arrest replication fork progression. Interestingly, the collision between a topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex and a replication fork converted the ternary complex to a nonreversible form but did not generate a DSB. An additional step was required for the generation of a DSB. Thus, the cytotoxicity associated with these topoisomerase poisons is likely to require two steps: (i) conversion of a topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex to a nonreversible form as a result of the collision between a ternary complex and a replication fork and (ii) generation of a DSB by subsequent denaturation of the topoisomerase in the dead end complex, perhaps by an aborted repair attempt (5Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further determine molecular mechanisms of replication fork arrest by topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes and generation of DSBs, we investigated the consequences of the collisions between topoisomerase complexes and DNA helicases. We found that a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex inhibited the activities of the DnaB, T7 gene 4 protein, SV40 large T-antigen (T-ag), and UvrD DNA helicases. Interestingly, unlike replication fork arrest, the strand cleavage and reunion activity of Topo IV was not required for this general inhibition of DNA helicases by the ternary complex. The encounter of UvrD with a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex converted the ternary complex to a nonreversible form, whereas that of the DnaB, T7 gene 4 protein, and SV40 T-ag helicases did not. These results suggest that inhibition of DnaB translocation by the topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex may arrest the replication fork progression but the collision of DnaB alone is not sufficient to disrupt the topoisomerase complex and generate DSBs. Two oligonucleotides containing a 40-nucleotide (nt) defined Topo IV binding site (underlined; see Ref. 6Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), T440top (5′-AATTCTTGTTATCGCGACACACTCCTAAAAATCCGGGGTATACCCCGGATTTTTAGGAGTCTAGATACGAGCCGGA-3′) and T440-bottom (5′-AGCTTCCGGCTCGTATCTAGACTCCTAAAAATCCGGGGTATACCCCGGATTTTTAGGAGTGTGTCGCGATAACAAG-3′), were synthesized and annealed to each other to form a short duplex (referred to as T440). A recombinant M13 containing a 40-base pair (bp) defined Topo IV binding site was constructed by cloning the T440 duplex DNA into EcoRI/HindIII-digested M13mp18 (M13-T440). The single-stranded circular DNA of M13-T440 was prepared as described previously (7Franke B. Ray D.S. Virology. 1971; 44: 168-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Model P. Zinder N.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 83: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The wild type, a quinolone-resistant Topo IV, ParC S80L Topo IV, and a catalytically inactive Topo IV, ParC Y120F Topo IV, were prepared according to Hiasa et al. (5Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Purified Topo IV, DnaB, and UvrD were the gift of Kenneth Marians (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). Purified SV40 T-ag, T7 gene 4 protein, and UvrD helicases were generous gifts of Jerard Hurwitz (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), Smita Patel (Ohio State University), and Steve Matson (University of North Carolina), respectively. Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Roche Boehringer Mannheim, Stratagene, and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Partial duplex DNAs were prepared as described previously (9Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11379-11385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 62-nt oligonucleotide, T440C (5′-GCTCGTATCTAGACTCCTAAAAATCCGGGGTATACCCCGGATTTTTAGGAGTGTGTCGCGAT-3′) was synthesized and hybridized to the M13-T440 single-stranded DNA to prepare a primer-template. The oligonucleotide in the primer-template was then 3′-end-labeled by incorporation of 2 residues of [32P]dAMP (ICN) with Klenow enzyme. We referred to this partial duplex DNA as 3′-T440 (Fig. 1 A). When required, a 3′-heteropolymeric tail having an average length of 30 nt was added to the annealed oligonucleotide using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (referred to as 3′-T440T) (Fig.1 A). Oligonucleotides T440C and T440CT (5′-TCGTATCTAGACTCCTAAAAATCCGGGGTATACCCCGGATTTTTAGGAGTGTGTCGCGATATGGTTCAGCTAGCG-3′) were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and then hybridized to the M13-T440 single-stranded DNA to prepare the 5′-end-labeled partial duplex DNAs. These substrates were referred to as 5′-T440 and 5′-T440T, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 23 °C), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 mm ATP, 10 fmol (as molecule) of substrate 3′-T440, 300 fmol of Topo IV, and the indicated concentrations of Norf were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. SDS was then added to 1%, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. EDTA and proteinase K were then added to 25 mm and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. The DNA products were purified by extraction of the reaction mixtures with phenol-chloroform (1:1, v/v), heat-denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and then analyzed by electrophoresis through 8 and 10% polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gels (140 × 160 × 1.2 mm) at 12 V/cm for 2 h using 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 1 mm EDTA as the electrophoresis buffer (TBE buffer). Gels were dried under vacuum onto DE81 paper (Whatman) and autoradiographed with Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Strand displacement was quantitated by scanning images by a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and scanning films by the Eagle Eye II Jr. system (Stratagene).

Three hundred fmol (as tetramer) of Topo IV was first bound to the DNA in a first stage incubation of 5 min at 37 °C. DnaB (250 fmol as hexamer) or T7 gene 4 protein (250 fmol as hexamer) was then added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated during the second stage for 10 min at 37 °C. SV40 T-ag helicase activity was assayed (11Amin A.A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18612-18622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 23 °C), 50 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 100 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml BSA, 2 mm ATP, and 10 fmol of DNA substrate (either 3′-T440 or 5′-T440). During the first stage of incubation, 300 fmol (as tetramer) of Topo IV was bound to the DNA. Then, 500 fmol (as hexamer) of SV40 T-ag helicase was added, and the second stage of the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 10 min. The helicase activity of UvrD was assessed (9Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11379-11385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Matson S.W. George J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2066-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in standard reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 23 °C), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 2 mm ATP. Ten fmol of DNA substrate (either 3′-T440 or 5′-T440) was added, to which 300 fmol (as tetramer) of Topo IV protein was bound by incubating at 37 °C for 5 min. After the first incubation stage, 125 fmol (as dimer) of UvrD helicase was added, and then the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 10 min. As described above, substrates 5′-T440T and 3′-T440T were used in the helicase assays for DnaB and T7 gene 4 protein, and 5′-T440 and 3′-T440 were used for SV40 T-ag and UvrD. We obtained virtually identical results with either substrate (data not shown). Reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to 25 mm, followed by the addition of a quarter volume of a dye mixture containing 15% glycerol, 2% sarkosyl, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 50 mm EDTA. Aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis through vertical 1% agarose (Seakem ME, FMC) gels (140 × 120 × 3 mm) at 5 V/cm for 2 h in a running buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 23 °C), 40 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (TAE buffer). Gels were dried under vacuum onto DE81 paper (Whatman) and autoradiographed with Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Strand displacement was quantitated by scanning images by a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and scanning films by the Eagle Eye II Jr. system (Stratagene). The reversibility of the topoisomerase complexes after their collision with DNA helicases was assessed by combining the strand displacement assay and the reversal assay (5Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were assembled as described above, and Topo IV was bound to the partial duplex DNA in the presence of Norf during the first stage of incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. Reaction mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence and absence of a DNA helicase. This assay allowed a DNA helicase to collide with a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex formed at the defined Topo IV binding site. Reactions were terminated by adding either EDTA or SDS to 25 mm and 1%, respectively, and incubating at 37 °C for 5 min. Either SDS or EDTA, together with proteinase K, was then added to each reaction mixture to a final concentration of 1%, 25 mm, and 100 μg/ml, respectively. The incubation was further continued at 37 °C for an additional 15 min. The DNA products were purified by extraction of the reaction mixtures with phenol-chloroform (1:1, v/v), heat-denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and then analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide (19:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gels (140 × 160 × 1.2 mm) at 12 V/cm for 2 h using TBE buffer. Gels were dried and analyzed as described above. In our previous studies (6Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we defined a preferred Topo IV binding site based on the DNA sequences of Norf-induced, Topo IV-catalyzed DNA cleavage sites on a plasmid DNA. Two oligonucleotides of 24 and 50 nt in length containing this defined Topo IV binding site have been designed as perfect palindromes with the cleavage sites offset 2 nt from the center. The wild type and various mutant Topo IV proteins bind to these short duplex DNAs, and their bindings are stimulated by Norf (6Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We constructed a recombinant M13 that contained the 40-bp defined Topo IV binding site (M13-T440) and prepared its single-stranded DNA. Partial duplex DNAs were prepared by annealing short oligonucleotides complementary to the cloned Topo IV binding site to the M13-T440 single-stranded DNA. On these partial duplex DNAs, the 40-bp-long Topo IV binding site was located in the middle of the duplex region (61–64 bp long) flanked by 10–12-bp spacer sequences at both sides (Fig.1). First, we examined the stimulation of Topo IV-catalyzed cleavages by Norf using a partial duplex DNA 3′-T440 as the substrate (Fig.2). As expected, we observed a unique cleavage of the annealed oligonucleotide as a result of a Norf-stimulated, Topo IV-catalyzed cleavage (Fig. 2 A). There was an additional weak cleavage (about 5–15% of the cleaved DNA) that was observed only at high concentrations of Norf. The stimulation of Topo IV-catalyzed cleavage of a partial duplex by Norf (Fig.2 B) was very similar to that of a short duplex DNA containing the same defined Topo IV binding site (6Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that the Norf-stimulated Topo IV-catalyzed DNA cleavages (Fig. 2) and the Norf-stimulated Topo IV binding to the DNA (6Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) coincided with each other. Thus, we assumed that the Topo IV-catalyzed DNA cleavages in the presence of various concentrations of Norf shown in Fig. 2 correlated with the relative amounts of Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complexes formed on the partial duplex DNA. The occupancy of the DNA substrate by the Topo IV complex determines the probability of the collision between a DNA helicase and a Topo IV complex. These results also showed that the long single-stranded DNA region of the partial duplex DNA neither sequestered the Topo IV protein nor inhibited Topo IV binding to the short duplex region. In addition, we did not observe DNA cleavages of the long single-stranded region of the partial duplex DNA (data not shown). These results were consistent with the observation that Topo IV does not bind to single-stranded DNA (13Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, we concluded that Topo IV could bind to and form both a binary and ternary complex at the short duplex region of the partial duplex DNA. Furthermore, because of the length of the duplex region, it is likely that only one molecule of Topo IV protein could bind to each partial duplex DNA. Thus, this system allowed us to monitor the molecular events during the collision of a DNA helicase with a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex at the defined position. We therefore investigated the effects of topoisomerase complexes on the activities of DNA helicases by using the strand displacement assay. Using oriC replication reconstituted with purified proteins, we have shown that the collision between a replication fork and a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex results in both replication fork arrest and the conversion of a normally reversible ternary complex to a nonreversible form (5Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanisms of replication fork arrest, we examined the effects of a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex on DNA helicases. Among the components of the replication fork, the DNA helicase is first to encounter any roadblock on the parental duplex DNA during chromosomal DNA replication. The DnaB protein is the replicative helicase in Escherichia coli (10LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that DnaB forms a hexameric ring around the lagging strand template while translocating in the 5′ → 3′ direction (10LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 15Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We first assessed the effects of the Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex on the DnaB helicase using a strand displacement assay (Fig.3 A). DnaB could displace about 60% of a short oligonucleotide from the partial duplex DNA under the conditions used (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Norf alone did not affect the activity of DnaB. In the absence of Norf, the binding of Topo IV inhibited DnaB activity by 50% in this assay (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). A catalytically inactive Topo IV alone also partially inhibited DnaB activity (data not shown). This may be because of the sensitivity of the DnaB translocation activity to the presence of proteins bound to duplex DNA that we have observed during previous studies on the effect of Tus protein on DNA helicases (9Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11379-11385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex resulted in an 80% inhibition (Fig. 3 A,lane 7). These results showed that a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex blocked the passage of the DnaB helicase. These results suggest that replication fork arrest by a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex could be due to the inhibition of DnaB translocation. To examine if the inhibition of helicase activity by a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex was specific to DnaB or represented a generalized inhibition of DNA helicases, we performed the strand displacement assay with other DNA helicases. The T7 gene 4 protein is another hexameric replicative helicase that translocates in the 5′ → 3′ direction (17Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,18Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, biochemically, structurally, and functionally, DnaB and T7 gene 4 protein are homologous to each other. We assessed the activity of T7 gene 4 protein in the absence and presence of Topo IV and Norf (Fig. 3 B). The T7 gene 4 protein-catalyzed strand displacement activity was severely inhibited (greater than 80%) only when both Topo IV and Norf were present in the reaction mixtures (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). Neither Topo IV nor Norf alone affected the activity of T7 gene 4 protein, and this helicase displaced about 70% of the annealed oligonucleotide under these conditions (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). These results demonstrated that inhibition of helicase activities by a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex was not specific to DnaB. In a cleavable complex, Topo IV forms a covalent enzyme-DNA bond at the 5′-end of the cleaved DNA strand. Although the topoisomerase-DNA complex is symmetrical, DNA helicases that translocate in the 3′ → 5′ direction would encounter the covalent linkage between the topoisomerase and the DNA at the DSB in the complex. On the other hand, DNA helicases that translocate in the 5′ → 3′ direction would reach an end of the DNA strand. Thus, it is possible that helicase inhibition by the Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex is dependent on the direction in which each DNA helicase approaches the topoisomerase in the ternary complex (i.e. a topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex could block DNA helicases that approach from one direction but not from the other). To test this directly, the effect of a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex on SV40 T-ag was examined. SV40 T-ag also functions in a hexameric form like DnaB and T7 gene 4 protein, but this helicase translocates in the opposite direction (3′ → 5′) on a DNA strand (19Goetz G.S. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wiekowski M. Schwarz M.W. Stahl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 436-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We performed the strand displacement assay with SV40 T-ag and found that about 30% of the annealed oligonucleotide was displaced (Fig.3 C, lane 3). When Topo IV formed a ternary complex with Norf and the DNA, the activity of SV40 T-ag was inhibited greater than 80% (Fig. 3 C, lane 6). Unlike DnaB, Topo IV alone had no effect on SV40 T-ag. However, Norf alone exhibited an inhibitory effect (about 50%) on SV40 T-ag (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). We believed that this inhibition was nonspecific inhibition of protein binding to DNA by Norf. We have noted that Norf specifically inhibits the activities of DNA gyrase and Topo IV in the oriC replication system, but this drug has an inhibitory effect on the binding of DnaA proteins to oriC when it is present at high concentrations. 2H. Hiasa and K. J. Marians, unpublished data. Thus, a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex could arrest replicative helicases approaching from either direction. The three DNA helicases described above are hexameric replicative helicases that act processively during the DNA unwinding reaction. In order to determine if the nature of helicase action modulated interactions between Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complexes and DNA helicases, we examined the effect of a ternary complex on UvrD, a repair helicase. UvrD is thought to function as a dimer on the DNA and catalyzes the DNA unwinding reaction in a distributive manner (12Matson S.W. George J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2066-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike DnaB and SV40 T-ag, neither Topo IV nor Norf alone had an effect on UvrD-catalyzed strand displacement (Fig. 3 D). UvrD displaced about 70% of the annealed oligonucleotide under these conditions (Fig. 3 D,lane 3). However, its activity was severely inhibited (greater than 80%) by a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex formed in the duplex region (Fig. 3 D, lane 6). These results showed that a topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex acted as a roadblock that inhibited the translocation of DNA helicases in a generalized manner. We have demonstrated that the collision between a replication fork and a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex results not only in replication fork arrest but also in the conversion of the ternary complex to a nonreversible form (5Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In light of this observation, we examined if the encounter of a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex with a replicative helicase converts the ternary complex to a nonreversible form. We modified the strand displacement assay so that we could also assess the reversibility of the topoisomerase complex after its collision with a DNA helicase (see “Materials and Methods”). After incubation with a DNA helicase in the presence of a ternary complex, reaction mixtures were terminated by adding either EDTA or SDS. EDTA reverses ternary complex formation, and the topoisomerase religates the DNA strands (21Kreuzer N. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 424-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, SDS denatures the enzyme in the ternary complex, resulting in the generation of a DSB. The DNA products were deproteinized, heat-denatured, and analyzed by electrophoresis. If the ternary complex is still reversible after collision, incubation with EDTA will reverse the ternary complex, and the annealed oligonucleotide will remain intact. However, if the ternary complex is no longer reversible after collision, even after the incubati"

These translocases reversibly cooperate during protein import. We have previously constructed a chimeric precursor (pPGPrA) consisting of an authentic mitochondrial precursor at the N terminus (Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, pPut) linked, through glutathione S-transferase, to protein A. When pPGPrA is expressed in yeast, it becomes irreversibly arrested during translocation across the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Consequently, the two membranes of mitochondria become progressively “zippered” together, forming long stretches in which they are in close contact (Schülke, N., Sepuri, N. B. V., and Pain, D. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.94, 7314–7319). We now demonstrate that trapped PGPrA intermediates hold the import channels stably together and inhibit mitochondrial protein import and cell growth. Using IgG-Sepharose affinity chromatography of solubilized zippered membranes, we have isolated a multisubunit complex that contains all Tom and Tim components known to be essential for import of matrix-targeted proteins, namely Tom40, Tom22, Tim17, Tim23, Tim44, and matrix-localized Hsp70. Further characterization of this complex may shed light on structural features of the complete mitochondrial import machinery.

Further characterization of this complex may shed light on structural features of the complete mitochondrial import machinery. Mitochondria are organelles of eukaryotes that perform essential functions involved in energy generation and many metabolic pathways. Most mitochondrial proteins are nuclear encoded, synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and then imported into mitochondria. Thus, the mitochondrial import machinery is essential for viability of the eukaryotic cell. Numerous components of this machinery have been identified through genetic and biochemical methods; only the core elements have been shown to be essential, and thus, deletion of the corresponding genes in yeast leads to non-viability. Here we describe the isolation of a complex containing these essential constituents, an important step for obtaining a complete molecular and functional picture of the mitochondrial import apparatus. Mitochondrial preproteins synthesized in the cytoplasm are targeted to various compartments of the mitochondrion. Proteins that are destined for the matrix must cross both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. This import process is mediated by two independent but cooperating translocases: one (Tom (translocase ofouter mitochondrial membrane)) is located in the outer membrane, and the other (Tim (translocase ofinner mitochondrial membrane)) in the inner membrane (for review, see Ref. 1Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The Tom machinery contains at least eight proteins: four receptor subunits (Tom70 (2Söllner T. Pfaller R.

The Tom22-Tom20 subcomplex recognizes preproteins with cleavable signal sequences, whereas the Tom70-Tom37 subcomplex recognizes mainly preproteins that have internal signal sequences (1Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Tom22 is the only receptor essential for cell viability and protein import, presumably because this is also a component of the outer membrane translocation channel (11Lithgow T. Junne T. Suda K.

The genes for Tom70, Tom37, or Tom20 can be deleted from haploid yeast strains without severe functional consequences; the cells remain viable, and protein import into mitochondria is only slightly affected (13Lithgow T.

Tom6 and Tom7 appear to modulate the stability of the Tom machinery, but do not directly interact with preproteins. In contrast to these small Tom proteins, Tom40 is an essential protein. Purified Tom40 forms a hydrophilic channel that specifically binds to and transports mitochondrial signal peptides (15Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N.

Instead, they are likely to interact with each other only transiently during import. When preproteins spanning both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes were trapped during in vitro import into the matrix and subsequently detergent-solubilized, some of the Tom and Tim proteins were found to be associated with the translocation intermediates (26Berthold J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but the composition of these complexes was variable and inconsistent. Furthermore, these observations were made in vitro and remain to be confirmed by in vivoexperiments. We have recently constructed a chimeric protein (pPGPrA (pPut-GST-protein A)) comprising an authentic N-terminal mitochondrial precursor (Δ 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GFP, green fluorescence protein; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GIP, general insertion pore -pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, pPut) linked, through glutathione S-transferase (GST),1 to IgG-binding domains derived from staphylococcal protein A (29Schülke N. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7314-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This construct becomes trapped en route to the matrix, spanning both outer and inner membranes in such a way that the entire Put moiety reaches the matrix while only the folded protein A domain remains outside. During in vivo import of pPGPrA, the outer and inner membranes of mitochondria become progressively “zippered” together. Under the electron microscope, these appear as long stretches of close membrane contact. Based on these results, we proposed that the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane channels, which normally interact only transiently, can be tightly joined by means of arrested PGPrA translocation intermediates (29Schülke N. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7314-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We now provide biochemical evidence for this hypothesis. We demonstrate that pPGPrA follows the same import pathway as authentic pPut both in vitro and in intact yeast cells. Blocking of import sites with PGPrA intermediates inhibits protein import and cell growth. These findings are extended by the isolation of a multisubunit complex containing PGPrA intermediates generated in vivo and essential components of both outer and inner membrane channels. The pPGPrA open reading frame was excised with XbaI and NcoI from the plasmid pET3a/pPGPrA (29Schülke N. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7314-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the same sites of pET21b/protein A. 2N. Schülke and D. Pain, unpublished data. The resulting plasmid, pET21b/pPGPrA, encodes pPGPrA with a C-terminal His6tag. The NdeI/NsiI fragment of the plasmid pET21b/pPGPrA was replaced by a short linker using the oligonucleotides 5′-TATGTATGTCAAGTATGCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TACTTGACATACA-3′ (antisense). The resulting plasmid, pET21b/ΔN-PGPrA, encodes a truncated protein in which the first 172 amino acids of pPGPrA-His6 are replaced by Met-Tyr-Val-Lys-Tyr-Ala. The HindIII/XbaI fragment of pYES/pPGPrA (29Schülke N. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7314-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was replaced by a short linker using oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTCACAGGAATTATGTATGCATCAGACGGATCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAGAGGATCCGTCTGATGCATACATAATTCCTGTGA-3′ (antisense). The resulting plasmid, pYES/m*PGPrA, encodes a truncated protein in which the first 124 amino acids are replaced by Met-Tyr-Ala- Ser-Asp-Gly. The plasmid pYES/pPGPrA was digested withKpnI and BamHI. The fragment containing the vector and most of pPut was religated in the presence of oligonucleotides 5′-CTGAGTCGACG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATCCGTCGACTCAGGTAC-3′ (antisense) to generate pYES/pPut. A chimeric protein (mtGFP) in which the first 90 amino acids of pPut linked in frame to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed as follows. TheHindIII/ScaI fragment of pYES2/pPGPrA was cloned into the HindIII/SmaI sites of pBluescript II SK+ (pBS, Stratagene), resulting in pNS161. The GFP open reading frame was excised from pGFPuv (CLONTECH) with XbaI and EagI and cloned into the same sites of pNS161 to yield pBS/mtGFP. The HindIII/EagI fragment of GFP from pBS/mtGFP was subsequently subcloned into the same sites of pRS415GAL1 2 to yield pRS415GAL1/mtGFP (pNS168), which encodes the chimeric protein (mtGFP) under the control of the GAL1 promoter for expression in yeast. Proteins were expressed in bacteria as described previously (30Sepuri N.B.V. Gordon D.M. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20941-20950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). pPGPrA, sequestered in insoluble inclusion bodies, was solubilized in 20 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.0, containing 8m urea and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, applied to a Mono P HR 5/20 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and subsequently eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–100 mm). Peak fractions containing pPGPrA were concentrated using a Ni2+-NTA column (QIAGEN Inc.). The final eluate was in 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.4 m imidazole, 8 m urea, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Inclusion bodies containing ΔN-PGPrA were solubilized in 8 m urea and directly purified on Ni2+-NTA. A protease-deficient yeast strain, ABYS 86 (MATαpra1-1 prb1-1 prc1-1 cps1-3 ura3Δ5 leu2-3,112 his −), was cotransformed with pNS168 and pYES/pPGPrA, pYES/m*PGPrA, or pYES/pPut, and Ura+Leu+transformants were selected. As a control for nuclear import, strain ABYS 86 was cotransformed with pYES/pPGPrA and aCEN-HIS3 plasmid containing the GAL1promoter-driven gene fusion of histone H2B1 to GFP (31Enenkel C. Schülke N. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12986-12991Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and Ura+His+ transformants were selected. Various transformants were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase in selective medium containing 2% dextrose and subsequently shifted to medium containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose. The subcellular distribution of GFP reporter proteins was analyzed by direct fluorescence microscopy as described (31Enenkel C. Schülke N. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12986-12991Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were purified from yeast cells that carried the plasmid pYES/pPGPrA after 4 h of induction with 1% galactose (29Schülke N. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7314-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were resuspended by sonication in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 72% sucrose, 0.15 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Samples (4 ml) were transferred to a SW 40 tube and layered with 6 and 2.5 ml of 68 and 5% sucrose in the same buffer, respectively. Membranes were floated by centrifugation at 202,000 × g for 40 h. Purified membranes (68/5% interface) were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% digitonin, 0.25 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.01% lipid (45% phosphatidylcholine, 35% phosphatidylethanolamine, 10% phosphatidylinositol, and 10% cardiolipin). Samples were centrifuged (TLA-100.3, 153,000 ×g, 30 min), and the supernatant thus obtained was loaded onto a column containing 0.1 ml of rabbit IgG-Sepharose (Cappel). The column was sealed and rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 2 h. Following washing, the column was eluted with 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 2.8, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.02% digitonin. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 2 m Tris base. PGPrA interferes with Western blot analysis since protein A has a high affinity for rabbit IgG. Therefore, PGPrA was specifically removed from the affinity eluate as follows. SDS (0.2% final concentration) was added to the affinity eluate and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Samples were then adjusted to 1% Triton X-100 and again passed through a fresh IgG-Sepharose column. The unbound fraction was used for all immunoblot analysis. Under these conditions, only PGPrA was retained by the IgG-Sepharose column; all other proteins were quantitatively recovered in the unbound fraction. All antibodies were raised in rabbits. Antibodies against mt-Hsp70, Tom70, Tom40, Tom20, Tim44, Tim11, and porin were generated against bacterially expressed and purified full-length proteins. The first 97 amino acids of Tom22 were expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein using the vector pGEX-4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-Tom22 antibodies were against the purified fusion protein. Antibodies against Tim23 (residues 1–14) and Tim17 (residues 142–156) were raised against chemically synthesized peptides as described (32Pain D. Murakami H. Blobel G. Nature. 1990; 347: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Antibodies against p32 have been described earlier (32Pain D. Murakami H. Blobel G. Nature. 1990; 347: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Murakami H. Blobel G. Pain D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3358-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the ADP/ATP carrier and cytochrome c peroxidase were from H. Murakami and J. Kaput, respectively. In vitro import reactions were performed using mitochondria isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D273-10B (ATCC 24657) in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 1 mm GTP (30Sepuri N.B.V. Gordon D.M. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20941-20950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Sepuri N.B.V. Schülke N. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1420-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, urea-denatured precursors were diluted 50-fold in the import reactions; the final urea concentration was 0.16 m. A final urea concentration as high as 0.6m does not inhibit import of native precursors (35Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Following import, reaction mixtures were left untreated or were treated with trypsin (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 0 °C. Trypsin was inactivated by a mixture of inhibitors, and mitochondria were reisolated. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. pPGPrA synthesized in reticulocyte lysate becomes trapped as a translocation intermediate en route to the matrix; hence, it could be of potential use for blocking mitochondrial import sites (29Schülke N. Sepuri N.B.V. Pain D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7314-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the quantity of proteins that can be synthesized in cell-free translation systems is very low. Therefore, to maximize our ability to saturate import sites with the translocation intermediates, we decided to use pPGPrA with a C-terminal His6 tag overexpressed in bacteria. The overexpressed protein was sequestered in insoluble inclusion bodies (Fig.1 A, lane 2,Load) and solubilized in 8 m urea. When this fraction was directly chromatographed on Ni2+-NTA resin, three other smaller molecular mass proteins copurified with pPGPrA (data not shown). These contaminants are probably N-terminally truncated forms of pPGPrA resulting from internal initiations. On SDS-PAGE, one of these contaminants migrated very closely to the mature chimeric protein obtained after removal of the signal sequence (mPGPrA) and interfered with the analysis of import results. We therefore first separated pPGPrA from all three contaminating proteins by fast protein liquid chromatography on Mono P HR 5 (data not shown). Peak fractions containing >90% radiochemically pure pPGPrA were concentrated on Ni2+-NTA (Fig. 1 A, lane 3,pPGPrA). Purified and urea-denatured 35S-labeled pPGPrA was used for import into isolated yeast mitochondria at 30 °C. About 50% of the precursor (∼118 kDa) was converted to the corresponding mature form (mPGPrA, ∼116 kDa) through cleavage of the signal sequence by a matrix-localized signal peptidase (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). The import was completely inhibited by valinomycin (Fig.1 B, lane 3), which dissipates the membrane potential across the inner membrane. This suggests that urea-denatured chimeric pPGPrA follows the same import pathway to the matrix as do authentic mitochondrial precursors. We next sought to determine the location of mPGPrA molecules. The susceptibility of the precursor protein to proteolytic cleavage both on the matrix side (by signal peptidase) and on the cytosolic side (by externally added protease) is evidence that the precursor has become lodged or stuck in the membrane as a translocation intermediate, spanning both the outer and inner membranes. Only ∼50% of the mPGPrA molecules remained completely protected from externally added trypsin. The remaining 50% were digested to varying degrees by external trypsin (Fig. 1 B, lane 4; equivalent to 20 times thelane 2 load), generating a ladder of bands. The ladder likely resulted from the partial cleavage of imported molecules arrested at various stages of translocation. Although the signal sequence of these molecules was cleaved by the matrix-localized signal peptidase, different lengths of the C-terminal domain remained exposed outside. A more slowly migrating band in the ladder corresponds to an intermediate with a longer protease-protected N-terminal segment,i.e. an intermediate in which more of the N terminus of pPGPrA has been translocated across the outer membrane. The band representing mPut-GST (mPG) was the major band in the ladder (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), indicating that a significant portion of the intermediates were trapped in such a way that only the protein A domain remained exposed outside the organelle. The ladder was not the result of incomplete digestion of non-imported molecules by trypsin since (i) pPGPrA was completely digested by trypsin when import was inhibited in the presence of valinomycin (Fig. 1 B,lane 5), and (ii) both precursor and mature forms of PGPrA were completely digested by trypsin in the presence of Triton X-100 (data not shown). The import of urea-denatured proteins at 30 °C is very rapid (34Sepuri N.B.V. Schülke N. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1420-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As a result, the protein A domain of pPGPrA may be unable to fold sufficiently to serve as an efficient C-terminal block during the import reaction. We reasoned that if the import of urea-denatured pPGPrA could be slowed by lowering the incubation temperature, the protein A moiety of the chimeric precursor might fold sufficiently, thereby yielding a larger number of translocation intermediates trapped within the import channels and fewer completely imported mature molecules in the matrix. Indeed, this was the case. When the import was carried out at 0 °C, intermediate formation was greatly increased (compare mPG/mPGPrA ratio in Fig. 1 B, lane 4, with that in Fig. 1 C, lane 4). We therefore used these conditions for import inhibition studies. To investigate how stably the outer and inner membrane channels were held together by PGPrA intermediates, import reactions were subjected to trypsin treatment in isotonic (Fig.2 A, lane 3) or hypotonic (the latter disrupts the outer membrane and exposes the intermembrane space; lane 4) buffer. The pattern and the intensity of each band in the ladders were almost identical. This suggests that no further degradation of intermediates by trypsin occurred when the intermembrane space was exposed by hypotonic shock. As a control, we monitored the release of endogenous cytochromec peroxidase (an intermembrane space protein) as an indicator of outer membrane disruption (Fig. 2 B). More than 90% of cytochrome c peroxidase was released under hypotonic conditions. Taken together, these data suggest that PGPrA translocation intermediates were able to hold the outer and inner membrane channels together, preventing trypsin access to the intermediates through the intermembrane space. To test whether pPGPrA and pPut compete with each other for import, mitochondria were incubated with [35S]Met-labeled native pPut (synthesized in reticulocyte lysate) in the presence of different concentrations of unlabeled urea-denatured pPGPrA. About 50% of pPut import was inhibited by pPGPrA at 2 μg/ml (Fig.3 A). The inhibition indeed occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). However, a relatively high concentration of pPGPrA was required for complete inhibition of pPut import. This was perhaps due to the rapid import of urea-denatured pPGPrA at 30 °C, making it a weak competitor. Nevertheless, to rule out any nonspecific effect of a relatively high concentration of pPGPrA, we tested ΔN-PGPrA (with the first 172 amino acids, including the signal sequence of pPGPrA, deleted) as a control. Even at the highest concentration, urea-denatured ΔN-PGPrA had no significant inhibitory effect on the import of native pPut (Fig. 3 B, lane 7). To test whether preformed PGPrA intermediates would inhibit subsequent pPut import, intermediates were first generated by incubating unlabeled urea-denatured pPGPrA with mitochondria at 0 °C as in Fig.1 C (lane 4). Mitochondria were then reisolated to remove unbound pPGPrA and tested for their ability to import [35S]Met-labeled native pPut at 30 °C. PGPrA intermediates (Mito + TI) were able to inhibit pPut import by ∼60% compared with the mock control (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 2 and 5). Complete inhibition was not achieved because some of the intermediates were chased into the matrix during the second import at 30 °C (data not shown), thereby making more import sites available to pPut. It should be noted that unlike urea-denatured preproteins, pPut synthesized in reticulocyte lysate is not imported at 0 °C. The urea-denatured precursor circumvents at least one highly temperature-sensitive and rate-limiting step, which presumably represents the unfolding of the native precursor prior to import into isolated mitochondria (34Sepuri N.B.V. Schülke N. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1420-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Eilers M. Hwang S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To obtain a more quantitative inhibition of pPut import, we took advantage of the high affinity of protein A for rabbit IgG.

Type IX collagen, which belongs to the group of fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices, is a component of hyaline cartilage, intervertebral discs, and the vitreous body. The molecule is a heterotrimer consisting of three genetically distinct chains, α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX) (1van der Rest M. Mayne R. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types.

Type IX collagen is also a proteoglycan, because a glycosaminoglycan side chain is covalently attached to the NC3 domain of the α2(IX) chain (4Bruckner P. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Proc. Natl.

Hyaline cartilage contains mixed fibrils of types II, IX, and XI collagens, of which type II is the major component. Type XI collagen is an internal component of the fibril, whereas type IX collagen is located on the surface. Covalent lysine-derived cross-links between the central COL2 region of the α3(IX) chain and the C-telopeptide of type II collagen and between the N-terminal ends of the COL2 domains of all the type IX collagen α chains and the N-telopeptide of type II collagen stabilize the interaction between type II and IX collagens (5Eyre D.R.

The association of α chains in proper stoichiometry and register is a prerequisite for the formation of a stable collagen helix. The mechanism of chain selection and association has been studied most extensively in the fibrillar collagens, for which the crucial role of large C-terminal propeptides in chain selection and association has been demonstrated. These propeptides contain specific recognition sequences that direct the association of α chains in a collagen type-specific manner (11Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For example, the fibrillar collagenous polypeptides synthesized by chondrocytes, namely α1(II), α1(XI), and α2(XI), are found only as two trimeric molecules in vivo, (α1(II))3 and α1(XI)α2(XI)α1(II), despite the 10 theoretically possible combinations (13Morris M.P. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11345-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The factors responsible for chain selection and assembly in the case of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices are likely to be different from those affecting the fibrillar collagens, because their C-terminal NC1 domains are much smaller and there is no appreciable homology with the C-propeptides of the fibrillar collagens. The chain assembly of type IX collagen has been studied both in vitro and in vivo. Labourdette and van der Rest (14Labourdette L. van der Rest M.

In the present work, we have used a baculovirus expression system to produce recombinant human type IX collagen in insect cells in order to study the structure and chain assembly of type IX collagen. We report here for the first time on the production of type IX collagen, which consists of three different α chains, in insect cells simultaneously with the tetrameric enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylase, needed for the production of stable collagen. Total RNA was extracted from human fetal cartilage of several individuals by the guanidium isothiocyanate method, and about 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Aliquots of cDNA were used for a single step amplification by polymerase chain reaction (ExpandTM long template polymerase chain reaction system; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using oligonucleotide primers for the 5′- and 3′-ends of the three α chains. Specific oligonucleotide primers for the α1(IX) chain were designed based on the published sequences (19Muragaki Y. Kimura T. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Rokos I. Muragaki Y. Warman M. Olsen B.R. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide MH-18 (ACT CCC TTG CGG CCG CTT CTT CAT AGG), corresponding to the 5′-noncoding sequence of the α1(IX) cDNA, contained an engineeredNotI cleavage site, and the oligonucleotide MH-19 (TCA TGC AGA CGG CCG TGC AGC AGT AAG), corresponding to the 3′-noncoding sequence, contained an engineered EagI cleavage site. For amplification of the α2(IX) cDNA, the specific oligonucleotides MH-22 (TCT GCC GTC GGT GCG GCC GCG GAC ACG C), corresponding to the 5′-noncoding sequence of the α2(IX) cDNA, and MH-23 (TCA TGC AGA CGG CCG TGC AGC AGT AAG), corresponding to the 3′-noncoding sequence, were designed based on published sequences (21Perälä M.

The oligonucleotides MH-29 (CCC GAC GCC GCA GTC TAG ACT CCG CCA CGC), corresponding to the 5′-noncoding sequence of the α3(IX) cDNA, and MH-30 (TCG GGC GTC CTT GTC TCT AGA TTC CTC ACG), corresponding to the 3′-noncoding sequence, contained engineered XbaI cleavage sites. The cDNAs were digested with the enzymes indicated above and ligated into the pVL1392 vector. The cDNAs were completely sequenced (SequenaseTM reagent kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using cDNA-specific sequencing primers. The three recombinant constructs were co-transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9; Invitrogen) insect cells with a modifiedAutographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus by means of the BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen), and the resultant viral pools were collected, amplified, and plaque-purified (24Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedures and Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1993: 51-52Google Scholar). Sf9 orTrichoplusia ni (High Five; Invitrogen) insect cells were cultured in monolayers in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bioclear), and High Five cells were also cultured in suspension in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C. Prior to the infection, the insect cells were seeded at densities of 5–6 × 105 cells/ml for the expression of recombinant proteins in monolayers and 1 × 106 cells/ml for expression in suspension. The cells were co-infected with three viruses coding for the α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX) chains and a double promoter virus 4PHαβ coding for the α- and β-subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase (25Nokelainen M. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Fietzek P.P. Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with multiplicities of infection of 2:2:2:4, respectively. Ascorbate (80 μg/ml) was added daily to the culture medium. After 72 h of infection, the High Five cells were detached from the culture plates by pipetting and harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Those cultured in suspension were also harvested by centrifugation. Intracellular proteins were extracted from the cells by homogenization in 0.27m NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.07 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, as described earlier (26Lamberg A. Helaakoski T.

The supernatant of the homogenate was stored at 4 °C, and the Triton-insoluble pellet was dissolved in 1% SDS at room temperature for 2 h, after which the insoluble remains were discarded. Alternatively, the cells were suspended and homogenized in 0.75 m NaCl, 0.5 macetic acid, pH 2, on ice (7.5 × 106 cells/ml) for 30 s using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and proteins were precipitated from the supernatant by increasing the NaCl concentration to 3 m and mixing at 4 °C for 12–16 h followed by centrifugation and dissolving of the pellet in 50 mm acetic acid (27Duance V.C. Wotton S.F. Voyle C.A. Bailey A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Homogenization was performed either without protease inhibitors or in the presence of 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm E-64, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μmpepstatin, and 75 nm aprotinin, separately or in various combinations. The presence of type IX collagen in the culture medium was assayed by dialyzing the medium against 50 mm acetic acid followed by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; T m, midpoint temperature of thermal transition; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid and Western blotting with the monoclonal antibody 95D1A. 2This antibody was generated using a collagenous fragment of recombinant human type XIII collagen as an antigen. It was found to recognize the collagen domains of various denatured collagen chains (A. Snellman and T. Pihlajaniemi, unpublished observations). To purify the type IX collagen, the proteins were precipitated from the culture medium by adding solid ammonium sulfate to a 25% saturation and placing the mixture on ice for 1 h. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and dissolved in 0.5 m urea, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.05m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C overnight to a concentration of about 1 mg/ml. The dissolved recombinant protein was then purified by gel filtration through Sephacryl S-300HR in the same buffer. Further purification was achieved by cation exchange on a CM-Sepharose fast flow column in a buffer of 2 m urea, 50 mm PIPES, and 20 mm NaCl at pH 6.5, eluting with an increasing NaCl concentration gradient (0.02–1 mNaCl). The recombinant protein isolated was characterized by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Western blotting with the monoclonal antibody 95D1A. The purified material was dialyzed against 50 mm acetic acid, hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 16 h and subjected to amino acid analysis in an Applied Biosystems 421 analyzer. The thermal stability of the material was determined by CD analysis at a fixed wavelength (221 nm), raising the temperature linearly at a rate of 60 °C/h (28Gaill F. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Kühn K. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For N-terminal sequencing, purified recombinant type IX collagen was electrophoresed under reducing conditions and transferred to ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride-type membrane, and the excised bands were subjected to Edman degradation with 477/120A liquid-phase protein/peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Three recombinant viruses, each coding for one of the three α chains of human type IX collagen, were generated and used to infect High Five cells together with a double promoter virus, 4PHαβ (25Nokelainen M. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Fietzek P.P. Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), coding for the α and β subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase. The cells were harvested after 72 h of culture and homogenized in a buffer containing Triton X-100, as used to isolate other recombinant collagens from insect cells (26Lamberg A. Helaakoski T.

No recombinant protein could be detected in the Triton X-100 soluble protein fraction by Coomassie staining, but individual α chains were clearly detectable in the insoluble fraction (not shown). Selective salt precipitation, which had been used previously to extract type IX collagen from tissues (27Duance V.C. Wotton S.F. Voyle C.A. Bailey A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was therefore used to isolate intracellular type IX collagen. The amount of intracellular type IX collagen produced by the insect cells was estimated by comparison with known amounts of Coomassie-stained recombinant human type II collagen to be 4–8 mg/liter of culture (not shown). However, analyses of the isolated material by Western blotting with the 95D1A antibody repeatedly revealed that the material was partially degraded, an effect that was not significantly reduced by the use of various protease inhibitors (not shown). The presence of type IX collagen in the culture medium was shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of dialyzed medium using the 95D1A antibody (Fig. 1). In comparison with the intracellular material extracted by acid/NaCl and precipitated with 3m NaCl, the recombinant type IX collagen present in the medium appeared to be less seriously degraded (Fig. 1), and therefore a protocol for isolating and purifying type IX collagen from the culture medium was designed. Addition of solid ammonium sulfate to a 25% saturation resulted in specific precipitation of the type IX collagen (Fig. 2), and analysis of the supernatant from this precipitation by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining or Western blotting showed that only a minor amount of type IX collagen had remained in solution (results not shown). Up to 10 mg of type IX collagen was obtained from 1 liter of culture medium. The precipitated type IX collagen was dissolved in a buffer containing 0.5 murea to enhance the solubilization of the protein, and the solution was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-300HR column in the same buffer. Analysis of the fractions containing most of the type IX collagen indicated removal of low molecular weight contaminants, e.g.the remaining bovine serum albumin (Fig.3, lane 3). Further purification was achieved by cation exchange chromatography on a CM-Sepharose fast flow column (Fig. 3, lane 4).Figure 2Efficiency of ammonium sulfate in selective precipitation of secreted recombinant type IX collagen. After 72 h of coinfection of High Five cells with the recombinant baculoviruses for the α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX) chains and the 4PHαβ virus, the culture medium was clarified by centrifugation, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to achieve the concentrations indicated (percentage of saturation). After 1 h, the precipitates were collected by centrifugation, dissolved, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and analyzed by Coomassie staining.Lane 1, molecular weight markers;lanes 2–6, extracellular material precipitated in the concentrations of ammonium sulfate indicated (calculated as saturation percentages).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Analysis of the efficiency of gel filtration and cation exchange in the purification of recombinant human type IX collagen.

The melting behavior of the recombinant type IX collagen was analyzed by CD. The profile was biphasic, with about 23 of the transition centering at T m = 37.5 °C and about 13 of the transition centering atT m = 46.0 °C (Fig.4).Table IAmino acid analysis of the purified recombinant human type IX collagenAmino acidRecombinant human type IX collagenExpected values from cDNA deduced amino acid sequence of type IX collagenResidues/1000%aThe total number of amino acids in heterotrimeric type IX collagen is 2223.

Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequence at the N terminus of the α1(IX) chain, as identified by Edman degradation, was AVKRRPR, corresponding to the predicted signal peptide cleavage site (19Muragaki Y. Kimura T. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The sequences for the α2(IX) and α3(IX) chains could not be determined, apparently because of N-terminal blocking. The tendency of the N termini of these two chains to get blocked may be explained by possible presence of glutamine (22Pihlajamaa T. Vuoristo M.M. Annunen S. Perälä M. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Brewton R.G. Wood B.M. Ren Z.-X. Gong Y. Tiller G.E. Warman M.L. Lee B. Horton W.A. Olsen B.R. Baker J.R. Mayne R. Genomics. 1995; 30: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) at the N terminus of the polypeptides (30Blombäck B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 398-411Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The formation of disulfide-bonded homomeric and heteromeric molecules by the α chains was studied by expressing each chain individually and in all possible combinations together with prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Analyses of samples of the culture media by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the 95D1A antibody showed that all three α chains of human type IX collagen appear to be capable of forming disulfide-bonded homodimers. Whereas α1(IX) chains showed clear homotrimer formation, the homotrimers of α2(IX) and α3(IX) chains were not readily detectable (Fig. 5). When all three chains are expressed simultaneously, the heterotrimer α1(IX)α2(IX)α3(IX) is the dominant molecular species. However, it is possible that also other disulfide-bonded trimers are formed, but in quantities that are below the detection limit. Interestingly, co-expression of any two α chains results in formation of detectable amounts of disulfide-bonded heterodimeric molecules only when the chains concerned are α1(IX) and α3(IX) (Fig. 5). Any other combination of two α chains appears to result only in the formation of disulfide-bonded homodimers (Fig. 5). Abundance of monomeric molecules seen in Fig. 5 is likely to reflect the release of the monomers into the culture medium due to cell lysis during the expression. Second, some of the monomers may originate from secreted trimeric molecules that were not fully disulfide-bonded. Also, the abundance of monomers is in part an artifact, because the efficiency of electroblotting is inversely related to the size of the blotted molecules. As type IX collagen is a minor cartilage component that is covalently cross-linked to type II collagen fibrils and has interruptions in its triple helix, it has been difficult to isolate intact type IX collagen molecules from tissues. We have now produced and isolated intact heterotrimeric human type IX collagen for the first time using a baculovirus expression system. To obtain stable type IX collagen, a double promoter virus for the α and β subunits of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (25Nokelainen M. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Fietzek P.P. Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was co-expressed with three viruses for the α chains of type IX collagen itself. Our initial attempts to purify intracellular type IX collagen failed because the protein was insoluble in a buffer containing Triton X-100 and was easily degraded after acid extraction and selective salt precipitation. Unlike the intracellular material, type IX collagen purified from the medium migrated as a single band of over 200 kDa in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and reduction indicated that the material consisted of three α chains in a 1:1:1 ratio. It is likely that the three viruses for the α chains and the virus for prolyl 4-hydroxylase do not infect all the insect cells with equal efficiency, which in turn may lead to the intracellular accumulation of underhydroxylated and improperly folded molecules that are insoluble or susceptible to degradation. Amino acid analysis of the secreted trimeric type IX collagen showed that the composition of the material was in agreement with composition expected based on the cDNA deduced amino acid sequence. An adequate degree of 4-hydroxylation of the Y-position prolines in the Gly-X-Y sequences is required to stabilize the collagen triple helix (31Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar), but the extent of prolyl 4-hydroxylation in type IX collagen is currently not known. That in the recombinant type IX collagen was about 80% of the theoretical maximum. CD analysis indicated that this degree of hydroxylation is adequate, because theT m values of the recombinant type IX collagen corresponded well to the values reported for type IX collagen isolated from tissues (32Miles C.A. Knott L. Sumner I.G. Bailey A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The transition profile was biphasic because the COL3 domain has a higher thermal stability than the rest of the molecule (32Miles C.A. Knott L. Sumner I.G. Bailey A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results of CD analysis also indicate proper folding of the recombinant type IX collagen. The results presented here show that all recombinant type IX collagen α chains are able to form disulfide-bonded homodimers, whereas only the α1(IX) chains show homotrimer formation. These findings support previous observations that the C-terminal fragments of α1(IX) chains exhibit the highest potential for homotrimer formation and α3(IX) chains have the lowest ability for self-association (16Mechling D.E. Gambee J.E. Morris N.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13781-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Monomers and disulfide-bonded dimeric molecules were also detected in the culture medium. Because collagens are secreted as trimeric molecules, these species may originate from secreted trimeric molecules that were not fully disulfide-bonded. Alternatively, the monomers and dimers could represent immature molecules that are released into the culture medium as a result of cell lysis. In a reassociation study using pepsin-resistant C-terminal low molecular weight fragments of bovine type IX collagen, Labourdette and van der Rest (14Labourdette L. van der Rest M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) found some formation of homomeric molecules in addition to the expected α1α2α3 heterotrimer upon mixing of fragments of all three α chains. Our results obtained using full-length α chains indicate that the heterotrimer is the predominant product formed. It is therefore possible that the C termini of the NC1 domains that are missing in the low molecular weight fragments enhance formation of the heterotrimer in preference to homotrimers. Because our results were obtained using secreted material, it is possible that homotrimeric molecules are also formed but remain mostly intracellular. It is also possible that homotrimeric molecules are present in the culture medium, but in very low quantities. Two cysteine residues located at the COL1/NC1 junction in all three α(IX) chains are involved in interchain disulfide bond formation. The functionality of these cysteines in connecting together any two of the α chains has been demonstrated by Labourdette and van der Rest (14Labourdette L. van der Rest M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), who were able to detect all possible dimeric combinations in minor quantities. In the present case, however, α1α3 was the only heterodimeric molecular structure detected. It is possible that the other two disulfide-bonded heterodimeric species were also formed but in quantities that were below the detection limit of the experimental system. Similarly, it is possible that in a reassociation study using synthetic NC1 domains (16Mechling D.E. Gambee J.E. Morris N.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13781-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), heterodimeric molecules were formed but remained undetected. Even though our results were obtained with a semiquantitative analysis, it appears that co-expression of the α1(IX) and α3(IX) chains results in formation of the heterodimer, which dominates the respective homodimers. The results thus suggest that in the association of full-length type IX collagen α chains the most favored trimeric form is an α1(IX)α2(IX)α3(IX) heterotrimer, although α1(IX) chains are capable of forming disulfide-bonded homotrimeric molecules.

To examine this hypothesis, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to analyze the protein expression pattern of therpb4 null mutant in response to heat shock, oxidative stress, osmotic stress, and in the post-diauxic phase. We show that this mutant is not impaired in stress induced transcriptional activation: the absence of heat shock response of the mutant is due to a general defect in RNA polymerase II activity at high temperature. Under this condition, Rpb4p is necessary to maintain the polymerase activity in vivo. The heat growth defect of the rpb4 null mutant can be partially suppressed by overexpression ofRPB7, suggesting that Rpb4p maintains or stabilizes Rpb7p in the RNA polymerase.

Structural data obtained by electron microscopy of the complete RNA polymerase and the enzyme devoid of the Rpb4/7 subcomplex have located these two subunits in the floor of the DNA-binding cleft (4Jensen G.J. Meredith G. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The function of this subcomplex could be to induce a tight closure of the arm domain surrounding the cleft and to favor the transition from an “open” conformation of the polymerase during the initiation step of transcription to a “closed” conformation during the elongation step (5Asturias F.J. Meredith G.D. Poglitsch C.L. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Whereas RPB7 is essential, RPB4 is not during normal growth conditions. Strains carrying a deletion ofRPB4 are cold- and heat-sensitive and auxotrophic for inositol (6Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 347-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rpb4 null mutant cells are unable to transcribe HSP26and SSA3mRNA under heat shock condition and when cells enter stationary phase (7Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been argued that this reflects specialized regulatory role of Rpb4p, which would endow Pol II with the ability to respond to stress stimuliin vivo (7Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the role of Rpb4p may be to prevent the inactivation of the polymerase under stress conditions. This second hypothesis is supported by in vitro experiments showing that Rpb4p is required for Pol II activity at temperature extremes (10 and 35 °C) (8Rosenheck S. Choder M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This would imply that the growth pattern of rpb4 null mutants is due to a general Pol II defect but not to a modification of its regulatory properties.To settle the issue, we used the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approach and examined the protein expression profile of a rpb4 null mutant in response to various stress conditions. We show that this mutant is not impaired in stress induced transcriptional activation but is globally defective in Pol II activity at high temperatures. Our data suggest that a role of Rpb4p would be to maintain or stabilize Rpb7p in the enzyme.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrevious works have shown that the rpb4 null mutant strain (devoid of the fourth subunit of Pol II) is temperature-sensitive (14Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and does not express HSP26 andSSA3 mRNA under heat shock condition and when cells enter stationary phase (7Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) suggesting that the rpb4 nullstrain could be defective in general stress response. We used the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approach to analyze the expression of heat shock proteins in the wild type (SUB62) and rpb4 null (MC11) strains. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min at 24 °C or after a temperature shift from 24 to 38 °C, and protein extracts were subjected to comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The protein expression pattern of the two strains grown at 24 °C was identical (Fig. 1 A and not shown), indicating that there is no expression defect of rpb4 null strain at 24 °C. In contrast, the two-dimensional maps from the two heat shocked strains were very different. More than 50 heat shock proteins (for example, the aldehyde dehydrogenase Ald5p and the heat shock proteins Hsp82p and Hsp104p) were strongly induced in the wild type strain, and no significant induction was observed in the mutant (compare Fig. 1, B and C). This observation includes proteins whose expression is dependent on Hsf1p and Msn2/4p transcription factors known to be involved in heat shock response (31Boy-Marcotte E. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Bussereau F. Boudsocq A. Jacquet M. Labarre J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; (in press): 33PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the proteins usually repressed under heat shock conditions (for example the ribosomal proteins and translation factors like Yef3p) were no longer repressed in the mutant strain. These results extended previous results (7Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showing that the rpb4 null mutant strain is impaired in the global heat shock response.We then analyzed the response of rpb4 null mutant to oxidative stress, osmotic stress, and diauxic phase transition. When wild type cells were treated with 0.4 mmH2O2, more than 100 oxidative stress-responsive proteins were observed on two-dimensional gels as described previously (15Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). No defect in H2O2 response was evidenced in rpb4 null strain (Fig.2 A). For example, theTRR1-encoded thioredoxin reductase, theCCP1-encoded cytochrome c peroxidase, or YOL151W were similarly induced in both strains. Similarly, the osmotic stress response was identical in both the wild type and mutant strains (Fig.2 B). For example, enzymes of the glycerol biosynthesis pathway (glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase Gpd1p and glycerol phosphate phosphatases Gpp1p and Gpp2p), which are essential in the osmotic stress response (16Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were induced to the same level in both strains. Finally, there was no significant difference in protein expression between the two strains in post-diauxic phase condition (Fig.2 C): in both strains, the expression of the glycolytic enzymes such as Eno2p and Fba1p were shut down and enzymes involved in respiratory metabolism such as Ach1p and Mdh1p were normally induced. Moreover, stress proteins such as the glutathione reductase Glr1p and the catalase Ctt1p were similarly induced.Figure 2Comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins extracted from wild type andrpb4 strains in stress conditions. Autoradiograms of two-dimensional gels performed with total yeast35S-labeled extracts from wild type in standard condition (first column), wild type in stress condition (second column), and rpb4 in stress condition (third column). The standard condition is a log growth phase at 25 °C. Stress conditions were: oxidative stress (0.4 mmH2O2) (A), osmotic stress (0.7m NaCl) (B) and post-diauxic phase (C). For each condition, a representative region of the autoradiograms were blown up, and induced proteins were indicated by their name and an arrow. ACT1 was used as internal standard to normalize for the differences in labeling efficiency and loading on two-dimensional gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These results indicate that the rpb4 null strain, which is defective in heat shock response, is not impaired in other stress responses at 24 °C. To confirm this point, we tested whether the mutant showed a normal oxidative stress response at 38 °C. The cells were shifted from 24 to 38 °C and after 5 min were treated with 0.4 mm H2O2. When this treatment was applied to the wild type strain, a strong induction of both heat shock and oxidative stress proteins was observed. In sharp contrast, no induction of either the heat shock proteins or the oxidative stress proteins was evidenced in the rpb4 null mutant (data not shown). The fact that the oxidative stress response which was unaffected at 24 °C became defective at 38 °C suggested that the ability of the mutant to respond to stress was suppressed at high temperatures.We reasoned that a thermosensitive Pol II mutant would probably have a deficiency in heat shock response similar to the defect observed inrpb4 null strain. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the heat shock response of a well characterized Pol II mutant,rpb1-1 (strain RY 260), which affects the largest Pol II subunit and stops rapidly mRNA synthesis when shifted to 37 °C (9Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The relevant two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is shown in Fig.1 D. No heat shock protein was induced after the temperature shift, indicating that the defect in mRNA synthesis appears quickly after the shift to the restrictive temperature. Moreover, proteins like Yef3p, which are repressed in the wild type strain, were not repressed in rpb1–1 strain as in the case of the rpb4 nullstrain (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the protein expression pattern of the two pol II mutants rpb4 null and rpb1-1 under heat shock condition are strikingly similar, suggesting that rpb4 null mutant, like rpb1-1 has a general transcriptional defect at the restrictive temperature.A more direct method to test the functional defect of Pol II consists to analyze the in vivo Pol II activity after transfer to restrictive temperature. A mutant having a defective Pol II should present a rapid shutdown of mRNA synthesis after the shift leading to a decrease of mRNA levels (9Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We examined by Northern blot analysis, the level of three selected mRNAs (DED1,STE2, and ACT1) in rpb4 null mutant after a shift to 38 °C (Fig. 3). The experiment was standardized with 25 S rRNA, which is a Pol I transcript not immediately affected by a Pol II defect (9Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The results showed that DED1 and STE2 mRNAs decreased rapidly after the shift, consistent with their short half-lives (9Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar);ACT1 mRNA levels decreased more slowly with a deduced half-life of about 30 min. The rpb1-1 strain behaved similarly. In contrast, in the wild type control experiment, mRNA level decreased slightly 15 min after the temperature shift and resumed to the basal level after 1 h. Thus, the rapid decrease of these three individual mRNAs in the mutant strains demonstrates that these mRNAs are no longer synthesized after the temperature shift. This result can be extended to all mRNAs, since Choder and Young (7Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) analyzed total poly(A)+ RNA and showed that therpb4 null mutant rapidly ceases global mRNA synthesis after a shift to 37 °C. Altogether, these data showing arrest of individual and global mRNA synthesis demonstrate that it is the activity of Pol II that is temperature-sensitive in the rpb4 null mutant. This result is also consistent with experiments showing that Pol II activity of this mutant is temperature-sensitivein vitro (8Rosenheck S. Choder M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3Time course of mRNA depletion inrpb4 and rpb1-1 cells. Total RNA was extracted from wild type and mutant cultures at indicated times after a temperature shift from 24 to 38 °C, and equivalent amounts of total RNA were subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blot was hybridized first with a mixture of ACT1 and DED1 probes, second withSTE2 probe, and third with the 25 S probe. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dNTP by random priming procedure (see “Materials and Methods”). Hybridization with a 25 S rRNA32P-labeled probe served as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The rpb4 null mutant is not impaired in stress response, but has a Pol II defective at restrictive temperature. Usually, a mutation in an essential gene can generate a conditional defect in the function of the encoded protein. This general case is exemplified by therpb1-1 mutant. Paradoxically, in this work, the conditional defect of Pol II is due to the absence of a polymerase subunit. This defect can be due either to the heat inactivation of the polymerase or to the degradation of the polymerase devoid of Rpb4p when subjected to high temperature. This last possibility can be excluded, since after heat inactivation for 15 min, Pol II can regain full transcriptional activity in less than 10 min after the temperature is shifted back to 24 °C as demonstrated by the rapid recovery of DED1mRNA synthesis (data not shown). Rpb4p has then no role in preventing Pol II degradation but is probably required to prevent the inactivation of the enzyme or of one of its essential subunits. Rpb4p has been shown to interact with Rpb7p by biochemical and two-hybrid experiments (1Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6450-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Khazak V. Sadhale P.P. Woychik N.A. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 759-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, Edwards et al. (2Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Rpb7p subunit dissociated from Pol II when the polymerase was purified from rpb4 null extracts, suggesting that a role of Rpb4p is to stabilize Rpb7p in the Pol II. According to this hypothesis, at permissive temperature, Rpb7p would continue to interact weakly with Pol II in the absence of Rpb4p; at restrictive temperatures, the interaction between Rpb7p and Pol II would become too weak, leading to the dissociation of Rbp7p and to the inactivation of the enzyme. In that case, the overexpression of Rpb7p would compensate its weak interaction with the defective Pol II and rescue its activity. To examine this possibility, we overexpressed Rpb7p on a 2-μm plasmid in the rpb4 null strain and tested the temperature sensitivity of this strain (Fig. 4): whereas therpb4 null strain was unable to grow at 33 and 34 °C, its growth resumed at these temperatures when Rpb7p is overexpressed. The suppression was partial, since Rpb7p overexpression did not allow growth of rpb4 null strain at higher temperatures (data not shown). These data are consistent with a role for Rpb4p in the stabilization of Rpb7p-Pol II interactions. Thus, Rpb4p would play a structural role in maintaining Rpb7p in the complex. Functionally, Rpb4p may act as a specific chaperone for Pol II. However, whereas chaperones are generally induced by heat shock condition,RPB4 is neither induced in heat shock condition nor in any other stress conditions tested (18Moskvina E. Schuller C. Maurer C.T. Mager W.H. Ruis H. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Treger J.M. Schmitt A.P. Simon J.R. McEntee K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26875-26879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Figure 4Partial suppression of temperature-sensitive phenotype of rpb4 by overexpression of Rpb7p.Freshly grown cells were streaked on rich medium (YPD). Plates were incubated at 34 or 24 °C and monitored after 2 days (34 °C) or 4 days (24 °C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Due to its conditional defect in mRNA transcription, the rpb4 null mutant can be used, as rpb1-1, to measure mRNA half-lives (20Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Parker R. Herrick D. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deleting RPB4 gene in a specific genetic background is much easier and less time consuming than the construction of the rpb1-1 mutation. Moreover, since the heat inactivation of Pol II from rpb4 null mutant is reversible in vivo, the mutant could be an interesting tool to analyze the cellular response to environmental modifications in absence of Pol II transcription and then in absence of synthesis of responsive proteins. This type of analysis usually requires the use of transcriptional or translational inhibitors that may interfere with the cellular response investigated (20Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For example, we analyzed the sensitivity of rpb4 null strain to a severe heat shock (shift from 24 to 50 °C for 15 min) and found no significant difference with the wild type strain (TableI). In the same way, the mutant transferred to 38 °C is as resistant to oxidative stress (1 or 3 mm H2O2 for 1 h) as the wild type strain. These data indicate that the cell survival to these stresses is not dependent upon transcription and induction of stress proteins. Concerning heat shock, this conclusion is in agreement with previous results obtained with cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor (24De Virgilio C. Piper P. Boller T. Wiemken A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, in the case of oxidative stress, this finding seems inconsistent with the property of the strain deprived of the transcriptional factor Yap1p: this mutant is unable to induce a part of the H2O2 stimulon (25Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and is sensitive to H2O2 (26Schnell N. Krems B. Entian K.D. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas the rpb4 nullstrain, which is impaired in the induction of the entire stimulon, is not sensitive. This paradox could be explained knowing that the basal amount of proteins with antioxidant and protective functions (Ahp1p, Sod1p, Ssa1p, Trr1p, Tsa1p, Zwf1p) is lower in the yap1 nullmutant than in the wild type (27Lee D.H. Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4773-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the rpb4 null strains. We also examined if the rpb4 null strain is able to acquire resistance to high temperature by pretreatment with a mild heat shock (thermotolerance). As shown in Table I, this property of the wild type strain is partly impaired in the rpb4 null strain, indicating that full thermotolerance requires the synthesis of a new set of proteins. Accordingly, previous reports have demonstrated that the expression of one protein, Hsp104p, is essential in this process (28Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 29Lindquist S. Kim G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5301-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 30Elliott B. Haltiwanger R.S. Futcher B. Genetics. 1996; 144: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that a mild heat shock allowed wild type cells to survive to 3 mm H2O2 (23Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) but this adaptation property was lost in the mutant. Then, whereas resistance to H2O2 does not necessitate any transcriptional event, the process allowing cells to adapt to more severe oxidative stresses does require an adequate transcriptional response. This strongly suggests that the capacity of cells to survive stresses is mainly dependent upon the amount of protective proteins present in the cells before the stress and that the gene expression induced by the stress aims essentially at protecting the cells toward forseeable more adverse conditions.Table IResistance and adaptation of rpb4 null strain to heat shock and H2O2 stressPretreatment/Treatment (heat shock and H2O2 stress)aBefore the stress, cells were cultivated at 24 °C.

Two of them, Rpb4p and Rpb7p, are closely associated in a subcomplex denoted Rpb4/7 that can be dissociated from the polymerase under nondenaturing conditions or by mild urea treatment (1Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6450-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rpb4/7 is also lacking in Pol II enzymes purified from the rpo B1mutant (1Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Winsor B. Lacroute F. J. Biol.

To elucidate the insertion mechanism in vivo, the cellular factors that participate in this process must be characterized, and the pathway or sequence with which the polypeptide segments are inserted must be determined. Cellular factors have been identified that mediate protein insertion into the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum (1Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) suggests that aspects of the insertion mechanism are universal. Less is known about the insertion pathway of polytopic membrane proteins. In eukaryotes, a co-translational, sequential insertion pathway (10Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In support of this model, the insertion of transmembrane segments of polytopic membrane proteins has been shown to be mechanistically coupled to translation (13Borel A.C. Simon S.M.

However, other evidence contradicts this model. At least one eukaryotic polytopic membrane protein appears to insert post-translationally (18Mueckler M. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 44: 629-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and several others exhibit multiple topologies that may reflect a nonsequential insertion pathway (19Skach W.R.

In bacteria, it is not known whether insertion is co-translational and sequential or more closely resembles protein secretion, where translocation is independent from elongation (22Randall L.L.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) insertion mechanisms, but the issue remains controversial. Studies of the insertion pathway have been problematic for several reasons. First, methods used to monitor the membrane insertion of protein segments are not time-resolved. Significant time elapses between polypeptide translation and analysis of insertion by methods such as cross-linking (14Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) or proteolysis (16Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). During this time, polypeptides may rearrange to yield a topology that does not reflect the state of the polypeptides during insertion. Second, the topology of most polytopic proteins is poorly defined, making it difficult to interpret insertion studies unambiguously. Third, topological reporters commonly used to study insertion, such as fusion domains (27Traxler B. Lee C. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5339-5345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jander G. Cronan Jr., J.E. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3049-3058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or glycosylation sequences (21Ota K. Sakaguchi M. vonHeijne G. Hamasaki N. Katsuyoshi M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), may alter protein topology or insertion. Finally, the insertion pathway determined in vitro may differ from the in vivo pathway because of differences in the concentrations of SRP or secretory translocase subunits, the membrane potential, or ionic conditions. To examine the insertion pathway of a polytopic membrane proteinin vivo, we have studied bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a light-driven proton pump of known structure (29Lanyi J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31209-31212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) expressed in the sole membrane of the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum. BR contains a 248-amino acid polypeptide, bacterioopsin (BO), which forms seven transmembrane α-helices that surround a covalently bound retinal cofactor. The polypeptide is initially synthesized with a 13-amino acid presequence that is cleaved during biogenesis (30Seehra J.S. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4187-4193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have developed an in vivo assay of BO insertion and used it to characterize the translocation kinetics of the first extracellular domain of the protein. The assay monitors the translocation of engineered Cys residues in BO with a membrane-impermeant gel shift reagent specific for sulfhydryl groups. Comparison of the translocation time of Cys residues near the N terminus and the BO elongation time indicated that the N-terminal domain inserts co-translationally. These results establish the assay as a direct method to monitor the insertion of transmembrane segmentsin vivo and raise the possibility that the predominant pathway of polytopic membrane protein insertion is co-translational in all taxonomic domains. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies Inc., Taq polymerase and ligase from Promega (Madison, WI), and restriction endonucleases from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow was obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Redivue [35S]Met (>1,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and 4-acetamido-4′maleimidylstilbene-2–2′-disulfonic acid disodium salt (AMS) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mutations in bopwere constructed in Escherichia coli by polymerase chain reaction. To introduce a sequence encoding six His residues at the BO C terminus, the primers TGTTGAGCGACGCTGGAAAG and GGCGACGGCGCGGCCGCGCACCACCACCACCACCACTGATCGCACACGCAG were used (codon changes are underlined). The last three codons ofbop were removed by these changes. Constructs encoding Cys at amino acids 4 and 5 of mature BO were created with the primers GCGCGGATCCGACGTGAAGA and CCGGACGTCCGGTGCACTGGGCCTGCGATA or CCGGACGTCCGCAGATCTGGGCCTGCGATA. Restriction fragments derived from the polymerase chain reaction products were cloned in pMPK62 (31Krebs M.P. Mollaaghababa R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1987-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to yield bop genes encoding His-tagged BO with a single Cys near the N terminus. Recombinant H. salinarumstrains expressing the BR variants were created by targeted gene replacement (31Krebs M.P. Mollaaghababa R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1987-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The bop sequence of the recombinant strains was confirmed by fluorescent dye terminator cycle sequencing (ABI Prism, Foster City, CA). To induce BR synthesis, H. salinarum was cultured with illumination (32Krebs M.P. Li W. Halambeck T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in 120 ml of peptone medium for 2 days (33Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared, and BR levels were determined as described (34Krebs M.P. Hauss T. Heyn M.P. RajBhandary U.L. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) from the change in absorbance at 585 nm between light- and dark-adapted samples. BR levels were expressed as percentages of total cell protein determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). For spectral analysis, mutant proteins were purified (33Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) and scanned in 30 mm sodium phosphate, 0.025% sodium azide, pH 6.9, with a Perkin-Elmer λ2 spectrophotometer. Full-length His-tagged BO was purified from H. salinarum to >90% homogeneity by denaturing Ni2+ affinity chromatography at room temperature. Cultures (120 ml) were harvested at 8,000 ×g for 10 min at room temperature, and the pellet was resuspended in 1.2 ml of medium salts (33Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). A 25-μl aliquot was mixed with 1.0 ml of 60 units DNaseI/ml and 100 μg phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/ml (lysis solution) and incubated for ∼10 min. Samples were combined with 40 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and adjusted with buffer to a final concentration of 300 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.1% SDS in 1.4 ml. After incubation for 2 h, beads were sedimented and washed with 1 ml of 0.01% SDS, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 5 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted by incubating for 0.5 h with 50 mm imidazole, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), in Laemmli sample buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were recovered quantitatively, as determined by immunoblotting with BR-114 antibody provided by Dr. H. G. Khorana (data not shown). To establish the elongation time of His-tagged BO, cells were radiolabeled as described (36Sumper M. Herrmann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells cultured to induce BR were harvested, washed, resuspended in medium salts containing 0.5%l-Ala and shaken at 40 °C for 2.5 h with illumination (36Sumper M. Herrmann G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 89: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were then harvested and resuspended in 1100th volume medium salts containing 0.5% l-Ala. A 400-μl concentrated cell suspension was stirred at 37 °C in a glass vial exposed to >520 nm illumination. After 5 min, 160 μCi of [35S]Met was added (pulse) followed 20 s later by 400 μl of 10 mm nonradioactive Met in medium salts containing 0.5% l-Ala (chase). At various times, 50 μl of radiolabeled cells were combined with 1.0 ml of lysis solution to halt synthesis. Full-length His-tagged BO was recovered by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and electrophoresed on a 14% polyacrylamide gel (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar), which was stained with Coomassie and dried. Radioactivity in BO was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized by the intensity of the Coomassie-stained bands. The elongation rate was determined by fitting the elongation time course data with a step-wise function similar to that described (37Sørensen M.A. Kurland C.G. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The maximum extent of radiolabeling was estimated by averaging points in the plateau region. The data were fit with a function containing nine steps distributed according to the spacing of Met residues in BO, with an increase in radiolabeling of 19th the plateau value at each step. A constant elongation rate was assumed and was the only adjustable parameter. To correct for lags due to Met equilibration, the function was fit starting at 41 s (see below and “Results”). The elongation time was calculated by dividing the length of mature His-tagged BO, 251 amino acids, by the derived elongation rate. The 13-amino acid presequence is not observed by this approach, presumably due to its rapid cleavage during biogenesis. Consequently, radiolabeling of this region is not detected and is not included in the analysis. To determine the lag in radiolabeling due to uptake and equilibration of Met during the pulse and chase, cells were radiolabeled or pulse-chase radiolabeled with [35S]Met as above. At various times, aliquots were removed and added to 40 volumes of lysis solution. Total protein in 10 μl was precipitated onto filter paper with trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v). [35S]Met incorporation was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis, plotted as a function of time after the pulse and fit by linear regression. The lag in [35S]Met incorporation after the pulse is given by the x intercept of the fit to data from radiolabeled cells. The lag in incorporation of nonradioactive Met after the chase is given by the time between chase addition and the intersection of the curves fit to data from radiolabeled and pulse-chase radiolabeled cells. Elongation times were also determined by a method in which the lag times preceding steady-state radiolabeling of total cell protein and a specific protein are compared (38Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Cells were radiolabeled and lysed at various times after the pulse. The time course of [35S]Met incorporation into total cell protein and His-tagged BO was determined as in previous sections. Linear fits of the data yielded x intercepts that correspond to the lags preceding steady-state radiolabeling of total cell protein and His-tagged BO, respectively. The difference in the xintercepts equals ½ the elongation time of His-tagged BO. To measure translocation times, cells expressing mutant BR were pulse-chase radiolabeled as above, except 2 μl of 200 mm AMS in dimethyl sulfoxide were added to 400 μl of the cells 1 min before radiolabeling. At various times after the pulse, 50 μl of the cells were combined with 50 μl of 20 mm DTT, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C to complete elongation of the radiolabeled protein, and mixed with 1.0 ml of lysis solution. His-tagged protein was recovered and electrophoresed as above, except that a pH 7.5 separating gel was used, and gels were run for 21 h at 11 °C at 200 V on a 20-cm gel apparatus to maximize resolution. The derivatized protein was expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity in each lane and plotted as a function of time. These data were fit to the curve generated from fitting the elongation data, with a shift along the time axis as the only adjustable parameter. The magnitude of this shift is equal to the difference in the translocation and elongation times. The length of the polypeptide upon translocation of the Cys residue was estimated by subtracting the value of this shift from the elongation time and multiplying this difference by the elongation rate. The in vivo kinetic assay is designed to detect when a transmembrane segment inserts into the membrane relative to other events in the lifetime of a membrane protein. In the assay, insertion is monitored by the translocation of a unique extracellular Cys across the cytoplasmic membrane. Translocation is detected by derivatizing Cys with AMS, a membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent that shifts protein mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 40Joly J.C. Swartz J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10067-10072Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the membrane protein are preincubated in AMS and then radiolabeled to monitor nascent polypeptides (Fig. 1, I). At various times after radiolabeling, derivatization is quenched with a thiol reagent, DTT (Fig. 1, II). Samples are then incubated to complete elongation of the radiolabeled population, and the full-length protein is purified (Fig. 1, III). Derivatized and underivatized protein are separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified. By this approach, the fraction of the radiolabeled population in which Cys has been translocated may be determined as a function of time after translation is initiated. To assess whether insertion occurs co- or post-translationally, the translocation time course is compared with the elongation time course, measured independently by pulse-chase radiolabeling. To develop the assay, Cys was substituted for Ile4 or Thr5, located in the 8-amino acid extracellular domain at the N terminus of mature BO (41Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 393-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Translocation of this domain reports on the insertion of the adjacent transmembrane α-helix of mature BO, which includes residues 9–31. A hexahistidine tag was introduced at the C terminus of the wild-type and Cys mutant proteins for purification. The His-tagged Cys mutant proteins, I4C:H6and T5C:H6, were expressed in H. salinarum at significantly lower levels than wild-type BR but only slightly lower than BR:H6 (Table I). The proteins could be purified in a form similar to the wild-type purple membrane (33Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) and had normal spectral properties (Table I), indicating that they assemble normally and bind the retinal chromaphore.Table IExpression levels and spectral characteristics of wild-type and mutant BRExpression levelsaBR expression levels from 2-day-old cultures were determined by light-dark spectroscopy of crude cell lysates as described (34).

Dark-adapted, incubated for >8 h at room temperature in the dark; light-adapted, illuminated for 5 min with >520 nm light. Open table in a new tab To demonstrate the reactivity of the Cys residues, the mutant proteins were derivatized with AMS. A shift was observed with T5C:H6 (Fig.2 A) and I4C:H6(data not shown) but not BO:H6, which lacks Cys (Fig.2 A). The reaction of AMS with T5C:H6 in intact cells was complete in ∼10 s and was effectively quenched by DTT (Fig.2 B). Thus, AMS is sulfhydryl-specific and reacts rapidly. As the first step in establishing the translocation time of the N-terminal domain, AMS derivatization of T5C:H6 and I4C:H6 was measured at various times after radiolabeling according to the scheme in Fig. 1. Results are shown for T5C:H6 (Fig.3); similar results were obtained for I4C:H6 (data not shown). A substantial fraction of radiolabeled T5C:H6 was derivatized at the earliest time point, indicating that many of the nascent polypeptides are inserted at the start of the assay (Fig. 3 A). Derivatization increased to a plateau of ≥90% (Fig. 3 B), consistent with maturation of the nascent radiolabeled population. Several observations suggest that the appearance of derivatized protein at early times is not due to derivatization of nascent BO inside the cell. First, AMS is unlikely to cross the membrane because of its two negatively charged sulfonate groups. It has been used in other systems as a membrane impermeant reagent (42Lutsenko S. Daoud S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Second, translocation time courses similar to that in Fig. 3 B were obtained when the preincubation with AMS was extended by several minutes or when the reagent was added after pulse-chase radiolabeling (data not shown). Finally, different translocation time courses are observed with Cys located in other extracellular regions of the protein, arguing that AMS derivatization reflects Cys translocation. 2H. Dale and M. Krebs, unpublished results. To determine whether translocation of Cys residues near the N terminus occurs co- or post-translationally, we measured the BO elongation time by labeling cells with a short pulse of [35S]Met followed by a nonradioactive Met chase. The point at which incorporation of [35S]Met into full-length BO reaches a plateau, corrected for the lag in Met equilibration, reflects the elongation time of the protein. [35S]Met incorporation into T5C:H6is shown in Fig. 4 A; similar results were obtained with I4C:H6 and BO:H6(data not shown). A plot of the data, normalized for the total number of Met residues in the protein (Fig. 4 B, open circles), was fit with a curve that accounts for the distribution of Met in BO (Fig. 4 B, dashed line). Prior to fitting, the data were corrected for lags due to pulse and chase equilibration, which require 19 ± 3 and 22 ± 2 s, respectively (Fig. 4 C). From the curve, the average elongation rates and corresponding elongation times for I4C:H6 and T5C:H6 were found to be within ∼30% of BO:H6 (Table II). Although the source of this variation has not been identified, the effect on the calculation of translocated chain length is minimal (see below). The elongation values for I4C:H6 and T5C:H6 are in excellent agreement with those obtained by an independent method (Table II, column 3), indicating that the difference in rates and the corrections made for Met equilibration are valid.Table IITranslocation and elongation times of mutant BRTranslocation timeElongation timeaElongation time and rate were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 4.Elongation timebElongation time was determined by the difference in the lag times of [35S]Met incorporation into total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein and full-length BO.Elongation rateaElongation time and rate were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 4.Translocated chain lengthsssaa/saaBR:H6129 ± 52.0 ± 0.1I4C:H646 ± 9114 ± 26120 ± 32.3 ± 0.6102 ± 4T5C:H661 ± 6169 ± 16167 ± 311.5 ± 0.192 ± 12Values reported are the average of 2–5 experiments.a Elongation time and rate were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 4.b Elongation time was determined by the difference in the lag times of [35S]Met incorporation into total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein and full-length BO.

Magasanik B. Resnikoff W.K. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar)). To determine whether the BO elongation rate was atypical, the elongation rates of several prominent radiolabeled proteins in cell lysates (M r = ∼24–57 kDa) were measured by the pulse-chase radiolabeling method used for BO. Elongation rates from 1.3 to 5.5 amino acids/s were obtained (data not shown), indicating that translation is relatively slow in H. salinarum and that BO translation is not unusual. Translocation and elongation data were compared to determine when the T5C:H6 N-terminal domain translocates relative to synthesis of the full-length protein (Fig. 4 B,closed circles). Strikingly, Cys translocation occurs significantly before elongation; similar results were obtained for I4C:H6. Thus, translocation of the N-terminal extracellular domain and insertion of the first transmembrane α-helix of BO occur co-translationally in H. salinarum. The translocation and elongation data were used to estimate the length of the polypeptide upon translocation of the Cys residue. Because both data sets reflect BO maturation, they were fit by similar curves, except that the fit of the translocation data was displaced along the time axis. The fits of the translocation and elongation data for T5C:H6 are shown in Fig. 4 B; similar analysis was applied to I4C:H6. By this analysis, translocation of the Cys residue in T5C:H6 occurs more than 70 s before elongation is complete (Table II, columns 1 and 2). Multiplying the time required for translocation by the average elongation rate (TableII), the length of the T5C:H6 polypeptide upon translocation of the Cys residue was calculated to be 92 ± 12 amino acids, assuming that the polypeptide is translated at a uniform rate. A similar result was obtained for I4C:H6 (Table II). Notably, even though the elongation rates differ, the calculated translocated chain length agrees. Correcting for the ∼10 s required for complete derivatization (Fig. 2 B), the calculated chain length upon translocation of the Cys residue in T5C:H6 is 77 ± 12 amino acids. We have developed a kinetic assay to monitor the membrane insertion of polytopic proteins and used it to demonstrate that the first transmembrane segment of BO inserts into the H. salinarum membrane co-translationally. To our knowledge, the insertion kinetics of a polytopic membrane protein have not been established in vivo in any other organism. The assay was feasible because the H. salinarum membrane is accessible to the external environment, AMS reacts with translocated Cys very rapidly, and BO translation is sufficiently slow to resolve translocation events. Although H. salinarum is ideal for this approach, it may be possible to apply the method to other prokaryotes in which the cytoplasmic membrane is accessible and translation is slow. Examination of other Cys substitutions in BO with this assay will be invaluable for determining the complete insertion pathway of this protein. Our results suggest that the insertion pathway of an archaeal polytopic membrane protein is similar to the co-translational pathway proposed for eukaryotic polytopic proteins (10Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 11Singer S.J. Maher P.A. Yaffe M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this pathway, ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides must reach a length of ∼70 amino acids to traverse the membrane (47Matlack K.E. Walter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6170-6180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 48Crowley K.S. Liao S. Worrell V.E. Reinhart G.D. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A similar length of 77 ± 12 amino acids is synthesized in T5C:H6 before the Cys residue is translocated, suggesting that ribosomes synthesizing BO are in close proximity to the membrane. The similarity between the membrane insertion of archaeal and eukaryotic proteins may reflect the conservation of “information pathways” such as transcription and translation in archaea and eukaryotes (49Brown J.R. Doolittle W.F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 456-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). These results, together with evidence of co-translational insertion in bacteria (4Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12451-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Lentzen G.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), raise the possibility that the predominant mode of polytopic membrane protein insertion is co-translational in all three taxonomic domains. The finding that translocation of the BO N terminus is coupled to translation has important implications for understanding BR folding. Because the N-terminal transmembrane segment is the first region of the mature protein to achieve a transmembrane configuration, it may interact with other regions of BO to promote their folding within the membrane. Recent evidence that the first two helices of BO facilitate the folding of the remaining helices supports this idea (50Lüneberg J. Widmann M. Dathe M. Marti T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28822-28830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Co-translational insertion of the first transmembrane segment may nucleate folding of the remaining transmembrane segments and must be considered in studies of BO folding in vitro. Co-translational translocation of the BO N terminus is consistent with both a translocase-dependent mechanism, in which protein factors within the lipid bilayer mediate insertion (10Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 11Singer S.J. Maher P.A. Yaffe M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and a spontaneous mechanism, in which no such factors are involved (51Wickner W.T. Lodish H.F.

Although our results do not distinguish between these possibilities, we propose that BO insertion is mediated by SRP and the secretory translocase, as has been demonstrated for eukaryotic and bacterial membrane proteins. This is reasonable, given that H. salinarum SRP is implicated in BO biogenesis (53Gropp R. Gropp F. Betlach M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1204-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that homologs of secretory translocase subunits exist in several archaea (9Pohlschroder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J.

Mutations in gene 59 disrupt this pathway, causing arrested DNA synthesis leading to reduced phage burst size (2Cunningham R.P. Berger H. Virology. 1977; 80: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

Alberts, manuscript in preparation. gp59 is a basic (pI = 10.18) 26-kDa protein with intrinsic binding activity toward single-stranded DNA.

Lefebvre, M. L. Wong, and S. W. Morrical, unpublished results. have established that gp59 exists predominantly as a monomer in solution. The oligomeric structure of gp59 in its ssDNA-bound state is currently unknown. However, Lefebvre and Morrical (14Lefebvre S.D. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) rigorously characterized the thermodynamics of gp59 interactions with single-stranded polynucleotides including native ssDNA and demonstrated that gp59 exhibits at least two distinct ssDNA-binding modes dependent on salt and/or lattice effects. One of these modes is characterized by extremely high cooperativity (ω ≈ 2500) but occurs at relatively low salt concentrations (14Lefebvre S.D. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moderate to low cooperativity is seen at higher salt. These results indicate that gp59 is capable of forming clusters on ssDNA. gp59 binds to all single-stranded polynucleotides with a binding site size of n = 9–10 nucleotide residues (14Lefebvre S.D. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition to its interactions with gp41 and ssDNA, gp59 exhibits very strong protein-protein interactions with gp32 (5Barry J.E. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morrical S.W. Hempstead K. Morrical M.D. J. Biol.

Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that gp59 interacts specifically with determinants in the acidic, C-terminal “A-domain” of gp32 and that the assembly of gp41 onto gp32-ssDNA complexes requires direct contacts between gp59 molecules and the A-domains of ssDNA-bound gp32 molecules (8Morrical S.W. Beernink H.T.H. Dash A. Hempstead K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20198-20207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These and other observations suggested a model of gp59 action in which a gp59-gp32-ssDNA complex of defined structure and stoichiometry serves as an obligatory intermediate in the gp59-dependent helicase assembly pathway. In addition to its structure and stoichiometry, several important questions about the gp59-gp32-ssDNA intermediate remain unresolved, including the following. Do both proteins contact the ssDNA or is one maintained solely through protein-protein interactions? As a corollary to this question, how do gp59 and gp32 affect the ssDNA-binding properties of each other? A key result obtained by Morrical et al. (8Morrical S.W. Beernink H.T.H. Dash A. Hempstead K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20198-20207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was that ssDNA molecules saturated with gp32-A, a truncated form of gp32 lacking the A-domain, are completely refractory to helicase assembly, even in the presence of gp59. One possible explanation for this result is that gp59 maintains contact with gp32-ssDNA complexes solely through protein-protein interactions with gp32. This would predict that gp59 is incapable of binding to (gp32-A)-saturated complexes. Alternatively, gp59 may bind to (gp32-A)-ssDNA complexes via contacts with the ssDNA itself but fails to load helicase due to the absence of essential gp59-gp32 contacts. To address these alternative models, we have investigated the interactions of gp59 with both gp32-ssDNA and (gp32-A)-ssDNA complexes and with ssDNA in the presence of the isolated A-domain fragment of gp32. By using methods including ssDNA-cellulose affinity chromatography, εDNA fluorescence enhancement, hydroxy radical protection, and electron microscopy, we find the following: (i) gp59 is able to co-occupy ssDNA pre-saturated with either gp32 or gp32-A; (ii) gp59 destabilizes both gp32-ssDNA and (gp32-A)-ssDNA interactions; (iii) interactions of gp59 with the A-domain of gp32 alter the ssDNA-binding properties of gp59; and (iv) gp59 organizes gp32-ssDNA versus (gp32-A)-ssDNA into morphologically distinct complexes. Our results support a model in which gp59-gp32 interactions are non-essential for the co-occupancy of both proteins on ssDNA but are essential for the formation of structures competent for helicase assembly. The data argue that specific “cross-talk” between gp59 and gp32, involving conformational changes in both, is a key feature of the gp41 helicase assembly pathway. Chemicals, biochemicals, and commercial enzymes were purchased from Sigma unless specifically noted in the text. All reagents were analytical grade, and solutions were made with de-ionized, glass-distilled water. Radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Single-stranded DNA cellulose affinity resin was prepared according to the procedure of Alberts and Herrick (15Alberts B.M. Herrick G.

The concentration of 60-mer was determined by the absorbance at 260 nm using a conversion factor of 36 μg/ml/A 260. The 60-mer was 5′-end-labeled with32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Circular single-stranded DNA from the bacteriophage M13mp19 was isolated by extraction from purified phage particles (17Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Benzinger R. Lawhorne L. Trieber G.

Poly(dA) (average chain length = 300 nucleotide residues) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The concentrations of both M13mp19 ssDNA and poly(dA) were determined by phosphate analysis (14Lefebvre S.D. Morrical S.W. J. Mol.

All ssDNA concentrations are expressed in units of micromoles of nucleotide residues per liter. A portion of the M13mp19 ssDNA was used to make etheno-DNA (εDNA) by modification with chloroacetaldehyde (obtained from Aldrich) according to the method of Menestski and Kowalczykowski (20Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6066-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The integrity of the εDNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The εDNA had a slightly reduced electrophoretic mobility compared with unmodified M13mp19 ssDNA, consistent with previous reports (14Lefebvre S.D. Morrical S.W. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to detect simultaneous binding of gp32 species and either gp59 or UvsY proteins to ssDNA. For each experiment, 50 μl (bed volume) of ssDNA-cellulose pre-equilibrated in DC-100 was placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. All subsequent protein addition, equilibration, washing, and elution steps were carried out batch style at 25 °C. Each batch step involved the addition of a 1.0-ml volume of solution to the 50 μl of resin, except where otherwise noted. The resin was resuspended gently and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min while the tube was gently rocked. The suspension was then spun for 3 min at 2000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, after which the supernatant was removed. This sequence of resuspension, equilibration, and centrifugation was repeated for each batch step. The ssDNA-cellulose used in these experiments contained 1.0 mg of immobilized, denatured salmon sperm DNA per ml of bed volume, as determined by the recovery of DNA from boiled samples (15Alberts B.M. Herrick G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 198-217Crossref Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The binding capacity of the ssDNA-cellulose was determined independently for the gp59, gp32, and gp32-A protein species. This procedure involved repeated batch style equilibrations of the resin with a saturating amount of protein in DC-100, followed by two DC-100 wash steps to remove unbound protein, followed in turn by elution of the bound protein with DC-2000. The amount of protein present in the high salt (DC-2000) supernatant was quantitated by the Bradford assay and was used to calculate the binding capacity. By using this method we determined that the ssDNA-cellulose used in these studies had approximately equal binding capacities for gp59, gp32, and gp32-A; the resin retained approximately 10 mg of each protein per ml of bed volume at saturation (see Table I, part A, and “Results”), consistent with previous results (8Morrical S.W.

Open table in a new tab Next, the salt elution properties of each protein species were tested, either alone or in a ternary complex. Protein (1.0 mg of gp59, gp32, gp32-A, or A-domain in 1.0 ml of DC-100) was equilibrated with resin as described above; the resin was washed with 2 × 1.0 ml of DC-100, and the supernatants were tested for protein content by the Bradford assay to determine the quantity of protein bound. In the ternary reactions containing gp59 plus either gp32 or gp32-A, the proteins were added to the resin, equilibrated, and washed sequentially, with the gp32 species being added first. In the ternary reactions containing gp59 plus the A-domain fragment of gp32, the two protein species were preincubated together in solution and then added to the resin simultaneously. The amount of protein bound was determined after the addition of each protein species by measuring the protein content of supernatants by the Bradford assay and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After preincubation and two washing steps with DC-100, proteins were eluted from the resin by successive washes with DC-200, DC-600, and DC-2000 buffers, respectively. Each salt elution step consisted of three 400-μl batch style washes with the same buffer. The three supernatants from each salt step were combined and analyzed for protein content by Bradford assay and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following each experiment the ssDNA-cellulose resin was treated with DNase I according to the method of Kowalczykowskiet al. (23Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol.

Cet1p consists of three domains as follows: (i) a 230-amino acid N-terminal segment that is dispensable for catalysis in vitro and for Cet1p function in vivo; (ii) a protease-sensitive segment from residues 230 to 275 that is dispensable for catalysis but essential for Cet1p function in vivo; and (iii) a catalytic domain from residues 275 to 539. Sedimentation analysis indicates that purified Cet1(231–549)p is a homodimer. Cet1(231–549)p binds in vitro to the yeast RNA guanylyltransferase Ceg1p to form a 7.1 S complex that we surmise to be a trimer consisting of two molecules of Cet1(231–549)p and one molecule of Ceg1p. The more extensively truncated protein Cet1(276–549)p, which cannot support cell growth, sediments as a monomer and does not interact with Ceg1p. An intermediate deletion protein Cet1(246–549)p, which supports cell growth only when overexpressed, sediments principally as a discrete salt-stable 11.5 S homo-oligomeric complex. These data implicate the segment of Ceg1p from residues 230 to 275 in regulating self-association and in binding to Ceg1p. Genetic data support the existence of a Ceg1p-binding domain flanking the catalytic domain of Cet1p, to wit: (i) the ts growth phenotype of 2μCET1(246–549) is suppressed by overexpression of Ceg1p; (ii) a ts alanine cluster mutationCET1(201–549)/K250A-W251A is suppressed by overexpression of Ceg1p; and (iii) 15 othercet-ts alleles with missense changes mapping elsewhere in the protein are not suppressed by Ceg1p overexpression. Finally, we show that the in vivo function of Cet1(275–549)p is completely restored by fusion to the guanylyltransferase domain of the mouse capping enzyme. We hypothesize that the need for Ceg1p binding by yeast RNA triphosphatase can by bypassed when the triphosphatase catalytic domain is delivered to the RNA polymerase II elongation complex by linkage in cis to the mammalian guanylyltransferase.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA 5′-triphosphatase Cet1p is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the first step of mRNA cap formation: the hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of triphosphate-terminated pre-mRNA to form a diphosphate end that serves as the substrate for capping by RNA guanylyltransferase (1Tsukamoto T.

Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cet1p is the prototype of a newly identified family of divalent cation-dependent nucleoside triphosphatases that includes the RNA 5′-triphosphatases encoded by two families of DNA viruses, poxviruses and baculoviruses (3Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The enzyme family is defined by the presence of three conserved collinear motifs (A, B, and C) that include clusters of acidic and basic amino acids essential for triphosphatase activity (3Ho C.K.

Motifs A–C of yeast Cet1p are located within the C-terminal half of the 549-amino acid protein (Fig. 1 A). The N-terminal 200-amino acid segment of Cet1p is dispensable for catalytic activity in vitro (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the NΔ200 alleleCET1(201–549) is fully capable of supporting yeast cell growth (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fungi and mammals have evolved different strategies to assemble bifunctional capping enzymes with triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities. In S. cerevisiae, separately encoded triphosphatase (Cet1p) and guanylyltransferase (Ceg1p) proteins interact to form a heteromeric complex (1Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Murakoshi T.

Genetic evidence suggests that the physical linkage of the mammalian triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase domains is essential in vivo. For example, a lethal yeast cet1 deletion can be complemented by expression of MCE1 but only if the catalytically active mouse triphosphatase domain is linked incis to a catalytically active guanylyltransferase domain (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12Yamada-Okabe T. Doi R. Shimmi O. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1700-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our isolation of CET1 in a genetic screen for high copy suppressors of temperature-sensitive mutations of Ceg1p suggested that interaction of the endogenous yeast triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase in trans may also be essential in vivo (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although analyses of the spectrum of ceg1-tsmutations that could be suppressed by Cet1p overexpression showed clustering of such lesions within a C-terminal domain of Ceg1p (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cho E. Rodriguez C.R. Takagi T. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3482-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), there is, as yet, no physical identification of a Cet1p-binding site on Ceg1p. A variety of qualitative methods have been employed to document Cet1p-Ceg1p interaction in vivo (by yeast two-hybrid reporter assay) or in vitro (far Western blotting or co-immunoprecipitation/Western blotting) (1Tsukamoto T.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A drawback of these studies is that they provide limited insight into the nature of the complexes formed, and the results have not been integrated with a genetic assessment of the function of a presumptive Ceg1p-binding site on Cet1p. Our approach has been to study the interaction of purified recombinant Cet1p with purified recombinant Ceg1p by zonal velocity sedimentation (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, the purity and concentration of the input proteins, as well as the extent of complex formation (manifest as a shift in the sedimentation peaks), are apparent from the gradient profiles. Moreover, the native size of the Cet1p-Ceg1p complexes can be gauged from the sedimentation behavior. We have shown (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the N-terminal deletion mutant Cet1(201–549)p forms a discrete complex with Ceg1p, in near quantitative yield, that is stable to centrifugation in a glycerol gradient. Thus, the catalytic domain and the Ceg1p-binding site reside within Cet1(201–549)p, which is fully functional in vivo. Here we present further physical and genetic analysis of the yeast RNA triphosphatase that includes the following: (i) delineation of a domain structure of Cet1(201–549)p by limited proteolysis; (ii) definition by serial N- and C-terminal deletions of Cet1(241–539)p as a minimum functional domain sufficient for cell growth at 25–37 °C; (iii) physical characterization of the Cet1p N-terminal deletion mutants and their complexes with Ceg1p; (iv) demonstration of suppression of the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of the deletion mutantCET1(246–549) by overexpression of Ceg1p; (v) characterization of a lethal deletion mutant,CET1(276–549), which encodes a monomeric enzyme with full catalytic activity that is unable to interact with Ceg1p; and (vi) restoration of the in vivo function of Cet1(276–549)p by fusion in cis with the guanylyltransferase domain of the mouse capping enzyme. Our results suggest that a protease-sensitive segment of Cet1p located proximal to the core catalytic domain regulates both Cet1p-Cet1p self-association and heteromerization with Ceg1p. A series of N-terminal deletion mutants of CET1 was constructed by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid amplification with mutagenic sense-strand primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codons for Glu210, Asn220, Asn230, Lys240, and Ile275. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into yeast plasmid pCET1–5′3′ (CEN TRP1) (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutated genes were named according to the amino acid coordinates of their polypeptide products, i.e. CET1(211–549),CET1(221–549),CET1(231–549),CET1(241–549), andCET1(276–549). C-terminal truncation mutantsCET1(201–539) andCET1(201–529) were constructed by PCR amplification using antisense primers that introduced translation stop codons in lieu of the codons for Glu540 and Ile530 and BamHI sites immediately 3′ of the new stop codons. The PCR products were digested with NdeI andBamHI and then inserted into pCET1–5′3′. Expression of the deleted alleles in these plasmids is under the control of the naturalCET1 promoter. Restriction fragments containing CET1, CET1(201–549),CET1(246–549), andCET1(276–549) were excised from the respective pCET1–5′3′-based plasmids and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYX232 (2μ TRP1). In the resulting plasmids, expression of the yeast RNA triphosphatase is under the control of the yeast TPI1 promoter. The NdeI/BamHI fragments encoding Cet1(201–549)p, Cet1(211–549)p, Cet1(221–549)p, Cet1(231–549)p, Cet1(241–549)p, Cet1(246–549)p, and Cet1(276–549)p were excised from their respective pCET1–5′3′ plasmids and inserted into pET16b to generate plasmids pET-CET1(201–549), pET-CET1(211–549), pET-CET1(221–549), pET-CET1(231–549), pET-CET1(241–549), pET-CET1(246–549), and pET-CET1(276–549). Induced expression of the His-tagged truncated Cet1 proteins was performed as described (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by Ni2+-agarose column chromatography (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polypeptide compositions of the imidazole eluate fractions were monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The fractions containing recombinant Cet1p protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100). Protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The enzyme preparations were stored at −80 °C. TheCEG1 gene was inserted into a customized T7-based expression plasmid (a derivative of pET16b) in such a way as to fuse the 459-amino acid CEG1-coding sequence in frame to an N-terminal 29-amino acid leader peptide containing 10 consecutive histidine codons sequence (MGSHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEGRHSRRASVH). The plasmid was transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3). A 500-ml culture was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until theA 600 reached 0.6. The culture was adjusted to 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% ethanol and then incubation was continued for 21 h at 17 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml; the suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min and then sonicated for 30 s. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and sonication was repeated to reduce the viscosity of the lysate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 18,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble extract was applied to a 2-ml column of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 5 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glucose, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. Ceg1p was retained on the Ni2+-agarose column and recovered in the 0.2 mimidazole eluate. The 0.2 m imidazole fraction was dialyzed against buffer C. The Ceg1p enzyme preparation was stored at −80 °C. Aliquots of the Ni2+-agarose preparations of truncated Cet1p proteins (typically ∼30 μg) were mixed with catalase (25 μg), BSA (25 μg), and cytochrome c (25 μg) in 0.2 ml of buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100). Where indicated, the mixtures also included recombinant Ceg1p (∼30 μg). The mixtures were incubated on ice for 45 min and then layered onto a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient containing buffer G. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW50 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected from the bottoms of the tubes. Aliquots (20 μl) of odd-numbered fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE along with samples of the input protein mixtures for each gradient. Polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue dye. Strain YBS20 (MATatrp1 his3 ura3 leu2 ade2 can1 cet1::LEU2 p360-CET1) is deleted at the chromosomal locus encoding RNA triphosphatase. Growth of YBS20 depends on maintenance of plasmid p360-CET1 (CEN URA3 CET1). Strain YBS50 (MAT a leu2 ade2 trp1 his3 ura3 can1 ceg1::hisG cet1::LEU2p360-CET1/CEG1) is deleted at the chromosomal loci encoding RNA triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase. Growth of YBS50 is contingent on the maintenance of plasmid p360-CET1/CEG1 (CEN URA3 CET1 CEG1), which contains the CEG1 and CET1genes under the control of their natural promoters. The CET1 gene was amplified in vitro by Taq DNA polymerase. The standard PCR reaction mixture was modified to contain either (i) a reduced concentration of dATP (0.08 mm) relative to the other three dNTPs (each at 2 mm); (ii) 0.08 mmdATP plus 0.2 mm manganese chloride; or (iii) 2 mm dATP plus 0.2 mm manganese chloride. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI. The mutagenized CET1 DNA fragments from 10 separate PCR reactions (4 using PCR reaction condition i, and 3 each using conditions ii and iii) were ligated separately into pCET1–5′3′, and the ligation mixtures were transformed into E. coli. After amplification in vivo, 10 pooled plasmid libraries were prepared, each from approximately 3,000 ampicillin-resistant colonies harvested directly from the agar plates. These DNA libraries were transformed into yeast strain YBS20. Trp+ transformants (150 for each transformed pool) were patched on agar medium lacking tryptophan at 30 °C and then replica-plated on 5-FOA medium at 30 °C to eliminate the wild type CET1 allele on aCEN URA3 plasmid. Six to fifteen percent of the transformants were unable to grow on 5-FOA. The surviving isolates, which had lost the CET1 URA3 plasmid, were replica-plated on YPD agar and incubated at 30 °C (permissive temperature) and 37 °C (nonpermissive temperature). Those able to grow at 30 but not 37 °C were selected. Plasmid DNA was recovered from candidatets mutants, amplified in vivo in E. coli, and retested for the conditional growth phenotype by plasmid shuffle. In this way, we obtained a collection of cet1-tsmutants. Fifteen of these mutant cet1 clones were mapped at the nucleotide level by DNA sequencing. The completeC. albicans open reading frame encoding the 520-amino acid RNA triphosphatase CaCet1p (15Yamada-Okabe T. Mio T. Matsui M. Kashima Y. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from a C. albicans DNA library (16Janbon G. Rustchenko E.P. Klug S. Scherer S. Sherman F. Yeast. 1997; 10: 985-990Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) using a sense primer that introduced anNdeI site at the translation start codon and an antisense primer that introduced a BamHI site immediately 3′ of the translation stop codon. The PCR product was digested withNdeI and BamHI and then inserted into a customized yeast expression vector pYN132 (CEN TRP1), a derivative of pYX132 in which a unique NdeI site replaced the NcoI site of pYX132. The resulting plasmid was named pCaCet1(1–520). N-terminal deletion mutants of CaCET1 were constructed by PCR amplification with mutagenic sense-strand primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codon for Asp178, Gln195, Tyr202, or Asn216. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and then inserted into pYN132 to yield plasmids pCaCet1(179–520), pCaCet1(196–520), pCaCet1(203–520), and pCaCet1(217–520). In these vectors, expression of the C. albicans polypeptide is under the control of theTPI1 promoter. Genes encoding fusion proteins composed of an N-terminal segment derived from yeast Cet1p and the catalytically active C-terminal guanylyltransferase domain of the mouse capping enzyme [Mce1(211–597)p] were constructed as follows. The CET1 coding sequences from residues 201–549, 275–549, and 301–549 were PCR-amplified using the respective pET-based CET1 plasmids as templates and an antisense primer that changed Val548 to His and introduced an NdeI restriction site at the C-terminal dipeptide His548–Met549. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and then inserted into the NdeI site of pYX1-MCE1(211–597) (CEN TRP1) to yield in-frame fusion genesCET1(201–547)-MCE1(211–597),CET1(276–547)-MCE1(211–597), andCET1(301–547)-MCE1(211–597). Expression of the chimeric genes in these plasmids is under the control of the TPI1 promoter. Recombinant Cet1(201–549)p containing a short N-terminal His tag was subjected to proteolysis with increasing concentrations of chymotrypsin, trypsin, and V8 proteases (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE analysis of the undigested protein preparation revealed a 44-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 2 A) corresponding to His-tagged Cet1(201–549)p (predicted size of 43 kDa). Sequencing of this species by automated Edman chemistry after transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane confirmed that the N-terminal sequence (GHHHHH) corresponded to that of the recombinant protein beginning from the second residue of the His tag. Apparently, the triphosphatase suffered removal of the initiating methionine during expression in E. coli. Initial scission of Cet1(201–549)p at low concentrations of chymotrypsin yielded a predominant ∼39-kDa species with N-terminal sequence RNVPIW resulting from chymotryptic cleavage at Tyr241/Arg242 (Fig. 2 A). At 2-fold higher protease concentration, this species was converted to an ∼36-kDa polypeptide with N-terminal sequence QSINVK, arising via cleavage at Leu258/Gln259 (Fig. 2 A). Even higher chymotrypsin concentrations yielded two major products, a ∼26-kDa polypeptide with its N terminus at Gln259 and a ∼12-kDa fragment with N-terminal sequence KSQSPI resulting from scission at Tyr445/Lys446 (Fig. 2 A). These two species persisted at the highest levels of chymotrypsin tested (8-fold greater than the amount sufficient to cleave all of the input protein at least once), although some of the protein was digested to a mixed cluster of low molecular fragments. One of these fragments retained an N terminus at Gln259, whereas two novel fragments were generated via cleavage at Tyr380/Arg381 (RVGLST) or Tyr461/Ile462 (IHNDSXT). The evolution of the digestion pattern with increasing protease concentration suggested the sequence of chymotryptic cleavages diagrammed in Fig. 1 B. The key point here is that the principal chymotrypsin-accessible sites (Tyr241 and Leu258) are located in the N-terminal portion of Cet1(201–549)p. Initial scission by V8 protease occurred between Glu231 and Ile232 to yield a ∼39-kDa polypeptide with N-terminal sequence ISASSK (Fig. 2 C). At higher V8 concentrations, this fragment was converted transiently to a ∼32-kDa species with the same N terminus (Fig. 2 C). Even higher levels of V8 led to the transient appearance of a ∼26-kDa fragment with N-terminal sequence LDAHLT via scission at Glu334/Leu335 (Fig. 2 C). Also arising was a ∼12-kDa species with N-terminal residue Ile232; this fragment was presumably generated when the larger precursor was cleaved at Glu334. This 12-kDa species persisted at the highest V8 levels tested, whereas the 26-kDa fragment originating at Leu335 was converted into an ∼19-kDa species with the same N terminus (Fig. 2 C). Initial cleavage by trypsin yielded a large fragment retaining the N-terminal His tag (Fig. 2 B). At the highest level of trypsin tested, the protein was converted to a stable ∼27-kDa doublet arising via closely spaced cleavages at Lys256/Ala257 (leaving N-terminal sequence ALQSIN) and Lys264/Asp265 (sequence DLKIDP) (Fig. 2 B). The experimentally determined protease cleavage sites within Cet1(201–549)p are annotated on the primary structure in Fig.1 A. The instructive point of this analysis is that the principal or prominent sites of accessibility to all three proteases are clustered within a short polypeptide segment from Glu231 to Lys264. We infer that this segment is either disordered or surface-exposed. In contrast, the distal portion of the protein is relatively protease-insensitive and likely to comprise a folded domain. We reported previously that expression of the truncated derivative Cet1p(201–549)p on a single copy plasmid under the control of the natural CET1 promoter fully complemented the growth of a Δcet1 deletion strain ofS. cerevisiae, whereas expression of the more extensively truncated derivatives Cet1(246–549)p and Cet1(301–549)p did not complement (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the proteolysis results suggesting a domain boundary downstream of residue 201, we constructed a series of finer N-terminal deletion alleles as follows:CET1(211–549),CET1(221–549),CET1(231–549), andCET1(241–549). The margins of the latter two alleles were placed at Glu231 and Tyr241, the residues that were cleaved by V8 and chymotrypsin, respectively. The deleted genes were cloned into a CEN TRP1 vector so as to place them under the control of the CET1 promoter. These plasmids were transformed into a Δcet1 strain YBS20, in which the chromosomal CET1 locus has been deleted and replaced by LEU2. Growth of YBS20 is contingent on the maintenance of a wild type CET1 allele on a CEN URA3 plasmid. Hence, YBS20 is unable to grow on agar medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) unless it is transformed with a biologically active CET1 allele such asCET1(201–549) (Fig.3 A; Δ200) or a functional homologue from another organism (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that growth on 5-FOA was complemented by CET1(211–549),CET1(221–549),CET1(231–549), andCET1(241–549)(Fig. 3, Δ210, Δ220, Δ230, and Δ240), but not by the more extensively truncated alleles CET1(246–549) orCET1(276–549) (Fig. 3 B,Δ245 and Δ275). This experiment delineates a short peptide segment between residues 241 and 245 that is required for Cet1p function in vivo when the triphosphatase is expressed from its own promoter. Previously, we showed that deletion of 30 or 60 amino acids from the C terminus of Cet1p resulted in loss of function in vivo(2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we tested by plasmid shuffle a finer series of C-terminal truncation mutants and found that CET1(201–539) complemented growth of YBS20 on 5-FOA, whereasCET1(201–529) did not (data not shown). A mutant allele, CET1(241–539), in which both termini were truncated to their respective functional boundaries, also complemented Δcet1 (data not shown). The N-terminal deletion mutants of Cet1p were expressed in bacteria as His-tagged fusions and purified from soluble lysates by Ni2+-agarose column chromatography (Fig.4 A). Triphosphatase activity was determined by assaying manganese-dependent ATP hydrolysis (3Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as a function of input enzyme. The specific activities of Cet1(211–549)p, Cet1(221–549)p, Cet1(231–549)p, and Cet1(241–549)p were comparable to that of Cet1(201–549)p (Fig. 4 B). This was in keeping with the expectation that any Cet1p derivatives that were active in vivo should retain catalytic activity in vitro. Note that Cet1(246–549)p, which did not complement Δcet1 growth, was also active in vitro (Fig.4 B). The instructive finding was that Cet1(276–549)p also retained full triphosphatase function in vitro (Fig.4 B). This result delineates an N-terminal margin of the catalytic domain at a point only 29 residues upstream of catalytic motif A. We tested whether activity of theCET1(246–549) orCET1(276–549) deletion alleles in vivo could be augmented by increased gene dosage and/or expression of the genes under the control of a strong yeast promoter. To do this, we cloned CET1(246–549) andCET1(276–549), as well as full-lengthCET1 and CET1(201–549) (the positive controls), into 2μ vectors wherein their expression is driven by the yeast TPI1 promoter. These genes were tested for function by plasmid shuffle; the counterselection on 5-FOA was performed at 25, 30, and 37 °C. Whereas the 2μ TPI1-CET1 and 2μTPI1-CET1(201–549) transformants gave rise to FOA-resistant colonies at all temperatures, the 2μTPI1-CET1(276–549) transformants"
https://openalex.org/W2124043611,"We report the complete sequence of the humanCOL9A3 gene that encodes the α3 chain of heterotrimeric type IX collagen, a member of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices family of collagenous proteins. Nucleotide sequencing defined over 23,000 base pairs (bp) of the gene and about 3000 bp of the 5′-flanking sequences. The gene contains 32 exons. The domain and exon organization of the gene is almost identical to a related gene, the human COL9A2 gene. However, exon 2 of theCOL9A3 gene codes for one -Gly-X-Y- triplet less than exon 2 of the COL9A2 gene. The difference is compensated by an insertion of 9 bp coding for an additional triplet in exon 4 of the COL9A3 gene. As a result, the number of -Gly-X-Y- repeats in the third collagenous domain remains the same in both genes and ensures the formation of an in-register triple helix. In the course of screening this gene for mutations, heterozygosity for separate 9-bp deletions within the COL1 domain were identified in two kindreds. In both instances, the deletions did not co-segregate with any disease phenotype, suggesting that they were neutral variants. In contrast, similar deletions in triple helical domain of type I collagen are lethal. To study whether α3(IX) chains with the deletion will participate in the formation of correctly folded heterotrimeric type IX collagen, we expressed mutant α3 chains together with normal α1 and α2 chains in insect cells. We show here that despite the deletion, mutant α3 chains were secreted as heterotrimeric, triple helical molecules consisting of three α chains in a 1:1:1 ratio. The results suggest that the next noncollagenous domain (NC2) is capable of correcting the alignment of the α chains, and this ensures the formation of an in-register triple helix.

Type IX collagen is a structural component of hyaline cartilage and vitreous of the eye. It is a heterotrimeric molecule composed of three genetically distinct polypeptide chains: α1, α2, and α3 (1van der Rest M. Mayne R. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 195-221Google Scholar). The protein is characterized by interruptions in the triple helix, and it consists of three collagenous domains (COL1, COL2, and COL3, numbered from the C terminus) that are joined by four small noncollagenous domains (NC1 to NC4) (2Ninomiya Y. Castagnola P. Gerecke D. Gordon M.K. Jacenko O. LuValle P. McCarthy M. Muragaki Y. Nishimura I. Oh S. Rosenblum N. Sato N. Sugrue S. Taylor R. Vasios G. Yamaguchi N. Olsen B.R. Sandell L.J. Boyd C.D.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 129-170Crossref Google Scholar). In addition to interrupted triple helices, type IX collagen is a fibril-associated collagen and thus belongs to the FACIT subgroup of collagens (4Gordon M.K. Olsen B.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Type IX collagen is attached to the surface of type II collagen fibrils by lysine-derived covalent cross-links between the COL2 domain and telopeptides of type II collagen (5Eyre D.R. Apon S. Wu J.-J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 6van der Rest M. Mayne R. J. Biol.

Because the flexible NC3 domain enables the COL3 and NC4 domains to project out of the fibril surface, it has been suggested that the COL3 and NC4 domains may play a role in mediating interactions between collagens and noncollagenous components of hyaline cartilage (6van der Rest M. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vasios G. Nishimura I. Konomi H. van der Rest M. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The NC3 domain of the α2(IX) chain also has an attachment site for a glycosaminoglycan side chain (11Bruckner P. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2608-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Results from a recent study indicate that the NC1 domain of the three α chains contains all of the necessary information for chain selection and assembly (12Mechling D.E. Gambee J.E. Morris N.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13781-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The COL1 domain may play a critical role in the anti-parallel binding to the fibril surface, although this has not been directly demonstrated. There are no known or proposed functions for the NC2 domain as yet. Transgenic mice expressing α1(IX) cDNA with a large in-frame deletion of the sequences encoding a part of the COL3 domain, the entire NC3 domain, and part of the COL2 domain develop abnormalities in cartilage collagen fibril structure and a phenotype similar to human osteoarthritis and a mild chondrodysplasia (13Nakata K. Ono K. Miyazaki J.-I. Olsen B.R. Muragaki Y. Adachi E. Yamamura K.-I. Kimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2870-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Degenerative joint disease was also seen in separate lines of transgenic mice with inactivation of the Col9a1 gene (14Fässler R. Schnegelsberg P.N.J. Dausman J. Shinya T. Muragaki Y. McCarthy M.T. Olsen B.R. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5070-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). All of these findings suggest that type IX collagen is not essential for cartilage development, but it is required for maintaining the normal structural integrity of cartilage.

A second probe was prepared using a sense primer H41 (5′-AAA TCA GGC TCT CGA AGC TC, nt 2032–2051) with an antisense primer H42 (5′-TCT TTA CAC AAA TGC TAT GC, nt 2355–2374) to amplify a 342-bp PCR product, p342, that originates in NC1 and extends into the 3′-untranslated region of the human α3(IX) cDNA (24Brewton R.G. Wood B.M. Ren Z.-X. Gong Y. Tiller G.E. Warman M.L. Lee B. Horton W.A. Olsen B.R. Baker J.R. Mayne R. Genomics. 1995; 30: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The probes p342 and p1061 were 32P-radiolabeled by nick-translation and used to screen replicate filters from a human EMBL3 PS6/T7 genomic library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (24Brewton R.G. Wood B.M. Ren Z.-X. Gong Y. Tiller G.E. Warman M.L. Lee B. Horton W.A. Olsen B.R. Baker J.R. Mayne R. Genomics. 1995; 30: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two unique clones, gRB2B1 and gRB5B1, were isolated and sequenced (24Brewton R.G. Wood B.M. Ren Z.-X. Gong Y. Tiller G.E. Warman M.L. Lee B. Horton W.A. Olsen B.R. Baker J.R. Mayne R. Genomics. 1995; 30: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For PCR screening of genomic P1 libraries for the humanCOL9A3 gene, the primer pairs were designed on the basis of published sequences for the human α3(IX) cDNA (24Brewton R.G. Wood B.M. Ren Z.-X. Gong Y. Tiller G.E. Warman M.L. Lee B. Horton W.A. Olsen B.R. Baker J.R. Mayne R. Genomics. 1995; 30: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and genomic organization of the mouse Col9a2 gene (25Perälä M. Elima K. Metsäranta M. Rosati R. de Crombrugghe B. Vuorio E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5064-5071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To amplify the 5′-end sequences of the gene, the primer pair C93-F4 (5′-CAG GAA AGC CGG GGA AAC CAG, nt 200–220 from the start of translation in the human cDNA) and C93-R5 (5′-GTC CAT CTC GTC CAG TCA GAC, nt 277–257) was used. The primer pair C93-F32 (5′-CCT GCC AAG GAG CCG TGT TAG G, nt 1997–2018) and C93-RUTR (5′-CCT TTT GAG GTA TGC TGT CAG GC, nt 2249–2227) was used for the amplification of the 3′-end sequences of the COL9A3 gene. The primers C93-F4 and C93-R5 corresponded to the sequences in exons 4 and 5, and the primers C93-F32 and C93-RUTR corresponded to the sequences in exon 32 of the mouse Col9a2gene. PCRs were performed in a 40-μl reaction volume using 50–100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.25 μm each primer, 200 μmeach dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 unit ofTaq polymerase (AmpliTaq, Perkin-Elmer). Thermal cycling conditions were 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles. The primer pairs amplified single bands of about 700 bp (C93-F4 and C93-R5) and 250 bp (C93–32F and C93-RUTR), and were used for screening a human P1 library (Genome Systems, Inc.). The screening resulted in identification of three positive P1 clones: P1-C93A, P1-C93B, and P1-C93C (Genome Systems control numbers 12269, 12270, and 12271 and clone addresses DMPC-HFF#1-270-C3, DMPC-HFF#1-753-B10, and DMPC-HFF#1-1082-B5, respectively). To isolate DNA, the P1 clones were cultured overnight in 3 ml of LB and 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and 2.5 ml of the overnight culture was grown in 75 ml of LB for 1.5 h. After addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, incubation was continued for 5 h followed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min in 10-ml aliquots and P1 DNA isolation with a standard plasmid isolation protocol (26Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9886) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the P1 clone was performed by cycle sequencing (Cycle Sequencing Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequencing primers were designed on the basis of the published cDNA sequences for the human α3(IX) chain (24Brewton R.G. Wood B.M. Ren Z.-X. Gong Y. Tiller G.E. Warman M.L. Lee B. Horton W.A. Olsen B.R. Baker J.R. Mayne R. Genomics. 1995; 30: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the genomic organization of the mouse Col9a2 gene (25Perälä M. Elima K. Metsäranta M. Rosati R. de Crombrugghe B. Vuorio E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5064-5071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intronic sequences between exons 10 and 11, 12 and 13, 26 and 27, and 31 and 32 were amplified using Expand long template PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR products were purified using an agarose gel extraction protocol (QIAEX II gel extraction kit, Qiagen), followed by cloning into pUC 18 vector (SURE clone ligation kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and sequencing (T7 sequencing kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequencing reactions were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Human control and patient DNA was extracted from whole blood using standard methods and used for PCR amplifications. PCR primers were designed from the intronic sequences to amplify separately each exon of the COL9A3 gene. The product sizes varied from 200 to 400 bp and contained at least 80 bp of 5′ and 3′ intronic sequences. Genomic DNA was amplified in a 40-μl volume with thermal cycling of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60–62 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Heteroduplexes were generated by denaturing the samples at 95 °C for 5 min and reannealing for 30 min at 68 °C. The concentration and quality of PCR products was estimated analyzing 5 μl of each reaction in 1.5% agarose gel. CSGE was used to scan the PCR products for mutations that generated heteroduplexes (27Ganguly A. Rock M.J. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10325-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). A CSGE gel consisted of 10% polyacrylamide, 99:1 ratio of acrylamide to 1,4-bis(acryloyl)piperazine (Fluka), 10% ethylene glycol, 15% formamide (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1% ammonium persulfate, and 0.07% TEMED in 0.5× TTE (44 mmTris, 14.5 mm Taurine, 0.1 mm EDTA buffer, pH 9.0) buffer. Gel electrophoresis was performed with a standard DNA sequencing apparatus (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 0.5× TTE as the electrode buffer. Prior to electrophoresis, 3–15 μl or 25–75 ng of sample was mixed with loading buffer (10× stock solution of 30% glycerol containing 0.25% of both xylene cyanol FF and bromphenol blue). The gel was pre-electrophoresed at 45 W for 15 min, and the samples were electrophoresed at 45 W for 5 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml), destained with water, and photographed. Samples containing heteroduplexes were analyzed by direct PCR product sequencing (T7 Sequenase PCR product sequencing kit, United States Biochemical). Some PCR products were purified from agarose gel, and 60 ng of purified product was cloned into pUC18 vector and sequenced. Several clones were sequenced to obtain sequences for both alleles. For amplification of the α3(IX) chain containing the Gly-Pro-Pro deletion, specific primers were designed on the basis of the published cDNA sequences (24Brewton R.G. Wood B.M. Ren Z.-X. Gong Y. Tiller G.E. Warman M.L. Lee B. Horton W.A. Olsen B.R. Baker J.R. Mayne R. Genomics. 1995; 30: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides, R9A3DEL (5′-CTT CTA CGG ACC GGG GGG GCC AGC TGG ACC GGG CCG ACC AAT GG, nt 1655–1685) and F9A3DEL (5′-GTT GTT CGG TCC GCC AGG CTC CAT TGG TCA CCC TGG CGC TCG, nt 1702–1730), both containing a generatedCspI cleavage site, were designed to exon 30. R9A3DEL was used for PCR amplification with oligonucleotide M29B (5′-CCC GAC GCC GCA GTC TAG ACT CCG CCA CGC) that corresponded to the 5′-noncoding region and F9A3DEL with oligonucleotide MH30 (5′-TCG GGC GTC CTT GTC TCT AGA TTC CTC ACG) that corresponded to the 3′-noncoding region of the α3(IX) cDNA. A DNA template for PCR amplification was α3(IX) cDNA transcribed from total RNA extracted from human fetal cartilage. PCR was performed in a 40-μl volume with thermal cycling of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The primer pairs amplified 1729-bp 5′-end sequences (M29B and R9A3DEL) and 404-bp 3′-end sequences (F9A3DEL and MH30) of the α3(IX) cDNA. The PCR products were digested with CspI, purified using QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) followed by ligation into pVL1392 vector, and sequenced using cDNA specific primers (ABI PRISM model 377 sequencer, Perkin-Elmer; ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, FS, Perkin-Elmer). The deleted α3(IX) cDNA was transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9, Invitrogen) insect cells using BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen). The viral pools were collected, amplified, and plaque-purified. Expression of mutant recombinant type IX collagen was achieved by co-infecting Trichoplusia ni(High Five, Invitrogen) insect cells with the recombinant virus for the α3(IX) chain containing the Gly-Pro-Pro deletion and viruses for the α1(IX) and α2(IX) chains (43Pihlajamaa T.

For expression of wild-type collagen, a virus for the wild-type α3(IX) chain (43Pihlajamaa T. Perälä M. Vuoristo M.M. Nokelainen M. Bodo M. Schulthess T. Vuorio E. Timpl R. Engel J. Ala-Kokko L. J.

Culture medium was collected after 72 h of infection, and the recombinant type IX collagen was precipitated with 25% saturation of ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved overnight at 4 °C in 0.5m urea, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4. For pepsin digestion, the samples were adjusted to pH 2, and digestion was performed at room temperature for 4 h. The undigested controls were incubated without pepsin, and denaturation of the samples was performed by heating at 60 °C for 5 min prior to digestion. After pepsin treatment, the pH was adjusted to 7.5. All the type IX protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Further purification of the mutant recombinant type IX collagen was achieved by cation exchange chromatography as described (43Pihlajamaa T. Perälä M. Vuoristo M.M. Nokelainen M. Bodo M.

Screening of the human genomic phage library yielded two positive clones, gRB2B1 and gRB5B1, that contained the 3′-portion of the COL9A3 gene. gRB2B1 was approximately 12 kb in size and hybridized with both P1061 and p342. gRB5B1 was approximately 18 kb in size and hybridized only with the 3′-probe p342. A third genomic clone, gRB35, that was isolated previously, contained the 5′-most end of the gene (24Brewton R.G. Wood B.M. Ren Z.-X. Gong Y. Tiller G.E. Warman M.L. Lee B. Horton W.A. Olsen B.R. Baker J.R. Mayne R. Genomics. 1995; 30: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, after DNA sequencing and restriction mapping of the genomic clones, it was found that the clones did not overlap and thus did not cover the entire gene. To obtain clones covering the entire gene, a human P1 library was screened with two PCR primer pairs designed from the cDNA sequence to amplify the 5′-end or the 3′-end of the gene. The screening yielded three positive clones. The P1 clones were analyzed for the presence of the most 5′-end and 3′-end sequences of the corresponding cDNA by sequencing and PCR amplification. All clones were found to contain the entire coding region, and one clone (P1-C93A) was selected for detailed characterization of the gene (Fig. 1). Nucleotide sequencing of the human COL9A3 gene was performed by direct sequencing of the P1 clone or by sequencing of subclones in plasmids. A total of over 26 kb of the nucleotide sequence was determined. The results indicated that the gene is about 23 kb and contains 32 exons (Fig. 1). Also, over 3 kb of 5′-flanking sequences are presented. The sequences extend to the 3′-end of the next gene, which is called 7-60. 2J. Liu, R. G. Brewton, M. Takanosu, B. M. Wood, and R. Mayne, unpublished observations. Sites for selected restriction enzymes are shown in Fig. 1. The genomic organization of the human COL9A3 gene is indicated in Figs.1 and 2. The genomic structure was compared with a related gene, the human gene for α2(IX) collagen chain (29Pihlajamaa T. Vuoristo M.M. Annunen S. Perälä M. Prockop D.J. Ala-Kokko L. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the domain structures of α2(IX) and α3(IX) collagen chains are almost identical, it was probable that the exon organization of the corresponding genes would also be conserved. As expected, the overall exon organization of the genes showed considerable similarities. There were, however, some unexpected differences in sizes of the exons encoding for the COL3 domain even though the size of the domain is identical in these genes. The COL3 domain is 411 bp or 137 amino acid residues and is encoded by exons 2 through 10 in both genes. Exon 2 in both genes is a junction exon between NC4 and COL3. Exon 2 in the COL9A3 gene codes for one collagen triplet less than exon 2 in the COL9A2 gene, but the COL3 domain is identical because exon 4 in COL9A3codes for one additional triplet compared with exon 4 in theCOL9A2 gene (Fig. 3). In effect, the deletion of 9 bp coding for one -Gly-X-Y- triplet in exon 2 of the COL9A3 gene is compensated by an insertion of 9 bp coding for an additional triplet in exon 4.Figure 3The number of -Gly-X-Y- triplets encoded by exons 2, 3, and 4 in the COL9A3 and COL9A2genes. Exons are drawn to scale. The junction of the NC4 and COL3 domains is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The intron sizes of the humanCOL9A3 gene vary from 84 to over 2000 bp (Figs. 1 and 2). Six introns are over 1000 bp (Fig. 2). The largest intron is intron 26, which is about 2000 bp. This large size can partially be explained by insertion of two Alu repeats. Surprisingly, the first intron is relatively small, and the large introns are located mostly in the 3′-end of the gene. This finding is the opposite of the humanCOL9A2 gene (29Pihlajamaa T.

Although the start of transcription was not determined due to a lack of human cartilage mRNA, sequences up to about −3000 from the start of translation were analyzed for the presence of the binding sites for common transcription factors. The sequences contained several Sp1 consensus recognition sites, but no TATAA or CCAAT boxes. Altogether, 30 Sp1 sites were found in this sequence, but 11 of the sites were found at the position −361 to −35 from the start of translation. The putative promoter region and the introns were analyzed for the presence of binding sites for known cartilage-specific transcription factors. Results of recent reports indicate that SOX9 may play a role in chondrogenesis (36Bell D.M. Leung K.K.H. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Nat.

This repeat was not homologous to any known sequences. A proband with MED was screened for mutations in the COL9A3 gene by PCR amplification of exons and flanking sequences and analyzing the products for heteroduplexes by CSGE.

Here we show that a PTC at nucleotide (nt) 385 in the NS1/2 shared exon of P4-generated pre-mRNAs of the autonomous parvovirus minute virus of mice caused a decrease in the accumulated levels of doubly spliced R2 relative to singly spliced R1, although the total accumulated levels of R1 plus R2 remained the same. The effect of this PTC was evident within nuclear RNA, was mediated by a PTC and not a missense transversion mutation at this position, and could be suppressed by improvement of the large intron splice sites and by mutation of the AUG that initiated translation of R1 and R2. In contrast to the PTC at nt 385, the reading frame-dependent effect of the PTC at nt 2018 depended neither on the initiating AUG nor the normal termination codon for NS2; however, it could be suppressed by a single nucleotide deletion mutation in the upstream NS1/2 common exon that shifted the 2018 PTC out of the NS2 open reading frame. This suggested that there was recognition and communication of reading frame between exons on a pre-mRNA in the nucleus prior to or concomitant with splicing.

Premature termination codons (PTCs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTC, premature termination codon; MVM, minute virus of mice; nt, nucleotide(s); ORF, open reading frame; ESE, exon splicing enhancer; WT, wild type have been shown to result in decreased levels of PTC-containing mRNAs in many organisms, and there is an increasing appreciation of the effect of PTCs on RNA levels in mammalian cells. In some of these cases, PTCs have been shown to affect nuclear-associated mRNA abundance by a process termed nonsense-mediated decay, which has been suggested to degrade fully spliced mRNAs in the nucleus, possibly during mRNA export (reviewed in Refs.1 and 2). PTCs have also been implicated in altering nuclear RNA processing events other than decay in mammalian cells, which results in both intron retention and exon skipping, suggesting that PTCs may influence splice site selection (1Maquat L.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 453-465PubMed Google Scholar). In two cases, exon skipping of the 66-nucleotide exon 51 of fibrillin FBN1 RNA (3Dietz H.C. Kendzior Jr., R.J. Nat.

Virol. 1998; 72: 1834-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is located between nt 2280 and 2399 and is common to both P4- and P38-generated transcripts. An upstream large intron, located between nt 514 and 1989, is additionally excised from a subset of P4-generated pre-mRNAs to generate R2 mRNA. This upstream intron utilizes a nonconsensus donor at nt 514 and has a weak polypyrimidine tract at its 3′ splice site (13Zhao Q. Gersappe A. Pintel D.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6170-6179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NS2-specific exon is a 290-nt alternatively spliced exon that is translated in two open reading frames (ORFs). In singly spliced R1, this region utilizes ORF3 to encode NS1; in doubly spliced R2, this exon utilizes ORF2 to encode NS2 (Fig.1). We have previously shown that PTCs in the NS2-specific exon caused a decrease in the accumulated levels of R2 relative to R1, although the total accumulated levels of R1 plus R2 remained the same. This decrease was a consequence of the artificially introduced translation termination signal acting in cisrather than the absence of a functional viral gene product and was shown to be evident in nuclear RNA and independent of RNA stability, suggesting an effect on nuclear splicing (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although perhaps not directly comparable with PTCs that cause genetic diseases in higher organisms, analyses of PTCs introduced into viral genes such as MVM have proven to be informative models for the effects of PTCs on RNA accumulation (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Efficient inclusion of the NS2-specific exon as an internal exonin vivo and consequent excision of the upstream large intron from P4-generated pre-mRNA to generate R2 require an internally redundant, bipartite exon splicing enhancer (ESE) comprised of 5′ and 3′ elements within the NS2-specific exon (17Gersappe A. Pintel D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The function of this ESE is sensitive to the presence of PTCs (5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A nonsense but not a missense mutation in the NS2 open reading frame at nt 2018 within the 5′ element of the ESE affected definition of the NS2-specific exon by interfering with the ability of the bipartite ESE to strengthen interactions at the upstream large intron polypyrimidine tract. A PTC at nt 2018 alone resulted in retention of the upstream intron without a net decrease in the total accumulated P4-generated product. When the PTC at nt 2018 was combined with a mutation in the 3′ element of the bipartite enhancer, the NS2-specific exon was skipped. These effects were independent of RNA stability and were shown to be reading frame-dependent; single nucleotide deletions in front of the 2018 mutation, which removed the PTC from the NS2 open reading frame, fully suppressed its effect (5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the NS1/NS2 shared exon is a 5′ terminal exon, PTCs at nt 385 within this exon have also been shown to result in a decrease in the accumulated level of doubly spliced R2 relative to singly spliced R1, in a manner independent of the stability of R2 or R1 (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the effect of the PTC at nt 385 was evident within nuclear RNA, was dependent on a PTC and not a missense transversion mutation at this position, and could be suppressed by improvement of the large intron splice sites. The effects of the 385 PTC and a PTC at nt 2018 were at least partially additive, suggesting that they operated by at least partially independent mechanisms. This was further underscored by the observation that the effect of the PTC at nt 385 depended upon the AUG that initiated translation of R1 and R2, whereas the reading frame-dependent effect of the PTC at nt 2018 depended neither on the initiating AUG nor on the normal termination codon for NS2. The effect of the PTC at nt 2018 could, however, be suppressed by a single nucleotide deletion mutation in the upstream NS1/2 common exon that shifted the 2018 PTC out of the NS2 ORF, suggesting that there was communication of reading frames between exons. Our observations are most consistent with a model in which reading frame can be recognized on a pre-mRNA molecule in the nucleus, prior to or concomitant with splicing. Construction of p385UTT and p2018TAA has been previously described (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mutants p385CAA, p385TAA, and pSTOP(−) were constructed by m13-based oligonucleotide mutagenesis as described previously (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mutant oligonucleotides were homologous to the viral DNA except at the nucleotides that were to be altered. pSTOP(−) is a deletion of two nucleotides at 2380 and 2381. The changes made in p385CAA and p385TAA are shown in Fig.2 A. pAUG(X) was constructed by cutting the wild type (WT) clone of MVM at the NcoI site at nt 260 and chewing back with mung bean nuclease to create a deletion between nt 261 and 265 (which deletes the initiating AUG at nt 260). To generate pAUG(XXX) and pAUG(XXX)2018TAA, mutations of the Kozak consensus sequences (18Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar) at nt 474 and 504 were initially generated by m13-based oligonucleotide mutagenesis (the 474 mutation changes the WT sequence 5′-GACATG-3′ to 5′-TACATT-3′; the 504 mutation changes the WT sequence 5′-GAAATG-3′ to 5′-CCAATT-3′), and then the m13 fragment bearing these mutations was subcloned into pAUG(X) and pAUG(X)2018TAA, respectively. All the final clones of the above mutants were sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutations were introduced, and the absence of the P38 promoter product R3 for these mutants confirms that no NS1 was made. p385UTT+2018TAA, pCSD385UTT, p2T385UTT, p4T385UTT, pCSD20188TAA, pAUG(X)2018TAA, pAUG(X)385UTT, pAUG(XXX)385UTT, p2018D1(−)A2(−), and p2018TAASTOP(−) were generated by combining the individual mutations using standard molecular cloning techniques. The changes made in the mutants are shown in Figs. 2 A,3 A, 4 A, and5 A. All the final clones of the above mutants were sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutations were introduced.Figure 4The nonsense-mediated reduction of R2 mRNA depends on the initiating AUG for mutations in the first exon but not the second exon of NS2 pre-mRNA.

Dadachanji D. Astell C.R. Ward D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1019-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and transfected with wild type and mutant MVM plasmids, using either DEAE-Dextran (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE-Plus reagent (as described in the LipofectAMINE-Plus reagent kit manufactured by Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was typically isolated 48 h post-transfection, after lysis in guanidinium thiocyanate, by centrifugation through CsCl exactly as described previously (15Schoborg R.V. Pintel D.J. Virology. 1991; 181: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (15Schoborg R.V. Pintel D.J. Virology. 1991; 181: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), using an [α-32P]UTP-labeled, SP6-generated antisense MVM RNA probe from MVM nucleotides 1854–2378 (probe B). This probe extends from before the acceptor site of the large intron to within the small intron common to all MVM RNAs and distinguishes P4-RNA species using the large intron acceptor and either of the alternative small intron donors (designated M for the major splice donor (D1) at nt 2280 and m for the minor splice donor (D2) at nt 2317 (15Schoborg R.V. Pintel D.J. Virology. 1991; 181: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). Thus probe B can distinguish between unspliced, minor, and major forms of both R1 and R2. For analysis of RNA produced after transfection with p2018TAA, p1T2018TAA, p2T2018TAA, p4T2018TAA, p385TAA+2018TAA, p2T385UTT, p4T385UTT, pCSD2018TAA, pAUG(X)2018TAA, pAUG(XXX)2018TAA, p2018TAAD1(−)A2(−), and p2018TAASTOP(−), antisense RNase protection probes homologous to the 2018 and polypyrimidine tract mutations being analyzed were constructed and used. Because in all cases the relative ratio of bands within an individual lane was the important result, rigorous attempts were not made to equilibrate the amounts of specific RNA between lanes. This would be expected to vary from sample to sample depending upon transfection efficiencies and does not effect the comparison of relative ratios within a sample. RNase protection products were analyzed on a Betagen-scanning phosphorimage analyzer, and molar ratios of MVM RNA were determined by standardization to the number of uridines in each protected fragment. Nuclear RNA was isolated after the pelleting of nuclei twice through sucrose exactly as described previously (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The nuclear RNA fractions were determined to be >95% pure as monitored by the relative absence of mature rRNA and the presence of rRNA precursors in these preparations by ethidium bromide staining following gel electorophoresis (data not shown), also as described (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Introduction of an ochre (TAA) PTC at nt 385 in the NS1/NS2 common exon of P4-generated pre-mRNA, either by point mutagenesis or by insertion of a 15-nt linker with overlapping PTCs in all three reading frames, led to a significant inversion in the accumulated levels of doubly spliced R2 relative to singly spliced R1 in total RNA, compared with that generated by wild type, although the total P4-generated product (R1+R2) was unchanged (Fig. 2, A and B). This result was similar to that previously seen when a PTC was introduced at nt 2018 in the internal NS2-specific exon of P4-generated pre-mRNA (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) but of somewhat greater magnitude. A missense transversion (CAG) at nt 385 showed no such effect (Fig. 2, A and B). When the PTCs at nt 385 and 2018 were combined, an even greater decrease in the accumulated level of R2 relative to R1 was seen (Fig. 2, Aand C). That the effects of the two mutations were at least somewhat additive suggested that the mechanisms behind their effects were at least partially independent, a possibility that is further supported by the observations described below. The effect of the PTC at nt 385 was also evident in pure preparations of nuclear RNA, suggesting that the effect of this PTC was manifest within the nucleus (Fig.2 D), as was previously reported for the PTC at 2018 (5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Subtle improvements of the large intron splice sites could suppress the effect of the PTC at nt 385, consistent with the suggestion that this effect was nuclear. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), improvement of either the large intron 5′ splice site to consensus or the large intron 3′ splice site polypyrimidine tract by as few as two additional pyrimidines, restored the accumulated levels of R2 relative to R1 to near wild type levels. Improvement of the large intron 5′ splice site to consensus also suppressed the phenotype of the PTC at 2018 (Fig. 3, A and C); we have previously reported that improvements of the 3′ polypyrimidine tract also suppresses the effect of the PTC at nt 2018 (5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Improvement of the large intron 3′ splice site polypyrimidine tract by four pyrimidines resulted in splicing of the P4 product almost exclusively to R2 (Fig.3 B, sixth lane). That the effects of the PTCs can be overcome by improvements of the large intron splice sites, which do not appear in the final spliced R2 mRNA (Fig. 3), further suggests that the effects of the PTCs are independent of effects on RNA stability, as has been shown previously (4Naeger L.K. Schoborg R.V. Zhao Q. Tullis G.E. Pintel D.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggested that PTCs in either exon of R2 can interfere with the nuclear excision of the upstream large intron from P4-generated pre-mRNAs. The accumulated level of R2 relative to R1 was affected by a PTC but not by a missense transversion at nt 385, and we have previously shown that the effect of a PTC at nt 2018 was reading frame-dependent,i.e. it was suppressed by a frameshift mutation in front of nt 2018 (5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose to ask whether the effects of the PTCs were linked to translation in the cytoplasm by determining whether their effect was dependent on the initiating AUG that begins the reading frame for NS1 and NS2. Although such mutations may conceivably have other effects on RNA processing, similar mutations have been used to suppress the effects of PTCs in the triosephoshate isomerase gene RNA in order to link the PTC effects to cytoplasmic translation (19Zhang J. Maquat L.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4, destruction by point mutagenesis of the initiating AUG at nt 260 suppressed the effect of the PTC at nt 385 but not the effect of the PTC at nt 2018. Translation reinitiation has also been shown to abrogate nonsense-mediated decay of the triosephoshate isomerase gene RNA (19Zhang J. Maquat L.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). There are also two internal AUG codons in frame in the NS1/NS2 shared exon (at nt 474 and 504), and the effect of the 2018 PTC was also resistant to mutation of all three AUGs. Interestingly, the triple AUG mutations were less effective than the nt 260 mutation alone in suppressing the effect of the PTC at nt 385 (Fig.4). This may have been because nt 474 and 504 lie close to the large intron donor at nt 514 and because mutations at these sites may have interfered with an exonic signal required for splicing of the large intron. That there was a reduction in the accumulated levels of R2 relative to R1 in RNA generated by a mutant in which the three AUGs were destroyed but no PTC had been introduced (pAUG(XXX)) is consistent with this possibility (Fig. 4). Thus, nonsense codon-mediated reduction of the accumulated levels of R2 relative to R1 caused by the PTC at nt 385 but not at nt 2018 was dependent upon the reading-frame initiating AUG at nt 260. The effect of the PTC at nt 2018 has previously been shown to be reading frame-dependent; a single nucleotide mutation at nt 2011 that shifted the R2 reading frame into the open NS1 reading frame prior to the 2018 PTC could suppress its effect (5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). That the 2018 PTC could not be suppressed by destruction of the initiating AUG codon suggested that the R2 reading frame must be marked from another point. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), this marker is not the normal termination codon for the major isoform of NS2. (The major isoform of NS2 is encoded by an R2 molecule that uses the small intron pair D1/A1 and is found in approximately 75% of the MVM mRNAs.) When the NS2 major isoform TAA codon was mutated so that the NS2 open reading frame was fused in-frame into the capsid gene VP1 open reading frame that terminated at nt 4552, the effect of the 2018 PTC on the accumulated levels of R2 relative to R1 remained unchanged (p2018TAASTOP(−)). The 2018 PTC was, however, suppressed by a single nucleotide deletion at nt 505 in the upstream NS1/2 common exon which shifts the PTC into the NS1 (ORF) in the final R2 spliced product (Fig. 5, A and B). This result suggested that there was communication of reading frame between the two exons before final splicing of the intervening intron. Studies with the T-cell receptor gene have suggested that a spliceable downstream intron was required for some effects of PTCs on RNA processing (20Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This was not the case, however, for the PTC at MVM nt 2018. Mutations that disabled both the outside small intron donor and the acceptor (D1 and A2; Fig. 1) prevent excision of the small intron (probably because the remaining internal D2-A2 pair that is separated by only 59 nt is too close to be spliced together (14Pintel D.J. Gersappe A. Haut D. Pearson J. Semin. Virol. 1995; 6: 283-290Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S.R. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)); however, the upstream intron is still excised at wild type efficiency in this mutant (Fig. 5, A and C). When a PTC was introduced at nt 2018 in this small intron-disabling mutant, the full effect of the PTC on the accumulated levels of R2 relative to R1 was still evident (p2018TAAD1(−)A2(−); Fig. 5, Aand C). Thus the 2018 PTC did not require a prior splicing event downstream for its effect. A PTC transversion mutation but not a missense transversion mutation at nucleotide 385 in the 5′-terminal NS1/2 common exon of P4-generated pre-mRNAs of the autonomous parvovirus MVM resulted in an increased level of the singly spliced R1 mRNA relative to doubly spliced R2 mRNA in the nucleus of transfected cells. This effect could be suppressed by improvement of the splice signals of the large intron, suggesting that the effect on MVM RNA processing was at the level of excision of the large intron. Mutation of the initiating AUG at nt 260 also suppressed the effect of the 385 PTC, suggesting a link to the establishment of the reading frame of this 5′-terminal exon. These results help place the MVM P4-generated pre-mRNAs in a growing list of examples in which PTCs can either directly or indirectly affect nuclear RNA processing in an open reading frame-dependent manner (1Maquat L.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 453-465PubMed Google Scholar, 22Maquat L.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 279-286PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a PTC at nt 2018 in the downstream internal NS2-specific exon of MVM P4-generated pre-mRNA also inhibited excision of this large intron, likely by virtue of interfering with the function of an ESE within the NS2 specific exon (5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In that case, the effect of the PTC on splicing was shown to be dependent upon an intact open reading frame. Here we show further that the effect of the PTC at nt 2018, although reading frame-dependent, was not affected by alterations of either the protein translation initiating AUG or terminating TAA signals, which have been shown to be important for PTC effects in other systems (1Maquat L.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 453-465PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang J. Maquat L.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Maquat L.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 279-286PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the effect could be suppressed by a frameshift mutation in the 5′ terminal NS1/2 common exon of R2 message, suggesting that the effect of the 2018 PTC was dependent upon communication of reading frame between the two exons in the nucleus, prior to the completion of the splicing process. PTCs have been shown to have significant effects on RNA processing associated with the nucleus of mammalian cells (1Maquat L.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 453-465PubMed Google Scholar, 20Carter M.S. Li S. Wilkinson M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In some cases PTCs have been shown to trigger nucleus-associated nonsense-mediated decay; in other cases PTCs have been shown to affect other nuclear processes that lead to altered steady state RNA levels (1Maquat L.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 453-465PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the PTC at nt 2018 likely affects splicing of MVM P4-generated pre-mRNA by interfering with the nuclear function of an ESE within the internal NS2-specific exon of MVM RNA (5Gersappe A. Pintel D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These observations are most consistent with “nuclear scanning”-type models of reading frame recognition (1Maquat L.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 453-465PubMed Google Scholar, 23Urlaub G. Mitchell P.J. Giudad C.J. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Because our results suggest that recognition of the PTC at nt 2018 is not influenced by the initiating AUG and yet can be suppressed by a frameshift mutation in an upstream exon, such a model would have to accommodate recognition of frame between the upstream NS1/2 common exon and the NS2-specific exon prior to splicing. On the other hand, because the PTC at nt 385 is suppressible by mutation of the initiating AUG, it is formally possible that the effect of this PTC could be linked to cytoplasmic translation. This seems unlikely, however, because the large intron begins only 129 nt downstream of the PTC at nt 385. The observation that the effects of the two PTC mutations together are additive suggests that they may function somewhat differently. Although the mechanisms of PTC action in the nucleus are not well understood, their effect has provoked a growing appreciation that the recognition of reading frame in the nucleus of mammalian cells can influence RNA processing events (1Maquat L.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 453-465PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dietz H.C. Kendzior Jr., R.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). How such recognition can occur is not known; however, there have recently been some interesting observations that suggest that an appropriate apparatus may be in place.

The reaction mechanism is known to proceed through at least three highly reactive intermediates: ammonia, carboxyphosphate, and carbamate. In keeping with the fact that the product of CPS is utilized in two competing metabolic pathways, the enzyme is highly regulated by a variety of effector molecules including potassium and ornithine, which function as activators, and UMP, which acts as an inhibitor. IMP is also known to bind to CPS but the actual effect of this ligand on the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon both temperature and assay conditions. Here we describe the three-dimensional architecture of CPS with bound IMP determined and refined to 2.1 Å resolution. The nucleotide is situated at the C-terminal portion of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet in the allosteric domain formed by Ser937 to Lys1073. Those amino acid side chains responsible for anchoring the nucleotide to the polypeptide chain include Lys954, Thr974, Thr977, Lys993, Asn1015, and Thr1017. A series of hydrogen bonds connect the IMP-binding pocket to the active site of the large subunit known to function in the phosphorylation of the unstable intermediate, carbamate.

Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) 1The abbreviations used are: CPS, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1The abbreviations used are: CPS, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase is one of the few allosterically regulated enzymes whose three-dimensional structure is now known to high resolution (1Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A list of other regulated proteins, whose molecular architectures are known in quite extensive detail, includes phosphofructokinase (3Schirmer T. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 343 (and references therein): 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), aspartate transcarbamoylase (4Kosman R.P. Gouaux J.E. Lipscomb W.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 15 (and references therein): 147-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), glutamine synthetase (5Liaw S.H. Jun G. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (and references therein): 11184-11188Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and glycogen phosphorylase (6Gregoriou M. Noble M.E. Watson K.A. Garman E.F. Krulle T.M. de la Fuente C. Fleet G.W. Oikonomakos NG. Johnson L.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7 (and references therein): 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), among others. The biochemical role of CPS is to catalyze the formation of carbamoyl phosphate, an unstable precursor that initiates subsequent steps in the biosynthesis of both pyrimidine nucleotides and arginine. The end-product of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, UMP, allosterically inhibits this enzyme. Conversely, ornithine, the co-substrate with carbamoyl phosphate in the next step of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, enhances the catalytic activity of CPS. Each of these effectors primarily, but not exclusively, modulates the activity of CPS by raising or lowering the dissociation constant for Mg2+ATP by approximately one order of magnitude (7Braxton B.L. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Braxton B.L. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11918-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As isolated from E. coli, CPS is a large multidomain heterodimeric protein. The smaller of the two subunits has a molecular weight of ∼42,000 and is catalytically responsible for the hydrolysis of glutamine and the subsequent translocation of the ammonia product to the large subunit (9Matthews S.L. Anderson P.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1176-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The larger subunit (molecular weight ∼118,000) is composed of four major regions as indicated in Fig.1 (1Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 10Trotta P.P. Burt M.E. Haschemeyer R.H. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Two of these structural units, known as the carboxyphosphate (Met1-Glu403) and carbamoyl phosphate (Asn554-Asn936) synthetic components are homologous to one another and contain all of the catalytic machinery necessary for the final assembly of carbamoyl phosphate. These two synthetase units are linked together by a third domain (Val404- Ala553) whose functional role in the structure and catalytic properties of CPS is still not well understood. However, this region of the protein appears to play a role in the oligomerization of the α,β-heterodimer into an (α,β)4-tetrameric species (1Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The remaining domain (Ser937-Lys1073) has been shown by both x-ray crystallographic and biochemical methods to harbor the binding sites for such allosteric effectors as ornithine, UMP, and IMP. The binding site for the positive allosteric effector, ornithine, was identified in the original x-ray structural analysis of CPS (1Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ornithine was found to straddle the interface between the allosteric domain and the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. Specifically, the α-amino group of this compound was shown to lie within hydrogen bonding distance to Oγ of Tyr1040 in the allosteric domain, whereas the δ-amino group was positioned within 3.0 Å from the carboxylate groups of Glu783 and Glu892, and O of Asp791, all of which originate from the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. In addition, the carboxylate group of ornithine was observed interacting with both the backbone amide nitrogen and Oγ of Thr1042. This same structure of CPS also provided the first hint for the locations of the nucleotide monophosphate binding sites. Indeed, within the allosteric domain, an inorganic phosphate was observed, hydrogen bonded, and ion-paired to Lys954, Thr974, Thr977, and Lys993. The hydroxyl group of Thr977 had previously been shown to be critical for the display of the allosteric properties of UMP (11), although somewhat later Lys993 was shown to be the residue modified upon photolabeling CPS with UMP (12Cervera J. Bendala E. Britton H.G. Bueso J. Nassif Z. Lusty C.J. Rubio V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7247-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). From the above mentioned data, a structural model was subsequently proposed by Thoden et al. (1Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) for the binding of UMP or IMP to the allosteric domain of the large subunit. Relative to UMP, the allosteric properties exhibited by IMP are rather modest. Originally, IMP was described as an activator of CPS (13Boettcher B. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5977-5980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Boettcher B. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13971-13976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kasprzak A.A. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8050-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) but Reinhart and colleagues (7Braxton B.L. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) elegantly demonstrated that the net allosteric effects of IMP can be modulated by temperature. At high temperatures, IMP activates CPS, whereas at lower temperatures the enzymatic activity is depressed. From past investigations (13Boettcher B. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5977-5980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Boettcher B. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13971-13976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Anderson P.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it was suggested that both IMP and UMP compete for the same binding site. More recently, it has been demonstrated quantitatively that the allosteric effects exhibited by IMP and UMP are strictly competitive with one another (17Braxton B.L. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1394-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These results are fully consistent with a common binding site for these two nucleotide monophosphate molecules. In contrast, ornithine and either IMP or UMP can bind simultaneously to CPS but the activation properties of ornithine completely dominate the inhibitory effects of either IMP or UMP (17Braxton B.L. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1394-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we report the first structural analysis of the nucleotide monophosphate allosteric binding site for CPS from E. coli. For this investigation, CPS was crystallized in the presence of both IMP and ornithine. The IMP binding site was found to be contained wholly within the allosteric domain of CPS in a position consistent with previous biochemical data. The model presented here provides one snapshot along the way toward a more complete structural understanding of the allosteric behavior displayed by this remarkable enzyme. Protein employed in this investigation was purified as described previously (18Miran S.G. Chang S.H. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7901-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For crystallization trials, the protein was concentrated to 4 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 100 mm KCl. Large single crystals were grown at 4 °C using a precipitant solution containing 0.65 m tetraethylammonium chloride, 8% w/v (polyethylene) glycol 8000, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm ornithine, 1.25 mm ADP, 1.25 mm BeF3, 5.0 mm IMP, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The crystals took approximately 3 months to achieve maximum dimensions of 1.2 × 0.5 × 0.4 mm. As in previous structural analyses of CPS fromE. coli, these crystals belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 152.1 Å, b = 163.9 Å, andc = 331.2 Å and one (α,β)4-heterotetramer per asymmetric unit. Before x-ray data collection, the crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution as described previously and subsequently flash-cooled to −150 °C in a stream of nitrogen gas (2Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). X-ray data to 2.1 Å resolution were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on beam-line 7–1 with the MAR300 image plate system. A low resolution x-ray data set, consisting of eighty “1o” frames with the direct beam centered on the detector and a crystal-to-detector distance of 420 mm, was collected first. These frames were collected with a constant number of photons per frame. The detector was then translated up into its offset position, again at a crystal-to-detector distance of 420 mm. A total of 320 “0.7o” frames was collected. These frames were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (19Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend : Data Collection and Processing, Oscillation Data Reduction Program. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, United Kingdom1993: 56-62Google Scholar). From 3,249,722 measurements, 1,855,323 reflections were integrated and reduced to 445,013 unique reflections after scaling.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the CPS·IMP complex described here was solved by the technique of molecular replacement (20Rossmann M.G. The Molecular Replacement Method. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc., New York1972Google Scholar) with the software package AMORE (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) and using, as a search model, the complete tetrameric form of CPS previously refined to 2.1 Å resolution (2Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Following rigid body refinement, the model was subjected to least squares refinement at 2.1 Å resolution with the software package TNT (22Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Because there were over 5,800 amino acid residues in the asymmetric unit, the model building and refinement processes were expedited by averaging the electron densities corresponding to the four α,β-heterodimers in the asymmetric unit as described previously (23Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Alternate cycles of rebuilding using this averaged electron density map followed by least squares refinement of the “averaged” model expanded back into the unit cell reduced the R cryst to 20.8% and theR free to 26.5%. For calculation ofR free, 5% of the x-ray data were removed from the reflection file. At this point the entire tetrameric model was adjusted in the unit cell and an additional cycle of least squares refinement conducted leading to an R cryst of 19.2% and an R free of 25.7%. A final cycle of refinement was conducted with all measured x-ray data from 30 to 2.1 Å resulting in an R-factor of 19.3%. Relevant refinement statistics are presented in Table II. The CPS·IMP model described here includes eight ADP molecules, 12 manganese ions, 8 ornithines, 4 inorganic phosphates, 28 potassium ions, 12 chloride ions, 4,037 water molecules, 4 tetraethylammonium ions, and 4 IMP molecules. The following side chains were modeled as multiple conformations: Ser29, Arg130, Glu278, Asp416, Glu655, Glu910, Gln967, and Glu983 in the large subunit and Arg215 in the small subunit of α,β-heterodimer I; Arg145 in the large subunit and Met286 in the small subunit of α,β-heterodimer II; Arg82, Arg222, Arg490, Arg559, Glu591, Lys634, Gln645, Arg652, Glu771, Lys941, Glu1009, and Arg1021 in the large subunit and Gln78 in the small subunit of α,β-heterodimer III and Lys35 and Glu478 in the large subunit of α,β-heterodimer IV. In addition, Cys269 was modeled as sulfenic acid for all four small subunits contained within the asymmetric unit.Table IILeast squares refinement statisticsResolution limits (Å)30.0–2.1R overall(%)aR-factor = Σ‖F o− F c‖/Σ‖F o‖ whereF o is the observed structure-factor amplitude, andF c is the calculated structure-factor amplitude.19.3R free (%)25.7No. of reflections used444,816No. of protein atoms44,374No. of water molecules4037Weighted root mean square deviations from idealityBond length (Å)0.013Bond angle (deg)2.30Planarity (trigonal) (Å)0.005Planarity (other planes) (Å)0.009Torsional angle (degrees)bThe torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement.17.9a R-factor = Σ‖F o− F c‖/Σ‖F o‖ whereF o is the observed structure-factor amplitude, andF c is the calculated structure-factor amplitude.b The torsional angles were not restrained during the refinement. Open table in a new tab The CPS crystals employed in this investigation contained a complete (α,β)4-heterotetramer in the asymmetric unit. Because the four (α,β)-heterodimers are strikingly similar, however, the following discussion will refer only to (α,β)-heterodimer II as deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. Shown in Fig. 2 is the electron density corresponding to the IMP ligand. The nucleotide fits the electron density best with the ribose in the C2′-endo conformation. The purine ring adopts an anti-orientation and is tilted by approximately 156o from the plane of the ribose ring. This is in sharp contrast to those conformations observed for the ADP moieties bound to CPS whereby the bases are tilted by approximately 128o and the ribose rings adopt C3′-endo puckers. All the nucleotide monophosphates contained within the crystallographic asymmetric unit are very well ordered with the IMP bound to (α,β)-heterodimer II having an average temperature factor of 30.5 Å2. The allosteric domain of CPS (Ser937 to Lys1073) is characterized by a five-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked on either side by two and three α-helices, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the IMP ligand is situated at the C-terminal end of this sheet and, indeed, is completely contained within the allosteric domain as originally predicted (1Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A close-up view of the IMP binding pocket is displayed in Fig.3 a and a cartoon of potential hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the protein is shown in Fig.3 b. As indicated by the gray spheres in Fig. 3 a, there are three water molecules located within a 5 Å sphere of the purine nucleotide. One side of the hypoxanthine ring is packed against a fairly hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile1001, Val1028, and Ile1029. The only direct electrostatic contact between the purine base and the protein occurs between O-6 of the hypoxanthine ring and N of Val994. A water molecule is located within 3.0 Å to N-1 of the purine base. Both Nδ2 of Asn1015 and Oγ of Thr1017 serve to anchor the 2′-OH group of the ribose to the protein. The 3′-OH group of the ribose lies within hydrogen bonding distance to O of Thr1016. All three phosphoryl oxygens form direct hydrogen bonds with the protein via the side chain functional groups of Lys954, Thr974, Thr977, and Lys993 as indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 3 b. In addition, the backbone amide groups of Gly976 and Thr977 also lie within hydrogen bonding distance to two of the phosphoryl oxygens. Approximately 90% of the surface area for the nucleotide ligand is buried upon binding to CPS as calculated with the program GRASP and employing a search radius of 1.4 Å (24Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). The original structure of CPS was solved in the presence of both Mn2+ADP and ornithine to 2.8 Å resolution (1Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In that model, two ornithine binding sites per α,β-heterodimer were identified. The first ornithine was shown to bridge the C-domain of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component to the allosteric domain. The second ornithine, along with an inorganic phosphate, was positioned at the C-terminal end of the β-sheet in the allosteric domain. At that time, it was postulated that the combination of ornithine and inorganic phosphate was most likely mimicking the mode of binding for such nucleotide ligands as UMP and IMP. For the subsequent x-ray data collection and analysis of the CPS model to 2.1 Å resolution, the crystals were first soaked in a solution containing 25 mmglutamine in an attempt to label the active site of the small subunit. Although the glutamine did not bind in the active site in this study, it did, however, displace the ornithine from its binding pocket in the allosteric domain (2Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A superposition of this ligand binding site, as observed in the refined structure of CPS, onto the present CPS·IMP model is depicted in Fig.4. The phosphoryl group of the nucleotide occupies a nearly identical position to that observed for the inorganic phosphate. This phosphate binding region is positioned at the N-terminal region of an α-helix formed by Thr974 to Gly982. It can thus be speculated that both hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions with the positive end of the helix dipole serve to promote binding of phosphate moieties to this region of the allosteric domain. The only two side chains that adopt significantly different conformations between the two models are Ile1001 and Ile1029 where their dihedral angles differ by approximately 120–130o. Other than these side chains, the two CPS complexes are remarkably similar, such that 5,744 of their backbone atoms coincide with a root mean square deviation of 0.31 Å. Recently, Bueso et al. (25Bueso J. Cervera J. Fresquet V. Marina A. Lusty C.J. Rubio V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3910-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) demonstrated that IMP bound to CPS can be photocrosslinked to the large subunit in very low yield. The only amino acid residue labeled after photoirradiation was shown to be His995. Site-directed mutagenesis of His995 to an alanine residue had relatively little effect on either the catalytic or regulatory properties of CPS. In the crystal structure of the CPS·IMP complex reported here, the imidazole ring of His995 is approximately 4 Å from the hypoxanthine ring of the nucleotide monophosphate. The biochemical results of Bueso et al. (25Bueso J. Cervera J. Fresquet V. Marina A. Lusty C.J. Rubio V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3910-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are thus entirely consistent with the fact that His995 does not significantly contribute to the binding site for IMP. In CPS, the IMP ligand binds to the C-terminal portion of a parallel β-sheet. A search of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank reveals that other enzymes have been solved in the presence of IMP, or analogs thereof, including adenoylsuccinate synthetase (26Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Detailed x-ray crystallographic analyses of this enzyme have demonstrated that the IMP ribose adopts the C2′-endo pucker with the purine base oriented similarly to that observed in CPS (26Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, the phosphoryl group of the nucleotide is positioned within approximately 5 Å of the N-terminal end of an α-helix formed by Gly132 to Ala142. The IMP moiety is deeply buried within the protein such that only about 1% of its surface area is exposed to the solvent. Unlike that observed in CPS, the purine ring makes numerous hydrogen bonding contacts with the protein. Note that adenoylsuccinate synthetase catalyzes the production of adenoylsuccinate from IMP, aspartate, and GTP, and in this case, the nucleotide monophosphate is a true substrate. With regard to the role of IMP acting solely as an effector molecule, however, the only other observed structural example of IMP binding within an allosteric pocket is that of glycogen phosphorylase (27Oikonomakos N.G.

In this enzyme, the ribose of the nucleotide adopts the C3′-endo pucker. The ligand is positioned in a rather open region of the molecule with approximately 48% of its surface area exposed to the solvent, the hypoxanthine ring facing outwards and no direct protein contacts to the base. Other than the similarities in ribose puckers between CPS and adenoylsuccinate synthetase, the tertiary motifs employed for IMP binding in these three enzymes are quite different. The overall spatial relationships between the active sites of the small and large subunits of CPS and the IMP and ornithine effector binding pockets are depicted in Fig. 5. The ornithine and IMP binding sites are separated by approximately 12 Å, whereas the ornithine binding region and active site in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component are situated approximately 14 Å apart. Previously, it was demonstrated that allosteric ligands such as IMP and ornithine affect the carbamoyl phosphate-dependent ATP synthesis reaction more so than the other two partial reactions catalyzed by CPS (7Braxton B.L. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The manner in which the IMP allosteric effector site communicates to this Mg2+ATP binding site is most likely via a complicated series of hydrogen bonds. As an example, there is a hydrogen bonding pathway leading directly from the 2′-hydroxyl group of the IMP ribose to one of the phosphoryl oxygens of the Mn2+ADP. This hydrogen bonding network initiates via the interaction between Nδ2 of Asn1015 and the 2′-hydroxyl group of IMP (Fig. 3 b). The backbone amide group of Asn1015 interacts with O of Asp1041. In this region, Oγ of Thr1042 forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of ornithine. In turn, the δ-amino group of ornithine lies within hydrogen bonding distance to O of Asp791, whereas the backbone amide group of Asp791 interacts with O of His788. Finally, the imidazole side chain of His788 hydrogen bonds to a phosphoryl oxygen of the Mn2+ADP moiety. Examination of the CPS·IMP complex model described in this report demonstrates that additional hydrogen bonding networks may also exist between the IMP binding pocket and the active site of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetic component. From previous biochemical studies (13Boettcher B. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5977-5980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Boettcher B. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13971-13976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Anderson P.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is known that IMP and UMP compete for the same binding site on CPS. It can thus be speculated that the structure of CPS described here reveals not only the manner in which IMP is accommodated on the enzyme but also the mode of UMP binding to the allosteric domain, at least as far as the phosphoryl and sugar moieties are concerned. Recent detailed kinetic analyses of the behavior of CPS in the presence of IMP, UMP, or ornithine or combinations thereof have revealed a quite complicated set of catalytic behaviors (17Braxton B.L. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Reinhart G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1394-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, these studies have demonstrated that though both ornithine, an activator, and UMP, an inhibitor, can bind simultaneously to CPS, the activating effect of ornithine on the catalytic activity of CPS clearly prevails. What is not apparent from the present structural studies is the manner in which the enzyme discriminates between UMP and IMP. It would appear likely that the same molecular contacts are made to the ribose-phosphate moieties of UMP and IMP in the bound complexes. However, in the structure of IMP complexed to CPS, relatively few contacts are made to the hypoxanthine ring system. We anticipate that a significant molecular rearrangement occurs upon the binding of UMP to CPS that is not observed in the present model. These structural manifestations can only be elucidated via a combination of biochemical and x-ray crystallographic experiments and, indeed, these investigations are in progress. We thank Dr. W. W. Cleland for helpful discussions. The high resolution x-ray data set employed in this structural analysis was collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, which is funded by the Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences."

We show that TFIIFα possesses a serine/threonine kinase activity, allowing an autophosphorylation of the two residues at position serine 385 and threonine 389. Mutation analysis strongly suggests that autophosphorylation of both sites regulates the transcription elongation process. Moreover we also evidence three additional phosphorylation sites located at positions 207–230, 271–283, and 335–344. These sites are phosphorylated by casein kinase II-like kinases and TAFII250, a component of TFIID.

We demonstrate that TFIIFα possesses a serine threonine kinase activity, allowing an autophosphorylation of the two residues at position serine 385 and threonine 389. Mutation analysis strongly suggest that autophosphorylation of both sites regulate the transcription elongation process. Moreover we also evidence three phosphorylation sites located at positions 207–230, 271–283, and 335–344. These sites are phosphorylated by some CKII and TAFII250 kinases. The TFIIFα/pET15b and the TFIIFβ/pVL1392 vectors were described previously (14Dubrovskaya V. Lavigne A.C. Davidson I. Acker J. Staub A. Tora L.

Either serine 385 (TFIIFα S385A) or threonine 389 (TFIIFα T389A) or both residues (TFIIFα S385A/T389A) of TFIIFα were mutated to alanine by polymerase chain reaction amplification to generateSacI/PstI fragments, which were further inserted into the SacI/PstI-digested TFIIFα/pAcAB3 plasmid. The sequences of the 5′ primers are: TFIIFα S385A, 5′-GGAGGGAGCTCAAGGGGCAACGCCCGCCCAGGCACGCCC-3′; TFIIFα T389A, 5′-GGAGGGAGCTCAAGGGGCAACAGCCGCCCAGGCGCCCCC-3′; TFIIFα S385A/T389A, 5′-GGAGGGAGCTCAAGGGGCAACGCCCGCCCAGGCG CCCCC3, and the sequence of the 3′ primer is 5′-GCCGCAACCGCTTGGCTGCAGGC-3′. Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells (typically 2.5 × 108) were then coinfected with either wild type TFIIFα or TFIIFα-S385A, -T389A, or -S385A/T389A mutants and TFIIFβ baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and 2 plaque-forming units/cell. Cells were collected 48 h postinfection, washed with 20 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then dounced in 15 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture (35Adamczewski J.P. Rossignol M. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The extract was centrifuged (20,000 × g, 1 h) at 4 °C and loaded onto a 15-ml phosphocellulose P11 column (2.5 × 6 cm, flow rate: 0.25 ml/min) equilibrated in buffer A. Step gradient elutions were performed sequentially with 5 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.3, 0.6, and 1 m KCl. TFIIF eluted at 0.6 m KCl was dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1 mKCl before being applied onto a DEAE-5PW (Toso-Haas) (0.75 × 7.5 cm, flow rate: 0.6 ml/min). Proteins were eluted with a 12-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.6 m KCl in buffer B. The TFIIF containing fractions of the DEAE-5PW column (0.3 ml, peak 0.25m KCl) were pooled and used for subsequent experiments. Highly purified wild type (from HeLa cells or recombinant) or mutated TFIIF either free or immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies designed against the α subunit are incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 15 mm MgCl2, 30 mmKCl) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions are stopped by the addition of protein loading buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Phosphorylation of rTFIIF S385A/T389A andEscherichia coli TFIIF was in some case performed in the presence of 0.5 unit of casein kinase II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or HeLa whole cell extract. To evaluate the intrinsic kinase activity of TFIIFα, an in-gel kinase assay was performed. In brief, rTFIIF (400 ng) is resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins are renatured by successive washes at room temperature for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 2.5% Triton X-100; then in the kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 2.5% Triton X-100; and finally in the kinase buffer. The kinase reaction was then initiated by addition of 35 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 90 min at 30 °C. The gel was washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate, stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographied. When indicated, phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping by amino acid sequence analysis were performed on autophosphorylated rTFIIF (10 μg) or on rTFIIF S385A/T389A (10 μg) phosphorylated with 200 ng of HeLa WCE as described in Ref. 36Rochette-Egly C.

The reaction was chased as indicated by addition of 100 μm cold CTP, 2 μm UTP, and 10 ng of either the wild type rTFIIF or rTFIIF mutants. Transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea. In vitro transcription assays using recombinant transcription factors and RNA pol II were used as described earlier (37Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that TFIIFα is phosphorylated in vitroas well as in vivo (12Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Ohkuma Y. Roeder R.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29970-29977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, we noticed that highly purified TFIIF was phosphorylated even in the absence of any additional kinase. To further analyze the potential enzymatic activity of TFIIF, in vitro kinase assays were performed with either purified endogenous TFIIF (hereafter referred to as eTFIIF) or purified recombinant TFIIF (hereafter referred to as rTFIIF). eTFIIF was purified from HeLa WCE on heparin-Ultrogel, DEAE-Spherodex, heparin-5PW and phenyl-5PW columns (37Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phenyl-5PW eluted fraction (0.65 m ammonium sulfate) was used for all subsequent experiments. rTFIIF was overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells coinfected with baculoviruses encoding the α (TFIIFα) and the β (TFIIFβ) subunits, respectively, and further purified from cytoplasmic cell extract on phosphocellulose and DEAE columns (Fig.1 A). The baculovirus expression system was preferred to expression in E. colibecause post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are similar to those observed in mammalian system. To further eliminate contaminating enzymatic activities, eTFIIF and rTFIIF were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antiboby raised against the α subunit (Ab-TFIIFα) cross-linked to protein G-Sepharose beads, and the immuno-adsorbed proteins were extensively washed at high salt concentration (1 m KCl). The immobilized proteins were assayed for kinase activity in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and in the absence of any additional substrate, before being resolved on SDS-PAGE (41Roy R. Schaeffer L. Humbert S. Vermeulen W. Weeda G. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9826-9832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody directed toward the α subunit is able to precipitate not only rTFIIFα, but also rTFIIFβ in a stoichiometric amount (Fig. 1 A, compare lane 2 with lane 1). This immunoprecipitation is highly specific, since no other additional polypeptide, except the heavy and the light chain of immunoglobulin, are present. Moreover as shown on the autoradiogram, a radiolabeled polypeptide having the same electrophoretic mobility as TFIIFα is observed, suggesting that TFIIF is phosphorylated (Fig. 1, comparelanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and4, respectively). Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrates that the phosphorylation occurs at serine and threonine residues on both rTFIIFα and eTFIIFα (Fig.1 B and data not shown). In order to identify phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues, a phosphopeptide mapping analysis was performed. In vitro phosphorylated 32P-rTFIIFα was trypsin-digested, and peptides were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography. Microsequencing of the single radiolabeled oligopeptide, encompassing residues 383–402 of TFIIFα, evidenced the two autophosphorylation sites (Fig. 2,AuPS). A careful analysis of the dehydro-amino acid derivative resulting from Edman degradation reaction reveals that serine and threonine at position 385 (Ser-385) and 389 (Thr-389) are phosphorylated. Together, these experiments suggest that TFIIFα is efficiently phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation is catalyzed by either a serine/threonine protein kinase tightly associated with TFIIF or by one of the subunits of TFIIF. To further demonstrate the presence of some kinase activity associated with TFIIF, we performed an in-gel kinase assay. This assay discriminates between intrinsic TFIIF-mediated kinase activity versuscontaminating kinase copurifying with TFIIF. After SDS-PAGE, TFIIF subunits were renatured by repeated washings of the gel and then subjected to kinase reaction in the gel in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.3 A). This allows detecting a single radioactive polypeptide that possesses the same apparent molecular weight as TFIIFα, revealing that TFIIFα autophosphorylates independently of the presence of TFIIFβ. This latter result was further confirmed by measuring the in vitro kinase activity of either rTFIIF (composed of α and β subunits) or the α subunit (rTFIIFα) overproduced in insect cells and purified as described above. Under these conditions, TFIIFα is phosphorylated regardless of the presence of TFIIFβ (Fig.3 B, compare lane 3 with lane 4). However, we consistently observed a higher autophosphorylation rate of TFIIFα when TFIIFβ was not present in the kinase reaction. Indeed, quantification of the radioactive signals corresponding to TFIIFα reveals that in the absence of TFIIFβ the kinase activity of TFIIFα is about 2.5 times greater. To characterize the autophosphorylation activity of TFIIFα, time course and dose-response experiments were performed. The autophosphorylation activity is linear between 1 and 30 min and reaches a plateau after 30 min (Fig.4 A). This activity exhibits a linear dependence during 15-min reaction (Fig. 4 B). We also found that ATP, dATP, and GTP all act as cofactors for the TFIIFα kinase in competition assays, while CTP or cAMP had no effect on the phosphorylation of TFIIFα (data not shown). Next, we tested the potential transphosphorylation activity of TFIIFα by using either standard serine/threonine substrates such as histone H1 and casein or a variety of substrates involved in basal transcription such as TFIIB, TBP, TFIID, TFIIEα, TFIIEβ, TFIIH, and the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA pol II. Under our experimental conditions, none of these substrates was phosphorylated by TFIIFα (data not shown). Since the adenosine analogue 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) is known to inhibit RNA pol II elongation and several kinases such as P-TEFb (42Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and TFIIH-associated kinase (43Yankulov K. Yamashita K. Roy R. Egly J.M. Bentley D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23922-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we tested whether it could be used as an inhibitor of TFIIF kinase activity. Kinase assays were carried out with highly purified rTFIIF in the presence of increasing amounts of DRB (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–6). The autophosphorylation activity of TFIIF is very sensitive to DRB, with a 50% inhibition point (IC50) of 7 mm(Fig. 4, C and D). We have demonstrated that TFIIFα is phosphorylated on Ser-385 and Thr-389; we next tested whether the phosphorylation of these two residues has any effect on the transcriptional activity of TFIIF. Therefore Ser-385 and Thr-389 residues were, individually or together, mutated to alanine, giving rise to three recombinant baculoviruses encoding rTFIIFα/S385A, rTFIIFα/T389A, and the double mutant rTFIIFα S385A/T389A. These three baculoviruses were coinfected separately with the baculovirus encoding TFIIFβ. Wild type rTFIIF and rTFIIF mutants were purified and tested in an in vitrokinase assay as described above. None of the rTFIIFα mutants are phosphorylated, whereas the wild type rTFIIFα is phosphorylated (Fig.5 A, compare lane 1with lanes 2–4), demonstrating that phosphorylation requires the presence of both Ser-385 and Thr-389 residues to occur. The rTFIIF mutants were then tested in an in vitro run-off transcription assay in the presence of the adenovirus major late promoter as a DNA template, RNA pol II, the basal transcription factors TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIH, and either wild type rTFIIF or mutated rTFIIF (as indicated at the top of Fig. 5 B). Transcriptions were performed in the presence of equal amounts of each mutated protein in subsaturating concentration of wild type rTFIIF, as judged in titration experiments (data not shown). Neither the single nor the double mutations at position Ser-385 and Thr-389 of TFIIFα appear to modify the transcription activity of TFIIF (Fig.5 B, compare lane 1 with lanes 2–4, and see the quantification of three independent experiments at the lowest part of the panel). Since TFIIF is a basal transcription factor that functions in both transcription initiation and elongation, we tested whether TFIIFα mutations affect its elongation activity, using a standard “tailed template” assay (38Tan S. Aso T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay allows the synthesis of defined RNA transcripts in the absence of factors required for promoter-specific initiation. The transcription template is a linearized double-stranded plasmid that has been modified by addition of a 3′ oligo(dC) tail to one of its termini. RNA pol II binds the oligo(dC) tail and initiates transcription rapidly and specifically within the first 6 (dC) residues adjacent to the duplex DNA terminus (44Dedrick R.L. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The increase in size of the RNA transcripts is directly proportional to the rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA pol II. Transcription of the oligo(dC)-tailed plasmid template was initiated by RNA pol II, in the absence of UTP, but in the presence of ATP, GTP, and 2 μm[α-32P]CTP. As diagrammed in Fig. 5 C, the first and second groups of nontemplate strand (dT) residues are ∼135 and ∼250 nt downstream of the oligo(dC) tail, respectively. During the pulse phase, transcripts of ∼135 nt accumulate, and after 15 min, these transcripts were chased with 100 μm cold CTP and 2 μm UTP in the absence or the presence of subsaturating amounts of wild type rTFIIF or equal amounts of rTFIIF mutants. In the absence of TFIIF or in the presence of each of the TFIIF subunits (data not shown), transcripts of ∼250 nt are synthesized at a very slow rate, starting at t = 16 min (Fig. 5, lane 7), whereas in the presence of wild type rTFIIF, transcripts are accumulated more rapidly at t = 4 min (lane 12) and chased into longer products (lanes 15–28), indicating that TFIIF increased the rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA pol II through these sites. In the presence of wild type rTFIIF, synthesis of 280 nt (lane 15) and 309 nt transcripts (lane 17) occurs after 12 and 20 min chase, respectively, whereas in the presence of rTFIIF S385A/T389A the 280-nt (lane 23) and the 309-nt transcripts (lane 25) appear earlier at 8- and 16-min chase, respectively. In this case (that repeatedly was reproduced), the rate of elongation by RNA pol II is slightly increased, thus demonstrating that the autophosphorylation of TFIIF may down-regulate the RNA pol II elongation activity. It was demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of TFIIF can be regulated by phosphorylation of the α subunit (40Kitajima S. Chibazakura T. Yonaha M. Yasukochi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29970-29977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that residues S385 and T389 of TFIIFα are the targets of a phosphorylation event. To further evaluate whether the regulation of TFIIF transcription activity involves other phosphorylation sites than the two presently identified, in vitro kinase assays were carried out in the presence or in the absence of HeLa WCE using the mutated rTFIIF S385A/T389A as a substrate (which was previously immunoprecipitated with Ab-TFIIFα). After 30 min of incubation, the beads were extensively washed, and the immunoabsorbed proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig.6 A, a radiolabeled polypeptide having the same electrophoretic mobility as TFIIFα is observed, indicating that in such conditions, TFIIF is efficiently phosphorylated (compare lanes 2 and 3). The radiolabeled polypeptide does not correspond to endogenous TFIIFα present in HeLa WCE, since it is not observed in the presence of HeLa WCE alone (Fig.6 A, compare lanes 1 and 3). In order to identify these phosphorylation sites, a phosphopeptide mapping analysis was performed on the radiolabeled rTFIIFaS385A/T389A after digestion by either trypsin or Glu-C endoproteinase. Microsequencing analysis shows that the 32P labeling is found within three oligopeptides 207–230, 271–283, and 335–344 of TFIIFα (Fig. 2,PS); each of them contains a CKII consensus phosphorylation motif, which is well conserved among different species. Indeed, we observed that CKII is able to phosphorylate both rTFIIF S385A/T389A mutant (Fig. 6 A, lane 4), as well as TFIIFα overexpressed in E. coli (Fig. 6 B). Trypsin digests of both radiolabeled polypeptides further confirm that the CKII consensus motifs are effectively phosphorylated (data not shown). Moreover, using partially purified TFIID (37Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed a weak but significant phosphorylation of TFIIFα (Fig. 6 C, lane 2). This may be explained by the fact that TAFII250 selectively phosphorylates the PS1 site (33Yonaha M. Tsuchiya T. Yasukochi Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It should be also noticed that TFIIFα overproduced in E. coli is weakly autophosphorylated (Fig. 6 B, lane 1), thus suggesting a potential cooperative effect between the various phosphorylation processes. In the course of this study, we have determined that the largest subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIIFα is the target of several phosphorylation processes. First, according to the in-gel kinase assay and microsequencing analysis, TFIIFα, which possesses a serine/threonine kinase activity, autophosphorylates at position Ser-385 and Thr-389. Careful screening of the TFIIFα amino acid sequence, however, did not reveal any known consensus kinase motifs. Second, we identified three other additional phosphorylated domains of TFIIFα. These oligopeptides at positions 207–230, 271–283, and 335–344 (Fig. 2), which contain the CKII consensus phosphorylation motif (SXXE/D), are indeed the target of the CKII kinase as well as of kinases present in HeLa WCE, as shown by in vitrokinase assays followed by microsequencing analysis. Interestingly, using purified TFIID, we observed a weak but significant phosphorylation of TFIIFα, likely due to the presence of TAFII250 (12Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 33Yonaha M. Tsuchiya T. Yasukochi Y.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). TAFII250, the largest component of the TFIID protein complex, and another component of the basal transcription machinery, indeed possesses a kinase activity (45O'Brien T. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 905-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TAFII250 autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates TFIIFα with which it interacts (12Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of rTFIIFαS385A/T389A and E. coli TFIIFα by TAFII250 is much weaker than by HeLa WCE (data not shown and Fig. 6 C, lane 1), thus likely explaining the specific phosphorylation of the PS1 oligopeptide motif previously identified (33Yonaha M. Tsuchiya T. Yasukochi Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this case, we failed to map the phosphorylated site(s), since TFIIFα was weakly phosphorylated by both TFIID and TAFII250. We also show here that abrogation of the two autophosphorylation sites of TFIIFα results in an up-regulation of the transcription reaction. Compared with wild type TFIIF, addition of rTFIIFαS385A/T389A, which cannot autophosphorylate, increased the rate of elongation of the transcription and as such may participate to the initial burst of RNA synthesis, further followed by a lower rate of synthesis likely associated with RNA pol II recycling as hypothesized by Lei et al. (24Lei L. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indeed, they have shown that the COOH-terminal domain of TFIIFα (from amino acid 358 to 517) stimulates the CTD phosphatase (which uses the CTD of RNA pol II as a substrate), upon TFIIF/RNA pol II interaction (46Archambault J. Pan G. Dahmus G.K. Cartier M. Marshall N. Zhang S. Dhamus M.E. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27593-27601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It thus is possible that TFIIF autophosphorylation, which decreases the elongation rate, could be one of the first steps implied in the RNA pol II recycling, through some modification of RNA pol II/TFIIF interaction. In such hypothesis, the fact that the autophosphorylation of TFIIFα occurs at the end of the elongation remains to be further established. It cannot be excluded, however, that the variations in the elongation rate (24Lei L. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) might be related to some changes in the overall conformation of the transcription complexes. Whether or not the other identified phosphorylation sites play some role in the transcription initiation step through TAFII250 and/or CKII-like kinases function is still an open question. Indeed, TFIIFα is targeted by TFIIB another basal transcription factor and RNA pol II (27Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 46Archambault J. Pan G. Dahmus G.K. Cartier M. Marshall N. Zhang S. Dhamus M.E. Greenblatt J. J. Biol.

Knowing that TFIIFα has distinct functions in bringing RNA pol II through the various steps of the transcription process (29, 41, 47, and this study), it will be of great interest to further characterize all the components involved in the phospho/dephosphorylation process orchestrating the formation of the preinitiation, the initiation, the elongation, and the termination transcription complexes throughout the gene expression regulatory cascade. Further investigations to understand the connection between autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of TFIIFα with consequence of some changes in the elongation rate and/or in the activation of transcription (46Archambault J.

Two peptides containing the NC1 domain of avian collagen X have been synthesized using a bacterial expression system and their properties characterized. One peptide consists only of the NC1 domain, and the other is a chimeric molecule with a noncollagenous A domain of matrilin-1 fused to the N terminus of NC1. The NC1 peptide alone forms a 45-kDa trimer under native conditions, suggesting that NC1 contains all the information for trimerization without any triple helical residues. This trimeric association is highly thermostable without intermolecular disulfide bonds. This indicates that the NC1 domain contributes to the remarkable structural stability of collagen X. Chemical cross-linking of the NC1 trimer results in a series of varying sized multimers, the smallest of which is a trimer. Therefore the NC1 trimer is sufficient to form higher order multimers. The chimeric A-NC1 peptide forms a homotrimer by itself, and a series of heterotrimers with the NC1 peptide via the NC1 domain. Thus the NC1(X) domain directs multimer formation, even in a noncollagenous molecule.

Type X collagen is expressed specifically by hypertrophic chondrocytes at the transition of cartilage to bone during endochondral bone formation (1Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol.

Type X collagen is essential for the structural organization of the matrix preceding calcification (3Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); the other is in association with type II collagen containing fibrils where it also interacts with proteoglycans (7Chen Q.

This interaction may be critical for the compartmentalization of matrix components during development (9Kwan K.M. Pang M.K. Zhou S. Cowan S.K. Kong R.Y. Pfordte T. Olsen B.R. Sillence D.O. Tam P.P.

The importance of type X collagen during bone development is evidenced by its mutations in a human limb disorder Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD) 1The abbreviations used are: SMCD, Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia; NC1, noncollagenous domain 1; CMP, cartilage matrix protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (10Warman M.L.

Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The type X collagen molecule consists of three α1(X) chains. Each α1(X) chain contains three domains, a central helical domain (COL1) flanked by the C-terminal and N-terminal noncollagenous domains (NC1 and NC2) (12Ninomiya Y. Gordon M. van der Rest M. Schmid T. Linsenmayer T. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5041-5050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal NC1 domain appears to be essential for at least some of the functions of type X collagen, because most of the mutations identified in the SMCD patients have been localized there (13Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14McIntosh I. Abbott M.H. Francomano C.A. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The NC1 domain of type X collagen is highly conserved among species (15Reichenberger E. Aigner T. von der Mark K. Stoss H. Bertling W. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 562-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), with that of the human and avian molecules sharing 77.7% identity at the amino acid level. Potentially important structural features, such as 13 tyrosine residues, an unpaired cysteine residue, and a putative N-linked oligosaccharide attachment site are all conserved within the NC1 domain of human and avian type X collagen. Also, all the residues within the NC1 domain mutated in the SMCD patients are conserved between human and avian α1(X). These data, when taken together, suggest that the NC1 domain of type X from different species plays a similar or identical roles, such as in the assembly of type X collagen. It has been proposed that the NC1 of type X is important for the triple helical assembly of the collagen, similar to the function of the NC1 domains from fibrillar collagens (10Warman M.L. Abbott M.

In addition, the NC1 domain of type X collagen may perform other functions. Unlike the procollagen C-terminal extensions, which are removed after a helix is assembled and secreted, the intact type X with the NC1 domain is found in hypertrophic cartilage matrix (17Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 20: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It may mediate intermolecular associations of type X, such as formation of a hexagonal lattice (6Kwan A.P. Cummings C.E. Chapman J.A. Grant M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and interactions with proteoglycans (7Chen Q. Linsenmayer C. Gu H. Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J.

Recent cloning data have shown that there is a family of molecules, which include both collagenous and noncollagenous molecules, that contain a homologous NC1 domain at their C termini (Fig.1). The collagenous molecules include α1(X); α1 and α2 chains of type VIII collagen (18Yamaguchi N. Mayne R. Ninomiya Y. J. Biol.

The noncollagenous molecules include two chains of precerebellin, which are expressed specifically in cerebellum during neurogenesis and synapse formation (24Kavety B. Jenkins N.A. Fletcher C.F.

The functions of NC1 in these noncollagenous molecules are not known. In this study, we have analyzed the functions of the NC1 domain by expressing and characterizing two noncollagenous peptides containing the NC1 domain from avian α1(X). The peptide comprised only of the NC1 domain, is sufficient to form a trimer and a series of higher order multimers of this trimeric unit. The other peptide comprised of the NC1 domain plus a noncollagenous A domain from cartilage matrix protein (matrilin 1) at the N terminus, forms homotrimers by itself, and a series of heterotrimers with the NC1 peptide. These data suggest that the NC1 domain of collagen X functions as a novel nucleation site for trimer and multimer formation, both for collagenous and noncollagenous molecules. For the NC1 construct, a cDNA fragment correspondent to the 162 amino acid sequence of the NC1 domain from avian α1(X) (Thr513 to Ile674) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a plasmid pNY3116 (12Ninomiya Y. Gordon M. van der Rest M. Schmid T. Linsenmayer T. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5041-5050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27LuValle P. Ninomiya Y. Rosenblum N.D. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18378-18385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction primers (5′-GCC CCG GGA CAA TCC CAG AAG GTT AT-3′, and 5′-ATA AGC TTA GAT TTG AGC AAA TAG-3′) contained a XbaI and aHindIII site at the respective 5′ and 3′ end. The fragment was then cloned into a pQE32 (type IV) (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) to carry a six histidine-tag at its N terminus. For the A-NC1 construct, a cDNA fragment (582 base pairs) of the A2 domain from avian cartilage matrix protein (CMP) was amplified from a mini-CMP cDNA (28Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with a pair of primers carrying XbaI sites (5′-TTC CCG GGG CTT GCA GTG GTG GGT CA-3′, 5′-TTC CCG GGA TCT TCC TCA ACG CAG AT-3′). After digestion with XbaI, the A2 fragment was ligated into the XbaI site 5′ upstream of the NC1 insert in the expression vector. This ligation created a chimeric molecule with the A2 domain at its 5′ end and the NC1 domain at its 3′ end. Both cDNA constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct reading frame and no spontaneous point mutations. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into competent M15 Escherichia coli. The expression of the His-tagged peptides were induced with 2 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. Cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm lysozyme, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and incubated in ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was loaded on Ni-NTA slurry column (Qiagen). After washing with washing buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, 40 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), the recombinant peptide was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, 300 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Cell pellets were incubated in urea lysis buffer (8m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at room temperature overnight with shaking. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was loaded on Ni-NTA slurry column. For purification under denatured conditions, the column was eluted with 8m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 4.5. For refolding, the column was washed with wash buffer (8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3) until A 280 to 0.01, then the slurry was divided into two parts for refolding in liquid and solid phases. For the liquid phase folding, a denatured peptide was eluted with elution buffer (8m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 4.5), followed by dialysis in urea step gradient buffers (6–0 m urea, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4) in an 8 h refolding process. For the solid phase folding, the peptide was first refolded on the column with the same urea step gradient buffers over the same period of time (8 h). After refolding, the peptide was eluted with imidazole elution buffer (400 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4). For co-refolding of the NC1 and A2-NC1 peptides, equal amounts of the bacterial cultures expressing the NC1 and A2-NC1 peptides were mixed. The peptide mixture was purified and refolded on a solid phase, identical to the procedure for a single peptide described above. The concentration of total protein was determined with BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Cross-linking was carried out with BS3(Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate) (Pierce), a water-insoluble, homobifunction-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester analog (spacer arm length 11.4 Å). 10 μm of the refolded NC1 peptides were mixed with various concentration of BS3 and incubated at room temperature with a gentle shake for 1 h followed by adding Tris-HCl buffer (final concentration: 50 mm) to stop the reaction. The samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE for electrophoresis. For reducing conditions, samples were mixed with 5× SDS gel loading buffer containing 15% β-mercaptoethanol, 15% SDS, 1.5% bromphenol blue, and 50% glycerol. For nonreducing conditions, the 4× loading buffer contains 16% SDS and 1% bromphenol blue. Sometimes the nonreducing buffer contains 2 m urea. The presence of urea in loading buffer does not affect dissociation properties of NC1 peptides. Samples were boiled for 10 min before loading when required. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Refolded NC1 peptides (300 μg/ml in 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 500 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4) were prepared for mass spectrometry by the dried droplet method in which the protein solution and a solution of sinapinic acid matrix (0.5 μl each) were mixed and air-dried. The crystals were then rinsed with 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Spectrum was obtained with STR Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA). It primarily shows the monomeric NC1 (20,554 Da), with small peaks corresponding to dimer (41,102 Da) and trimer (61,687 Da). Another spectrum was obtained in similar fasion but after heating the sample to 90 °C for 5 min with similar results. To characterize the function of the NC1(X) domain, two molecules containing this domain were created. The first peptide, NC1, consists of the C-terminal 162 amino acid residues of α1(X), and thus comprises the entire NC1 domain (Fig.2 A). This peptide is devoid of any triple helical (Gly-X-Y) residues, and thus can be used to test whether the NC1 domain alone is sufficient to form a trimer and higher order multimers. To test whether the NC1 domain is sufficient to direct trimer formation of a noncollagenous molecule, the second peptide, A-NC1, is comprised of two domains: the NC1 domain at the C terminus and the entire A2 domain (194 amino acid residues) of avian CMP at the N terminus (Fig.2 B). Previous studies (29Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Hofer U. Chen Q. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23150-23154Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have used a mini-CMP, which comprises a heptad-repeat domain at the C terminus and the A2 domain at the N terminus (Fig. 2 B), to demonstrate that the heptad-repeat domain forms a three-chain coiled-coil thereby facilitating the trimer formation of the molecule. This trimer then is covalently stabilized by the intermolecular disulfide bonds involving the two cysteines at the N terminus of the heptad repeat (29Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Hofer U. Chen Q. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23150-23154Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The chimeric peptide construct that we designed deleted the coiled-coil domain and the cysteine residues, and replaced these with the X-NC1 domain. If the NC1 domain functions as the coiled-coil domain, it would direct trimer formation of the A-NC1, as does the coiled-coil in mini-CMP. Finally, the two peptides, A-NC1 and NC1, would be refolded together in vitro. This is to test whether they form heterotrimers via the NC1 domain. The number of the co-refolding products would confirm their trimeric states (i.e. four products are expected for the formation of trimers) (Fig.2 C). We observed that E. coli containing a His-tag bacterial expression vector encoding the NC1 domain assembled the newly synthesized peptides into a trimeric form under native conditions. Upon induction by isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside, E. coliexpressed a 20-kDa peptide (Fig.3 A). This is the molecular mass predicted from the amino acid sequence of the peptide, and also of the NC1 monomer from authentic type X collagen (30Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The expressed His-tagged NC1 peptide, when affinity purified from cytoplasm using Ni-NTA resin under native conditions, produced a His-tag protein that migrated on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 45 kDa (Fig.3 B, lane 2). This apparent molecular weight is the same as that of the NC1 trimer isolated by bacterial collagenase digestion of authentic type X collagen from avian hypertrophic chondrocytes (30Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The NC1 trimer is 45 kDa instead of 60 kDa, because of its compact conformation (30Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for a trimeric form will be presented later. Some of the 45-kDa band was shifted to 20-kDa monomer after heating at 100 °C in a SDS-containing buffer (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). This suggests that the native NC1 peptide alone is sufficient to form a trimer. Analysis of the intracellular location of the recombinant protein within the bacteria indicated that less than 10% of the protein was in a soluble form; more than 90% of the recombinant protein was insoluble in inclusion bodies (data not shown). To isolate large quantities of the recombinant protein for further analysis, the insoluble fraction was purified under denaturing conditions. The denatured peptide existed as a 20-kDa monomer, and a 40-kDa putative dimer. However, no 45-kDa trimeric form was visible (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). The denatured peptide was tested for its ability to undergo refolding in solution by a step wise dilution of denaturants (see “Materials and Methods”). The resulting material formed an insoluble precipitate that upon SDS-PAGE analysis was still monomers and dimers (Fig.4, lanes 2 and 3). We reasoned that to achieve the native trimeric state may require that the NC1 peptide monomers first undergo intramolecular folding to achieve a stable monomeric configuration, before they undergo intermolecular association to form a trimer. To test this hypothesis, we prevented premature intermolecular aggregation by immobilizing one end of the peptide through its His-tag to a Ni-NTA column. The immobilized peptide was then renatured with the same step wise dilution of denaturants as employed in solution. After the solid-phase refolding, the renatured material that was eluted from the column was a 45-kDa trimer (Fig. 4, lane 4). It was shifted to a 20-kDa monomer after heating at 100 °C (Fig. 4, lane 5). To demonstrate that the refolded NC1, seen as a 45-kDa band on gels, was actually a trimer, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry was performed. The refolded peptides were subject to dissociation process by removing salts from the solution. The resulting spectrum primarily showed the monomeric peak at 20.6 kDa, with small dimer and trimer peaks at 41.1 and 61.7 kDa, respectively. Thus, the refolded NC1 was a trimer with a molecular mass of 61.7 kDa. To determine the thermal stability of the NC1 domain, the refolded NC1 peptides were incubated at different temperatures (70, 80, 90, and 100 °C) before analysis by SDS-PAGE. The trimers were resistant to thermal denaturation up to 90 °C under reducing conditions (Fig.5). At 90 °C, the majority of the NC1 domain still remained as trimers (Fig. 5). Only at 100 °C were the trimers separated completely into monomers (Fig. 5). To determine whether disulfide bonds were involved in the thermal stability of the NC1 domain, the NC1 trimers were incubated in the absence of reducing reagents. Similar to the results under reducing conditions, the trimers became completely separated only at 100 °C (Fig. 5). Thus, disulfide bonds were not involved in the thermal stability of the NC1 trimer. To further characterize the association of the NC1 peptides, we performed a cross-linking experiment with a cross-linker BS3. The spacer arm length of BS3 is 11.4 Å. Therefore, neighboring peptides whose distance is equal to or less than 11.4 Å will be covalently cross-linked by BS3. The refolded NC1 peptides were incubated in a series of solutions with different concentrations of BS3 (Fig. 6). In a solution with an equal ratio of cross-linker to NC1, a ladder of bands appeared above the trimer (Fig. 6, arrows in themiddle panel). The smallest of this series of bands was the 45-kDa NC1 trimer. Therefore, the NC1 trimer formed higher order multimers in solution. After heating to 100 °C, the cross-linked sample included, in the least, monomers (20 kDa), dimers (40 kDa), and trimers (60 kDa) (Fig. 6, arrows in theright panel). The unheated native NC1 trimer migrated at the 45-kDa position faster than a heated denatured trimer. This is probably because of the compact configuration of the native peptides. With excessive cross-linker (1,000 times of that of NC1), the NC1 peptides remained as a high molecular polymer under both heating and nonheating conditions (Fig. 6, arrowheads). To test whether the NC1 domain facilitates trimer formation of a noncollagenous molecule, a chimeric A-NC1 peptide was purified under denatured conditions and refolded on a solid phase. With SDS-PAGE performed without heating, this material contained three forms (Fig.7). The smallest was the 40-kDa form, the predicted molecular mass of an A-NC1 monomer. The second was 100 kDa, consistent with a native trimeric form following refolding (see below). The third was 200 kDa, twice the molecular mass of the trimer and most probably a hexamer. After heating to 100 °C, both of the multimeric forms shifted to the monomeric 40-kDa form (Fig. 7). To demonstrate that the 100-kDa form was, in fact, an A-NC1 trimer, denatured A-NC1 peptide was refolded together with the NC1 peptide. If both the A-NC1 and the NC1 peptides form trimers, co-refolding of these two peptides should result in four products, the 100 kDa (A-NC1)3, the 45 kDa (NC1)3, and two heterotrimers (A-NC1)2NC1 and A-NC1(NC1)2between 100 and 45 kDa (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of the (A-NC1)2NC1 should be above 72.5 kDa (the average of the molecular weights of the two homotrimers), and the molecular mass of the A-NC1(NC1)2 is expected to be below 72.5 kDa. Upon analysis by SDS-PAGE, the co-refolded material shows the predicted four products (Fig. 8). Thus, the A-NC1 peptide and the NC1 peptide can form heterotrimers via the NC1 domain. In collagens, it is well established that triple helix formation is initiated at the carboxyl-terminal end, where the individual chains are maintained in register by interchain disulfide links (31Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In some collagens (e.g. homotrimer type XII collagen), disulfide bond formation requires triple helix and thus will not occur in the absence of prolylhydroxylase (32Mazzorana M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3029-3032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of the type IX collagen NC1 heterotrimers also requires some adjacent triple helical segments, although in this case, a triple helical conformation is not necessary (33Mechling D.E. Gambee J.E. Morris N.P. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Mayne R. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13781-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The trimeric NC1 domain of avian type X collagen is unique in that it does not contain interchain disulfide bonds. Another puzzling fact is that a homologous NC1(X) domain has been found at the C terminus of some molecules that do not contain any triple helical sequences at all (Fig. 1). We have demonstrated here that peptides of the NC1 domain of type X are sufficient to form trimers without adjacent triple helical segments. This suggests that the NC1 domain alone is sufficient for chain association and proper trimeric assembly. The NC1(X) forms an extraordinary stable trimer without any disulfide bonds. The trimeric interaction of the NC1 is resistant to denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE, as is that of the native molecule (30Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Under such conditions noncovalently linked subunits of most molecules would be dissociated. For example, the CMP trimer, which is held together by a C-terminal coiled-coil, is dissociated into monomers under denaturing conditions if disulfide bonds are not present (29Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Hofer U. Chen Q. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23150-23154Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown that, when the coiled-coil domain of CMP is replaced by the NC1 domain, the NC1 domain is able to hold the mini-CMP trimer together under such reducing conditions. The noncovalent association of the NC1(X) is highly thermostable. Only at 100 °C did the trimer become completely dissociated. It was known that the intact native type X collagen can be dissociated only by boiling in the presence of detergents (30Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the NC1 domain is responsible for this remarkable stability of collagen X. The stability of the NC1 may also contribute to the rapid renaturation of collagen X after thermal denaturation. The denaturation temperature (T m) of the helical structure of avian collagen X is 47 °C (30Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been found previously that, after thermal denaturation at 55 °C, more than 60% of the helical structure from intact type X was reformed after 40 min. However, without the NC1, the collagenous domain renatured 15% at most, even after 24 h (30Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our data have shown that the NC1 peptide remains as a trimer under thermal denaturation up to 90 °C. This suggests that at a denaturing temperature between 47 °C and 90 °C the NC1 domain would still hold trimers together, thus maintaining proper chain registration and allowing rapid renaturation of the adjacent triple helix. In vitro refolding of NC1 suggests that to achieve proper trimeric assembly of the molecule, premature interchain association has to be prevented. It is possible that a chaperon may perform such a function in vivo, as does immobilization on a solid phasein vitro. This “chaperon” hypothesis is consistent with the recent finding that protein disulfide isomerase, a chaperon candidate molecule, binds to type X during folding to prevent premature association by an interaction that is not dependent on the presence of cysteines in the peptide (34McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the NC1 domain of collagen X directs two levels of polymerization. The first is from monomer to trimer, and the second is from trimer to multimers. This multimeric association exists in solution, as revealed by the cross-linking experiment. The distance of neighboring trimers should be no more than 11.4 Å (1.14 nm), which is the spacer arm length of the cross-linker BS3. Because the NC1 domain is sufficient to form intermolecular self-associations without the collagenous domain, the NC1 domain may act as a nucleation site to initiate the multimeric self-assembly of collagen X. This provides a structural mechanism for the electron microscopic observations that type X undergoes self-association (35Schmid T.M. Mayne R. Bruns R.R. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Ultrastruc. Res. 1984; 86: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and forms a multimeric hexagonal lattice (6Kwan A.P. Cummings C.E. Chapman J.A. Grant M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have shown that the NC1(X) domain is also capable of directing trimer and higher order multimer formation in a noncollagenous molecule. This suggests that a homologous NC1 domain at the C terminus of a noncollagenous molecule, such as multimerin, may be responsible for multimerization of this molecule. The multimeric state of precerebellin, the other noncollagenous protein with a homologous NC1 domain at its C terminus, is not known. In the light of the present data, it will be intriguing to test whether precerebellin forms trimers and higher order multimers during synapse formation. The structural features within the NC1(X) domain which direct trimer and multimer formation remain to be determined. Computer analysis of the secondary structure of the NC1(X) indicates that the NC1 peptide may be a novel structural entity comprised of multiple β sheets and loops. 2Y. Zhang and Q. Chen, unpublished data. The elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of this domain will rely on x-ray crystallography and mutational analysis of the peptide.

https://openalex.org/W1978748426,"Eukaryotic topoisomerase II is a dimeric nuclear enzyme essential for DNA metabolism and chromosome dynamics. Central to the activities of the enzyme is its ability to introduce transient double-stranded breaks in the DNA helix, where the two subunits of the enzyme become covalently attached to the generated 5′-ends through phosphotyrosine linkages. Here, we demonstrate that human topoisomerases IIα and IIβ are able to cleave ribonucleotide-containing substrates.

DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that act to change the topological state of the DNA double helix (1Vosberg H.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 114: 19-102PubMed Google Scholar). Two highly conserved classes of topoisomerases have been identified so far, which differ in their reaction mechanisms and physical properties (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar, 3Wang J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Type I DNA topoisomerases alter DNA topology by making a transient single-stranded break in the DNA backbone, thereby allowing the passage of another DNA strand. In contrast, type II DNA topoisomerases introduce transient double-stranded DNA breaks and transfer an intact DNA duplex through the break before resealing it (4Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 5Osheroff N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Based on the fundamental roles of DNA topoisomerases in manipulating DNA topology, it has been well established that these enzymes participate in virtually all aspects of DNA metabolism, including transcription, replication, recombination, and chromosome dynamics (6Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar, 7Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shed light on a novel feature of DNA topoisomerases in RNA manipulation, in addition to their essential roles in DNA transactions (8Burgin Jr., A.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 873-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic type I topoisomerase,Escherichia coli topoisomerase III, has been shown to cleave RNA molecules to form a protein-RNA adduct (9DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20532-20535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has furthermore proven to be a true RNA topoisomerase, catalyzing topological changes on circular RNA as well as DNA substrates (10Wang H. DiGate R.J. Seeman N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9477-9482Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). More recently, it was manifested that also eukaryotic type I topoisomerases, including vaccinia virus and human topoisomerase I, recognize and cleave RNA-containing substrates. These two enzymes, however, possess a pronounced endoribonuclease activity, which results in self-displacement of the enzymes from the generated cleavage complexes due to a nucleophilic attack by the 2′-OH group of the ribose sugar on the phosphotyrosine linkages (11Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the data existing so far exclusively deal with type I topoisomerases, they suggest a possible general feature of DNA topoisomerases as RNA processors. Here, we have tested the ability of type II topoisomerases to operate on RNA-containing substrates. Advantage has been taken of an earlier developed partially double-stranded suicide substrate to investigate the ability of human topoisomerases IIα and IIβ to cleave and ligate substrates with a single ribonucleotide substitution (12Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the recessed strand of the suicide substrate contains a ribonucleotide rather than a deoxyribonucleotide at the scissile phosphodiester, cleavage of this strand was ∼8-fold stimulated by both topoisomerase II isoforms, and the same cleavage stimulation was seen on the complementary strand not holding a ribonucleotide. Topoisomerase II covalently linked to the ribonucleotide in the cleavage complex efficiently mediated ligation, and ligation occurred equally well to acceptors with a 3′-ribo- or deoxyribonucleotide. A stimulatory effect of the ribonucleotide on topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage was also observed when either topoisomerase IIα or IIβ was incubated with a duplex molecule having the ribonucleotide at the scissile phosphodiester in one strand. ATP and the antitumor drug VM-26 further stimulated cleavage of the ribonucleotide-containing duplex substrate, as they do of a normal DNA substrate. Taken together, our results indicate that human topoisomerase II, like type I topoisomerases, possesses the ability to operate on RNA as well as on DNA, and the possible functional implication of topoisomerase II in RNA processing is discussed. The recombinant human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ enzymes were purified from the yeast strain BJ201, which carries an expression vector containing either the human topoisomerase IIα or IIβ cDNA under control of the yeast Gal1 promoter. The recombinant enzymes are fused to a c-Myc tag and a hexahistidine tail at the C-terminal ends. The initial purification step using the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix was as described previously (13Biersack H. Jensen S. Gromova I. Nielsen I.S. Westergaard O. Andersen A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8288-8293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For further purification of the recombinant proteins to near homogeneity, the fractions pooled from the Ni2+column were loaded on a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column, and elution was performed with a 75-ml linear gradient of 200 mm to 1m NaCl. Topoisomerase II-containing fractions were further applied to a 0.4-ml Source S column. The enzyme was finally eluted with a 5-ml linear gradient of 100–600 mm NaCl, and peak fractions were pooled and stored at −80 °C until use. DNA oligonucleotides as well as the oligonucleotides containing a single ribonucleotide substitution were synthesized on a Model 394 DNA synthesizer by DNA Technology Corp. and purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 28-mer used as the bottom strand in the suicide or duplex substrate is modified at the 3′-end by the amino link -O-PO2-O-CH2-CHOH-CH2-NH2to inhibit ligation to this end. The suicide and duplex substrates were prepared by hybridizing 10 pmol of the top strand (16-mer and 24-mer, respectively) to 10 pmol of the complementary 28-mer bottom strand in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl. The mixture was heated to 70 °C for 2 min and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. After hybridization, the top strand of the substrates was 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), resulting in a 17-mer top strand in the suicide substrate and a 25-mer top strand in the duplex substrate. For studies of bottom strand cleavage, the 28-mer bottom strand was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) before hybridization. The hybridized substrates were purified by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A standard suicide cleavage reaction was set up by incubating 2.5 pmol of topoisomerase II with 0.1 pmol of labeled substrate in 50 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm EDTA (cleavage buffer) at 37 °C for 60 min. SDS (1% final concentration) was then added to stop the reaction, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Covalent complex formation was revealed by transfer of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide to the topoisomerase II polypeptide. Alternatively, the samples were subjected to phenol extraction after SDS treatment, and the protein-linked complexes were recovered from the phenol/water interphase as described previously (12Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complexes were subsequently ethanol-precipitated and digested with proteinase K (1 mg/ml, 2 h, 37 °C). Following proteinase K digestion, the samples were equally divided into two tubes: one was further treated with NaOH (0.5 m, 60 min, 55 °C) followed by ethanol precipitation, and the other was left untreated. One volume of gel loading buffer (50% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.03% xylene cyanol, and 5 mm EDTA) was added to all the samples, and they were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The level of cleavage was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Reversibility of topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage was investigated by addition of 0.4m NaCl to cleavage samples instead of 1% SDS. Samples were otherwise treated as described above. Cleavage of duplex substrates was performed by incubating 0.1 pmol of the substrate with 2.5 pmol of topoisomerase II in cleavage buffer. After 3 min at 37 °C, SDS was added to 1% to freeze the reaction. The protein-linked complexes were recovered from the phenol/water interphase and analyzed by 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The effect of ATP or the antitumor drug VM-26 (teniposide) on the cleavage activity of topoisomerase II was assayed by including either 1 mm ATP or 100 μm VM-26 in the reaction mixture. A topoisomerase II-mediated suicide cleavage reaction was performed as described above. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the cleavage reaction was stopped by addition of NaCl to 0.4 m, thereby preventing further cleavage during the ligation reaction. Ligation was initiated by addition of a 12-mer ligation substrate in a 200-fold molar excess relative to the cleavage substrate. After further incubation (with incubation times as indicated in the figure legends), the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS to 1%. The samples were ethanol-precipitated, proteinase K-digested, and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To investigate if human topoisomerase II can act as a potential RNA topoisomerase, we have taken advantage of a suicide cleavage substrate that contains a strong topoisomerase II recognition sequence (12Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate consists of a 16-base-long 5′-recessed top strand with only three nucleotides 5′ to the cleavage position and a 28-base-long bottom strand. Use of the suicide substrate has been demonstrated to cause an uncoupling of the cleavage and ligation half-reactions due to the release of the trinucleotide 5′ to the cleavage position on the top strand, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 A (12Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the suicide substrate was modified by substituting the deoxyribonucleotide (A) at the normal scissile phosphodiester of the top strand with a ribonucleotide (rA), and the ability of topoisomerases IIα and IIβ to cleave this substrate was investigated. The substrate was labeled at the 3′-end of the recessed top strand and incubated with either human topoisomerase IIα or IIβ in a standard suicide cleavage reaction. After 60 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by SDS, and the samples were analyzed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Both isoforms were able to cleave the ribonucleotide-containing substrate (R-substrate) 1The abbreviations used are: R-substrate, ribonucleotide-containing substrate; D-substrate, deoxyribonucleotide-containing substrate ; cleavage resulted in radioactive labeling of the enzymes due to their covalent linkage to the labeled top strand (Fig. 1 B, leftand right panels, lanes 4–6). The polypeptide bands visible in the autoradiogram migrated with a mobility of 170–180 kDa as predicted based on the molecular mass of the human topoisomerase II isoforms (15Jenkins J.R. Ayton P. Jones T. Davies S.L. Simmons D.L. Harris A.L. Sheer D. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5587-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Tsai Pflugfelder M. Liu L.F. Liu A.A. Tewey K.M. Whang Peng J. Knutsen T. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7177-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Most strikingly, both isoforms had a strong preference for cleavage of the R-substrate as compared with the suicide substrate composed entirely of deoxyribonucleotides (D-substrate) (Fig. 1 B, left and right panels, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6). To quantify the effect of the ribonucleotide on topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage, a time course analysis of the cleavage reaction was performed in which samples were withdrawn from the suicide cleavage reaction at different time points (0–75 min) and analyzed as described above. The level of cleavage was determined by PhosphorImager scanning of the gel. As presented in Fig. 1 C, the two enzymes gave rise to a time-dependent accumulation of cleavage products with both the R- and D-substrates, in accordance with the suicidal nature of these substrates. The rate of the forward cleavage reaction was relatively constant after the first 15 min of incubation with the enzyme/substrate ratio used in the experiment. However, with both isoforms, the cleavage rate obtained with the R-substrate was ∼8-fold higher than that obtained with the D-substrate. Thus, not only do human topoisomerases IIα and IIβ recognize and cleave the RNA-containing suicide substrate, the presence of a ribonucleotide at the scissile phosphodiester also stimulates the cleavage reaction dramatically. Although insertion of a ribonucleotide at the normal scissile phosphodiester heavily stimulates topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage, the presence of the ribonucleotide might change the cleavage specificity of the enzyme. To determine if topoisomerases IIα and IIβ cleave the R-substrate at the same position as they cleave the D-substrate, cleavage reactions were performed in which the protein-linked complexes were isolated from a phenol/water interphase and analyzed on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel after proteinase K treatment (Fig. 2). Both isoforms gave rise to one prominent cleavage product with the R-substrate, which migrated to the same position as the cleavage product obtained with the D-substrate (compare lanes 5 and 2 andlanes 12 and 9), demonstrating that insertion of the ribonucleotide in the substrate does not change the sequence specificity of topoisomerase II. Rather, the enzymes cleaved with increased activity at the ribonucleotide, releasing the trinucleotide 5′ to the cleavage position, as demonstrated previously for the D-substrate (12Andersen A.H.

Svejstrup J.Q. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, it should be noted that the labeled 17-mer top strand migrated with the apparent mobility of an 18.5-mer due to sequence differences between the substrate and the employed DNA size marker. The 14-mer cleavage product migrated to the position of a 16.5-mer, and the extra 1-base retardation was due to residual undigested protein, as demonstrated previously (12Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lund K. Andersen A.H. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands marked with an asterisk represent cleavage products with a longer protein fragment covalently linked due to partial proteinase K digestion (12Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lund K. Andersen A.H. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm that cleavage of the R-substrate results in a covalent linkage between topoisomerase II and the inserted ribonucleotide, the cleavage products were treated with 0.5m NaOH after proteinase K digestion, as the linkage of the tyrosine ribonucleotide to the rest of the DNA substrate should be alkali-labile. For the R-substrate, alkaline treatment resulted in a new product with the apparent mobility of a 14.5-mer (Fig. 2,lanes 6 and 13), which is the mobility expected for the 13-mer generated from the cleavage product after release of the ribonucleotide with the covalently linked undigested protein. As expected, NaOH treatment did not change the mobility of the cleavage product obtained with the D-substrate (lanes 3 and 10). Taken together, the results show that the stimulated cleavage mediated by topoisomerases IIα and IIβ of the R-substrate takes place at the ribonucleotide, and the enzymes become covalently linked to the ribonucleotide during complex formation. Topoisomerase II covalently linked to a deoxyribonucleotide in the cleavage complex generated upon cleavage of a suicide substrate is known to be kinetically active. It can therefore act as a donor in ligation if a suitable ligation substrate is added to the reaction mixture after cleavage complex formation, as schematically illustrated in Fig.3 A (12Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate if the same holds true for topoisomerase II covalently linked to a ribonucleotide, a ligation assay was set up with the R-substrate. Topoisomerase II cleavage complexes were prepared for the ligation assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” After an increase in the salt concentration to inhibit further cleavage, ligation was initiated by addition of a 12-mer DNA oligonucleotide able to hybridize to the bottom strand of the cleaved substrate. At different time points, samples were withdrawn from the reaction mixture, and the cleavage and ligation products were analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 3 B for topoisomerase IIα, the enzyme covalently linked to the ribonucleotide in the R-substrate efficiently performed ligation to the added DNA acceptor, leading to an accumulation of a 26-mer ligation product (lanes 11–17), as did the enzyme covalently linked to a deoxyribonucleotide in the D-substrate (lanes 2–8). The results are depicted graphically in Fig.3 C, where the levels of ligation at the different time points are given as a percentage of initial cleaved material to take into account differences in the cleavage level at the start of ligation. The initial rate of topoisomerase II-mediated ligation and the final percentage of ligated material are comparable for the enzyme linked to a ribo- or deoxyribonucleotide, indicating that the two complexes have similar donor capabilities, at least when the acceptor is DNA. Analogous results have been obtained with topoisomerase IIβ (data not shown). To investigate if ligation also takes place to a ribonucleotide-terminated acceptor, another ligation experiment was performed utilizing a 12-mer ligation substrate identical to the one used in Fig. 3 (B and C), except that a ribonucleotide (rG) was at the 3′-end. Cleavage and ligation were performed as described above, and a time course of the ligation reaction for topoisomerase IIα is presented in Fig. 3 D. As seen from the ligation curves, the ribonucleotide-terminated ligation substrate efficiently acted as an acceptor whether the donor was topoisomerase II linked to a ribo- or deoxyribonucleotide. From a comparison of the ligation reactions presented in Fig. 3 (Cand D), it is furthermore evident that the two 12-mer ligation substrates acted with equal efficiency in the ligation reaction, indicating that there is no major difference in the ability of a ribonucleotide and a deoxyribonucleotide to perform the required nucleophilic attack on the phosphotyrosine linkage during ligation. Although it is likely that the nucleophilic attack performed by the ribonucleotide-containing ligation substrate is mediated through the 3′-OH group of the ribose sugar, we cannot exclude the possibility that the 2′-OH group of the sugar may act to form a 2′–5′ linkage during ligation in addition to the canonical 3′–5′ linkage. The results suggest that topoisomerase II, besides its activities on DNA, can operate on RNA substrates or even at the link between RNA and DNA in substrates made up partly by RNA. The enzyme is therefore a likely candidate for performing different topological changes on RNA-containing nucleic acids in the cell. So far, we have used the R-substrate to investigate how insertion of a ribonucleotide at the scissile phosphodiester influences cleavage of the strand holding the ribonucleotide. However, the dimeric topoisomerase II enzyme functions by creating a double-stranded break 4 base pairs apart on the DNA backbone, with one subunit acting on each strand (4Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to investigate how a ribonucleotide at the scissile phosphodiester of the top strand in the suicide substrate would influence cleavage mediated by the other subunit on the bottom strand. To address this question, the 28-mer bottom strand was labeled at the 5′-end before hybridization to either the ribo- or deoxyribonucleotide-containing top strand to generate the bottom strand labeled R- and D-substrates, respectively. The substrates were incubated with topoisomerase IIα or IIβ for 3 min at 37 °C before each sample was divided in two: one was stopped by SDS, and the other was treated with NaCl. DNA was isolated from the SDS and NaCl samples by ethanol precipitation, and cleavage products were loaded directly on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Both isoforms cleaved the R- and D-substrates at the same position on the bottom strand, creating a protein-free cleavage product of 12 bases as expected from the 4-base staggered fashion of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage (data not shown). The bottom strand cleavage levels for topoisomerase were further quantified by PhosphorImager scanning of the gels and are graphically presented in the histogram in Fig.4 A. As a control, a similar experiment was performed using the top strand 3′-end-labeled R- and D-substrates, and the results are presented graphically in Fig.4 B. A comparison of the SDS samples obtained with the R- and D-substrates shows that the enzyme had a strong preference for the R-substrate also concerning bottom strand cleavage. Cleavage of this strand was stimulated ∼8-fold (Fig. 4 A), which is similar to the cleavage stimulation seen on the top strand holding the ribonucleotide (Fig. 4 B). The same observations have been obtained for topoisomerase IIβ (data not shown). Thus, the presence of a ribonucleotide at the scissile phosphodiester of the top strand not only stimulates cleavage of this strand, but also has a tremendous influence on the cleavage mediated by the other subunit on the bottom strand. The observation that cleavage of both strands is equally stimulated indicates a strong coordination between the two topoisomerase II subunits during substrate binding and/or cleavage. From earlier observations, it was anticipated that cleavage of the bottom strand in the suicide substrate predominantly occurs as an equilibrium process, with most cleavage complexes being reversed upon addition of NaCl, whereas cleavage of the top strand is suicidal and salt-irreversible (12Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same holds true for the R-substrate, as bottom strand cleavage was largely reversed by addition of NaCl (Fig.4 A), whereas top strand cleavage was not (Fig.4 B). The fact that religation took place on the bottom strand under conditions where no religation occurred on the top strand suggests that the two topoisomerase II subunits are uncoupled in the ligation reaction, as demonstrated previously (12Andersen A.H. Sørensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it cannot be excluded that some of the cleavage events result from topoisomerase II-mediated single-stranded cleavage (19Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Andersen A.H. Christiansen K. Zechiedrich E.L. Jensen P.S. Osheroff N. Westergaard O. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6237-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results presented above indicate that topoisomerase II has an intrinsic ability to recognize and cleave RNA-containing substrates as well as to use such substrates both as donors and acceptors in its catalytic cycle. However, all the results were obtained using suicide substrates, which are ideal for delineating mechanistic aspects of topoisomerase II, but are different from the enzyme's normal duplex substrates. To confirm that topoisomerase II has an ability to act on an RNA-containing substrate also when the substrate has a duplex nature, two other substrates were generated that were identical to the R- and D-substrates, except they were fully extended at the 5′-end of the top strand. The two substrates, denoted by R′ and D′, respectively, were labeled at the 3′-end of the top strand and incubated with topoisomerase IIα or IIβ. After 3 min at 37 °C, SDS was added to freeze the equilibrium. Cleavage complexes were recovered from a phenol/water interphase and analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel after proteinase K digestion. As shown in Fig. 5 A (lanes 2, 4, 7, and 9), the cleavage products obtained with the R′- and D′-substrates migrated to the same position, demonstrating that both isoforms recognize and cleave at the ribonucleotide phosphodiester also when the ribonucleotide is present in a duplex substrate. In addition, more cleavage was observed with the R′-substrate than with the D′-substrate (compare lanes 4 and 2 and lanes 9 and7), although cleavage stimulation was not as pronounced as with the suicide substrate. The fact that topoisomerase II has an increased activity on a ribonucleotide-containing duplex substrate demonstrates that the stimulatory effect of the ribonucleotide on cleavage is not just an intrinsic characteristic of the suicide substrate, and the result lends further support to the possible action of human topoisomerase II as an RNA processor. Several antitumor agents as well as ATP are known to stimulated topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex formation (14Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar, 22Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate if these agents also have a stimulatory effect on complex formation between topoisomerase II and RNA-containing substrates, a cleavage experiment was performed in which either ATP or the antitumor drug VM-26 was added to a cleavage reaction containing the duplex R′- or D′-substrate. Following gel electrophoresis, cleavage products were quantified by PhosphorImager scanning, and relative cleavage levels are presented in the histograms shown in Fig. 5 B. The stimulation of cleavage complex formation seen with ATP or VM-26 was independent of whether the substrate contains a ribo- or deoxyribonucleotide at the scissile phosphodiester. Thus, these agents do not seem to have a preference for DNA as a substrate for topoisomerase II in their mode of action, supporting the hypothesis of topoisomerase II as a modulator of both DNA and RNA substrates. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II catalyzes a repertoire of DNA transactions, which all depend on the ability of the enzyme to introduce transient double-stranded breaks in the DNA backbone (4Maxwell A. Gellert M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 69-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The DNA cleavage and ligation reactions of topoisomerase II have been investigated in great detail using linear duplex (19Zechiedrich E.L. Christiansen K. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. Osheroff N.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9538-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) substrates, and the latter allow studies of the two reactions independently (26Andersen A.H. Svejstrup J.Q. Westergaard O. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29: 83-101Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The analyses have demonstrated an ability of topoisomerase II to take part in both inter- and intramolecular ligation reactions, and a more detailed characterization has been performed of the various DNA substrates that can act as donors and acceptors in the DNA transfer reactions (27Schmidt V.K. Sørensen B.S. Sørensen H.V. Alsner J. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, we have analyzed the potential of the human topoisomerase II isoforms, topoisomerases IIα and IIβ, to operate on RNA-containing substrates. We found that both isoforms recognize and cleave either suicide or duplex substrates containing a single ribonucleotide at the scissile phosphodiester in one strand. Cleavage of the suicide substrate, in which the ribonucleotide is inserted at the scissile phosphodiester of the 5′-recessed strand, is stimulated ∼8-fold, whereas cleavage of the duplex is stimulated ∼2-fold. Studies of the ligation reaction have shown that topoisomerase II covalently linked to a ribonucleotide in the cleavage complex has the same donor activity as topoisomerase II linked to a deoxyribonucleotide. Moreover, ligation substrates terminated with either a ribo- or deoxyribonucleotide at the 3′-end function equally well as acceptors in the ligation reaction. The stimulated activity of the human topoisomerase II isoforms on ribonucleotide-containing substrates can be further increased by either ATP or the antitumor drug VM-26. Together, our observations suggest that topoisomerase II can operate on RNA or RNA-containing substrates, so the enzyme, besides being a DNA topoisomerase, might also act as an RNA topoisomerase. Different type I topoisomerases have previously been described to possess RNA-manipulating activity. Thus, E. colitopoisomerase III is capable of cleaving RNA molecules to produce a protein-RNA adduct (9DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20532-20535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also, this enzyme has directly been proven to hold RNA strand passage activity (10Wang H. DiGate R.J. Seeman N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9477-9482Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Likewise, vaccinia virus topoisomerase I has been investigated for the ability to act on RNA or RNA-containing substrates. Although this enzyme does not cleave substrates in which either the scissile or the complementary strand is composed entirely of RNA (28Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a duplex substrate in which the scissile strand is composed of DNA upstream and RNA downstream of the scissile phosphate is proportionally cleaved by the enzyme (29Sekiguchi J. Cheng C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15721-15728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Combined with our observations on human topoisomerase II, the ability to act on RNA or RNA-containing substrates seems to be a general characteristic for all topoisomerases. A study by Sekiguchi and Shuman (11Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that vaccinia virus and human topoisomerase I both hold an endoribonuclease activity. Thus, the phosphotyrosine linkage of the covalent RNA-3′-phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate is attacked by the vicinal 2′-OH of the ribose sugar, whereby the enzyme is released, and a free 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate product is generated. The reaction is highly efficient, with up to 80% of the input substrate being converted to the enzyme-free cleaved product. Another eukaryotic topoisomerase I-like protein, the site-specific DNA recombinase Flp, also possesses endoribonuclease activity (30Xu C.J. Grainge I. Lee J. Harshey R.M. Jayaram M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Such an activity has not been observed for E. coli topoisomerase III, which, in contrast to the others, becomes covalently linked to the 5′-phosphate of its substrate (9DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20532-20535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, our investigations have not revealed any endoribonuclease activity for human topoisomerase II. In no case is a release of an enzyme-free cleaved product seen upon topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of the ribonucleotide-containing substrates. This is further supported by the results obtained from an experiment in which ligation was continued in the absence of an acceptor for another 30 min after the cleavage reaction had been stopped with NaCl. In this experiment, no change in the level of protein-linked cleavage product was observed during the extended ligation period, demonstrating that self-displacement of the enzyme does not take place under the employed conditions (data not shown). Thus, biochemically, the 2′-OH of the ribose sugar is probably structurally remote from the 5′-phosphotyrosine linkage in the topoisomerase II-ribonucleotide cleavage complex and is unable to perform a nucleophilic attack. Our demonstration of a lacking endoribonuclease activity of human topoisomerase II lends support to the earlier proposed suggestion that only topoisomerases forming covalent linkage to the 3′-phosphate of RNA can be released by nucleophilic attack from the vicinal 2′-OH of the ribose sugar (11Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The fact that topoisomerase II is highly efficient on ribonucleotide-containing substrates whether the substrates have a suicidal or duplex nature suggests that the observed in vitro activities are not just irrelevant side reactions. However, it is not yet evident why cleavage is stimulated ∼8-fold on the suicide substrate and only 2-fold on the duplex substrate. To this end, it should be noted that topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of suicide substrates in general is much less efficient than cleavage of duplex substrates (17Lund K. Andersen A.H. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lowered cleavage activity on the suicide substrates probably reflects a decreased affinity of topoisomerase II for these substrates. Based on this, a likely explanation for the differences observed in cleavage stimulation with the ribonucleotide-containing suicide and duplex substrates is that binding of topoisomerase II to the suicide substrate is relatively more stabilized by the presence of a ribonucleotide than binding of the enzyme to the duplex substrate. Another interesting observation seen here with the suicide substrate is that the same 8-fold cleavage stimulation is obtained on both strands, although only one of these holds a ribonucleotide. Taking the dimeric nature of topoisomerase II into consideration, where one subunit acts on each strand, the single ribonucleotide is expected to strongly influence binding of only the enzyme subunit directly contacting it. Our observation therefore indicates that the effect of the ribonucleotide somehow can be transmitted from one subunit to the other, suggestive of a strong coordination between the two enzyme subunits during substrate recognition and/or cleavage. The results obtained in this study using substrates containing a single ribonucleotide strongly indicate that topoisomerase II can operate on RNA or RNA-containing substrates. Although DNA topoisomerase II has not yet been proven to act as an RNA operator within the cell, a number of possible in vivo functions can be suggested for the enzyme based on its observed in vitro activities. For example, topoisomerase II might actively recognize and cleave at ribonucleotides that have been misincorporated into DNA, as suggested earlier for type I topoisomerases (11Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the fact that topoisomerase II has an increased cleavage activity as well as an efficient ligation activity on the ribonucleotide-containing substrates makes it more likely that the enzyme is a candidate for performing topological changes on RNA or RNA/DNA hybrids within the cell. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that topoisomerase II lacks endoribonuclease activity, which otherwise would disturb the normal catalytic cycle by releasing the enzyme before normal ligation. Since the endoribonuclease activity is pronounced for eukaryotic topoisomerase I (11Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), this enzyme is less likely to be a topological monitor of RNA-containing substrates. So far, a function of topoisomerase II as a modulator of RNA or RNA/DNA topology is only speculative. A main issue for the future is therefore to investigate if topoisomerase II holds full RNA topoisomerase activity in such a way that, besides its cleavage/ligation activities, it has the ability to perform strand transfer reactions on RNA or RNA-containing substrates. A clear delineation of the biological roles of the RNA-manipulating activities of topoisomerase II, however, awaits further in vitro andin vivo experimentation. We are grateful to Drs. Harald Biersack, Ole Frederik Nielsen, Mogens Kruhøffer, and Kent Christiansen for valuable discussions and to Kirsten Andersen for skillful technical assistance."

Heme disrupts this complex and permits Hap1 to bind to DNA with high affinity, thereby activating transcription. Heme regulation of Hap1 activity is analogous to the regulation of steroid receptors by steroids, which involves molecular chaperones. Steroid receptors often exist as monomers when associated with molecular chaperones in the absence of ligand but as dimers when activated by steroids. Furthermore, previous studies indicate that dimerization might be important for heme activation of Hap1. We therefore determined whether Hap1 is a monomer or oligomer in the absence of heme. By coeluting two Hap1 size variants and by comparing DNA binding properties of the HMC and Hap1 dimer, we show that Hap1 is a preexisting dimer in the HMC. Further, increasing overexpression of Hap1 caused progressive increases in Hap1 DNA binding and transcriptional activities. Our data suggest that in the absence of heme, Hap1 exists as a dimer, and the two subunits act cooperatively in DNA binding.

Dimerization is a common mechanism by which the activity of numerous important biological macromolecules can be regulated. These molecules include receptors for growth hormones (1Kelly P.A.

The transcriptional activators of the yeast Gal4 family also require dimerization for DNA binding and transcriptional activation (8Johnston M. Microbiol.

Although the DNA binding properties of the C6 zinc cluster proteins are well characterized, the molecular mechanisms by which these members act to control transcription in response to various signals are largely unclear. Interestingly, recent data suggest that, like steroid hormone receptors, certain members of the yeast Gal4 family such as Hap1 and Pdr1 (16Hallstrom T.C. Katzmann D.J. Torres R.J. Sharp W.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) are regulated by Hsp90 and Hsp70 molecular chaperones. In particular, Hap1 is a heme-responsive transcriptional activator, which promotes transcription of genes required for respiration and for controlling oxidative damage in response to oxygen/heme (18Creusot F. Verdiere J. Gaisne M. Slonimski P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Pfeifer K. Kim K.S. Kogan S. Guarente L.

In the absence of heme, Hap1 is bound to cellular proteins including Hsp82 (the yeast homologue of Hsp90) and Ydj1, forming a higher order complex termed HMC 1The abbreviations used are: HMC, higher molecular weight complex; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DC, dimeric Hap1 complex; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic Acid (17Zhang L.

Hap1 DNA binding and transcriptional activities are repressed in this complex. Heme disrupts the HMC and permits Hap1 to bind to DNA as a dimer with high affinity, thereby activating transcription. The formation and disruption of the HMC are the key events in Hap1 repression in the absence of heme and subsequent activation by heme. How does the HMC repress Hap1, and how does the disassembly of the HMC lead to Hap1 activation? In the case of steroid hormone receptors, a plethora of reports suggested a model for how molecular chaperones control their activities (23Pratt W. Toft D. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 24Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 25Bohen S.P. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1303-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the absence of hormone, steroid hormone receptors form heteromeric complexes containing a receptor monomer, a dimer of Hsp90, and several other proteins including Hsp70 and Ydj1 (23Pratt W. Toft D. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 24Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 25Bohen S.P.

Biol. 1996; 56: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hormone binding causes the dissociation of Hsp90 and other proteins, permitting steroid hormone receptors to dimerize and bind to DNA with high affinity and activate transcription (23Pratt W. Toft D. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 24Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 25Bohen S.P. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1303-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This suggests that dimerization is an important event leading to the activation of steroid hormone receptors. In the case of Hap1, we envisioned two ways by which Hap1 activity could be controlled by the HMC. First, Hap1, like steroid hormone receptors, could exist as a monomer in the HMC and is thus repressed. When the HMC disassembles in the presence of heme, Hap1 is free to dimerize and bind to DNA with high affinity, thereby activating transcription. Second, Hap1 could already be a dimer in the HMC, but its activity is inhibited by molecular chaperones in the HMC. The disruption of the HMC by heme would then relieve this inhibition, thereby leading to Hap1 activation. Previous experiments indicated that the Hap1 dimerization domain plays a role in heme regulation (17Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear whether it acts by controlling dimerization or by making molecular interactions critical for Hap1 activity. In this report we describe a series of experiments aimed at distinguishing whether Hap1 is monomeric or oligomeric in the HMC. First, the two size variants of Hap1 coeluted on affinity columns in the absence of heme. Second, DNA mobility shift assays showed that the HMC recognizes various Hap1-binding sites in a manner similar to Hap1 dimer binding but completely different from monomer binding. Third, increasing overexpression of Hap1 caused graded increases in Hap1 DNA binding and transcriptional activation in the absence of heme, indicating that overexpression of Hap1 can functionally titrate out molecular chaperones. Together, these results strongly suggest that in the absence of heme, Hap1 is a preexisting oligomer in the HMC. Cells used for β-galactosidase assays and for extract preparation were grown as described previously (17Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Yeast strains used were MHY200 (MATaura3–52 leu2–3, 112 his4–519 ade1–100 hem1-Δ100 hap1::LEU2) (27Haldi M.L. Guarente L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), L51 (MAT a leu2–2, 2–112 his4–519 ade1–100 ura3–52 hap1::LEU2 trp1::HISG), and JEL1 (MATα leu2 trp1 ura3–52 nprb1–1122 pep4–3 ΔHis3::pGAL10-Gal4). To construct the expression plasmids for His6-Hap1 and His6-Hap1ΔKpn, a DNA fragment encoding Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His was synthesized and inserted into the SamI site of the Hap1 and Hap1ΔKpn expression plasmids, SD5-HAP1 and SD5-HAP1ΔKpn (28Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids express Hap1 and Hap1ΔKpn with the MRGS-His6 tag at their N termini. To construct GST-Hap1, a DNA fragment encoding GST was inserted into theSamI site of the Hap1 expression plasmid, SD5-HAP1. The correct clones were identified by restriction digestion and confirmed by sequencing. Yeast MHY200 cells, with theHEM1 (encoding for δ-aminolevulinate synthase, the first enzyme in heme synthesis) (27Haldi M.L. Guarente L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and HAP1 genes deleted, were transformed with yeast high copy 2 μm replicating plasmid expressing wild type Hap1, GST-Hap1, or His6-Hap1 from theGAL1–10 promoter and a UAS1/CYC1-TATA-lacZ reporter plasmid as described previously (17Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in synthetic complete medium containing 2% raffinose with limiting amounts of heme precursor δ-aminolevulinate (2 μg/ml) or high amounts of 5-aminolevulinate (250 μg/ml) to approximately A 0.5. Cells were then induced with 2% galactose for 7 h or for specified times (see Fig. 5) and harvested for determination of β-galactosidase as described previously (22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cell extracts were prepared according to previously established protocols (17Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells bearing expression plasmids were grown to A 0.5 and induced with 2% galactose for 6 h or for specified times (see Fig. 5). Cells were harvested and resuspended in three packed cell volumes of buffer (20 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were then permeabilized by agitation with four packed cell volumes of glass beads, and extracts were collected as described (29Pfeifer K. Prezant T. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of extracts were determined by Bradford assays. DNA binding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume with 5% glycerol, 4 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 10 μm ZnOAc2, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin as described (22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 0.01 pmol of labeled oligonucleotides and 20-μg extracts or eluate containing approximately 200 ng of total proteins were used in each reaction. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then loaded onto 3.5 or 4% polyacrylamide gels in 1/3 Tris borate/EDTA for gel electrophoresis at 4 °C. The intensity of bands representing the HMC and dimeric complex was quantified by using the PhosphorImagerTM system (Molecular Dynamics). To purify the HMC or test the coelution of Hap1 and His6-Hap1ΔKpn, Ni-NTA superflow beads (QIAGEN) were packed in a column and equilibrated with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmdithiothreitol. Then, extracts were loaded onto the column at the rate of approximately 5 ml/h. Columns were subsequently washed with 150–200 column volumes of the equilibration buffer containing 20 mmimidazole. The HMC complexes were eluted with buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was further concentrated on Centricon 10 (Amicon) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and DNA mobility shift assays. For Western blotting, whole cell extracts and the eluate from Ni-NTA columns were first separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. Hap1 was visualized by using a purified antibody against the Hap1 DNA binding sequence and a chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), as described previously (17Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To characterize biochemically the HMC and to determine whether it contains a Hap1 monomer or oligomer, we purified the complex. We fused the GST or His6 tag to the Hap1 N terminus and determined how tagged Hap1 fusions respond to heme and how they form the HMC. As shown in Fig.1 A, both His6-Hap1 and GST-Hap1 responded to heme in the same way as Hap1; they showed a low level of activity in the absence of heme, and heme greatly stimulated their activity. Like Hap1, GST-Hap1 and His6-Hap1 formed a high molecular weight complex (HMC) and bound to DNA with low affinity (Fig. 1 B). Heme disrupted this complex and permitted Hap1 to bind to DNA as a dimer with high affinity. These results show that fusion of His6 and GST tags to Hap1 has no effect on heme responsiveness of tagged Hap1 fusion proteins and HMC formation. Therefore, the tagged Hap1 fusions can be used to purify the HMC. We initially tested purification by using both GST-Hap1 and His6-Hap1. We prepared extracts from cells expressing a high level of GST-Hap1 and His6-Hap1 from theGAL1–10 promoter. We then loaded the extracts onto glutathione or Ni-NTA columns, respectively. We found that both GST-Hap1 and His6-Hap1 were highly enriched on the columns, but bound GST-Hap1 could not be easily eluted for unknown reasons. However, the bound His6-Hap1 complexes could be successfully eluted by using imidazole. As shown in Fig. 1 C, Hap1 was highly enriched in the eluate compared with crude extracts, and several other proteins were coeluted with Hap1 (see Ref. 17Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These proteins also cofractionated with His6-Hap1 on a Superose 6 column and were cross-linked to His6-Hap1 (Ref. 17Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and data not shown) but were not retained on the Ni-NTA column when extracts containing Hap1 (not His6-Hap1) were used. These results strongly suggest that these proteins were bound to Hap1, not to Ni-NTA beads. The two most abundant proteins, p70 (Hsp70) 2T. Hon, A. Hach and L. Zhang, unpublished data. and p60, are in a molar ratio of about 1:1 to His6-Hap1. Further, as expected, the purified HMC bound to DNA with low affinity; heme disrupted the HMC and permitted Hap1 to bind to DNA with high affinity (at least 10-fold higher) (Fig. 1 D). This confirms the previous observation that Hap1 DNA binding activity is repressed in the HMC (17Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Fytlovich S. Gervais M. Agrimonti C. Guiard B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Zhang L. Guarente L. Genetics. 1994; 136: 813-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After determining the appropriate conditions for purifying the HMC, we investigated whether Hap1 is a dimer/oligomer in the HMC by coelution. We imagined that if Hap1 exists as an oligomer in the HMC, two different Hap1 size variants should be complexed together in the HMC and thus should coelute on the column that retains one form of the size variants. However, if Hap1 exists as a monomer in the HMC, two Hap1 size variants should not be complexed together and should not coelute on the column. Because all Hap1 domains except for the activation domain are required for forming a stable HMC, we used His6-Hap1ΔKpn (containing Hap1 residues 1–1309 but not residues in the activation domain) and Hap1 as two size variants. Longer Hap1 size variants were not used because of difficulties in cloning and expressing long Hap1 derivatives. We coexpressed His6-Hap1ΔKpn and Hap1 in yeast cells and prepared extracts from these cells under the condition that all Hap1 forms the HMC (22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then loaded the extracts containing both His6-Hap1ΔKpn and Hap1 (Fig.2, lane 2) onto a Ni-NTA column. As a control, we loaded extracts containing only Hap1 (Fig. 2,lane 1) onto a Ni-NTA column (for reasons unclear, His6-Hap1ΔKpn appeared to be expressed at a higher level than Hap1; see Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). We then extensively washed these columns and eluted them with imidazole. We found that Hap1 coeluted with His6-Hap1ΔKpn, and the ratio of Hap1 to His6-Hap1ΔKpn in the eluate was similar to the ratio in crude extracts (Fig. 2, compare lane 4 withlane 2). Further, no Hap1 was found in the eluate when the extracts did not contain His6-Hap1ΔKpn (Fig. 2,lane 3), suggesting that the retention of Hap1 on the column was not attributable to nonspecific binding to Ni-NTA beads. These results suggest that Hap1 is in a dimeric or possibly higher oligomeric form in the absence of heme in the HMC. The coelution experiment suggests that Hap1 is a preexisting dimer or possibly a higher oligomer in the HMC in the absence of heme. We further ascertained this idea by testing whether Hap1 subunits in the HMC are physically close enough to function together as a dimer. We examined the manner by which the HMC binds to various DNA sites. Hap1 contains a conserved C6 zinc cluster that recognizes a CGG triplet (31Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A Hap1 dimer binds cooperatively to asymmetric DNA sites containing a direct repeat of CGG triplets (consensus sequence: CGGnnnTAnCGG) (31Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The two C6 zinc clusters are positioned in tandem to recognize the two CGG triplets in a direct repeat (32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33King D.A. Zhang L. Guarente L. Marmorstein R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mutating any of the conserved nucleotides leads to reduced Hap1 binding affinity (31Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, when Hap1 is mutated or engineered so that it cannot form a stable dimer, it binds to DNA as a monomer with low affinity (32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These previous studies clearly demonstrated that the affinity of Hap1 monomeric binding is identical whether one or more CGG triplets are present in the DNA sites (32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), apparently because a Hap1 monomer can make contacts with only one CGG triplet. The low DNA binding affinity of the HMC may result from monomer binding because the HMC contains a Hap1 monomer or from weakened dimer binding due to the interference by molecular chaperones. If the HMC contains only one Hap1 subunit (a monomer), it should bind identically to various Hap1-binding and mutated sites with one or more CGG triplets. However, if the HMC contains two Hap1 subunits (a dimer) and the C6 zinc clusters are close enough to function together, it should bind to various DNA sites in a manner similar to the Hap1 dimer formed in the presence of heme (32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined and compared the ways by which the HMC and Hap1 dimer bind to various Hap1-binding and mutated sites. These sites include UAS1/CYC1 (Fig. 3,lanes 1 and 2); a chimeric site containing a half-site of UAS1/CYC1 and a half-site of UAS/CYC7 (lanes 3 and 4); UAS/CYC7 (lanes 5 and 6); a consensus Hap1 site, HC1 (CGGACTTATCGG, lanes 7 and 8); M1, a mutant site with the second CGG of HC1 changed to CCG (CGGACTTATCCG, lanes 9 and 10); M2, a mutant site with the conserved T in the spacer changed to C (CGGACTCATCGG, lanes 11 and 12); and M3, a double mutant site that combines mutations in M1 and M2 (CGGACTCATCCG, lanes 13 and14) (32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Clearly, Fig. 3 shows that the HMC did not bind identically to these sites, strongly arguing against the idea that the HMC contains a Hap1 monomer. Instead, the HMC and Hap1 dimer bound to these sites in a similar manner. The HMC binding was observed at UAS1/CYC1, UAS/CYC7, the chimera, and the HC1 site, where the affinity of Hap1 dimer binding is known to be high (31Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, lanes 1–8). At the M2 site, dimer binding was weaker, and HMC binding was barely observable. Binding by both HMC and Hap1 dimer was not observed at the M1 and M3 sites that contain only one CGG triplet. Quantitation showed that the intensity of the HMC band varied to about the same degree as the intensity of the Hap1 dimer band at these sites. The data strongly suggest that the HMC, like the Hap1 dimer formed in the presence of heme, requires a complete site containing a direct repeat of two CGG triplets for binding, suggesting that the HMC recognizes DNA as a Hap1 dimer, not a monomer. To further verify this result, we carried out competition experiments. We examined the effects of various unlabeled DNA sites on HMC and Hap1 dimer binding to the radiolabeled consensus HC1 site (Fig.4). We used unlabeled HC1, M1, M2, and M3 oligonucleotides to compete with the binding of HMC and Hap1 dimer to the radiolabeled HC1 site. The cold HC1 oligonucleotides completely out-competed DNA binding by the HMC and Hap1 dimer (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2), M2 oligonucleotides competed slightly with the binding by the HMC and Hap1 dimer to labeled HC1 (compare lanes 7 and 8 withlanes 1 and 2), and M1 and M3 did not compete with (perhaps M3 even enhanced) the binding at labeled HC1 (comparelanes 5, 6, 9, and 10 withlanes 1 and 2). Quantitation showed that these oligonucleotides competed with the HMC and dimer binding to the same extent. These results again showed that the HMC and the Hap1 dimer behaved similarly when binding to various DNA sites. These DNA binding experiments (see Figs. 3 and 4) strongly suggested that the HMC, like the Hap1 dimer formed in the presence of heme, cooperatively binds to DNA as a dimer. The above results suggest that the HMC is a preexisting Hap1 dimer, bound and repressed by molecular chaperones. Thus, we expect that heme should cause the dissociation of molecular chaperones in the HMC, thereby leading to Hap1 activation. To test this idea, we attempted to purify Hap1 in the presence of heme. However, this experiment was not successful because heme binds strongly to the columns (heme is known to be a very sticky molecule, and it stuck to all kinds of beads we tested, including Ni-NTA beads). When extracts were loaded onto the column in the presence of heme, most of the heme stuck to the beads on the top of the column and became ineffective in dissociating the HMC. We also tried to dissociate Hap1 from the HMC by purifying Hap1 from denatured yeast extracts. However, Hap1 is very labile under denaturing conditions, and we were not able to recover any full-length Hap1 from the Ni-NTA columns (the longest contained only the DNA-binding domain). Despite these setbacks, we obtained evidence suggesting that overexpression of Hap1 indeed functionally titrates out the molecular chaperones in the HMC (Fig. 5). As the Hap1 protein level increased, Hap1 DNA binding activity progressively increased (Fig. 5 A). First, more and more HMC formed (Fig.5 A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and8). Second, the amount of the HMC reached its limit, presumably because the molecular chaperones were titrated out, and extra Hap1 formed the lower molecular weight, dimeric Hap1 complex (DC) (Fig. 5 A, lane 8). Further, as the Hap1 expression level gradually rose, Hap1 transcriptional activity in vivo simultaneously increased, even in the absence of heme (Fig.5 B). Hap1 activity reached a significant level (about 50-fold higher than the basal transcription level) under the condition that the smaller DC formed (see Fig. 5 B, 8-h induction time, and Fig. 5 A, lane 8), although this level of activity was still 10-fold less than Hap1 activity in the presence of heme (see Fig. 1 A). Together, these results suggest that titration of molecular chaperones in the HMC is functionally linked to Hap1 transcriptional activation. In this report, we begin to probe the mechanism by which Hap1 is repressed in the HMC. We present strong evidence suggesting that Hap1 is a preexisting dimer or possibly higher oligomer in the HMC in the absence of heme. First, Hap1 and His6-Hap1ΔKpn coeluted on the Ni-NTA column in the absence of heme (Fig. 2). Second, DNA binding analysis of the HMC showed that the HMC binds to various DNA sites in a manner similar to Hap1 dimer binding but not monomer binding (32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (see Figs. 3 and 4). Third, increasing overexpression of Hap1 leads to increased DNA binding, the formation of the smaller Hap1 dimeric complex, and a significant level of Hap1 transcriptional activity in the absence of heme. These results suggest that Hap1 repression in the absence of heme is due, at least in part, to the interference of DNA binding of the preexisting Hap1 dimer by molecular chaperones. If the HMC was not a preexisting dimer in the absence of heme, and heme were required for Hap1 dimerization, then overexpression of Hap1 would not lead to the formation of the smaller dimeric complex. Further, the correlation between the increase of Hap1 transcriptional activity in vivo (Fig. 5 B) and the increase of Hap1 DNA binding activity from both the HMC and DC in vitro(Fig. 5 A) suggests that the titration of molecular chaperones is functionally important for Hap1 activation. Previously, it was postulated that in the absence of heme, Hap1 is prevented from dimerization by other proteins in the HMC; thus, it cannot bind to DNA with high affinity and activate transcription (22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Zhang L. Bermingham M.O. Turcotte B. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2851-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Heme presumably disrupts the HMC, so Hap1 is free to dimerize and thus bind to DNA with high affinity, thereby activating transcription (22Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zhang L. Bermingham M.O. Turcotte B. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2851-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our data argue against this simple dimerization model. The data show that in the absence of heme, Hap1 preexists as a dimer or possibly higher oligomer. Further, the two subunits of the preexisting dimer act cooperatively in DNA binding; disrupting the interaction of one subunit with one CGG triplet completely abolished HMC binding. Clearly, because of the interference of molecular chaperones, the DNA binding affinity of the HMC is greatly reduced compared with that of the Hap1 dimer formed in the presence of heme (see Figs. 1, 3, 4, and5). The low DNA binding affinity of the HMC may result from weakened Hap1-Hap1 dimer interactions, weakened Hap1-DNA interactions, or both. In any case, the two Hap1 subunits of the HMC are very likely in direct physical contact with each other because they must be close enough to recognize simultaneously the two CGG triplets, separated by only six base pairs (31Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Zhang L. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4676-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest a new model for how heme regulates Hap1 activity. In the absence of heme, Hap1 exists as a dimer in the HMC, but its DNA binding and perhaps transcription-activating activities are inhibited by molecular chaperones. When heme binds to Hap1, it may induce certain Hap1 conformational changes, disrupting the inhibitory interactions imposed on the preexisting Hap1 dimer by molecular chaperones in the HMC. Consequently, the inhibition on Hap1 is relieved and allows the Hap1 dimer to bind to DNA with high affinity, thereby leading to Hap1 activation. This model predicts that dissociation of molecular chaperones in the HMC should lead to Hap1 activation. Indeed, data shown in Fig. 5 suggest that molecular chaperones can be functionally titrated out by overexpression of Hap1, and this titration leads to significant increases in Hap1 DNA binding and transcriptional activities. This model provides a new example of how the activity of a dimeric transcription factor can be controlled. Perhaps the activity of many other dimeric transcription factors, such as Mal63 and Pdr1 of the Gal4 family, is also regulated in this manner."

Science. 1929; 70: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) discovered PCr in vertebrate skeletal muscle, Meyerhof and Lohmann (20Meyerhof O. Lohmann K. Biochem. J. 1928; 196: 22-49Google Scholar) found another phosphagen, PArg, in crustacean muscle (4Needham D.M. Needham J. Baldwin G. Yudkin J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1932; 110: 260-294Crossref Google Scholar). Six years later, Lohmann demonstrated the reaction in muscle extracts prepared from crabs. The first equilibrium constant was performed by Lehmann in 1936, who reported a value of K′AK = 3.1 at pH 7.7 in the direction of ATP, a value close to unity (6Lehmann H. Biochem. Z. 1936; 286: 336Google Scholar). The next major study on the thermodynamics AK was by Szorenyi et al. (7Szorenyi E.T. Dvornkiova P.D. Degtyar P.G. C. R. Acad. Sci. U. R. S. S. 1949; 67: 341-344Google Scholar), who reported a constant of 500 at pH 6.1 and 5.9 at pH 9.1. The soviet study provided the first glimpse into the major effect of pH on K′AK (8Virden R. Watts D.C. Baldwin E. Biochem. J. 1964; 94: 536-544Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nearly two decades later Uhr et al. (9Uhr M.L. Marcus F. Morrison J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5428-5435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studied the effect of magnesium on the AK equilibrium. By substituting the initial rates of reaction into the Haldane relationship, they calculated K′AK = 2.4 at pH 8.0, [Mg2+] = 1.0 mm at 30 °C, and unspecified ionic strength (I) (9Uhr M.L. Marcus F. Morrison J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5428-5435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a second approach of attaining equilibria, then stopping the reaction and measuring ATP, they obtained K′AK values of 0.82, 0.47, and 0.41 at [Mg2+] concentrations of 0.12, 0.61, and 1.93 mm, respectively (9Uhr M.L. Marcus F. Morrison J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5428-5435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1969, Smith and Morrison (10Smith E. Morrison J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4224-4234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reinvestigated the kinetics and equilibria of arginine kinase and reported a similar value of K′AK= 1.3 in the direction of ATP formation. In 1986 Graham et al. (11Graham R.A. Ellington W.R. Chih C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 887: 157-163Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) measured the forward and reverse fluxes of the arginine kinase using saturation transfer 31P NMR in the isolated scallop adductor muscle in vitro. In addition, these researchers made some equilibrium measurements and reported a value for K′AK of 54 ± 6 at pH 7.1, 25 °C. More recently, Ellington (12Ellington W.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1989; 143: 177-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used31P NMR and a multiple equilibria approach to determine the value of K′AK at pH 7.25, 35 °C at unspecified free [Mg2+] and I. By allowing the creatine kinase and the arginine kinase reactions to reach equilibrium simultaneously in solution and assuming a K′CK of 100, these workers calculated that K′AK was 13% that of the value of K′CK, or K′AK = 13 (12Ellington W.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1989; 143: 177-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their NMR value of 13 agreed within 5% of the value determined by more conventional enzymatic analysis (12Ellington W.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1989; 143: 177-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). What emerges from this brief history is that even the best attempts to estimate K′AK suffer from a number of analytical problems that make it difficult to compare values between laboratories. The aim of the present study is to provide a quantitative assessment of the thermodynamics of the AK reaction at specified conditions of pH, pMg, T, and I. In addition we will examine the effect of temperature (5 to 40 °C), pH (6.4–8.2), free [Mg2+] (0.1 to 4 mm), and ionic strength (0.13–0.34 m). Last, our data will be compared and discussed with the thermodynamic properties of the creatine kinase reaction (13Lawson J.W.R. Veech R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6528-6537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Teague Jr., W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arginine kinase (EC 2.7.3.3) was purchased as 3.2 m ammonium sulfate suspension from lobster tail muscle (Sigma). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) grade 1 from yeast, hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) from yeast, lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) from beef heart, and pyruvate kinase (EC2.7.1.40) from rabbit skeletal muscle were purchased as the 3.2m ammonium sulfate suspensions from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Pyruvate monosodium salt, ATP-crystallized disodium salt, ADP disodium salt, P-enolpyruvate tricyclohexylammonium salt, NADH monosodium salt (grade 1), and NADP disodium salt (98%) were also obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. d-Glucose, imidazole (low fluorescence blank 0.002%), Trizma (Tris base (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane)), phosphate potassium salt (monobasic and dibasic), and EDTA (acid form) were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Phosphoarginine disodium salt, arginine HCl (ultra >99%), phosphate sodium salt (monobasic and dibasic), potassium chloride, magnesium chloride (anhydrous), and the potassium salts of ATP and ADP were purchased from Sigma. NADH or NADP oxidation-reduction was monitored at 340 nm and 1-cm path-length using a GBC 918 UV-visible spectrophotometer (GBC Scientific Equipment Pty. Ltd. Melbourne Australia), taking the extinction coefficient of NADH under these conditions to be 6.22 × 10+6cm2/mol at 340 nm. In those instances where the limitations of the UV-visible spectrophotometer were reached (e.g. ADP) when the equilibrium was approached, favoring ATP and arginine formation, the oxidation of NADH was monitored by a change in fluorescence using a Farrand Ratio-2 fluorometer (Optical Technology Devices, Inc., Elmsford, NY) and disposable borosilicate Kimble glass culture tubes (10 × 75 mm). The AK reaction was carried out from the forward and reverse direction in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 110 mmpotassium chloride, and 5.8 mm magnesium chloride. For the forward direction, the reaction buffer contained an additional 5 mm PArg and 5 mm ADP. The reaction buffer for the reverse direction contained 5 mm Arg and 5 mm ATP but no PArg or ADP. A 10-ml aliquot of each reaction buffer was placed in separate 10-ml conical-bottom reaction vials with V-shaped magnetic stirring bars (Pierce). These reaction vials were sealed with removable Teflon caps and placed in a Neslab RTE100 temperature-controlled water bath (Neslab Instruments, Portsmouth, NH). The experimental temperature was maintained ± 0.1 °C. A water/air-powered magnetic stir motor operating at approximately 150 revolutions/min was used to mix the reaction vials throughout the experiment. The temperature of the water bath was initially set at 5 °C. The reaction buffer pH was monitored using a Radiometer Copenhagen PHM 93 Reference pH meter, with a Radiometer Copenhagen PHC 2005 electrode. During the temperature experiments, the pH meter was calibrated at each experimental temperature using the Radiometer Copenhagen 47.5 mm phosphate S11M004 pH 7.0 ± 0.01 at 25 °C. This pH standard had a temperature coefficient (ΔpH/Δt °C) of −0.0028. This was appropriate for our experimental reaction buffers that contained 50 mm phosphate. The vials containing the reaction buffer were allowed 20 min to reach temperature before initiation of the reaction with enzyme. A stock 200-μl aliquot of AK in 3.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.01 m glycine buffer, pH 8.0, 0.01 m mercaptoethanol, and 1.0 mm EDTA was placed into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf test tube and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then carefully removed and discarded. The enzyme precipitate was dissolved in 175 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and placed on ice until the time of use. 25 μl of this prepared enzyme solution was added to each 10-ml reaction vial. After the 1-h equilibration period, pH readings of each reaction vial were taken in triplicate before the removal of a 1-ml aliquot. This 1-ml aliquot of reaction buffer was placed in a Centricon 30 spin filter housed in a centrifuge rotor maintained at 5 °C. The sample was then centrifuged at 4500 × g in a centrifuge maintained at the same temperature for 5 min, and the filtrate was retained. The enzyme-free filtrate containing the reactants of the AK reaction were removed and kept at −80 °C until analysis. The temperature was then reset on the water bath to 15 °C, new filters were placed in the rotor head, and the reaction was allowed 1 h to establish equilibrium at the new temperature. The same process was repeated at 15, 25, 33, and 40 °C, and the rotor head and centrifuge were maintained at the different temperatures. Experiments studying the variation of pH, free [Mg2+], and I were carried out in a similar manner. For the pH experiment, initial reaction buffers were the same as for the temperature experiment, except the initial pH was adjusted to pH = 6.4, and the initial temperature was set at 25 °C. Potassium hydroxide (10 m stock) was added in μl amounts to adjust the pH to 6.7, 7.0, 7.4, 7.8, and 8.2. For the free [Mg2+] experiment, initial reactions contained only 1.4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, and 25 °C. Solid MgCl2·6H20 was added to adjust free [Mg2+] concentrations from 0.1 to 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mm. For the ionic strength experiment, initial reactions contained only 10 mm KCl, pH 7.0, and 25 °C. Solid KCl was added to adjust ionic strength from 0.13 to 0.19, 0.24, 0.29, and 0.34 m. Spectrophotometric and fluorometric enzymatic assays were carried out according to the procedures described in Lowry and Passonneau (15Lowry O. Passonneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Total adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) was measured in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.4 mmd-glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm NADP containing 0.35 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated with 0.7 units/ml hexokinase and complete in 5 to 10 min. Total phosphoarginine phosphate (PArg) was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (ICI) using two LC1100 HPLC pumps, a LC 1600 autosampler, a LC 1200 UV-visible detector and DP800 data collection module and software. The autosampler was cooled using a Neslab RTE-110 variable temperature water bath/pump set at 0 °C. Samples were maintained at a constant 3 °C for the duration of their time in the autosampler for a maximum of 3 h. It was determined by repeated measurements of the same sample over this time period that there was no loss of phosphoarginine. The separation was carried out using a Waters Spherisorb S5 SAX 4.6 × 250-mm strong anion exchange analytical cartridge equilibrated with 0.5 mmsodium phosphate, 1.25 mm sodium chloride, pH 3.2, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Sample runs lasted 20 min with the initial conditions maintained until 7 min, at which the pump gradient program switched the eluent to 200 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride, pH 4.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Phosphoarginine has a retention time of 4.6 min. The stronger buffer was used to wash off the ATP and ADP in the sample. This wash with the second buffer lasted 15 min, at which time the column was re-equilibrated at the initial conditions for 5 min in preparation for the next sample. Total run time was 20 min with data collection only necessary for the first 10 min. Total arginine (Arg) was measured in 100 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm [squlf], 30 mm KCl, 0.5 mm P-enolpyruvate, 1 mm ATP, 0.100 mm NADH containing 5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase and 5 units/ml pyruvate kinase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 150 units/ml arginine kinase. The reaction was complete in 10 min. Total adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP) was assayed in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (30 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm P-enolpyruvate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.100 mm NADH containing 1.25 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. ADP was then measured by the addition of 5.0 units/ml pyruvate kinase. The reactions were complete in 5 min. The reagent for the fluorometric assay of ADP was identical to that described for the spectrophotometric assay, except that the NADH was reduced to 0.005 mm, and the reaction was initiated with 0.2 units/ml pyruvate kinase. The ΔH° values for the acid-dissociation and magnesium binding reactions used in our study are those used in Golding et al. (16Golding E.M. Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception of the acid dissociation and magnesium binding constants to PArg. The temperature variation of K a for PArg was estimated using a ΔH° (I = 0) of +2.66 kJ mol−1, giving values of 2.91 × 10−5, 3.09 × 10−5, 3.28 × 10−5, 3.44 × 10−5, and 3.58 × 10−5m at 5, 15, 25, 33, and 40 °C, respectively The temperature variation of K b for PArg was estimated using a ΔH° (I = 0 of +9.84 kJ mol−1), giving values of 34.9, 38.8, 42.7, 45.7, and 48.1m−1 at 5, 15, 25, 33, and 40 °C, respectively. Further details of these calculations can be found in Teague et al. (17Teague Jr., W.E. Golding E.M. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 509-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the values are reported at 25 °C, and an ionic strength of zero (I = 0). The published ΔH° values for the acid dissociation constant for PArg was based on values for PCr (14Teague Jr., W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The magnesium binding constant for PArg was that reported in Data for Biochemical Research (18Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford1986Google Scholar). The ΔH° value for the PArg magnesium binding constant was estimated from knowing the ΔG° and the average value of ΔS° for other similarly charged metabolites such as the magnesium binding reactions of PCr. 2R. N. Goldberg, personal communication. This method of estimating ΔH° gave a value of 8.5 kJ mol-1and was then checked by changing the value by 2-fold and examining its effect on our results. No differences were apparent, indicating that this binder has little effect on the total system of equations. The free [Mg2+] and concentration of ionic species of reactants were calculated using a computer program written in the language of Mathematica® (Wolfram Research, MA). Briefly, total concentrations of reactants of the reaction at equilibrium, together with the total magnesium concentration, ionic strength, and the appropriate acid dissociation and metal binding constants, were substituted into a number of simultaneous equations. The ionic reactant species, free [Mg2+], K refs, and all the buffer components were calculated (14Teague Jr., W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Golding E.M. Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical significance between the equilibrium constants and temperature was assessed using Student'st test. All values reported are the mean ±S.E. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the mathematical relationships between K′AK and the experimental parameters, unless otherwise stated. Changes in dependent variables are statistically assessed using a two-way repeated measured analysis of variance (ANOVA). The α level of significance for all experiments was set at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Office 98. Equilibrium was judged complete when the apparent K′, [ATP][Arg]/[ADP][PArg], agreed to within 15% at experimental conditions of pH, free [Mg2+], and ionic strength from both directions. Table I shows the concentrations of metabolites before the addition of AK and at the first experimental point taken after 1 h at 5 °C. The results show a mean K′AK of 33.8 in the direction of ATP formation and 38.4 in the opposite direction. Importantly, although this difference is statistically significant (p < 0.05), the data refers to experimental conditions of approximately pH 7.0, a free [Mg2+] of approximately 1.0 mm, and an ionic strength of approximately 0.25m. When these K′experimental values are adjusted to specified conditions of pH 7.0, free [Mg2+] of 1.0 mm, and ionic strength of 0.25 m, the statistical significance disappears. At these ionic conditions, using our mathematical model we calculate a mean K′AK in the direction of ATP formation of 44.8 ± 0.83 (S.E.) (n = 4) and 45.6 ± 1.07 (n = 4) in the opposite direction. Thus, a 15% criteria for K′experimental satisfies the condition of attainment of equilibrium under our experimental conditions. For the other temperatures, K′AK values at pH = 7.0, free [Mg2+] = 1.0 mm, I = 0.25 m in the forward and reverse directions were as follows: 39.8 ± 1.50 (n = 4) versus39.4 ± 0.54 (n = 4) at 15 °C; 34.6 ± 1.08 versus 36.3 ± 0.84 at 25 °C; 33.9 ± 0.41versus 32.9 ± 0.80 at 33 °C, and 29.2 ± 0.78versus 30.7 ± 0.81 at 40 °C. At all temperatures, K′AK in both directions were not significantly different (p < 0.05). The same was also found for K′AK versuspH, free [Mg2+] and I (Table I). From this point we will only refer to the calculated K′AKat specified conditions.Table IAttainment of equilibrium from the forward and reverse directions for the AK reactionInitial concentrationsFinal concentrations[ADP][PArg][ATP][Arg][ADP][PArg][ATP][Arg]pH[Mg]K′AK10 −3m10 −3mForward direction: PArg + ADP = Arg + ATPA I4.605.58000.7500.7373.874.787.1585.5933.5A II4.605.58000.6990.7793.904.727.1485.5933.8A III4.605.58000.7150.7993.834.867.1455.5932.6A IV4.605.58000.7130.7473.894.817.1465.5935.1Reverse direction: Arg + ATP = PArg + ADPB I004.556.340.6750.7813.835.527.1155.7040.1B II004.556.340.7010.7553.865.067.1105.7036.9B III004.556.340.7090.7543.915.037.1085.7036.8B IV004.556.340.6730.7273.924.937.1075.7039.6Average K′AK forward direction = 33.8 ± 0.52 (S.E.)

From the van't Hoff plot, the Δ f H°′ for the AK biochemical reaction was −8.19 kJ mol−1. Similarly, from the intercept, where 1/K′ = zero, the entropy (Δf S′°) was + 2.2 J mol−1. The effect of temperature on the two chemical reactions was the following. ADP3−+PArg2−+H+↔ATP4−+HArgEquation 3 MgADP−+MgPArg+H+↔MgATP2−+HArg+Mg2+Equation 4 For Equation 3, the Δ f H° and Δ f S° was −16.10 kJ mol−1and +97.6 J mol−1, respectively, and for Reaction 4, was −20.97 kJ mol−1 and +41.1 J mol−1 (graph not shown, see Table II).Table IIValues of K′AK at varying conditions of temperature, pH, and free [Mg 2+]Temperature pH 7.0, [Mg2+] = 1.0 mm,I = 0.25 mpH T = 25 °C, [Mg2+] = 1.0 mm, I = 0.25mFree [Mg2+] T = 25 °C, pH 7.0, I = 0.25 m1.0 mm45.19 ± 0.6597.02 ± 3.9511.08 ± 0.11(5 °C)(pH 6.4)([Mg2+] = 0.1 mm)39.64 ± 0.7457.79 ± 2.9516.50 ± 0.31(15 °C)(pH 6.7)([Mg2+] = 0.25 mm)35.44 ± 0.7131.11 ± 1.0022.49 ± 0.42(25 °C)(pH 7.0)([Mg2+] = 0.5 mm)33.44 ± 0.4613.80 ± 0.3932.57 ± 2.57(33 °C)(pH 7.4)([Mg2+] = 1.0 mm)29.91 ± 0.595.74 ± 0.2039.76 ± 1.16(40 °C)(pH 7.8)([Mg2+] = 2.0 mm)2.15 ± 0.1146.50 ± 1.07(pH 8.2)([Mg2+] = 4.0 mm) Open table in a new tab The effect of pH on the K′AK is shown in Fig. 2. The AK reaction was studied at six different pH values, 6.4, 6.7, 7.0, 7.4, 7.8, and 8.2 at free [Mg2+] of 1.0 mm, 25 °C, andI = 0.25 m. Like most other kinases, the AK reaction is extremely sensitive to pH. From a fall in pH from 8.2 to 6.4, K′AK varies 10-fold from 10 to about 100. Of interest in Fig. 2 is the excellent agreement between the measured effects of pH on K′AK (open circles) and the theoretical curve (closed black circles). This theoretical curve was calculated using K refAKfrom Equation 3 above and knowledge of acid dissociation and magnesium binding constants (16Golding E.M. Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The equation linking K′AKto K AKis KAK′=KrefAK[H+]1+[H+]KaATP+(KbMgATP[Mg2+])+(KbMgHATP[H+][Mg2+])KaATP1+[H+]KaADP+(KbMgADP[Mg2+])+(KbMgHADP[H+][Mg2+])KaADP1+[H+]KaPArg+(KbMgPArg[Mg2+])Equation 5 where K a values are the acid dissociation constants, K b values are magnesium binding constants, [Mg2+] is the free magnesium concentration, and [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration, all inm. The high degree of agreement between the experimentally determined values and theoretically predicted values of K′AK suggest that the equation linking K′AK toK refAK was an accurate representation of the effects of pH on the K′AK (see Table II). The effect of free [Mg2+] on the K′AK is shown in Fig.3. The AK equilibrium was also studied at six values of free [Mg2+] of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mm (pH = 7.0, T = 25 °C, andI = 0.25 m). The effect of [Mg2+] was not as pronounced as the effect of pH. For example, the value of K′AKincreased only 4.5-fold over the range of [Mg2+] examined. Again, the black dots represent a theoretical plot of K′AK versus[Mg2+] using the method as discussed above for pH. There was excellent agreement between the observed and predicted values of K′AK (Eq. 5). The effect of ionic strength on the K′AK showed no significant differences between ionic strength of 0.13 and 0.34 m(graph not shown). Over this range of I, the K′AK changed from 32.5 to 31. However, it should be mentioned that although the K′AK did not vary significantly, it does not preclude the necessity of adjusting the equilibrium constants of reference reactions to ionic strength as we have done throughout. The equation linking K′AK toK ref (Eq. 4) contains numerous acid dissociation and magnesium binding constants, that all require meticulous adjustment to the conditions of T and I. This study examined in a quantitative manner the effect of temperature, pH, pMg, and I on the arginine kinase reaction. Table III summarizes the thermodynamics of the AK reaction and compares these values with the CK biochemical reaction at pH 7.0, [Mg2+] =1.0 mm, I = 0.25 m, 25 °C (14Teague Jr., W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed Gibbs energy (ΔG°′) for the AK reaction is −8.89 kJ mol−1 compared with −13.31 kJ mol−1 for the CK reaction. In addition, the AK biochemical reaction releases −3.74 kJ mol−1 less heat/mol of ATP formed than the CK biochemical reaction. Like CK, however, the ΔG°′AK is comprised mostly of enthalpy (92%) (Table III). The physiological significance of a lower ΔG°′ is that AK, which appears exclusively in invertebrate tissues, supports lower cytosolic [ATP]/[ADP] [Pi] compared with CK in vertebrate tissues (12Ellington W.R. J. Exp. Biol. 1989; 143: 177-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The underlying assumption for this prediction is that the arginine kinase operates near equilibrium in vivo as has been demonstrated for creatine kinase (19Veech R.L. Lawson J.W.R. Cornell N.W. Krebs H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6538-6547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIISummary of the thermodynamic values for the AK and CK biochemical and chemical reactionsBiochemical reactionsΔG°′ 25 °CΔH°′ 5–40 °CΔS°′ 5–40 °CTΔS°′ 25 °CkJ mol −1kJ mol −1J mol −1 K −1kJ mol −1PArg + ADP ↔ Arg + ATP (Eq.2)−8.89−8.19 (92%)+2.2+0.70 (8%)PCr + ADP ↔ Cr + ATP−13.31−11.93 (89%)+4.7+1.38 (11%)Chemical reactionsΔG° 25 °CΔH° 5–40 °CΔS° 5–40 °CTΔS° 25 °CkJ mol −1kJ mol −1J mol −1 K −1kJ mol −1ADP3− + PArg2− + H+ ↔ ATP4− + Arg (Eq.3)−45.01−16.10 (36%)+97.6+28.91 (64%)ADP3− + PCr2−+ H+ ↔ ATP4− + Cr−49.63−16.73 (34%)+110.4+32.90 (66%)MgADP− + MgPArg + H+ ↔ MgATP2− + Arg + Mg2+ (Eq.4)−32.87−20.97 (64%)+41.1+11.90 (36%)MgADP− + MgPCr + H+ ↔ MgATP2− + Cr + Mg2+−48.08−23.23 (48%)+83.5+24.85 (52%)CK values have been adjusted from 38 to 25 °C (14Teague Jr., W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All values are at I = 0.25 m. The percentages in parentheses for enthalpy and TΔS term are relative to the Gibbs energy. Open table in a new tab CK values have been adjusted from 38 to 25 °C (14Teague Jr., W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All values are at I = 0.25 m. The percentages in parentheses for enthalpy and TΔS term are relative to the Gibbs energy. In contrast to the biochemical reaction, the ΔG° for both reference reactions have much lower enthalpy contributions (TableIII). For the chemical reaction ADP3− + PArg2− + H+ ↔ ATP4− + Arg (Eq.3), the TΔS° term contributes to 64% of the ΔG° and 66% for the CK reaction. The similarities between the AK and CK reactions are probably because of the similarities in the acid dissociation constants (14Teague Jr., W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Golding E.M. Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the chemical reaction MgADP− + MgPArg + H+ ↔ MgATP2−+Arg + Mg2+ (Eq. 4), the TΔS° term contributes 36% to the overall ΔG° and somewhat higher for the CK reaction. Again the differences are probably because of the magnesium binding constants for PArg and PCr. At present we do not know the reasons for the differences in the relative contributions of enthalpy and TΔS° term to Gibbs energy between the biochemical and chemical reactions. As would be expected there was no large differences between the relative effect pH and magnesium have on the AK and CK equilibria at 25 °C. For example, a fall in pH from 7.4 to 6.4 increased the K′AK 8-fold (from 9.6 to 76.3) and for K′CK about 7-fold (95 to 700) (13Lawson J.W.R. Veech R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6528-6537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Golding E.M. Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar trends hold true for the effect of magnesium. Changes in the K′ values for both AK and CK constants increase about 3-fold for an increase in [Mg2+] from 0.1 to 1.5 mm (13Lawson J.W.R. Veech R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6528-6537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Golding E.M. Teague W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the comparisons already discussed, the information provided in the present study can now be applied to more quantitative assessments between the cellular bioenergetics of invertebrate and vertebrate systems. Using the K′AK, the cytosolic [ATP]/[ADP] [Pi] and free [ADP] can be calculated using total reactant concentrations obtained from 31P NMR after adjustment of the constant to the pH and free [Mg2+] of the tissues. These adjustments can be made using the equation linking the K′AK to theK ref (see Eq. 5). In addition, using the ΔH°′ of −8.19 kJ mol−1 and oneK′ value at one temperature, a second K′ at a second temperature can be calculated using a rearrangement of the van't Hoff plot (14Teague Jr., W.E. Dobson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14084-14093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)."

The binding affinities of a series of lysine analogs, viz.4-aminobutyric acid, 5-aminopentanoic acid, ε-aminocaproic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, andt-4-aminomethylcyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid, to this mutant were measured and showed up to a 15-fold tighter interaction, as compared with wild-type K2Pg (K2Pg[C4G]). The variant, K2Pg[C4G/E56D], afforded up to a 4-fold increase in the binding affinity to these same ligands, whereas the K2Pg[C4G/L72Y] mutant decreased the same affinities up to 5-fold, as compared with K2Pg[C4G]. The thermal stability of K2Pg[C4G/E56D/L72Y] was increased by approximately 13 °C, as compared with K2Pg[C4G]. The functional consequence of up-regulating the lysine binding property of K2Pg was explored, as reflected by its ability to interact with an internal sequence of a plasminogen-binding protein (PAM) on the surface of group A streptococci. A 30-mer peptide of PAM, containing its K2Pg-specific binding region, was synthesized, and its binding to each mutant of K2Pg was assessed. Only a slight enhancement in peptide binding was observed for K2Pg[C4G/E56D], compared with K2Pg[C4G] (K d = 460 nm). A 5-fold decrease in binding affinity was observed for K2Pg[C4G/L72Y] (K d = 2200 nm). However, a 12-fold enhancement in binding to this peptide was observed for K2Pg[C4G/E56D/L72Y] (K d = 37 nm). Results of these PAM peptide binding studies parallel results of ω-amino acid binding to these K2Pg mutants, indicating that the high affinity PAM binding by plasminogen, mediated exclusively through K2Pg, occurs through its lysine-binding site. This conclusion is supported by the 100-fold decrease in PAM peptide binding to K2Pg[C4G/E56D/L72Y] in the presence of 50 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid. Finally, a thermodynamic analysis of PAM peptide binding to each of these mutants reveals that the positions Asp56 and Tyr72 in the K2Pg[C4G/E56D/L72Y] mutant are synergistically coupled in terms of their contribution to the enhancement of PAM peptide binding.

Kringles are modular units found in a number of proteins that participate in the blood coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. These structural motifs contain approximately 80 amino acids with three disulfide bonds in a 1–6, 2–4, 3–5 arrangement. The copy numbers of kringles vary in these proteins. For example, a single kringle is found in urokinase-type plasminogen activator (1Steffens G.J. Gunzler W.A. Otting F. Frankus E. Flohe L. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol.

K3Pghas not as yet been directly implicated in the functioning of hPg. The interactions of hPg and plasmin with fibrinogen and fibrin, as well as with cell surfaces, are inhibited by lysine and its structural analogues. K1Pg (20Menhart N. Sehl L.C. Kelley R.F.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). K3Pg does not measurably interact with ligands of this type (24Marti D. Schaller J. Ochensberger B. Rickli E.E. Eur. J.

These combination of studies have shown that those kringle residues most directly involved in ligand binding are Asp54and Asp56 (K1Pg numbering) which coordinate the amino group of the ω-amino acid ligand, Arg70(Lys33 in the case of K2tPA) which stabilizes the carboxylate moiety of the ligand, and Trp61 and Tyr71 which accommodate the methylene groups of the ligand in the binding pocket. A verification of the extent of understanding of the interactions critical to this binding event would be to design the binding site in a kringle module that does not contain such a site or, more modestly, to up-regulate this site in a kringle motif that possesses a weaker site. This latter feature characterizes K2Pg, and it was our aim to redesign this kringle unit to contain a stronger ω-amino acid-binding site. The results of this investigation are reported herein. A construct containing K1Pg linked through a factor Xa-sensitive cleavage site (IEGR) to K2Pg was inserted into the yeast expression bacterial shuttle vector pPIC9k (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) (pPIC9k[K1PgXaK2Pg]) and used as the template DNA for PCR-based mutagenesis. The plasmid was provided by Hui Wang of this laboratory. The K2Pg was amplified by PCR for preparation of the mutants used in the work described herein. For PCR-based amplification of K2Pg, the forward primer (1Steffens G.J. Gunzler W.A. Otting F. Frankus E. Flohe L. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1982; 363: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), 5′-CGATGAATTCTCCGAGGAATGTATGCATTGC, consisted of the 5′ end of the K2Pg gene, engineered with a 5′ EcoRI site (in bold). The reverse primer (P2), 5′-ATTCGCGGCCGC TTACTATGCTGCGCAGCGGGGG, contained the 3′ end of the K2Pg gene, engineered with a 3′NotI site. This primer also coded for two Ala residues (mutated bases underlined) immediately following the final residue, Cys78, of K2Pg. Two Thr residues are found at these positions in the natural hPg molecule, but they have been replaced by Ala residues to avoid the possibility ofO-linked glycosylation at these sites during the subsequent expression in yeast. This primer also encodes two stop codons (initalics) immediately following the two Ala residues and are immediately upstream of the NotI site. By using primers P1 and P2, a 276-bp fragment (F1) was amplified, containing the wild-type K2Pg gene flanked by an upstreamEcoRI site and a downstream NotI site, which were used to ligate F1 into plasmid pPIC9k, generating the pPIC9k[K2Pg] construct. The ultimate expression of the isolated wtr-K2Pg gene product yielded little intact properly folded target material. This is most likely due to the existence of Cys4, which is normally disulfide-linked to the Cys42 of K3Pg in hPg. Therefore, the Cys4 of K2Pg was mutated to Gly, which is the amino acid found in all ligand-binding kringles of hPg at this position. This is considered to be the wild-type K2Pg. This plasmid was generated with a two-round PCR strategy, using the pPIC9k[K2Pg] as the template. For round 1, the forward primer (P3) was 5′-ACTACTATTGCCAGCATTGC, which is positioned approximately 86 bases upstream of the 5′ terminus of the K2Pg gene, at the α-factor signal sequence of the pPIC9k vector. The reverse primer (P4) employed was 5′-CTCCACTGC CATGCATAC, which contains the sequence within the K2Pg gene coding for the C4G mutation (the codon for G is in bold, with the mutated base underlined). By using primers P3 and P4, a 105-bp fragment (F2) containing the C4G mutation was amplified from the pPIC9k/[K2Pg] template. The forward primer (P5), 5′-GTATGCATG GCAGTGGAG, is the complement of P4 and also contains the sequence within the K2Pg gene which codes for the C4G mutation (the codon for Gly is in bold, with the mutated base underlined). The reverse primer (P6), 5′-GGCAAATGGCATTCTGACATCCTC, is positioned approximately 130 bases downstream from the 3′ end of the K2Pg gene, at the 3′ AOX1 gene sequence region of the pPIC9k vector. By using primers P5 and P6, a 370-bp fragment (F3) containing the C4G mutation was amplified from the pPIC9k[K2Pg] template. Because fragments F2 and F3 are complementary around the region of the C4G mutation in K2Pg, they were employed as overlapping templates in round 2 of a PCR reaction, using primers P3 and P6 to amplify a 457-bp fragment (F4). This latter fragment is composed of the following genes: α-factor signal sequence EcoRI site-SEE[K2Pg/C4G]AA-NotI site-3′AOX1. The upstream EcoRI and downstream NotI sites were used to ligate the PCR-amplified DNA into the pPIC9k vector, thus creating the pPIC9k[K2Pg/C4G] construct. Plasmid pPIC9k[K2Pg/C4G] was used as the template for the generation by PCR of the double mutant K2Pg construct, pPIC9k[K2Pg/C4G, E56D]. Reverse primer P7 5′-CAAGGCCGCAGATCCCTATCG and forward primer P8 5′-CGATAGGGATCTGCGGCCTTG are complementary primers at the region of Glu56 of the K2Pg gene, and both contain the E56D mutation (in bold). Forward P3 and reverse primer P7 were used to amplify a 265-bp fragment (F5) containing the genes encoding the amino-terminal region of K2Pg, including the C4G and E56D mutations. Forward primer P8 and reverse primer P6 were used to amplify a 213-bp fragment (F6) containing the gene encoding for the carboxyl-terminal region of K2Pg, including the E56D mutation. Because fragments F5 and F6 are complementary around the region of the E56D mutation, they were used as overlapping templates in a subsequent PCR reaction, using primers P3 and P6 to amplify a 457-bp fragment (F7). F7 is comprised of the genes for the following: α-factor signal sequence EcoRI site-SEE[K2Pg/C4G, E56D]AA-NotI site-3′AOX1, which was ligated into pPIC9k through the upstream EcoRI and downstream NotI sites as above. The pPIC9k[K2Pg/C4G] DNA was used as the template for the generation by PCR of the double mutant K2Pg construct, pPIC9k [K2Pg/C4G, L72Y]. Reverse primer P9, 5-GATGTCGCAATATTCCCAGCGCTT, and forward primer P10, AAGCGCTGGGAATATTGCGACATC, are complementary primers at the region of the Leu72 of the K2Pggene, and both contain the L72Y mutation (in bold). Forward primer P3 and reverse primer P9 were used to amplify a 312-bp fragment (F8) containing the genes encoding for the amino-terminal region of K2Pg, including the C4G and L72Y mutations. Forward primer P10 and reverse primer P6 were used to amplify a 169-bp fragment F9 containing the gene encoding for the carboxyl-terminal region of K2Pg, including the L72Y mutation. Because fragments F8 and F9 are complementary around the region of the L72Y mutation, they were used as overlapping templates in a subsequent PCR reaction, using primers P3 and P6 to amplify a 457-bp fragment (F10). Fragment F10 is comprised of the genes for the following: α-factor signal sequence EcoRI site-SEE[K2Pg/C4G, L72Y]AA-NotI site-3′AOX1, which was ligated into pPIC9k through the upstream EcoRI and downstream NotI sites as above. The same PCR strategy, described above, that was used for the generation of pPIC9k[K2Pg/C4G, L72Y] was used to create pPIC9k[K2Pg/C4G, E56D, L72Y], using pPIC9k[K2Pg/C4G, E56D] DNA as the template. The final fragment (F11) was a 457-bp product comprised of the genes for the following: α-factor signal sequence EcoRI site-SEE[K2Pg/C4G, E56D, L72Y]AA-NotI site-3′AOX1, which was ligated into pPIC9k as above. For each of these variants, 35 transformed clones were screened for expression on a small scale. The best expressing clones from plasmids linearized with either BglII orSalI, and transformed into the GS115 strain of Pichia pastoris, were fermented with a 20-h methanol induction. The media were then collected and removed by centrifugation. After adjusting the supernatant to pH 7.8, the precipitated salts were removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was directly percolated over a lysine-Sepharose column that was equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. In the case of the K2Pg[C4G] mutant, the protein bound weakly to the column and was eluted with extensive application of the wash buffer, viz. 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. Elution with the competing ligand, EACA, was not necessary. The retarded protein, however, bound to the column to a sufficient degree to be separated from any contaminating yeast proteins produced in the fermentation. No further purification was necessary. The yield was >100 mg/liter after purification. For K2Pg[C4G/E56D], purification on lysine-Sepharose column was attained by chromatography with lower ionic strength buffer than above, viz. 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. Under these conditions, this peptide was retained more tightly than was the case with K2Pg/C4G but could still be eluted from the column in a purified form with extensive washing. However, a large fraction was eluted with 0.15 mEACA. The final yield was approximately 100 mg/liter. In the case of K2Pg[C4G/L72Y], the lysine-Sepharose step afforded no purification since this protein was not retarded during this process. Therefore, the media were dialyzed extensively against a solution of 25 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5, and percolated over a Mono S column pre-equilibrated in the same buffer, using fast protein liquid chromatography. A 0–0.5 m linear gradient of NaCl in 25 mm NaOAc, pH 4.5, was applied to the column at 1 ml/min over 60 min. The peptide was eluted in a homogeneous state at 0.5m NaCl. The purified yield was >100 mg/liter. The variant, K2Pg[C4G/E56D/L72Y], did adsorb to the lysine-Sepharose column in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. After extensive washing with this same buffer, the peptide was batch-eluted with 0.15 m EACA. A homogenous product was obtained in a yield of >160 mg/liter. The 30-mer PAM peptide, VEK30, that interacts with the K2 domain of hPg (17Wistedt A.C. Kotarsky H. Marti D. Ringdahl U. Castellino F.J. Schaller J. Sjobring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24420-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), viz. Ac-[VEKLT ADAEL QRLKN ERHEE AELER LKSEY]-CONH2, was synthesized on a 0.1 mmol scale by automated solid state methodology on a PAL resin support (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA), using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 433A Peptide Synthesizer. Each residue was coupled using the manufacturer's protocols for FastMoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Deprotection of blocking groups and cleavage from the resin was effected using trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/dithiothreitol/triisopropylsilane (88/5/5/2, v/v/w) for 2 h at room temperature. The resin was separated from the peptide deprotection mixture by filtration, and the trifluoroacetic acid was removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation. Cold diethyl ether was added to the filtrate to precipitate the peptide. Following filtration and several ether washes, the crude peptide products were dissolved in water and lyophilized. Peptide purification was accomplished by ion exchange chromatography on a Bio-Rad DEAE-20 column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. A 500-ml linear gradient from 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (start solvent), to 10 mm Tris-HCl, 350 mmNaCl, pH 7.4 (limit solvent), was applied. Fractions corresponding to the major peak were pooled and lyophilized. Desalting was carried out on a 1.5 × 100-cm bed of Sephadex G-15 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 0.1% NH4OH. Pooled peptide fractions were lyophilized to constant weight and dissolved in water at final concentrations of 15–20 mm. These stock solutions were retained at −20 °C until needed. The purity of the peptide was assessed by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a 5 mm Vydac 218TP column (4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated in a solution containing 95% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, 5% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. At 3 min after injection onto the column, a 60-min linear gradient was implemented to a limiting value of 60% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, 40% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN. Absorbance detection was performed at 215 nm. Further characterization of the peptide was accomplished by DE-MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Voyager-DE spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems) as described previously (40Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry experiments were accomplished with a Nano Differential Scanning Calorimeter (Calorimetric Sciences Corp., Provo, UT). The peptides were dialyzed against a buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, or 100 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm EACA, pH 7.4. The peptide concentrations were approximately 1 mg/ml. Temperature scans were recorded between 20 and 95 °C at a scan rate of 1 °C/min. The temperatures of maximum heat capacity (T m) of the deconvoluted peaks were determined from the software that accompanied the calorimeter. Binding isotherms of ω-amino acids and the PAM-based peptide (VEK30) to K2Pg were obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with an OMEGA titration calorimeter (Microcal, Inc., Northhampton, MA) at 25 °C in a buffer of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Peptide samples ranging in concentrations from 30 to 90 μm in a total volume of 1.4 ml were placed in the reaction cell. After equilibration, an appropriate concentration of ω-amino acids or peptide VEK30 in matching buffer was delivered at discrete intervals in 5-μl aliquots. The observed heat was measured after each injection. The total observed heat effects were corrected for the heats of dilution of ligand by performing control titrations in the absence of peptide. The resulting titration curves were deconvoluted for the best-fit model using the ORIGIN for ITC software package supplied by Microcal and yielded values for stoichiometry of binding (n), K d, and ΔH. The binding of ligands to K2Pg and its variants was determined by titration of the change in intrinsic fluorescence in the kringle that occurred upon ligand binding. The experiments were carried out at 25 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-OAc, 150 mm NaOAc, pH 8.0. The K d values that characterize the ligand-kringle interaction were calculated from the fluorescence titrations by nonlinear least squares iterative curve fitting of the titration data (20Menhart N. Sehl L.C. Kelley R.F. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1948-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Molecular weight analysis of the K2tPA samples was measured by time-of-flight matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization with delayed-extraction mass spectrometry (TOF-MALDI-DE-MS) on a Voyager-DE spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) under conditions reported previously (41Chang Y. Zajicek J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7652-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal amino acid sequences of the mutant proteins were conducted as described (42Chibber B.A.K. Urano S. Castellino F.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All methods employed for manipulations of the DNA samples have been published earlier (20Menhart N. Sehl L.C. Kelley R.F.

Extinction coefficients of the kringles were calculated by the General Protein Mass Analysis for Windows software, based on the amino acid and disulfide bond composition. To examine the importance of specific amino acid residues in the lysine-binding site of the K2Pg, a series of mutations,viz. C4G, C4G/E56D, C4G/L72Y, and C4G/E56D/L72Y, were incorporated into this isolated module that would be predicted to up-regulate its LBS. To obtain sufficient amounts of the variant recombinant kringles, a P. pastoris expression system was employed that has been successfully used by this laboratory to obtain large amounts of other kringles from hPg, as well as from tPA (23Chang Y.
