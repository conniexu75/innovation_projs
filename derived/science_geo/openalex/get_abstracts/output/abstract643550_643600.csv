https://openalex.org/W2990182987,"Bile acids are abundant in the mammalian gut, where they undergo bacteria-mediated transformation to generate a large pool of bioactive molecules. Although bile acids are known to affect host metabolism, cancer progression and innate immunity, it is unknown whether they affect adaptive immune cells such as T helper cells that express IL-17a (TH17 cells) or regulatory T cells (Treg cells). Here we screen a library of bile acid metabolites and identify two distinct derivatives of lithocholic acid (LCA), 3-oxoLCA and isoalloLCA, as T cell regulators in mice. 3-OxoLCA inhibited the differentiation of TH17 cells by directly binding to the key transcription factor retinoid-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) and isoalloLCA increased the differentiation of Treg cells through the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS), which led to increased expression of FOXP3. The isoalloLCA-mediated enhancement of Treg cell differentiation required an intronic Foxp3 enhancer, the conserved noncoding sequence (CNS) 3; this represents a mode of action distinct from that of previously identified metabolites that increase Treg cell differentiation, which require CNS1. The administration of 3-oxoLCA and isoalloLCA to mice reduced TH17 cell differentiation and increased Treg cell differentiation, respectively, in the intestinal lamina propria. Our data suggest mechanisms through which bile acid metabolites control host immune responses, by directly modulating the balance of TH17 and Treg cells."
https://openalex.org/W2989785130,"Vision, choice, action and behavioural engagement arise from neuronal activity that may be distributed across brain regions. Here we delineate the spatial distribution of neurons underlying these processes. We used Neuropixels probes1,2 to record from approximately 30,000 neurons in 42 brain regions of mice performing a visual discrimination task3. Neurons in nearly all regions responded non-specifically when the mouse initiated an action. By contrast, neurons encoding visual stimuli and upcoming choices occupied restricted regions in the neocortex, basal ganglia and midbrain. Choice signals were rare and emerged with indistinguishable timing across regions. Midbrain neurons were activated before contralateral choices and were suppressed before ipsilateral choices, whereas forebrain neurons could prefer either side. Brain-wide pre-stimulus activity predicted engagement in individual trials and in the overall task, with enhanced subcortical but suppressed neocortical activity during engagement. These results reveal organizing principles for the distribution of neurons encoding behaviourally relevant variables across the mouse brain."
https://openalex.org/W2990914781,"Clinical trials using adult stem cells to regenerate damaged heart tissue continue to this day1,2, despite ongoing questions of efficacy and a lack of mechanistic understanding of the underlying biological effect3. The rationale for these cell therapy trials is derived from animal studies that show a modest but reproducible improvement in cardiac function in models of cardiac ischaemic injury4,5. Here we examine the mechanistic basis for cell therapy in mice after ischaemia-reperfusion injury, and find that-although heart function is enhanced-it is not associated with the production of new cardiomyocytes. Cell therapy improved heart function through an acute sterile immune response characterized by the temporal and regional induction of CCR2+ and CX3CR1+ macrophages. Intracardiac injection of two distinct types of adult stem cells, cells killed by freezing and thawing or a chemical inducer of the innate immune response all induced a similar regional accumulation of CCR2+ and CX3CR1+ macrophages, and provided functional rejuvenation to the heart after ischaemia-reperfusion injury. This selective macrophage response altered the activity of cardiac fibroblasts, reduced the extracellular matrix content in the border zone and enhanced the mechanical properties of the injured area. The functional benefit of cardiac cell therapy is thus due to an acute inflammatory-based wound-healing response that rejuvenates the infarcted area of the heart."

By constructing synthetic autotrophic organisms, we could learn what the main constraints are on natural autotrophs and how to improve their central metabolic pathways. Thus, a grand challenge in synthetic biology is to engineer autotrophy within a model heterotrophic organism. We can break this formidable task into three essential components. To enable a complete transition to autotrophy, the host must (1) operate CO2 fixation machinery in a pathway where the carbon input is comprised solely of CO2, while the outputs are organic molecules that enter central carbon metabolism and supply all 12 essential biomass precursors of the cell (Nielsen and Keasling, 2016Nielsen J. Keasling J.D. Engineering Cellular Metabolism.Cell. 2016; 164: 1185-1197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar); (2) express enzymatic machinery to obtain reducing power, either by harvesting non-chemical energy (light, electricity, etc.) or by oxidizing a reduced chemical compound that does not serve as a carbon source; and (3) regulate and coordinate the energy-harvesting and CO2-fixation pathways so that they together support steady-state growth with CO2 as the sole source of carbon (Barenholz et al., 2017Barenholz U.

Eng. 2018; 47: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to establish autocatalytic CO2 fixation cycles in model heterotrophs required the addition of multi-carbon organic compounds, which served, at least partially, as a carbon source, in order to achieve stable growth. Specifically, the metabolic design in our previous work (Antonovsky et al., 2016Antonovsky N. Gleizer S. Noor E. Zohar Y. Herz E. Barenholz U. Zelcbuch L. Amram S. Wides A.

Commun. 2017; 8: 1705Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was such that CO2 was the source of only a third of the cellular biomass carbon, with the rest supplied by an organic acid that served also as the reducing power and energy source. Therefore, the engineering of a heterotrophic organism to supply all its biomass components from inorganic carbon is still a standing challenge. Here, we report the establishment of synthetic autotrophy in E. coli. Our engineered E. coli strain uses the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (CBB, also referred to as Calvin cycle for short) for carbon fixation and harvests energy and reducing power from the one-carbon molecule formate (HCOO−), which can be produced electrochemically. The stepwise bioengineering process required coexpression of Calvin cycle enzymes and an energy harvesting enzyme, rational rewiring of the endogenous metabolic network, and adaptive laboratory evolution (Sonderegger and Sauer, 2003Sonderegger M.

The establishment of synthetic autotrophy demonstrates the incredible plasticity of central metabolism and could provide a framework for future carbon-neutral bioproduction. In order to convert E. coli to autotrophy in the laboratory, we considered several candidate compounds (Claassens et al., 2018Claassens N.J. Sánchez-Andrea I. Sousa D.Z. Bar-Even A. Towards sustainable feedstocks: A guide to electron donors for microbial carbon fixation.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2018; 50: 195-205Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to serve as electron donors for CO2 fixation. We chose formate as our electron source, because this one-carbon organic compound can serve as a source of reducing power (Berríos-Rivera et al., 2002Berríos-Rivera S.J. Bennett G.N. San K.-Y. Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli: increase of NADH availability by overexpressing an NAD(+)-dependent formate dehydrogenase.Metab. Eng. 2002; 4: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) but does not naturally support the growth of E. coli and is not assimilated into biomass. Its reduction potential (E0 = −420 mV) is low enough to reduce NAD+, the main electron carrier in the cell (E0 = −280 mV under physiological conditions in E. coli) (Huang et al., 2012Huang H. Wang S. Moll J. Thauer R.K. Electron bifurcation involved in the energy metabolism of the acetogenic bacterium Moorella thermoacetica growing on glucose or H2 plus CO2.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 3689-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Another advantage is that it can be electrochemically produced from renewable sources (Yishai et al., 2016Yishai O. Lindner S.N. Gonzalez de la Cruz J. Tenenboim H. Bar-Even A. The formate bio-economy.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2016; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and is seen as a promising path for carbon negative biomass formation. To harvest the electrons from formate and direct them into the main cellular reducing power reservoir NADH, we used an NAD+-coupled formate dehydrogenase (FDH; EC 1.17.1.9) from the methylotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas sp. 101 (Egorov et al., 1980Egorov A.M. Popov V.O. Berezin I.V. Rodionov U.V. Kinetic and structural properties of Nad-Dependent bacterial formate dehydrogenase.J. Solid-Phase Biochem. 1980; 5: 19-33Google Scholar). Stoichiometric analysis of the metabolic network in E. coli (Orth et al., 2010bOrth J.D. Thiele I. Palsson B.Ø. What is flux balance analysis?.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar) suggests that the addition of FDH, Rubisco, and phospho-ribulo-kinase (Prk) to the metabolic network of E. coli is sufficient for in silico autotrophic growth (Volpers et al., 2016Volpers M. Claassens N.J. Noor E. van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. Kengen S.W. Martins Dos Santos V.A. Integrated In Silico Analysis of Pathway Designs for Synthetic Photo-Electro-Autotrophy.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11: e0157851Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) in M9 minimal medium with formate and CO2 as cosubstrates (Figure 1). Yet, co-expression of the three recombinant enzymes in a naive BW25113 E. coli strain did not result in growth in autotrophic conditions. The stoichiometric analysis (Figure S1) does not take into account requirements such as tuning enzyme kinetics, expression level, and regulation. We thus decided to use adaptive laboratory evolution as a metabolic optimization tool (Antonovsky et al., 2016Antonovsky N. Gleizer S. Noor E. Zohar Y. Herz E. Barenholz U. Zelcbuch L. Amram S.

There is strong coupling between the formate uptake and the net CO2 production rate since formate can only be metabolised via FDH in our model. In reality, formate can be used for a relatively small flux of C1-related biosynthesis and these reactions are not part of the core model. However, at the measured growth rate, these fluxes are negligible compared to the FDH rate. The yellow shading indicates our measured value for the formate uptake rate (19 ± 2 mmol/gCDW/h).

Legend abbreviations are as follows: FDH, formate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; ICDHyr, isocitrate dehydrogenase; ME1, NAD+-dependent malate dehydrogenase; PPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; RBC, rubisco. The basic rationale behind our approach is as follows: heterologous expression of non-native enzymatic machinery expands the space of possible metabolic reactions for the cell, enabling autotrophic growth. However, this does not guarantee that the needed flux will flow through the newly expanded set of reactions. In fact, as the central metabolism of E. coli is adapted to heterotrophic growth, it is likely that flux distribution that supports heterotrophic growth would continue to be utilized. To drive flux toward the desired metabolic pathway, we employed adaptive laboratory evolution. Our approach combines rewiring central metabolism to establish a dependence on the Rubisco carboxylation flux, tailoring the growth medium to inhibit flux through the native heterotrophic pathways, and providing a significant selective advantage to utilizing autotrophic pathways. This, we hypothesized, will lead to the needed tuning of enzyme activity in a way that will divert flux to autotrophic pathways. The way in which our approach was implemented is shown in Figure 2A. First, we knocked out three genes encoding two enzymes in central carbon metabolism: phosphofructokinase (Pfk) in glycolysis and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (Zwf) in the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway. The former has two isoenzymes encoded by two genes (pfkA and pfkB). When growing cells on xylose, this rewiring ensures that cellular growth is dependent on carboxylation by Rubisco (Antonovsky et al., 2016Antonovsky N. Gleizer S. Noor E. Zohar Y. Herz E. Barenholz U. Zelcbuch L. Amram S. Wides A. Tepper N. et al.Sugar Synthesis from CO2 in Escherichia coli.Cell. 2016; 166: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). Second, we heterologously expressed Rubisco, Prk, carbonic anhydrase (CA, which interconverts CO2 and bicarbonate), and FDH. Third, we grew our cells in xylose-limited chemostats, which maintain cells in constant starvation for organic sugar carbon. This growth medium allows cells to proliferate, which is essential for evolution to take place, but inhibits the flux through heterotrophic catabolic pathways. The chemostat also contained an excess of formate and was constantly sparged with CO2-enriched (10%) air. Thus, we created conditions where we predict that cells that accumulate mutations leading to diversion of flux to the autotrophic pathway are selected. Such cells will reduce their dependence on the external organic sugar carbon input and gain a large selective advantage compared to the non-mutated cells, which are limited by the supply of xylose. We used a dilution rate of 0.02 h−1 following our previous experience at evolving an E. coli synthesizing sugars from CO2 (Antonovsky et al., 2016Antonovsky N. Gleizer S. Noor E. Zohar Y. Herz E.

We proceeded to test if, by continuous cultivation of the engineered strain in the tailored growth medium supplied by the chemostats, a completely autotrophic E. coli would evolve.Figure S2Metabolic Configuration for Mixotrophic Rubisco-Dependent Growth, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Metabolic depiction of native route of xylose metabolism in E. coli via the pentose phosphate pathway into glycolysis.

Upon the inoculation of the engineered strain into the xylose-limited chemostat with excess levels of formate, the residual levels of xylose dropped below the detection level, as expected under carbon-limited chemostat growth. We extracted samples from the chemostat once a week and tested for growth in autotrophic conditions. Specifically, these are chemo-organo-autotrophic conditions for E. coli, which consist of minimal M9 media supplemented with 30 mM sodium formate in an elevated CO2 (10%) atmosphere but without any other carbon source. Methylotrophs could potentially grow heterotrophically in such conditions, but we continuously monitored for the possibility of such contamination. After ≈200 days of chemostat propagation, equivalent to ≈150 chemostat generations, we observed growth in media devoid of xylose (autotrophic conditions). This phenotype persisted in all samples taken from that day on. Starting at day ≈350 of the chemostat adaptive laboratory evolution experiment, we omitted xylose from the feed media altogether as shown in Figure 2B. The sustained growth and turbidity implied full takeover by xylose-independent cells in the chemostat. We continued to validate growth of the extracted samples by repeatedly re-diluting them into fresh xylose-free media. The samples required elevated CO2 for growth, suggesting a carbon fixation growth mechanism. One of the isolated clones that showed more robust growth was chosen for in-depth characterization and exhibited a doubling time of 18 ± 4 h in autotrophic conditions, as shown in Figures 2C and S3. The cells had a formate-to-biomass conversion yield of 2.8 ± 0.8 gCDW/mol formate (Equation 1), similar to microorganisms that naturally grow autotrophically on formate (Pronk et al., 1991Pronk J.T. Meijer W.M. Hazeu W. van Dijken J.P. Bos P. Kuenen J.G. Growth of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans on Formic Acid.Appl. Environ.

Biotechnol. 2015; 8: 155-163Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To test whether the evolved cells are indeed autotrophic and eliminate the possibility of unaccounted-for carbon sources or significant heterotrophic formate assimilation, we conducted comprehensive isotopic labeling experiments. First, we grew one of the evolved clones in an environment with 13C-labeled formate and 13CO2 for ≈10 generations (until isotopic steady state) and analyzed the 13C labeling patterns of various metabolites using LC/MS (Equation 3; Zamboni and Sauer, 2009Zamboni N. Sauer U. Novel biological insights through metabolomics and 13C-flux analysis.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We observed that biomass building blocks across central metabolism had ≈98% of their carbon atoms labeled (Figures 3B and S4; Table S2). This is in line with the labeled formate and CO2 comprising ≈99% 13C and ≈1% unlabeled bicarbonate dissolved in the growth media. This provides definitive evidence that the cells’ biomass carbon is derived solely from CO2 and formate. To test whether formate is directly assimilated into biomass, the evolved cells were grown in minimal M9 media supplemented with 13C-labeled formate. The cultures were grown in a vessel with an air permeable cover inside a shaking incubator with elevated CO2 (10%, naturally labeled). The 13C labeling pattern of biomass building blocks following growth in this environment showed 1%–2% 13C labeling (Figures 3B and S4; Table S3), which is the value expected based on the natural abundance of 13C plus minor amounts of labeled formate being oxidized to 13CO2 and then fixed before equilibrating with the overall 12CO2 pool. These results demonstrate that the evolved cells essentially do not assimilate formate. One very minor exception is the incorporation of carbon from formate into one of the carbons of the purine rings. However, this is not a necessity of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway but rather a technical issue, because the formyl moiety can either originate from formate, if it is present in the media, or from 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, which originates from serine (STAR Methods). The finding of negligible formate assimilation, together with the previous results indicating that there is no carbon source beyond CO2 and formate entering the biomass, serves as strong evidence that the evolved E. coli cells are indeed autotrophic.Figure S4Amino Acid 13C Labeling Profile in Additional Labeling Experiments and the Effect of Unlabeled CO2 Emission from Formate Oxidation in Closed Vessels, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) The 13C fraction of various protein-bound amino acids and sugar-phosphates is close to 100% when the evolved cells were grown on 13CO2 and labeled 13C formate. The experiment was carried out in closed vessels (n = 3; ± SD).

(C) The weighted average of the effective isotopic composition of CO2 during a labeling experiment that starts with 99% 13CO2 (≈1 mmol) in the headspace and ≈0.3 mmol naturally labeled formate can be computed from the measured labeled fractions of glutamate and arginine, which we define as a 13CO2 “sensor.” The bottom box describes the calculation method and its implementation in the subsequent normalization of the raw labeling measurements of various metabolites (e.g., valine). (D) The experimental setup of isotopic biomass labeling with 13CO2 consists of a septum-sealed 250 mL growth flask and 10 mL of minimal M9 media with 30 mM naturally labeled sodium formate. In total, the vessel contains ≈0.3 mmol formate and ≈1 mmol of 13CO2 at the beginning of the experiment. The latter is flushed into the headspace via a thin needle, which is removed at the end of the flushing procedure. The initial inoculum of cells is also naturally labeled. As the cells grow and oxidize the formate to obtain energy, the isotopic composition of inorganic carbon within the vessel changes as depicted in the plot (blue line). The isotopic dynamics of the biomass carbon during autotrophic growth is depicted by the red line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) The 13C fraction of various protein-bound amino acids and sugar-phosphates is close to 100% when the evolved cells were grown on 13CO2 and labeled 13C formate.

https://openalex.org/W2990380375,"Features of higher-order chromatin organization-such as A/B compartments, topologically associating domains and chromatin loops-are temporarily disrupted during mitosis1,2. Because these structures are thought to influence gene regulation, it is important to understand how they are re-established after mitosis. Here we examine the dynamics of chromosome reorganization by Hi-C after mitosis in highly purified, synchronous mouse erythroid cell populations. We observed rapid establishment of A/B compartments, followed by their gradual intensification and expansion. Contact domains form from the 'bottom up'-smaller subTADs are formed initially, followed by convergence into multi-domain TAD structures. CTCF is partially retained on mitotic chromosomes and immediately resumes full binding in ana/telophase. By contrast, cohesin is completely evicted from mitotic chromosomes and regains focal binding at a slower rate. The formation of CTCF/cohesin co-anchored structural loops follows the kinetics of cohesin positioning. Stripe-shaped contact patterns-anchored by CTCF-grow in length, which is consistent with a loop-extrusion process after mitosis. Interactions between cis-regulatory elements can form rapidly, with rates exceeding those of CTCF/cohesin-anchored contacts. Notably, we identified a group of rapidly emerging transient contacts between cis-regulatory elements in ana/telophase that are dissolved upon G1 entry, co-incident with the establishment of inner boundaries or nearby interfering chromatin loops. We also describe the relationship between transcription reactivation and architectural features. Our findings indicate that distinct but mutually influential forces drive post-mitotic chromatin reconfiguration."
https://openalex.org/W2990803388,"The organization of genomic DNA into nucleosomes profoundly affects all DNA-related processes in eukaryotes. The histone chaperone known as 'facilitates chromatin transcription' (FACT1) (consisting of subunits SPT16 and SSRP1) promotes both disassembly and reassembly of nucleosomes during gene transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair2. However, the mechanism by which FACT causes these opposing outcomes is unknown. Here we report two cryo-electron-microscopic structures of human FACT in complex with partially assembled subnucleosomes, with supporting biochemical and hydrogen-deuterium exchange data. We find that FACT is engaged in extensive interactions with nucleosomal DNA and all histone variants. The large DNA-binding surface on FACT appears to be protected by the carboxy-terminal domains of both of its subunits, and this inhibition is released by interaction with H2A-H2B, allowing FACT-H2A-H2B to dock onto a complex containing DNA and histones H3 and H4 (ref. 3). SPT16 binds nucleosomal DNA and tethers H2A-H2B through its carboxy-terminal domain by acting as a placeholder for DNA. SSRP1 also contributes to DNA binding, and can assume two conformations, depending on whether a second H2A-H2B dimer is present. Our data suggest a compelling mechanism for how FACT maintains chromatin integrity during polymerase passage, by facilitating removal of the H2A-H2B dimer, stabilizing intermediate subnucleosomal states and promoting nucleosome reassembly. Our findings reconcile discrepancies regarding the many roles of FACT and underscore the dynamic interactions between histone chaperones and nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W3102218703,"All stellar mass black holes have hitherto been identified by X-rays emitted by gas that is accreting onto the black hole from a companion star. These systems are all binaries with black holes below 30 M$_{\odot}$$^{1-4}$. Theory predicts, however, that X-ray emitting systems form a minority of the total population of star-black hole binaries$^{5,6}$. When the black hole is not accreting gas, it can be found through radial velocity measurements of the motion of the companion star. Here we report radial velocity measurements of a Galactic star, LB-1, which is a B-type star, taken over two years. We find that the motion of the B-star and an accompanying H$\alpha$ emission line require the presence of a dark companion with a mass of $68^{+11}_{-13}$ M$_{\odot}$, which can only be a black hole. The long orbital period of 78.9 days shows that this is a wide binary system. The gravitational wave experiments have detected similarly massive black holes$^{7,8}$, but forming such massive ones in a high-metallicity environment would be extremely challenging to current stellar evolution theories$^{9-11}$."
https://openalex.org/W2989673368,"Mammals form scars to quickly seal wounds and ensure survival by an incompletely understood mechanism1-5. Here we show that skin scars originate from prefabricated matrix in the subcutaneous fascia. Fate mapping and live imaging revealed that fascia fibroblasts rise to the skin surface after wounding, dragging their surrounding extracellular jelly-like matrix, including embedded blood vessels, macrophages and peripheral nerves, to form the provisional matrix. Genetic ablation of fascia fibroblasts prevented matrix from homing into wounds and resulted in defective scars, whereas placing an impermeable film beneath the skin-preventing fascia fibroblasts from migrating upwards-led to chronic open wounds. Thus, fascia contains a specialized prefabricated kit of sentry fibroblasts, embedded within a movable sealant, that preassemble together diverse cell types and matrix components needed to heal wounds. Our findings suggest that chronic and excessive skin wounds may be attributed to the mobility of the fascia matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2990430418,"The emergence and spread of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum impedes global efforts to control and eliminate malaria. For decades, treatment of malaria has relied on chloroquine (CQ), a safe and affordable 4-aminoquinoline that was highly effective against intra-erythrocytic asexual blood-stage parasites, until resistance arose in Southeast Asia and South America and spread worldwide1. Clinical resistance to the chemically related current first-line combination drug piperaquine (PPQ) has now emerged regionally, reducing its efficacy2. Resistance to CQ and PPQ has been associated with distinct sets of point mutations in the P. falciparum CQ-resistance transporter PfCRT, a 49-kDa member of the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily that traverses the membrane of the acidic digestive vacuole of the parasite3-9. Here we present the structure, at 3.2 Å resolution, of the PfCRT isoform of CQ-resistant, PPQ-sensitive South American 7G8 parasites, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and antigen-binding fragment technology. Mutations that contribute to CQ and PPQ resistance localize primarily to moderately conserved sites on distinct helices that line a central negatively charged cavity, indicating that this cavity is the principal site of interaction with the positively charged CQ and PPQ. Binding and transport studies reveal that the 7G8 isoform binds both drugs with comparable affinities, and that these drugs are mutually competitive. The 7G8 isoform transports CQ in a membrane potential- and pH-dependent manner, consistent with an active efflux mechanism that drives CQ resistance5, but does not transport PPQ. Functional studies on the newly emerging PfCRT F145I and C350R mutations, associated with decreased PPQ susceptibility in Asia and South America, respectively6,9, reveal their ability to mediate PPQ transport in 7G8 variant proteins and to confer resistance in gene-edited parasites. Structural, functional and in silico analyses suggest that distinct mechanistic features mediate the resistance to CQ and PPQ in PfCRT variants. These data provide atomic-level insights into the molecular mechanism of this key mediator of antimalarial treatment failures."

https://openalex.org/W2990368503,"TLR8 is among the highest-expressed pattern-recognition receptors in the human myeloid compartment, yet its mode of action is poorly understood. TLR8 engages two distinct ligand binding sites to sense RNA degradation products, although it remains unclear how these ligands are formed in cellulo in the context of complex RNA molecule sensing. Here, we identified the lysosomal endoribonuclease RNase T2 as a non-redundant upstream component of TLR8-dependent RNA recognition. RNase T2 activity is required for rendering complex single-stranded, exogenous RNA molecules detectable for TLR8. This is due to RNase T2’s preferential cleavage of single-stranded RNA molecules between purine and uridine residues, which critically contributes to the supply of catabolic uridine and the generation of purine-2′,3′-cyclophosphate-terminated oligoribonucleotides. Thus-generated molecules constitute agonistic ligands for the first and second binding pocket of TLR8. Together, these results establish the identity and origin of the RNA-derived molecular pattern sensed by TLR8."
https://openalex.org/W2989794976,"Every night across the world’s oceans, numerous marine animals arrive at the surface of the ocean to feed on plankton after an upward migration of hundreds of metres. Just before sunrise, this migration is reversed and the animals return to their daytime residence in the dark mesopelagic zone (at a depth of 200–1,000 m). This daily excursion, referred to as diel vertical migration (DVM), is thought of primarily as an adaptation to avoid visual predators in the sunlit surface layer1,2 and was first recorded using ship-net hauls nearly 200 years ago3. Nowadays, DVMs are routinely recorded by ship-mounted acoustic systems (for example, acoustic Doppler current profilers). These data show that night-time arrival and departure times are highly conserved across ocean regions4 and that daytime descent depths increase with water clarity4,5, indicating that animals have faster swimming speeds in clearer waters4. However, after decades of acoustic measurements, vast ocean areas remain unsampled and places for which data are available typically provide information for only a few months, resulting in an incomplete understanding of DVMs. Addressing this issue is important, because DVMs have a crucial role in global ocean biogeochemistry. Night-time feeding at the surface and daytime metabolism of this food at depth provide an efficient pathway for carbon and nutrient export6–8. Here we use observations from a satellite-mounted light-detection-and-ranging (lidar) instrument to describe global distributions of an optical signal from DVM animals that arrive in the surface ocean at night. Our findings reveal that these animals generally constitute a greater fraction of total plankton abundance in the clear subtropical gyres, consistent with the idea that the avoidance of visual predators is an important life strategy in these regions. Total DVM biomass, on the other hand, is higher in more productive regions in which the availability of food is increased. Furthermore, the 10-year satellite record reveals significant temporal trends in DVM biomass and correlated variations in DVM biomass and surface productivity. These results provide a detailed view of DVM activities globally and a path for refining the quantification of their biogeochemical importance. Satellite-derived analysis of daily vertical migrations of ocean animals shows that the relative abundance and total biomass of these animals differ between different regions globally, depending on the availability of food and necessity to avoid predators."
https://openalex.org/W2990741917,"Limited knowledge of the mechanisms that govern the self-renewal of human haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and why this fails in culture, have impeded the expansion of HSCs for transplantation1. Here we identify MLLT3 (also known as AF9) as a crucial regulator of HSCs that is highly enriched in human fetal, neonatal and adult HSCs, but downregulated in culture. Depletion of MLLT3 prevented the maintenance of transplantable human haematopoietic stem or progenitor cells (HSPCs) in culture, whereas stabilizing MLLT3 expression in culture enabled more than 12-fold expansion of transplantable HSCs that provided balanced multilineage reconstitution in primary and secondary mouse recipients. Similar to endogenous MLLT3, overexpressed MLLT3 localized to active promoters in HSPCs, sustained levels of H3K79me2 and protected the HSC transcriptional program in culture. MLLT3 thus acts as HSC maintenance factor that links histone reader and modifying activities to modulate HSC gene expression, and may provide a promising approach to expand HSCs for transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2989576567,"Seismological data provide evidence of a depth-dependent rupture behaviour of earthquakes occurring at the megathrust fault of subduction zones, also known as megathrust earthquakes1. Relative to deeper events of similar magnitude, shallow earthquake ruptures have larger slip and longer duration, radiate energy that is depleted in high frequencies and have a larger discrepancy between their surface-wave and moment magnitudes1–3. These source properties make them prone to generating devastating tsunamis without clear warning signs. The depth-dependent rupture behaviour is usually attributed to variations in fault mechanics4–7. Conceptual models, however, have so far failed to identify the fundamental physical causes of the contrasting observations and do not provide a quantitative framework with which to predict and link them. Here we demonstrate that the observed differences do not require changes in fault mechanics. We use compressional-wave velocity models from worldwide subduction zones to show that their common underlying cause is a systematic depth variation of the rigidity at the lower part of the upper plate — the rock body overriding the megathrust fault, which deforms by dynamic stress transfer during co-seismic slip. Combining realistic elastic properties with accurate estimates of earthquake focal depth enables us to predict the amount of co-seismic slip (the fault motion at the instant of the earthquake), provides unambiguous estimations of magnitude and offers the potential for early tsunami warnings. Models compiled from subduction zones worldwide show that the elastic properties of the rock overlying shallow subduction megathrusts can be used to estimate potential slip, possibly enabling early tsunami warnings."
https://openalex.org/W2989981694,"Student engagement is an important factor for learning outcomes in higher education. Engagement with learning at campus-based higher education institutions is difficult to quantify due to the variety of forms that engagement might take (e.g. lecture attendance, self-study, usage of online/digital systems). Meanwhile, there are increasing concerns about student wellbeing within higher education, but the relationship between engagement and wellbeing is not well understood. Here we analyse results from a longitudinal survey of undergraduate students at a campus-based university in the UK, aiming to understand how engagement and wellbeing vary dynamically during an academic term. The survey included multiple dimensions of student engagement and wellbeing, with a deliberate focus on self-report measures to capture students' subjective experience. The results show a wide range of engagement with different systems and study activities, giving a broad view of student learning behaviour over time. Engagement and wellbeing vary during the term, with clear behavioural changes caused by assessments. Results indicate a positive interaction between engagement and happiness, with an unexpected negative relationship between engagement and academic outcomes. This study provides important insights into subjective aspects of the student experience and provides a contrast to the increasing focus on analysing educational processes using digital records."
https://openalex.org/W2990548291,"Calcium homeostasis modulators (CALHMs) are voltage-gated, Ca2+-inhibited nonselective ion channels that act as major ATP release channels, and have important roles in gustatory signalling and neuronal toxicity1-3. Dysfunction of CALHMs has previously been linked to neurological disorders1. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human CALHM2 channel in the Ca2+-free active or open state and in the ruthenium red (RUR)-bound inhibited state, at resolutions up to 2.7 Å. Our work shows that purified CALHM2 channels form both gap junctions and undecameric hemichannels. The protomer shows a mirrored arrangement of the transmembrane domains (helices S1-S4) relative to other channels with a similar topology, such as connexins, innexins and volume-regulated anion channels4-8. Upon binding to RUR, we observed a contracted pore with notable conformational changes of the pore-lining helix S1, which swings nearly 60° towards the pore axis from a vertical to a lifted position. We propose a two-section gating mechanism in which the S1 helix coarsely adjusts, and the N-terminal helix fine-tunes, the pore size. We identified a RUR-binding site near helix S1 that may stabilize this helix in the lifted conformation, giving rise to channel inhibition. Our work elaborates on the principles of CALHM2 channel architecture and symmetry, and the mechanism that underlies channel inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2990248610,"Although human genetic studies have implicated many susceptible genes associated with plasma lipid levels, their physiological and molecular functions are not fully characterized. Here we demonstrate that orphan G protein-coupled receptor 146 (GPR146) promotes activity of hepatic sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) through activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, thereby regulating hepatic very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, and subsequently circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) levels. Remarkably, GPR146 deficiency reduces plasma cholesterol levels substantially in both wild-type and LDL receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice. Finally, aortic atherosclerotic lesions are reduced by 90% and 70%, respectively, in male and female LDLR-deficient mice upon GPR146 depletion. Taken together, these findings outline a regulatory role for the GPR146/ERK axis in systemic cholesterol metabolism and suggest that GPR146 inhibition could be an effective strategy to reduce plasma cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis."

We performed a study addressing gender-based differences in platelet function using point-of-care platelet function tests (PFT).The patient population consisted of 760 cardiac surgery patients where preoperative PFT (multiple-electrode aggregometry [MEA]) were available. Platelet count and function at the ADPtest and TRAPtest were compared in the overall population and separately in patients with or without residual effects of P2Y12 inhibitors.Women had a significantly (P = 0.001) higher platelet count but a non-significantly higher platelet reactivity to ADP. In clopidogrel-treated patients, the platelets ADP reactivity was significantly (P = 0.031) higher in women, and platelet count was the main determinant of platelet hyper-reactivity. Within patients under full clopidogrel effects, women with a platelet count ≥ 200,000 cells/μL had a significantly (P = 0.023) higher rate of high-on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR, 45.5%) with respect to males with a platelet count < 200,000 cells/μL (11.9%), with a relative risk of 6.2 (95% confidence interval 1.4-29).Our findings confirm that women have a larger platelet count than men, and that this is associated to a trend towards a higher platelet reactivity. HTPR is largely represented in women with a high platelet count. This generates the hypothesis that women requiring P2Y12 inhibitors could potentially benefit from larger doses of drug or should be treated with anti-platelet agents with a low rate of HTPR."

At the molecular level, a Wnt 3a gradient determines the position of the rachis (Yue et al., 2006Yue Z. Jiang T.X. Widelitz R.B. Chuong C.M. Wnt3a gradient converts radial to bilateral feather symmetry via topological arrangement of epithelia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A curved rachis in frizzled chickens forms due to a mutated keratin 75 (K75) with a defective medulla that alters rachidial rigidity (Ng et al., 2012Ng C.S. Wu P. Foley J. Foley A. McDonald M.L. Juan W.T. Huang C.J. Lai Y.T. Lo W.S.

Despite this progress, much remains to be learned about how the rachis becomes structured. The feather vane serves an essential role, yet the molecular basis for transforming the 3-dimensional (3D) barb branches into a 2-dimensional (2D) planar vane is unknown. The barb ridge is the basic structure needed to form feather branches (Chuong et al., 2014Chuong C.M. Bhat R. Widelitz R.B. Bissell M.J. SnapShot: Branching Morphogenesis.Cell. 2014; 158 (1212–1212)Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, Lucas and Stettenheim, 1972Lucas P. Stettenheim A. Avian anatomy. Integument.

B Mol. Dev. Evol. 2003; 298: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each barb branch is composed of a ramus and two rows of barbules (proximal and distal). As the axial plates disappear from the middle of the barb ridge, the proximal and distal rows of barbules separate and open. In plumulaceous barbs, the distal and proximal barbules have the same shape. In pennaceous barbs, the distal barbules bear a hooklet, a newly evolved subcellular structure, which interlocks onto the proximal barbules of the immediately adjacent barb. This linking occurs via a Velcro-like mechanism to form the closed, coherent surface of the pennaceous feather vane. Basic barb ridge organization allows the flexibility to generate diverse barb branching forms, as seen in different feather types in current birds (Li et al., 2017Li A. Figueroa S. Jiang T.X. Wu P.

Growth Differ. 2019; 61: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To study how feather architecture can be adaptive in diverse ecospaces, we analyze the rachis and barb branches of feathers. We used a newly developed quantitative morphology field analysis (QMorF) to evaluate the properties of the rachis. Examining different feathers from chickens and flight feathers from birds reveal the importance of medulla cell shape and normalized cortex thickness in endowing feather properties. Molecular studies suggest that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling is involved in assembling the rachis architecture. We examined cellular and molecular differences leading to the formation of pennaceous and plumulaceous branching. Tissue interactions, transcriptome analyses, and gene perturbation studies show that the DP stores positional information to control feather branch morphology. We further study feathers embedded in amber ~99 million years ago and found that an ancient feather vane can form by simple overlapping of barbules whereas modern birds use a Velcro-like mechanism. Our results show that in modern birds, the rachis and barbules evolved distinct architectures for optimal functional performance in their unique eco-spaces. We titled this article the making of a flight feather, in parallel to Lawrence’s classical book on animal design (Lawrence, 1992Lawrence P.A. The Making of a Fly: The Genetics of Animal Design. Wiley-Blackwell, 1992Google Scholar). We aspire to learn similarly fundamental principles that govern feather bio-architectures, enabling birds to adapt to a wide range of eco-spaces. Understanding these principles may also inspire engineers to fabricate light and strong materials for other uses. To analyze the structure of the rachidial cortex and medulla, we first examined whole mount and serial cross-sections (Figures S1C and S1D) at 1-cm intervals from a 4-week regenerating chicken flight feather that grew to approximately 50% of full length. These specimens demonstrated the gradual maturation of the rachis from young (level I) to older (level IV) developmental stages along the proximal-distal axis. At level I, we see the dorsal cortex start to differentiate but the medulla and ventral cortex have not yet formed. Ridges from the dorsal cortex can be observed at level II. The medulla cells also begin to differentiate at this stage. At level III, both the dorsal cortex and medulla are well differentiated but the ventral cortex remains immature. At level IV, all of the rachis components are mature. To compare the characteristics of the downy, contour, and flight feather rachis collected when the feathers had reached their full adult size (Figure 1D). Specimens were analyzed at positions along the z axis of the rachis from the beginning of branching at the proximal end (0.0Z) to the distal end (1.0Z) using two methods to assess the internal rachis structure. The first method is synchrotron micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. However, this method caused significant tissue shrinkage (Figures S2A and S2B). As an alternate method, we cut physical cross-sections at different intervals along the proximal-distal axis and then analyzed the properties of the reconstructed rachis. Cortex strength, in general, is a function of its geometry and the material from which it is configured. The medulla of the rachis is made of keratinocytes that vacuolized to form one pore per cell. Properties of the medulla are characterized by the size, elongation, and orientation of these pores, collectively. We developed QMorF to provide high-resolution measurements to analyze the spatial distribution of cell shapes and to assess changes in medulla cell structure along the proximal-distal axis (Figure S2C). This method converts multiple cross-sectional images to a digital reconstruction of the medulla with three parameters: pore size (PS) (Figures 1D and S2D), pore elongation (PEL) (Figure S2E), and pore orientation (PO) (Figure S2F). We analyzed three major types of chicken feathers: flight, down, and contour feathers using QMorF and found that the PS are small and relatively uniform in downy and contour feathers, but show a large range of variation in flight feathers (Figures 1D and S2D). In flight feathers, PS is small along the midline and at the periphery but is large in the center of each half of the rachis (darker colors indicate larger pore size). This finding suggests these cells are subjected to spatially varied compression/stretching during rachis morphogenesis. The PEL and PO reveal the spatially varied degree of cellular elongation and the direction of the anisotropic stress on the cell, respectively. The PEL was uniformly high in downy feathers, showing a center core in contour feathers, and was highest along cell bands and at the periphery of flight feathers. Cell bands indicate a collective of cells/pores sharing similar geometry that differ from adjacent ones. PEL was close to 1 in the center of the flight feathers (Figure S2E). The range of flight feather PO was much greater than for downy or contour feathers that may reflect the asymmetric feather configuration (Figure S2F). Cell bands are aligned from the dorsal cortex ridge toward the ventral cortex. Beneath the dorsal cortex, medulla cells are orientated perpendicular to the cortical ridge, but cell bands become aligned toward the midline in the ventral medulla. This heterogeneous, yet patterned, organization suggests uneven biomechanical landscapes in the rachis. We further explore the structure-function relationship of rachis architecture in the chicken flight feather cortex. We defined dorsal, ventral, and lateral regions based on their geometric and material characteristics (Figure S3A). We then determined the mean normalized cortex thickness (NCT), to resolve the distribution of dense keratin in these regions. The multiple ridges on the dorsal cortex and the 2 ventral cortex projections on either side of the groove are highlighted as peaks in the angular cortex thickness plot (Figure S3B). Regions showing larger mean NCT suggest a thicker cortex, which would provide greater material strength geometrically. To test the strength of the cortex, a section of rachis (0.3Z–0.4Z) was cut, and the cortex from each of the 4 regions was isolated and subject to a tensile test. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS, the point at which the feather cortex broke) and elastic modulus (E) were calculated (Figures S3C and S3D). Regional cortexes with a larger UTS and E imply their material properties are stronger and stiffer and vice versa. We wondered whether birds using different modes of flight might have evolved different optimized rachis structures. While flight involves collective feather configurations, wing shapes, and body weight, here, we focus on the biophysical property of the single primary flight feather. We examined the rachis of ostriches (flightless), chickens (short distance flight), ducks and eagles (soaring flight), and sparrows (high wing flapping frequency and bounding flight). We used QMorF analyses to evaluate medulla cell characteristics in proximal (0.2Z–0.3Z) regions of flight feathers (Figures 2A, S2G, and S2H). For ostriches, the morphological field of the medulla is highly segmented compared to the other species. Heterogeneous vacuolated keratinocytes in the medulla comprise cell bands with a variety of cellular sizes, elongation, and orientation angles. These cell bands show a hyperbolic fanning-out pattern into both the dorsal and ventral medulla, while the ventral cell bands in chickens are merged. As demonstrated by the ostrich and chicken, the widely spread cell bands, composed mainly of small, elongated, and locally aligned vacuoles, contribute a small average PS, large average PEL, and widely distributed PO. These results suggest that the collectively arranged and aligned cell bands with periodic cortical ridges increases the rachis ability to support mechanical loads. The bilaterally symmetric QMorF patterns in ducks and eagles are composed of a larger PS, with less significant elongation and angular expansion of vacuoles, suggesting a collective cellular deformation toward the mid-dorsal region. They also both show small cell bands extending from the center toward the ventral groove along the midline. In ducks, the dorsal medulla contains large-sized pores. In contrast, eagles have a hollow cell depletion zone in this same region. These results suggest that enlarged PS improves the stiffness to weight ratio of the rachis by increasing the second area moment of the cortex with limited weight cost and therefore enhances sustained feather flight performance. We also note that the hollow depletion zone in eagles likely increases the tendency of the rachis to twist under load, without greatly compromising bending strength. Although diverse PEL and PO patterns in the medulla provide little benefit to rachis strength, their distribution suggests anisotropic stress applied during rachis morphogenesis contributes to the polarized cortex geometry. The Java sparrow displays a relatively homogeneous medulla. Sparrow PS is like that of the chicken, although their body masses are very different, leading to a much higher pore size/body mass ratio. We expanded our cross-species QMorF analysis to reveal a trend of functional form at a larger scale. The results show that normalized mean pore size divided by body weight of flight feather shafts, including the rectrix (tail feather) shaft of flying birds (Figure 2B), is, in general, larger than those of other feather types. The mean PS normalized with body weight is a parameter that can represent the function of a feather. We further analyzed the regional geometric distribution of relative cortex thickness, material strength, and rigidity of flight feathers from the 5 previously described species (Figures 2C and S3E–S3G). These data indicate that cortex polarity seen in flight feathers from the uniform ostrich rachis to the dorsal-ventral polarized eagle rachis. Sustained flyers show a trend of increased thickening in the dorsal cortex and thinning in the lateral cortex (Figure 2C and S3G). The material test also reveals that a polarized flight shaft with a strengthened dorso-ventral cortex and weakened lateral cortex may be a common attribute of flyers that sustain flight for long periods or engage in high flapping frequencies (Figures S3E and S3F). In the ostrich, the cortex was relatively isotropic with a slightly stronger and thicker dorsal wall. These data suggest that sustained flight performance was improved by increasing dorsal-ventral cortex thickness and strength while decreasing these attributes in the lateral cortex. This was accompanied by increasing medulla pore size and decreasing medulla complexity (Figure 2D). To analyze the molecular basis for rachis formation, we performed in situ hybridization at different stages of rachis development. H&E staining shows the temporal chicken rachis morphogenesis from early (Figure 3A, top row) to late (Figure 3A, bottom row) stages of maturity. The rachis is composed of a combination of α- and β-keratins (Figure 3A). We examined the distribution of K75, Chr25-FK12, and K13A by in situ hybridization from early to late stages of maturity. K75 is expressed by medulla cells (red arrows), Chr25-FK12 is expressed by cortex cells (green arrows), and K13A is expressed by both medulla and cortex cells (blue arrows). To study how the diverse composite rachides are made, we examined regenerating flight and contour feathers from adult chickens and ducks (Figures 3B–3C′). Immunostaining of K17 (cortex, purple), β-catenin (β-cat, red), and desmoglein 1 (DSG1, green) (cortex and medulla) was examined. In both chickens and ducks, feather epidermal progenitors begin by forming rachidial ridges (Figures 3B and 3C). Thus, the rachis is shaped by the following processes. First, the ventral surface of the dorsal cortex folds to produce different numbers and sizes of cortical ridges. Second, the medulla grows to a certain size. Third, the cortex extends laterally and ventrally to enclose the medulla. Fourth, cells in the medulla become vacuolated and some are organized into cell bands (Figures 3B and S1C). Diverse rachides use these basic processes to different degrees, making a spectrum of composite materials with different phenotypes and physical properties (Figures 1D and S1C). Feather formation is orchestrated by molecular signaling within the follicle niche (Chen et al., 2015Chen C.F. Foley J. Tang P.C. Li A. Jiang T.X. Wu P. Widelitz R.B. Chuong C.M.

To understand how molecular pathways are used in these morphogenetic processes, we use RCAS retrovirus to mis-express molecules known to be expressed in the developing rachis. Among the ectopically expressed molecules, the most dramatic phenotypes were generated by (1) bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) that leads to thickening of the dorsal cortex and reduction of the medulla and (2) Ski, a repressor of TGF-β signaling (Tecalco-Cruz et al., 2018Tecalco-Cruz A.C.

In this study, we collected DNA samples from the gut contents and body surface of leptocephali belonging to the five Anguilliform families (Anguillidae, Chlopsidae, Congridae, Muraenidae, and Serrivomeridae) from the northwest Pacific and performed next-generation 18S rDNA sequencing. Wide variety of eukaryotes was detected in both samples, from which eight eukaryotic groups (jellyfish, conoid parasite, tunicate, copepod, krill, segmented worm, fungi, and dinoflagellate) were selected on the basis of abundance. All groups except conoid parasites were common in both the samples. Cnidarian 18S rDNA reads were the most abundant in both the samples; however, the number of samples having cnidarian reads and the read counts were significantly higher in the body surface scraping samples than in the gut content samples, regardless of careful rinsing of the body surface. These results indicate that the cnidarian DNAs are most likely found because of cross contamination from the body surface and/or environment. 18S rDNA read counts of copepod and tunicate in the gut contents were greater than or comparable with those in the body surface scraping samples, which may correspond to the previous observations of fecal pellets and larvacean houses in the leptocephali gut. Thus, the present study supports previous implications that leptocephali utilize detritus materials, so called marine snow."

PVL was seen in 14% of the isolates (MRSA: 25%, MSSA: 75%); 56% were classified as healthcare-associated infection. The SCCmec typing method did not definitively classify all unknown isolates into clearly defined types. It showed that majority of these isolates were not the conventional types; untypeable elements appeared to be composite SCCmec elements, consisting of multiple ccr gene complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2990046508,"Even though HIV-1 replication can be suppressed by combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) inflammatory processes still occur, contributing to comorbidities. Comorbidities are attributed to variety of factors, including HIV-1 mediated inflammation. Several HIV-1 proteins mediate central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, including Nef. Nef is an early HIV-1 protein, toxic to neurons and glia and is sufficient to cause learning impairment similar to some deficits observed in HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders. To determine whether hippocampal Nef expression by astrocytes contributes to comorbidities, specifically peripheral inflammation, we infused Sprague Dawley rats with GFP- (control) or Nef-transfected astrocytes into the right hippocampus. Brain, lung, and ileum were collected postmortem for the measurement of inflammatory markers. Increased blood-brain-barrier permeability and serum IL-1β levels were detected in the Nef-treated rats. The lungs of Nef-treated rats demonstrated leukocyte infiltration, macrophage upregulation, and enhanced vascular permeability. Ileal tissue showed reactive follicular lymphoid hyperplasia, increased permeability and macrophage infiltration. The intracerebroventricular application of IL-1 receptor antagonist reduced infiltration of immune cells into ileum and lung, indicating the important role of IL-1β in mediating the spread of inflammation from the brain to other tissues. This suggests that localized expression of a single viral protein, HIV-1 Nef, can contribute to a broader inflammatory response by upregulation of IL-1β. Further, these results suggest that Nef contributes to the chronic inflammation seen in HIV patients, even in those whose viremia is controlled by cART."

It protects the brain by preventing toxic substances from entering the brain but also limits the entry of therapeutic agents. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters are critical for the functional barrier and present a formidable impediment to brain delivery of therapeutic agents including antibiotics. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible involvement of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 and 4 (MRP1 and MRP4), two ABC transporters, in benzylpenicillin efflux transport using wild-type (WT) MDCKII cells and cells overexpressing those human transporters, as well as non-selective and selective inhibitors. We found that inhibiting MRP1 or MRP4 significantly increased [3H]benzylpenicillin uptake in MDCKII-WT, -MRP1 or –MRP4 cells. Similar results were also found in HepG2 cells, which highly express MRP1 and MRP4, and hCMEC/D3 cells which express MRP1. The results indicate that human and canine MRP1 and MRP4 are involved in benzylpenicillin efflux transport. They could be potential therapeutic targets for improving the efficacy of benzylpenicillin for treating CNS infections since both MRP1 and MRP4 express at human blood-brain barrier."

Oil palm can experience cold damage when exposed to low temperatures for a long period. During these unfavorable conditions, a series of gene induction/repression and physico-chemical changes occur in oil palm. To better understand the link between these events, we investigated the expression levels of various genes (including COR410, COR413, CBF1, CBF2, CBF3, ICE1-1, ICE1-2, ICE1-4, SIZ1-1, SIZ1-2, ZAT10, ZAT12) and the accumulation of osmolytes (proline, malondialdehyde and sucrose). Likewise, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in oil palm under cold stress (4°C, 8°C and 12°C) was examined. The results showed a clear link among the expression of CBFs (especially CBF1 and CBF3) and the all genes examined under cold stress (12°C). The expression of CBF1 and CBF2 also exhibited a positive link with the accumulation of sucrose and proline under cold stress in oil palm. At 4°C, the proline content exhibited a very significant correlation with electrolyte leakage in oil palm. The results of this study provide necessary information regarding the mechanism of the response and adaption of oil palm to cold stress. Additionally, they offer clues for the selection or development of cold-tolerant cultivars from the available germplasms of oil palm."

https://openalex.org/W2990314759,"Background Critical care nurses need a high level of medical competence, especially with regard to patient safety. There are several tools to measure general and critical care nursing competence, but the usability of these tools is inadequate because they include large numbers of questions. To maintain quality and safety in intensive care units (ICUs), it is necessary to be able to easily measure and evaluate critical care nursing competence. The purpose of this study was to develop an easy-to-use questionnaire assessing critical care nursing competence related to patient safety. Methods A cross-sectional, descriptive, explorative study was designed to collect data from nurses working in six ICUs in tertiary hospitals in Japan. Data were collected from August 2017 to December 2018. The Critical Care Nursing Competence Questionnaire for Patient Safety (C3Q-safety) is a 22-item instrument designed to assess nursing competence related to patient safety in ICUs. Items were developed based on previous work related to critical care nursing competence and were adjusted based on a pilot study. Results A total of 211 nurses working in ICUs participated in this study. Through descriptive statistics and factor analysis, the number of questions was reduced from 24 to 22. The C3Q-safety had four factors: decision making, collaboration, nursing intervention, and principles of nursing care. Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.73 to 0.83. The four factors showed positive correlations with each other (0.47 to 0.72). Nurses licensed as certified nurses in intensive care and those with longer ICU work experience showed significantly higher scores on all four factors. Conclusions We developed an easy-to-use questionnaire to assess critical care nursing competence related to patient safety. The C3Q-safety was able to detect four areas of competence.

To further dissect the relationship between methionine catabolism and epigenetic regulation by SIN3, we sought to identify genes and metabolic pathways controlled by SIN3 and SAM synthetase (SAM-S) in Drosophila melanogaster. Using several approaches, including RNAi-mediated gene silencing, RNA-Seq– and quantitative RT-PCR–based transcriptomics, and ultra-high-performance LC-MS/MS– and GC/MS–based metabolomics, we found that, as a global transcriptional regulator, SIN3 impacted a wide range of genes and pathways. In contrast, SAM-S affected only a narrow range of genes and pathways. The expression and levels of additional genes and metabolites, however, were altered in Sin3A+Sam-S dual knockdown cells. This analysis revealed that SIN3 and SAM-S regulate overlapping pathways, many of which involve one-carbon and central carbon metabolisms. In some cases, the factors acted independently; in some others, redundantly; and for a third set, in opposition. Together, these results, obtained from experiments with the chromatin regulator SIN3 and the metabolic enzyme SAM-S, uncover a complex relationship between metabolism and epigenetic regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2990664733,"Change Acceleration Process model (CAP) emerged in early 90's as a set of principles for accelerating change management efforts in organizations. Business Process Improvement (BPI) projects open avenues of opportunity and success for organizations in this highly competitive era. However, most of these projects fail due to lack of commitment, communication, scope creep and inadequate resources. This research attempts to study industry relevant factors most critical to success of a BPI Project in the highly competitive telecom sector. Modified Delphi technique employing a panel of telecom professionals was adopted in order to determine the critical success factors (CSFs) after a thorough review of the literature. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to map extracted factors to the five agents of change. Research outcome defines the relevant CSFs in terms of vision, skills, incentives, resources and action plan. A significant contribution of this research is an extended CAP model for implementation of BPI projects. Practical implications of this research are utilization of the proposed model for BPI project success."
https://openalex.org/W2990433970,"Topical estrogen application to wounds is effective in promoting cutaneous wound healing. However, whether it promotes cutaneous wound healing in delayed cutaneous wound healing associated with advanced age remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of topical estrogen application to wounds in cutaneous wound healing in 80-week-old female mice. C57BL/6J female mice aged 82–85 and 12 weeks old were submitted to two full-thickness wounds. Mice were divided into four groups: aged group, topical estrogen wound treatment aged group (aged-E), vehicle wound treatment aged group (aged-vehicle), and young group. Wound healing was observed until day 14. In the aged group, wound area ratio (wound area / initial wound area) was significantly higher on days 3–14, ratio of re-epithelialization was significantly lower on day 3 and tended to be lower on day 14, and neutrophil number was significantly higher on day 7 compared with the young group. In contrast, in the aged-E group, wound area ratio was significantly smaller on days 1–14, re-epithelialization ratio was significantly higher on days 3–14, and neutrophil and macrophage number was significantly lower on days 3 and 7 compared with the aged group. These results demonstrate that topical estrogen application to wounds in 80-week-old female mice promoted cutaneous wound healing by reducing wound area and inflammatory response and promoting re-epithelialization."

https://openalex.org/W2991592373,"Background Whether mindfulness and emotional intelligence may counteract psychological symptoms and whether brooding and worry may be linked to decreased psychological well-being (PWB) in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is still an issue. Methods The study used a cross-sectional design on a sample of 66 consecutive individuals with a diagnosis of GAD. Two hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to determine whether PWB and anxiety symptoms were accounted for by mindfulness and emotional intelligence skills, brooding, and worry. Results Worry was negatively related to PWB and showed a tendency to be positively associated with anxiety symptoms after controlling for the other variables. Brooding was uniquely and positively related to anxiety symptoms. Different mindfulness (i.e., describing and nonjudging) and emotional intelligence (i.e., attention and repair) skills were particularly important for PWB. Repair was also negatively related to anxiety symptoms. Conclusions Repair was the variable that played a key role in the association with both PWB and GAD symptoms. Worry was the second most important variable, although it approached significance in the relationship with anxiety symptoms. Brooding was more strongly positively associated with anxiety than worry. In sum, the results suggest that an integrated and balanced focus on both positive and negative functioning will be useful in future clinical psychology research to predict, understand, and treat anxiety as well as to examine the antecedents and characteristics of positivity in individuals with GAD and promote their PWB."

https://openalex.org/W2991633640,"As research teams are increasingly comprised of members from multiple disciplines, ranging from the physical sciences, life sciences, social and behavioral sciences to the arts and humanities, it is important to revisit how research is conducted at several levels. Coupled with the national concern over rigor and reproducibility in research, it is therefore crucial to ensure that all members of such multidisciplinary teams view the need for ethics in the conduct of research in similar ways. Towards this end, Wayne State University developed a course in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) which was mandatory for all its 1500 doctoral students across all disciplines in its 75 PhD programs. We found that student perceptions of the validity, applicability and usefulness of the course varied by discipline. This was in spite of iterative changes made to the course by faculty in those disciplines to make the content palatable to all. The findings show that more work needs to be done to fully incorporate the needs of social sciences and humanities disciplines in a comprehensive university course. This is especially important as these students become members of large multidisciplinary research teams in order to uphold the highest levels of rigor, reproducibility and ethics."

https://openalex.org/W2989776593,"DNA clamp, a highly conserved ring-shaped protein, binds dsDNA within its central pore. Also, DNA clamp interacts with various nuclear proteins on its front, thereby stimulating their enzymatic activities and biological functions. It has been assumed that the DNA clamp is a functionally single-faced ring from bacteria to humans. Here, we report the crystal structure of the heterotrimeric RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9-1-1) checkpoint clamp bound to a peptide of RHINO, a recently identified cancer-related protein that interacts with 9-1-1 and promotes activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. This is the first structure of 9-1-1 bound to its partner. The structure reveals that RHINO is unexpectedly bound to the edge and around the back of the 9-1-1 ring through specific interactions with the RAD1 subunit of 9-1-1. Our finding indicates that 9-1-1 is a functionally double-faced DNA clamp."
https://openalex.org/W2991190345,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant bacterium responsible for serious nosocomial and community-acquired infections worldwide. Since few antibiotics are effective for treating MRSA infections, the development of new therapies is of great importance. Previous studies demonstrated that PBP2a is a target that generates protective antibodies against MRSA. A murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) that recognizes PBP2a from MRSA strains was previously isolated and characterized. In this report, we evaluated the biodistribution of this MAb in blood and tissues, as well as the extent of protection conferred using prophylactic and therapeutic assays compared to vancomycin treatment. Biodistribution was evaluated 12–96 h after MAb administration. It predominantly remained in the serum, but it was also detectable in the kidneys, lungs, and spleen at low concentrations (about 4.5% in the kidneys, 1.9% in the lungs, and 0.7% the spleen) at all observed timepoints. Prophylactic studies in a murine model demonstrated a significant bacterial load reduction in the kidneys of the groups treated with either with IgG (greater than 3 logs) or F(ab’)2 (98%) when compared to that of the control groups (untreated). Mice were challenged with a lethal dose, and the survival rate was higher in the treated mice. Treatment with the MAb resulted in a bacterial load reduction in the kidneys similar to that of mice treated with vancomycin, and a MAb/vancomycin combination therapy was also effective. These results demonstrate that an anti-PBP2a MAb may be a promising therapeutic for treating MRSA infections."
https://openalex.org/W2991649411,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the main culprit in cervical cancers. Although the HPV vaccine is now available, the slow and gradual process for HPV cancers to form means little will change, even for vaccinated individuals. This warrants the development of new therapeutic strategies in both the newly diagnosed and recurrent patients. We have previously shown that Alisertib (MLN8237), an Aurora A kinase inhibitor, potently and selectively kills HPV-positive cervical cancer cells. However, Alisertib is known for its unfavorable side effects when administered systemically. A targeted delivery approach is therefore warranted. The topical delivery of drugs to the cervix for the treatment of cervical cancer is an underexplored area of research that has the potential to significantly improve therapeutic outcome. Here, we design a novel topical drug delivery system for localized delivery in the vaginal tract using intravaginal silicone rings loaded with Alisertib. We assessed the suitability of the drug for the application and delivery method and develop a high-performance liquid chromatography method, then show that the vaginal rings were effective at releasing Alisertib over an extended period of time. Furthermore, we showed that Alisertib-loaded vaginal rings did not induce overt inflammation in the mouse vaginal tract. Our work has major translational implications for the future development of vaginal ring devices for the topical treatment of cervical cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2990290667,"It is widely acknowledged that phonemic segments are primary phonological units, processed serially, in spoken word production of Germanic languages. However, evidence for a behavioural effect of single-segment overlap on Chinese spoken word production is lacking. The current study adopted the form-preparation paradigm to investigate the effects of segment predictability and segment repetition separately, which were mixed in previous studies. Native Mandarin Chinese speakers named pictures in the following conditions: predictable, unpredictable, and no segment repetition. Different positions in words (i.e., the onset and the rhyme) were examined at the same time. Results revealed a facilitation effect of onset predictability masked by an inhibition tendency of onset repetition, indicating Chinese speakers’ ability to prepare the predictable onset. In contrast, rhyme predictability showed a non-significant effect. This pattern of results did not change no matter whether the conditions of unpredictable onset repetition and unpredictable rhyme repetition were mixed in the same context (Experiment 1) or extracted from different blocked contexts (Experiment 2). The finding provides essential support to the claim that phonemic segments are functionally engaged in Chinese spoken word production, and thus adds original evidence to the universal aspect of spoken word production."
https://openalex.org/W2990300409,"Starvation-resistant renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines are considered dormant-state cells that survive even under glucose starvation. The cellular biological and global transcriptional analysis using these cells identified potential markers of chemotherapy-resistant RCC and therapeutic agent candidates. Recently, we showed that ARL4C was a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis in patients with chemotherapy-resistant RCC by the global transcriptional analysis of patient primary tissues. The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of chemotherapy-resistant RCC by the global transcriptional analysis of primary tissues of patients with RCC and RCC cell lines. The connective global transcriptional analysis showed that two starvation-resistant RCC cell lines, SW839 and KMRC-1, were strongly correlated to tissues of patients with chemotherapy-resistant RCC and showed high expressions of invasive- and proliferation-related genes. We found fibronectin (FN1) expression was a predictive biomarker in some patients with chemotherapy-resistant RCC, which especially correlated with two starvation-resistant RCC cell lines. These results indicate these cell lines emulate chemotherapy-resistant RCC and might be useful in the search for markers to predict poor prognosis and in the development of therapeutic agents and their index markers for chemotherapy-resistant RCCs."
