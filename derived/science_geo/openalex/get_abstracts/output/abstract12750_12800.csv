https://openalex.org/W1967304777,"It is proposed that most neoplasms arise from a single cell of origin, and tumor progression results from acquired genetic variability within the original clone allowing sequential selection of more aggressive sublines. Tumor cell populations are apparently more genetically unstable than normal cells, perhaps from activation of specific gene loci in the neoplasm, continued presence of carcinogen, or even nutritional deficiencies within the tumor. The acquired genetic insta0ility and associated selection process, most readily recognized cytogenetically, results in advanced human malignancies being highly individual karyotypically and biologically. Hence, each patient's cancer may require individual specific therapy, and even this may be thwarted by emergence of a genetically variant subline resistant to the treatment. More research should be directed toward understanding and controlling the evolutionary process in tumors before it reaches the late stage usually seen in clinical cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2002666776,"The waveform of the cortical event-related potential is extremely sensitive to variations in the sequence of stimuli preceding the eliciting event. The waveform changes were manifested primarily in the amplitudes of the negative component of the potential that peaked at 200 milliseconds, the positive component that peaked at 300 milliseconds, and the slow-wave components. A quantitative model was developed relating the waveform changes to changes in event expectancy. Expectancy is assumed to depend on a decaying memory for events within the prior sequence, the specific structure of the sequence, and the global probability of event occurrence. For stimuli relevant to the task, the less expected the stimulus the larger the amplitudes of late components of the event-related potentials."

Comparison of dendritic field diameters and receptive fiedl center sizes of large ganglion cells suggests that neural circuitry in sublamina a conveys ""OFF""-center properties and connections in sublamina b ""ON""-center properties to retinal ganglion cells."

Prevention of the contraction by indomethacin suggested mediation by a prostaglandin. The contraction produced by aggregating platelets was unlike those produced by prostaglandins E2, F2alpha, G2, or H2, but resembled that evoked by thromboxane A2, which is formed by platelets during aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1981977956,"Monocularly deprived kittens were compared with littermates that had had their eyelids sutured for the same time but that had, in addition, been treated with 6-hydroxydopamine to deplete their forebrains of catecholamines. The visual cortices of all the catecholamine-depleted kittens showed high proportions of binocular neurons, in contrast to the control group, most of whose visual cortical neurons were driven exclusively by the nondeprived eye. Catecholamines may play an important role in the maintenance of cortical plasticity during the critical period."

https://openalex.org/W2046322467,Superior collicular fragments transplanted from fetal to newborn rat brains develop complex internal organization and receive visual afferents from the host providing they lie sufficiently close to the host visual pathways. This system allows investigation in vivo of special affinities between cells of the mammalian central nervous system.
https://openalex.org/W2075418079,"Flow-field-fractionation is a new separation technique that seems likely to have broad applicability. Its theoretical scope includes any solute for which one can find a solvent and a semipermeable membrane. The principles on which the technique is based are presented. Some experiments with polystyrene beads, viruses, and proteins verify that retention depends solely on diffusion coefficients."
https://openalex.org/W2004060405,The ultrastructure of bone cells was examined in biopsies from 18 patients with Paget's disease of bone and from 60 patients with a variety of other bone diseases. A characteristic nuclear inclusion was found in the osteoclasts of each patient with Paget's disease. The nuclear inclusion most closely resembles viral nucleocapsids of the measles type.
https://openalex.org/W2045602174,"The thrust of the experimental data presented here is that small air ions are biologically active. There is convincing evidence that both negative and positive ions (i) inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi on solid media; (ii) exert a lethal effect on vegetative forms of bacteria suspended in water when opportunity is provided for contact of cells and ions; and (iii) reduce the viable count of bacterial aerosols. Through physical action, ions of either charge upset the stability of aerolosized bacterial suspensions and, in addition, have a direct lethal effect which is more prominent with negative ions than with positive ions. With regard to the serotonin hypothesis of air ions action, the situation is more complex. The essential fact is that mice and rats display a charge-related metabolic response to air ions and this phenomenon also occurs in humans. Because serotonin is such a potent hormone, the ultimate functional changes incident to air ion action are impressive and account for the signs of symptoms of the sharav syndrome. Alterations in the cumulative mortality rate with three experimental respiratory disease in the mouse also are charge-dependent, positive ions routinely exercising a detrimental effect. Further, in the case of mice infected with influenza virus, ion-deprivation increases the cumulative mortality rate. Since ion depletion is a constant concomitant of modern urban life, one reasonably may speculate about comparable inimical effects on humans."
https://openalex.org/W2156212276,"The muscle relaxant dantrolene sodium acts directly and specifically on skeletal muscle, unlike other pharmacological agents which affect the central nervous system or act at the nueromuscular junction. Dantrolene sodium markedly suppresses the release of calcium previously sequestered by skeletal, but not cardiac, muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. No effect in the total amount of calcium accumulated was found. In situ, the drug may reduce the amount of calcium necessary for muscle contraction."

Protection of the mosquito appears to be related to the immobilization of the microgametes in its gut and is associated with the immunoglobulin G fraction of serum."
https://openalex.org/W1983524837,"Aldehyde and ketone xenobiotic substances are preferentially reduced to alcohols by cytoplasmic enzymes in mammals. These enzymes are widely distributed in the tissues, have broad substrate specificities, have similar physical-chemical characteristics, and require reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as cofactor for the reductions. These reductases define a system of detoxification for aldehyde and ketone groups."

https://openalex.org/W2042033299,"We used an apparatus similar to Tscherning's aberroscope, and analyzed subjects' drawings to obtain the wave aberration surfaces of 55 eyes. This analysis permitted a Taylor series representation of the wave aberrations to terms of the fourth order. The results revealed a wide variety in type and severity of high-order aberrations in which ""cylindrical"" aberrations were prominent and cases of classical spherical aberrations were rare. We computed the monochromatic modulation transfer function curves for the range of observations. The overall findings suggest a more prominent role for monochromatic high-order aberrations in degrading the visual image than has hitherto been assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2086870565,"The size of myocardial infarctions following coronary artery occlusion in the rat was determined directly by measurement of creatine phosphokinase activity in homogenized whole left ventricles and by planimetric measurement of the area of the infarctions in histologic sections of serial slices of the left ventricles. Hyaluronidase was shown to produce significant reductions in expected infarct size both 48 hours and 3 weeks after occlusion without impairing fibrosis during the healing phase. Thus, the amount of myocardial necrosis that follows a coronary artery occlusion has been shown directly to be amenable to reduction with a pharmacological intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2017325468,"When cultures of skeletal muscle cells of the chick embryo are subjected to repetitive, electrical stimulation, the contractions increase the amount of protein produced by these cells. The increase is greater for contractile proteins such as myosin heavy chain than for total cellular protein. This demonstrates that in a culture system of skeletal muscle cells that have differentiated in the absence of innervation, one can elicit the protein synthetic response associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2015929894,"Rabbit pups, 12 to 72 hours old, did not develop a fever when injected intraperitoneally with a pyrogen and maintained at an ambient temperature of 32°C for 2 hours. When placed in a thermally graded alleyway, animals injected with pyrogen selected gradient positions that represented significantly higher temperatures than controls injected with saline (40.4° in contrast to 36.4°C). Allowing the pups to remain at their selected positions for 5 minutes caused a significant increase in the rectal temperatures of the pyrogen-injected pups but not that of the controls. Thus, newborn rabbits will develop a fever by behavioral means after a single injection of an exogenous pyrogen."

These chemical body burdens were obtained naturally under free-living conditions at the maternity roost. The data obtained support the hypothesis that pesticides have contributed to recent declines in populations of this bat."

https://openalex.org/W1995828363,"Recently deposited fine-grained sediments in the Hudson River estuary contain radionuclides from global fallout produced by atmospheric bomb tests as well as from low-level releases of a local nuclear reactor. Accumulation rates of these nuclides are dependent on rates of sediment deposition and vary with location in the estuary by more than two orders of magnitude. Within the Hudson estuary, New York harbor is currently the zone of most rapid deposition of sediments containing radionuclides, some of which were released from a nuclear reactor about 60 kilometers upstream of the harbor."

https://openalex.org/W2010096704,"Double labeling studies with [3H]valine and [14C]valine were used to investigate the pattern of protein synthesis in the brains of goldfish. The protein fractions in three bands (α, β, and γ) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels indicate that more valine was incorporated in the brains of goldfish that had been trained in a vestibular conditioning task than in the brains of untrained fish or fish trained in a variety of control behavioral situations. Changes in the pattern of labeling were localized in the cytoplasmic fraction of the brain; no increases in labeling occurred in either the nuclear or synaptosomal components. The results suggest that a specific change occurs in the pattern of protein synthesis in the brain after the acquisition of a new behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2027819132,"When tested behaviorally, Siamese cats display marked differences in contrast sensitivity compared to ordinary cats. Overall sensitivity is depressed, the high-frequency cutoff point is lower, and there is less falloff in sensitivity at low spatial frequencies. Optical factors may contribute to these differences, or they may be attributable to the well-established anatomical abnormalities within the visual system of the Siamese cat."

https://openalex.org/W2005190479,"A compound, 4,8-dimethyl,5′-carboxypsoralen (DMeCP), has been identified in mouse urine as a major metabolite of the photoactive drug, 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (TMeP). This drug is widely used in the treatment of vitiligo and psoriasis. DMeCP is fluorescent, and nonphotosensitizing when tested on guinea pig skin. DMeCP also occurs in the urine of human patients receiving TMeP orally."
https://openalex.org/W2052216925,"Culture of human lymphoblasts in medium containing limited glutamine (less than 0.2 millimolar) effects an inhibition of purine base reutilization and synthesis de novo. Both processes appear to be inhibited by a decreased availability of the common substrate 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Under conditions of glutamine limitation, the maintenance of capacity for purine base utilization and synthesis de novo and consequently growth was dependent on supplementation of cultures with inosine. The purine nucleoside provides a source of ribose phosphate for synthesis of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Glutamine limitation may result in a decreased availability of ribose-5-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2018273477,"Cells infected with vaccinia virus in the presence of hydroxyurea (HU), which blocks DNA replication, were examined in thin sections by electron microscopy at intervals after removal of HU. Dense, fibrillar material was observed at the orifice formed just before closure of the membrane constituting the envelope of the immature form of the virus. It is concluded that synchrony of assembly enabled stages in the condensation and insertion of viral deoxyribonucleoprotein to be observed. The mechanism appears to be similar to that encountered in morphologic studies of herpes simplex virus and in biochemical studies of poliovirus, adenovirus, and several bacteriophages."

https://openalex.org/W1982202608,"SELECTIVE IgA deficiency is believed to be the commonest form of human immunodeficiency disease, and occurs with a frequency of between 1: 500 and 1: 700 in random populations1,2. Although the isolated deficiency is often considered non-pathological, there is clinical and laboratory evidence that IgA-deficient individuals suffer more sinopulmonary infection and autoimmune and gastrointestinal disorders3,4. Family studies have suggested a genetic factor but no defined inheritance patterns have been established4,5. The chicken model has been used for a number of years in our laboratory to study the ontogeny of immunoglobulin class development6. Surgical bursectomy at hatching7,8, treatment of chick embryos with specific antisera7,9–11 and combined neonatal bursectomy–thymectomy12 can result in depressed levels of IgA. This report describes recent observations of a selective IgA-deficiency that spontaneously occurs in the Obese strain (OS) of White Leghorn chickens. The OS chickens develop spontaneous autoimmune thyroiditis (SAT) at several weeks of age13. Clinical hypothyroidism is observed and high litres of circulating as well as bound anti-thyroglobulin antibodies can be detected14. The OS chickens were initially derived from the Cornell C-strain which reveals a 1% incidence of SAT. Selective breeding of CS birds, which showed phenotypic symptoms of hypothyroidism, resulted in the OS of which now, in generations 16 and 17, show 96% SAT. The histolegical and serological features in OS chickens make it a reasonable animal model to study Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder in humans15."
