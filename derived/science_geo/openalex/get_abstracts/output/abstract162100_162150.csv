https://openalex.org/W2105902511,"Variation in the CYP3A enzymes, which act in drug metabolism, influences circulating steroid levels and responses to half of all oxidatively metabolized drugs. CYP3A activity is the sum activity of the family of CYP3A genes, including CYP3A5, which is polymorphically expressed at high levels in a minority of Americans of European descent and Europeans (hereafter collectively referred to as 'Caucasians'). Only people with at least one CYP3A5*1 allele express large amounts of CYP3A5. Our findings show that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6 that cause alternative splicing and protein truncation result in the absence of CYP3A5 from tissues of some people. CYP3A5 was more frequently expressed in livers of African Americans (60%) than in those of Caucasians (33%). Because CYP3A5 represents at least 50% of the total hepatic CYP3A content in people polymorphically expressing CYP3A5, CYP3A5 may be the most important genetic contributor to interindividual and interracial differences in CYP3A-dependent drug clearance and in responses to many medicines."

https://openalex.org/W1533251376,"The existence of tumor-suppressor genes was originally demonstrated by functional complementation through whole-cell and microcell fusion. Transfer of chromosome 11 into a human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, A549, suppresses tumorigenicity. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the long arm of chromosome 11 has been reported in NSCLC and other cancers. Several independent studies indicate that multiple tumor-suppressor genes are found in this region, including the gene PPP2R1B at 11q23-24 (ref. 7). Linkage studies of NSCLC are precluded because no hereditary forms are known. We previously identified a region of 700 kb on 11q23.2 that completely suppresses tumorigenicity of A549 human NSCLC cells. Most of this tumor-suppressor activity localizes to a 100-kb segment by functional complementation. Here we report that this region contains a single confirmed gene, TSLC1, whose expression is reduced or absent in A549 and several other NSCLC, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic cancer (PaC) cell lines. TSLC1 expression or suppression is correlated with promoter methylation state in these cell lines. Restoration of TSLC1 expression to normal or higher levels suppresses tumor formation by A549 cells in nude mice. Only 2 inactivating mutations of TSLC1 were discovered in 161 tumors and tumor cell lines, both among the 20 primary tumors with LOH for 11q23.2. Promoter methylation was observed in 15 of the other 18 primary NSCLC, HCC and PaC tumors with LOH for 11q23.2. Thus, attenuation of TSLC1 expression occurred in 85% of primary tumors with LOH. Hypermethylation of the TSLC1 promoter would seem to represent the 'second hit' in NSCLC with LOH."

https://openalex.org/W2035897334,"Stomata form pores on leaf surfaces that regulate the uptake of CO2 for photosynthesis and the loss of water vapour during transpiration. An increase in the cytosolic concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca2+]cyt) is a common intermediate in many of the pathways leading to either opening or closure of the stomatal pore. This observation has prompted investigations into how specificity is controlled in calcium-based signalling systems in plants. One possible explanation is that each stimulus generates a unique increase in [Ca2+]cyt, or 'calcium signature', that dictates the outcome of the final response. It has been suggested that the key to generating a calcium signature, and hence to understanding how specificity is controlled, is the ability to access differentially the cellular machinery controlling calcium influx and release from internal stores. Here we report that sphingosine-1-phosphate is a new calcium-mobilizing molecule in plants. We show that after drought treatment sphingosine-1-phosphate levels increase, and we present evidence that this molecule is involved in the signal-transduction pathway linking the perception of abscisic acid to reductions in guard cell turgor."

https://openalex.org/W1526301924,"Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, is prevalent in India, where about half of the world's estimated 800,000 cases occur1. A role for the genetics of the host in variable susceptibility to leprosy has been indicated by familial clustering, twin studies, complex segregation analyses and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association studies. We report here a genetic linkage scan of the genomes of 224 families from South India, containing 245 independent affected sibpairs with leprosy, mainly of the paucibacillary type. In a two-stage genome screen using 396 microsatellite markers, we found significant linkage (maximum lod score (MLS)=4.09, P<2×10−5) on chromosome 10p13 for a series of neighboring microsatellite markers, providing evidence for a major locus for this prevalent infectious disease. Thus, despite the polygenic nature of infectious disease susceptibility, some major, non-HLA–linked loci exist that may be mapped through obtainable numbers of affected sibling pairs."

The Cdc2 molecule of pre-MPF is phosphorylated on threonine 14/tyrosine 15 by Myt1 and threonine 161 by cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase.

Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The neosynthesized cyclin B is also required for leading oocyte maturation beyond germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) in mammals, in which pre-MPF in immature oocytes is only sufficient for inducing GVBD (16Polanski Z. Ledan E. Brunet S. Louvet S. Verlhac M.-H. Kubiak J.Z. Maro B. Development. 1998; 125: 4989-4997PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hampl A. Eppig J.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that newly synthesized cyclins upon progesterone stimulation are not required for initiating oocyte maturation in Xenopus (18Minshull J. Murray A. Colman A. Hunt T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Like c-mosmRNA, however, translation of cyclin B1 mRNA is activated during Xenopus oocyte maturation (20Kobayashi H. Minshull J. Ford C. Golsteyn R. Poon R. Hunt T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Artificial translational activation of endogenous cyclin B1 mRNA brings about GVBD without progesterone and Mos (22de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Barkoff A.F. Dickson K.S. Gray N.K. Wickens M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, the finding that progesterone induces cyclin B1 synthesis without any activities of Mos, MAPK, and MPF strongly suggests that progesterone-induced cyclin B1 synthesis is a physiological trigger of pre-MPF activation (24Frank-Vaillant M. Jessus C. Ozon R. Maller J.L. Haccard O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results of past studies strongly suggest that the translational activation of cyclin B1 mRNA universally plays a key role in initiation of oocyte maturation in lower vertebrates, includingXenopus (25Yamashita M. Zool. Sci. 2000; 17: 841-851Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and an understanding of its control mechanisms during oocyte maturation is therefore of particular importance.Over the past decade, the mystery of how translationally repressed mRNAs in immature oocytes are released from masking at the appropriate time during oocyte maturation has been partially solved. Translational control of masked mRNAs stored in oocytes is mediated by the U-rich motif U4–6A1–2U, named cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE), present in their 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) (for review see Ref. 26Hake L.E. Richter J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: M31-M38PubMed Google Scholar). The CPE sequence is the target site for CPE-binding protein (CPEB), which facilitates polyadenylation of the target mRNA during oocyte maturation (27Hake L.E. Richter J.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 617-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition to the involvement in translational activation, CPEB has recently been shown to mediate the masking of cyclin B1 mRNA (22de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Barkoff A.F. Dickson K.S. Gray N.K. Wickens M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Tay J. Hodgman R. Richter J.D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 221: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, CPEB seems to have a dual function: to maintain maternal mRNAs, including those of cyclin B1, in a dormant state in immature oocytes and to activate their translation via polyadenylation during oocyte maturation. Nevertheless, many issues still remain to be elucidated. For example, although both c-mos and cyclin B1 mRNAs hold the CPEs in their 3′-UTR, the following findings indicate that their translational activation is controlled by different mechanisms: 1) translational activation of c-mos mRNA precedes that of cyclin B1 mRNA (29Ballantyne S. Daniel D.L.J. Wickens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1633-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); 2) in contrast to c-mos mRNA, the protein level of cyclin B1 can increase in the absence of polyadenylation or cap-ribose methylation of mRNA and is independent of MAPK activity (24Frank-Vaillant M. Jessus C. Ozon R. Maller J.L. Haccard O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Kuge H. Brownlee G.G. Gershon P.D. Richter J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3208-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,31Howard E.L. Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); 3) a reporter mRNA carrying the cyclin B1 3′-UTR is translationally repressed when injected into oocytes, whereas that carrying the c-mos 3′-UTR is not (23Barkoff A.F. Dickson K.S. Gray N.K. Wickens M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); and 4) the injection of high concentrations of the CPE induces unmasking of cyclin B1 mRNA but not of c-mos mRNA (22de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulatory elements other than CPEs and CPEB must operate for the coordinated activation of masked mRNAs to promote oocyte maturation.In early Drosophila embryos, Pumilio represses translation of maternal hunchback (hb) mRNA, in conjunction with Nanos (32Tautz D. Nature. 1988; 327: 383-389Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 33Irish V. Lehmann R. Akam M. Nature. 1989; 338: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 34Barker D.D. Wang C. Moore J. Dickinson L.K. Lehmann R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2312-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The translational repression is due to the direct binding of Pumilio to two copies of a bipartite sequence, the nanos response elements (NREs), located in the 3′-UTR ofhb mRNA (35Wharton R.P. Struhl G. Cell. 1991; 67: 955-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 36Wharton R.P. Sonoda J. Lee T. Patterson M. Murata Y. Mol.

Loss-of-function mutations ofpumilio and nanos induce the premature expression of cyclin B protein in pole cells (39Asaoka-Taguchi M. Yamada M. Nakamura A. Hanyu K. Kobayashi S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Deletion from cyclin B mRNA of cis-elements (named TCEs) resembling the NREs inhb mRNA results in a phenotype similar to that caused bypumilio and nanos mutations (40Dalby B. Glover D.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that Pumilio, in cooperation with Nanos, is involved in translational repression of cyclin B mRNA through the NRE-like sequence TCE, although it remains to be elucidated biochemically whether or not the direct binding of Pumilio to cyclin B mRNA brings about its translational repression.Our goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of translational activation of dormant cyclin B1 mRNA upon hormonal stimulation, which is prerequisite for initiating oocyte maturation in fish and amphibians, probably inclusive of Xenopus (25Yamashita M. Zool. Sci. 2000; 17: 841-851Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). NRE-like motifs are found in the 3′-UTR of cyclin B1 mRNA in fish and amphibians, including goldfish (41Hirai T. Yamashita M. Yoshikuni M. Lou Y.-H. Nagahama Y. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 33: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), medaka (42Mita K. Ohbayashi T. Tomita K. Shimizu Y. Kondo T. Yamashita M. Zool. Sci. 2000; 17: 365-374PubMed Google Scholar), zebrafish, 2M. Yamashita (2000) GenBank™ accession numberAB040435. 2M. Yamashita (2000) GenBank™ accession numberAB040435. Xenopus (43Minshull J. Blow J.J. Hunt T. Cell. 1989; 56: 947-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and Rana (44Ihara J. Yoshida N. Tanaka T. Mita K. Yamashita M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is therefore expected that a homolog of Pumilio or its related protein(s) binds directly to cyclin B1 mRNA to control its translation. To date, however, there has been no report on protein expression of Pumilio homologs in vertebrates, although cDNAs probably encoding human homologs have been isolated in a cDNA project (45Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Miyajima N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 46Nagase T. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Sazuka T. Seki N. Sato S. Tabata S. Ishikawa K.-I. Kawarabayasi Y. Kotani H. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the present study, we biochemically characterized a XenopusPumilio protein, and we investigated its involvement in the translational control of cyclin B1 mRNA. We isolated a cDNA clone encoding a protein homologous (78% identity) toDrosophila Pumilio in the domain that defines the Pumilio family. A monoclonal antibody raised against this domain has revealed for the first time in any vertebrate that Xenopus oocytes have a protein homologous to Pumilio (named XPum for XenopusPumilio), which has an apparent molecular mass of 137 kDa and binds to the NRE of Drosophila hb mRNA, as in the case of theDrosophila counterpart. Using UV cross-linking assays with various RNA probes, we have also provided the first biochemical evidence for the sequence-specific direct binding of Pumilio to the 3′-UTR of cyclin B1 mRNA. Moreover, the results of protein pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that XPum associates with a Xenopus homolog of Nanos, Xcat-2 (47Mosquera L. Forristall C. Zhou Y. King M.L. Development. 1993; 117: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar), and CPEB.DISCUSSIONWe have focused on Pumilio as one of the possible translational regulators of cyclin B1, because the 3′-UTR of cyclin B1 mRNA has sequences resembling those required for translational repression by Pumilio in Drosophila. We report here the following main findings: 1) A 137-kDa Xenopus homolog of Pumilio (XPum) exists in oocytes and eggs, the first demonstration of Pumilio protein expression in vertebrates; 2) XPum binds to the cyclin B1 3′-UTR containing the UGUA at nucleotides 1335–1338; 3) The sequence responsible for masking cyclin B1 mRNA, as determined by translational activation of endogenous cyclin B1 mRNA by injection of various cis-elements, is located around CPE1 (nucleotides 1353–1360), close to but different from the XPum-binding site; 4) XPum physically associates with a Xenopus Nanos homolog, Xcat-2, at least in vitro and with CPEB in vivo.The amino acid sequence alignment of Pumilio homologs exhibits a high degree of conservation in the Pum-HD (Fig. 1), which is known to have a dual function, not only recognizing the NREs but also interacting with some component of the translational machinery (36Wharton R.P. Sonoda J. Lee T. Patterson M. Murata Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 863-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Sonoda J. Wharton R.P.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1009-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity is suggestive of a common function of Pumilio. Indeed, our results showed that XPum can bind to the NRE ofhb mRNA, the sequence recognized by theDrosophila counterpart. Moreover, the present UV cross-linking assays using endogenous Pumilio protein and various mutant probes indicated that the Pumilio-binding site contains the sequence UGUA, which is identical to the sequence determined by gel-shift experiments with recombinant Pumilio proteins from human andDrosophila (60Zamore P.D. Williamson J.R. Lehmann R. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1997; 3: 1421-1433PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also demonstrated that yeast Pumilio-related proteins play a role in negative control of translation by recognizing a cis-element similar to that forDrosophila, Xenopus, and human Pumilio homologs (66Olivas W. Parker R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6602-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 67Tadauchi T. Matsumoto K. Herskowitz I. Irie K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results strongly suggest that the function of Pumilio as a translational regulator and itscis-element of the target RNAs are widely conserved in evolution.Drosophila Pumilio represses translation of maternalhb mRNA by direct binding to the NRE in its 3′-UTR (36Wharton R.P. Sonoda J. Lee T. Patterson M. Murata Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 863-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,38Murata Y. Wharton R.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 747-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The results of genetic analyses also suggest that Pumilio, in cooperation with Nanos, controls translation of cyclin B mRNA in the migrating pole cells (39Asaoka-Taguchi M. Yamada M. Nakamura A. Hanyu K. Kobayashi S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), although there has been no direct biochemical evidence for the binding of Pumilio to cyclin B mRNA in any species to date. The results of the present study have provided the first biochemical evidence of a Pum-binding site in cyclin B1 mRNA as well as evidence of the binding of endogenous Pumilio to cyclin B1 mRNA in a sequence-specific manner. These findings led us to verify the possibility that, as in Drosophila, XPum plays an essential role in translational control of cyclin B1 mRNA during oocyte maturation. To this end, we injected variouscis-elements into oocytes in the expectation that, if the injected sequence is responsible for masking cyclin B1 mRNA, it will titrate the masking proteins and thereby induce translational activation of endogenous cyclin B1 as already demonstrated (22de Moor C.H. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Barkoff A.F. Dickson K.S. Gray N.K. Wickens M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the injection of large amounts of cyclin B1 3′-UTR intoXenopus oocytes induced cyclin B1 synthesis and GVBD. We also demonstrated that the cis-element necessary for translational repression of cyclin B1 mRNA exists in the neighborhood of CPE1 (nucleotides 1353–1360) but not in CPE2 (nucleotides 1371–1377). Injection of the XPum-binding sequence, however, induced neither translational activation of endogenous cyclin B1 mRNA nor GVBD (Fig. 5). These results seem to imply that the binding of Pumilio to cyclin B1 mRNA is not responsible for masking cyclin B1 mRNA. Nevertheless, this suggestion needs to be proved by experimental approaches other than the injection ofcis-elements, because it has been reported that injection of large amounts of CPE-containing RNA into mouse oocytes does not induce translational activation of cyclin B1 mRNA despite the involvement of CPEB in both the repression and the stimulation of cyclin B1 mRNA in this species, as in the case of Xenopus (28Tay J. Hodgman R. Richter J.D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 221: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In cooperation with CPEB as a major control element, XPum might contribute as a fine tuner of cyclin B1 mRNA translation. This notion is also supported by the present finding that XPum physically interacts with CPEB both in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 6,B–D).The function of Drosophila Pumilio in control of the translation of mRNAs is dependent on Nanos (68Wreden C. Verrotti A.C. Schisa J.A. Lieberfarb M.E. Strickland S. Development. 1997; 124: 3015-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 69Forbes A. Lehmann R. Development. 1998; 125: 679-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FBF, aC. elegans Pumilio-related protein, also controls the sperm/oocyte switch in a hermaphrodite germ line by regulating the translation of fem-3 mRNA with interaction with one of the C. elegans Nanos homologs (61Zhang B. Gallegos M. Puoti A. Durkin E. Fields S. Kimble J. Wickens M.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 65Kraemer B. Crittenden S. Gallegos M. Moulder G. Barstead R. Kimble J. Wickens M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1009-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). XPum may likewise collaborate with one or more partners to regulate the translation of specific maternal mRNAs (for review see Ref. 70Parisi M. Lin H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R81-R83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most likely candidate for the XPum partner is a Xenopus homolog of Nanos, Xcat-2 protein (71Zhou Y. King M.L. Development. 1996; 122: 2947-2953PubMed Google Scholar, 72Forristall C. Pondel M. Chen L. King M.L. Development. 1995; 121: 201-208PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, we have provided evidence of association between XPum and Xcat-2, at least in vitro (Fig.6 A). However, Xcat-2 protein is reported to be absent in oocytes and eggs despite the presence of its mRNA. The protein appears in accordance with the movement of germ plasm during early embryogenesis (73MacArthur H. Bubunenko M. Houston D.W. King M.L. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Xcat-2 is undetectable in anti-XPum immunoprecipitates from oocyte extracts. 3S. Nakahata and M. Yamashita, unpublished data. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that one or more Nanos homologs other than Xcat-2 collaborate with XPum in oocytes, it remains a mystery whether XPum acts together with a Nanos homolog to govern the translation of mRNAs in oocytes.The actual biological roles of XPum are completely unknown at present, but we speculate that XPum plays an important role in translational control of cyclin B1 mRNA like in Drosophila (39Asaoka-Taguchi M. Yamada M. Nakamura A. Hanyu K. Kobayashi S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 40Dalby B. Glover D.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CPEB directly binds to maskin, a protein that can also bind directly to the cap-binding translation initiation factor elF-4E, which leads to translational repression. The dissociation of maskin from elF-4E allows elF-4G to bind to elF-4E, which brings elF-3 and the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA to initiate translation via cap-ribose methylation (30Kuge H. Brownlee G.G. Gershon P.D. Richter J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3208-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 74Stebbins-Boaz B. Cao Q. de Moor C.H. Mendez R. Richter J.D. Mol.

Recent studies have also shown that a progesterone-induced early phosphorylation of CPEB at serine 174 is catalyzed by Eg2 (76Mendez R. Hake L.E. Andresson T. Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Richter J.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and that this phosphorylation recruits cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor into an active cytoplasmic polyadenylation complex (77Mendez R. Murthy K.G.K. Ryan K. Manley J.L. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1253-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, CPEB plays a key role in both translational repression and activation of mRNAs stored in oocytes (for review see Ref. 78Richter J.D. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 785-806Google Scholar). We demonstrated in this study that XPum is physically associated with CPEB in oocytes. In cooperation with CPEB, XPum may control the CPEB/maskin-mediated translational masking and unmasking to assure the highly coordinated successive translational activation of masked mRNAs during oocyte maturation. Further studies are required to understand the biological significance of the interactions among XPum, CPEB, and cyclin B1 mRNA, as well as to elucidate the functions of XPum in oocytes. The final inducer of oocyte maturation is the maturation-promoting factor (MPF),1 which consists of Cdc2 and cyclin B. MPF is stored in immature oocytes as an inactive form (called pre-MPF), although its amount differs from species to species (1Yamashita M. Mita K. Yoshida N. Kondo T. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Taieb F. Thibier C. Jessus C. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 48: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In Xenopus (as well as fish and mammals except for mice), the initiation of oocyte maturation requires proteins (called “initiators”) newly synthesized by translational activation of dormant mRNAs stored in oocytes (masked mRNAs). Mos functions as an initiator with the aid of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (3Yew N. Mellini M.L. Vande Woude G.F.

The Cdc2 molecule of pre-MPF is phosphorylated on threonine 14/tyrosine 15 by Myt1 and threonine 161 by cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase. The Mos/MAPK pathway probably leads to the activation of Cdc25, which dephosphorylates threonine 14/tyrosine 15 via the polo-like kinase (10Abrieu A. Brassac T. Galas S. Fisher D. Labbe J.C. Doree M.

Enhanced cyclin B synthesis is a ubiquitous event that occurs during oocyte maturation in all species examined so far, and it is indispensable for initiating oocyte maturation in fish and amphibians except Xenopus, in which pre-MPF is absent in immature oocytes (15Yamashita M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The neosynthesized cyclin B is also required for leading oocyte maturation beyond germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) in mammals, in which pre-MPF in immature oocytes is only sufficient for inducing GVBD (16Polanski Z.

https://openalex.org/W2039708570,"Leukolysin, originally isolated from human leukocytes, is the sixth member of the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMP) subfamily with a potential glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. To understand its biological functions, we screened subpopulations of leukocytes and localized the expression of leukolysin at the mRNA level to neutrophils. Polyclonal and mono-specific antisera raised against a synthetic peptide from its hinge region recognized a major protein species at 56 kDa and several minor forms between 38 and 45 kDa in neutrophil lysates. In resting neutrophils, leukolysin is distributed among specific granules (∼10%), gelatinase granules (∼40%), secretory vesicles (∼30%), and the plasma membrane (∼20%), a pattern distinct from that of neutrophil MMP-8 and MMP-9. Consistent with its membrane localization and its reported GPI anchor, leukolysin partitions into the detergent phase of Triton X-114 and can be released from intact resting neutrophils by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Phorbol myristate acetate stimulates neutrophils to discharge 100% of leukolysin from specific and gelatinase granules and ∼50% from the secretory vesicles and plasma membrane, suggesting that leukolysin can be mobilized by physiological signals to the extracellular milieu as a soluble enzyme. Indeed, interleukin 8, a neutrophil chemoattractant, triggered a release of ∼85% of cellular leukolysins by a process resistant to a mixture of proteinase inhibitors, including aprotinin, BB-94, pepstatin, and E64. Finally, purified recombinant leukolysin can degrade components of the extracellular matrix. These results not only establish leukolysin as the first neutrophil-specific MT-MMP but also implicate it as a cytokine/chemokine-regulated effector during innate immune responses or tissue injury."

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3936-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Cytochrome bd-type oxidases purified from Azotobacter vinelandii or Escherichia coli consist of two subunits and carry three iron-porphyrin groups: low spin hemeb558, high spin hemeb595, and a chlorin-type high spin iron-porphyrin group (heme d). All three redox centers are proposed to be located near the periplasmic side of the membrane (2Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 32-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Heme b558 is directly involved in ubiquinol oxidation (11Green G.N. Lorence R.M. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2309-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Dueweke T.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3401-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Heme d binds O2 and is involved in the trapping and reduction of oxygen (3Poole R.K. Anthony C. Bacterial Energy Transduction. Academic Press, London1988: 231-291Google Scholar). The specific role of heme b595 is still a matter of debate. One obvious possible role is the transferrence of electrons from heme b558 to heme d (13Poole R.K. Williams H.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 217: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Hata-Tanaka A. Matsuura K. Itoh S. Anraku Y. Biochim. Biophys.

However, because heme b595 is high spin, it is tempting to consider its involvement in dioxygen reduction; it was proposed that hemes b595 and d might form a binuclear dioxygen reduction center analogous to the heme-copper oxygen-reducing site in the cytochrome aa3- orbo3-type oxidases (16Rothery R.A. Houston A.M. Ingledew W.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 3247-3255PubMed Google Scholar, 17Krasnoselskaya I. Arutjunjan A.M. Smirnova I. Gennis R. Konstantinov A.A.

In such a case, one might expect heme b595 to react with other exogenous ligands such as CO or NO as is typical of most high spin hemoproteins. Surprisingly, despite a long history of such studies, this essential and apparently simple question has not been answered by the apparently conflicting data. The intricate line shape of the absorption changes induced by CO binding with the fully reduced cytochrome bd in the Soret band as observed in conventional room temperature studies has long been considered to indicate CO binding with both hemes d and b595(e.g. see Refs. 20Poole R.K. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 65: 289-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Jünemann S. Wrigglesworth J.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and references therein). However, the spectral features attributed to CO binding withb595 could be caused by a small bandshift of unligated heme b595 induced by CO interaction with the nearby heme d (23Vos M.V. Borisov V.B. Liebl U. Martin J.-L. Konstantinov A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy has shown that only a small fraction of heme b595, if any, in the E. colicytochrome bd binds CO or NO at room temperature. On the other hand, low temperature photodissociation studies carried out by Poole and co-workers (24Poole R.K. Scott R.I. Chance B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 125: 431-438PubMed Google Scholar, 25D'mello R. Palmer S. Hill S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 121: 115-120Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26D'mello R. Hill S. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) on cytochrome bd from different bacteria have revealed consistently a simple pattern of photoinduced spectral changes assigned to the photodissociation of the cytochrome b595-CO complex. Recent femtosecond photobleaching studies have identified the Soret band of ferrous hemeb595 at about 440 nm and support this interpretation (23Vos M.V. Borisov V.B. Liebl U. Martin J.-L. Konstantinov A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CO binding with about 15% of hemeb595 at cryogenic temperatures was observed with the aid of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in the membrane-bound cytochrome bd from E. coli, but there was no binding in the isolated enzyme (18Hill J.J. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5863-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the enzyme may behave differently at cryogenic and room temperatures. On the other hand, the results obtained by different techniques and at different temperatures were also often done with different preparations and under different conditions, which complicates direct comparison of the data in the literature. We considered it worthwhile to address this problem specifically and compare the spectral changes associated with CO binding and photodissociation at room and low temperatures in the same preparation of purified cytochrome bd from A. vinelandii. The results confirm that CO photodissociation from hemeb595 is the sole major process revealed spectrophotometrically at temperatures around −100 °C. However, the fraction of heme b595 that shows CO photodissociation at low temperature corresponds to only about 5% of the enzyme. These observations resolve the apparent contradiction between the room and low temperature experiments and corroborate the model of cytochrome bd interaction with exogenous ligands assuming negative cooperativity between hemesb595 and d (22Borisov V.

Low temperature experiments were performed using a dual-wavelength scanning spectrophotometer with low temperature facilities and photolysis arrangements as described (31Poole R.K. Salmon I.

A typical experiment was performed as follows. Purified cytochrome bd in a buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.02% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, pH 7.2, was reduced with a small amount of solid sodium dithionite for 15 min or by 10 mm ascorbate/50 μm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine for 25 min in a 2-mm path-length cuvette (total volume, 1 ml) and then bubbled with CO for 2 min at room temperature. The cuvette was transferred in total darkness to an ethanol/dry-ice bath at −78 °C and frozen rapidly. After equilibration in the sample compartment of the spectrophotometer, a baseline was recorded and stored in the memory. The sample was subsequently photolysed for 3 min with the focused beam from a 150-watt tungsten lamp, and the difference absorption spectra (versus the stored baseline) were recorded. A reduced CO-untreated sample was prepared and frozen in a parallel manner to provide a baseline for the low temperature measurements of the CO binding-induced absorption changes and compared with the photodissociation-induced spectral changes. Laser flash-induced CO photodissociation/recombination time-resolved measurements at room temperature were done as described (34Azarkina N. Siletsky S. Borisov V. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L.

This side-by-side comparison of the two enzymes is important because some of the essential CO binding studies were performed with cytochrome bd purified from E. coli, whereas others were done with the A. vinelandiienzyme. Therefore, for generalization of the conclusions it is desirable to ensure that in the same study, the two enzymes show the same CO-induced spectral changes. The two difference spectra are very similar and agree well with the published data (21Jünemann S. Wrigglesworth J.M. J. Biol.

In the visible region, a typical red shift of the absorption band of ferrous heme d at ∼630 nm (presumably, the Qy transition) is observed, giving rise to a symmetric first derivative-shaped curve with a maximum at 642 nm and a minimum at 622 nm. This shift is accompanied by an increased absorption at 538 nm that could report concurrent modulation of theQx band of heme d. The intricate line shape of the Soret band changes induced by CO binding is not yet fully understood, but as discussed in Refs. 22Borisov V. Arutyunyan A.M. Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Konstantinov A.A.

First there is a large blue shift of the ferrous heme d γ-band that gives rise to a maximum at ∼400 nm (formation of CO-ligated heme d) and a broad minimum centered around 432 nm (decrease in free heme d) with an inflection point around 420 nm between them. This major effect overlaps with a sharp first derivative-shaped feature with a maximum at 436 nm and a minimum at 444 nm dominated by perturbation of the ferrous heme b595 band at ∼440 nm induced indirectly by CO binding to heme d (23Vos M.V.

Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Konstantinov A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, room temperature absorption spectra provide no clear evidence for direct CO binding by heme b595. A difference absorption spectrum (CO-reduced minus reduced) recorded at −100 °C is shown in Fig. 2 a. Changes in the 500–700-nm range are virtually identical to those at room temperature (Fig.1 a) and reflect mainly CO binding with heme d. In the Soret band, the changes recorded at low temperature are slightly different in line shape and showed some variability between the samples. Very similar results were obtained with the samples reduced by ascorbate +N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine instead of dithionite (data not shown). Illumination of the frozen CO-ligated cytochrome bd with white light for 3 min brings about absorption changes indicative of a red shift of the Soret band (Fig. 2, spectrum b). The line shape (a maximum around 438 nm and a minimum at about 420 nm) is in good agreement with earlier data (25D'mello R. Palmer S. Hill S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 121: 115-120Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26D'mello R. Hill S. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and is typical of CO photodissociation from a high spin heme b(36Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). No photoinduced changes of heme d can be discerned in the far red region under these conditions (cf. also Refs.24Poole R.K. Scott R.I. Chance B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 125: 431-438PubMed Google Scholar, 25D'mello R. Palmer S. Hill S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 121: 115-120Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26D'mello R. Hill S. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) because of geminate recombination of CO with the hemed, which is fast enough even at −100 °C (3Poole R.K. Anthony C. Bacterial Energy Transduction. Academic Press, London1988: 231-291Google Scholar). Much lower temperatures (4–5 K) are required to observe the photolysis and subsequent recombination of CO with heme d (37Poole R.K. Sivaram A. Salmon I. Chance B. FEBS Lett. 1982; 141: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This property makes the low temperature photodissociation studies fairly selective for cytochrome b595, whereas at room temperature the changes from heme d in the Soret region overlap those of heme b595. At a 25-fold higher concentration of the enzyme, the matching absorption changes in the visible region can be resolved clearly (Fig.3); the difference spectrum of the photoinduced changes shows peaks at 595 and 556 nm and a trough at 571 nm, diagnostic of CO dissociation from a high spin rather than low spin heme b. Together, the data show that CO photodissociation from high spin heme b595 is the sole effect revealed by static spectra in cytochrome bd at −100 °C. The photoinduced absorption changes at low temperatures cannot be quantitated directly with the use of known extinction coefficient values for the chromophores because of the well known effect of intensification of the absorption bands at cryogenic temperatures (typically ∼10-fold) (38Wilson D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 121: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,39Vincent J.-C. Kumar C. Chance B. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is mainly caused by an increase in the effective optical pathway because of the multiple reflection of light within the frozen sample, with a minor contribution from band narrowing. The extent of band intensification depends critically on the buffer/solvent system used, the exact procedure for freezing the sample, and other details that render comparison of the different series of experiment samples problematic (38Wilson D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 121: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 39Vincent J.-C. Kumar C. Chance B. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, when the experiment is repeated under the same conditions, fairly reproducible results can be obtained. Therefore, to calibrate the absorption changes induced by photodissociation of CO at cryogenic temperatures, we compared their magnitude with that of the well resolved changes induced in the same samples by CO binding with hemed and recorded at the same low temperatures. In each experiment, a set of three low temperature spectra was recorded. First, a spectrum of a control sample reduced with dithionite was taken. Second, a spectrum of a similar sample that was treated with CO at room temperature in the dark before freezing was recorded (reduced + CO state). Third, after taking the low temperature spectrum of the reduced + CO state, the frozen sample was illuminated, and a spectrum of the photodissociated state was taken (reduced + COlight). Each of the low temperature spectra was recorded versus a frozen sample of buffer alone to compensate for light scattering. Subsequently, low temperature difference spectra were constructed for CO photodissociation at low temperature (reduced + COlight minus reduced + CO) compared with low temperature recordings of a sample prepared by CO binding at room temperature (reduced + CO minus reduced). In this way, the magnitude of the heme b595 response induced by low temperature photodissociation of CO was evaluated by comparison with the well separated absorption changes of heme d in the same frozen sample induced by CO binding. Eight such experiments were performed, and the results are summarized in Table I. The normalized observed photoinduced absorption changes of heme b595 are almost two orders of magnitude smaller than a typical extinction coefficient of ≈215 mm−1 cm−1for a difference spectrum induced by CO binding with reduced high spin heme b proteins (36Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and correspond to photodissociation of ∼4.5% of heme b595 at −70 °C and even less (∼3%) at −100 °C. The actual values may be slightly higher because of somewhat lower intensification of the Soret band changes relative to the α-range. In our samples, the α/γ intensification ratio was about 1.4. The corresponding values for the percentage of b595-CO photodissociation are given in Table I in brackets and give an upper limit for the effect (∼4 and 6% of the heme at −100 °C and −70 °C, respectively).Table IQuantitation of the absorption changes induced by CO photodissociation from heme b595 at cryogenic temperaturesR-CO minus R apparent ΔA-(640–622) (binding of CO with hemed)R-COlight minus R-CO apparent ΔA-(440–420) (photodissociation of CO from hemeb595)ΔA-(440–420)/ΔA-(640–622)ΔA-(440–420) calculated for room temperatureMolar absorption 1-aAssuming Δɛ of 18 mm−1 cm−1 for CO binding with hemed at room temperature (21).Fraction ofb5951-bAssuming Δɛ of 215 mm−1 cm−1 for high spin bhemoprotein (36).mm−1 cm−1mm−1 cm−1mm−1 cm−1%−100 °C134 ± 749 ± 20.34 ± 0.026.1 ± 0.42.8 ± 0.2(8.5 ± 0.6) 1-cCorrected for lower intensification in the Soret relative to the visible part of the spectrum.(3.9 ± 0.3) 1-cCorrected for lower intensification in the Soret relative to the visible part of the spectrum.−70 °C188 ± 12100 ± 190.53 ± 0.129.5 ± 2.24.4 ± 1.0(13 ± 3.1) 1-cCorrected for lower intensification in the Soret relative to the visible part of the spectrum.(6.0 ± 1.4) 1-cCorrected for lower intensification in the Soret relative to the visible part of the spectrum.Conditions were as described in the Fig. 2 legend.

Open table in a new tab Conditions were as described in the Fig. 2 legend. Cytochromebd concentration, 0.8 μm. R, denotes the fully reduced form of cytochrome bd. Independent evidence for CO binding with a small fraction of heme b595 in the same preparation of the enzyme is provided by the time-resolved studies of CO recombination with the reduced cytochrome bd after laser flash-induced photolysis of the ligand complex at room temperature (Fig. 4). The absorption changes induced by CO photodissociation were fully reversible in the dark, and their decay revealed several phases in general agreement with the data of Jünemann et al. (40Jünemann S. Rich P.R. Wrigglesworth J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 157Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The rapid phase is well separated kinetically and is characterized by τ of 18 ± 3 μs at ∼1 mm CO (second order rate constant,k1 = 5.5 × 108m−1 s−1). A difference spectrum of this phase is shown in Fig. 4 by spectrum a, which is typical of CO binding with heme d (including a spectral perturbation of ferrous heme b595induced by CO binding with heme d (23Vos M.V. Borisov V.B. Liebl U. Martin J.-L. Konstantinov A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). The slower part of recombination included 2–3 phases with τ values in the range of 0.2–2.3 ms, but the difference spectra of the phases were rather similar and indicated CO binding with a b-type heme in agreement with the findings in Ref. 40Jünemann S. Rich P.R. Wrigglesworth J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 157Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar. Heterogeneity of the slow part of the response could reflect CO recombination with bothb595 and low spin hemeb558. In any case, the overall magnitude of the slow phase of absorption changes allows us to evaluate the upper limit of the CO-reactive fraction of heme b595. An overall difference spectrum for the slow phases is given in Fig. 4 by spectrum b, which reveals a maximum near 440 nm and a minimum around 420 nm, similar to the photoinduced absorption changes at low temperatures. Its amplitude (Δε420–440 = 4–6 mm−1cm−1) allows an estimate of the upper limit forb595 reactivity toward CO and corresponds to 2–3% of this redox center. This value may be even less if part of the slow phase of CO recombination reflects binding of the ligand with the low spin heme b558 (40Jünemann S. Rich P.R. Wrigglesworth J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 157Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This work resolves the long standing controversy as to whether high spin heme b595 in cytochrome bdreacts with exogenous ligands like CO. Although the absorption changes induced by illumination of the CO complex of cytochrome bdat low temperatures pointed consistently to CO photodissociation from heme b595 (3Poole R.K. Anthony C. Bacterial Energy Transduction. Academic Press, London1988: 231-291Google Scholar, 24Poole R.K. Scott R.I. Chance B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 125: 431-438PubMed Google Scholar, 25D'mello R. Palmer S.

Microbiol. 1983; 129: 1345-1355PubMed Google Scholar), room temperature magnetic circular dichroism measurements allowing resolution of individual signals of ferrous heme b595 in the visible have shown that the heme does not respond significantly to either CO or NO (22Borisov V. Arutyunyan A.M. Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Konstantinov A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The present work shows that 1) there is CO binding with ferrous b595 as evidenced by both low temperature photodissociation of the bd-CO complex and time-resolved studies of CO recombination at room temperature, but 2) the binding involves only a small fraction of the heme, some 2–5%, that could well go unnoticed in magnetic circular dichroism studies. Two alternative explanations for our finding can be considered. First, the results may provide support for the model of exogenous ligand binding with cytochrome bd suggested in Refs. 22Borisov V. Arutyunyan A.M. Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Konstantinov A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and 27Borisov V.B. Gennis R.B. Konstantinov A.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 60: 231-239Google Scholar. This model (A) implies that the two high spin hemes d andb595 are located very close to each other and form a diheme binuclear center with a capacity for only one molecule of exogenous ligand like CO. This molecule distributes between the two heme irons within the binuclear center in accordance with their intrinsic affinities for the ligand, heme d having a higher affinity (cf. Fig. 9 in Ref. 22Borisov V. Arutyunyan A.M. Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Konstantinov A.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 740-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Within the framework of model A, our work indicates that the Kd of heme d for CO is about 20–30-fold lower that that ofb595, so that about 95% of the ligand bound to cytochrome bd reposes on heme d (i.e.the ligand molecule trapped in the diheme binuclear center of the oxidase spends about 95% of time at heme d and ∼5% at heme b595). Model B proposes that the cytochrome bd population may be heterogeneous so that in ∼95% of the enzyme the ligand can bind to heme d only, whereas in the remaining ∼5% the ligand reacts with heme b595 (whether hemed in this 5% of the enzyme can also bind CO is difficult to deduce). Model B may be more consistent with the recombination data that show heme b595-associated changes to be slower than those of heme d. Indeed, if there were free rapid (say, nanosecond) equilibration of CO between hemes d andb595 within the same heme-binding pocket, one might expect synchronous development of the absorption changes of the two hemes induced by CO recombination. However, the above alternatives are not necessarily mutually exclusive and rather may pose a question as to what the time constant for equilibration between the states is.τ=?[b595−COd]↔[b595CO−d]Equation 1 If the characteristic time is short relative to an observation period in a particular type of experiment, model A applies. If the equilibration is slow, model A will transform to model B. The process may be slow if limited, for instance, by an exchange of the endogenous ligands in the coordination sphere of heme d(42Azarkina N. Borisov V. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It must be emphasized that the above discussion refers to cytochromes bd from A. vinelandii and E. coli, showing much the same CO reactivity (e.g. Fig.1). It is interesting that in cytochrome bd fromBacillus stearothermophilus, the major part of hemeb595 binds CO at room temperature as can be inferred from the difference spectra in Fig. 1B of Ref.43Sakamoto J.

The enzyme relaxes negative and positive supercoils arising as a consequence of DNA processes such as DNA transcription, replication, recombination, and chromosome condensation (1Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar).Mechanistically, topo I acts by introducing transient single-strand breaks into the DNA double helix. The catalytic cycle can be subdivided into several steps including: (i) non-covalent DNA binding, (ii) cleavage, (iii) strand rotation, (iv) religation, and (v) enzyme turnover. The cleavage and religation events constitute two reverse phosphoryl transfer (transesterification) reactions. During the cleavage reaction, an active-site tyrosine residue of the enzyme is used as a nucleophile to break a phosphodiester bond of the DNA backbone, generating a covalent enzyme-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-DNA linkage and a free 5′-hydroxyl group (2Stewart L.

This 5′-hydroxyl group provides the nucleophile for the religation reaction that restores intact DNA.The solved crystal structure of an N-terminal-truncated version of the human topo I together with proteolytic analyses show that the enzyme is organized into four structural domains. These consist of an N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–206), a core domain (amino acids 207–635), a linker domain (amino acids 636–712), and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 713–765) (2Stewart L.

The C-terminal domain contains the active-site tyrosine (Tyr723), which together with the catalytic residues Arg488, Lys532, Arg590, and His632 of the core domain constitutes the active site of the enzyme (4Jensen A.D.

Structural data show that the core and C-terminal domains form a clamp structure that wraps around the DNA and, together with the helix-turn-helix linker domain (1Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), contacts DNA in a region extending 4 base pairs upstream and 9 base pairs downstream of the cleavage site (3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Based on this structural information of the human topo I-DNA complex, a model for strand rotation (topoisomerization) has been proposed. According to this “controlled rotation” model, rotation of the cleaved strand around the intact strand is partially hindered by contacts between the rotating DNA and part of the core and linker domains (3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The involvement of the linker in controlling strand rotation has recently been supported by biochemical studies showing that the sensitivity of topo I toward camptothecin in relaxation depends on a functional linker domain (9Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The recently published crystal structure of a topo I form encompassing a few residues of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 203–214) demonstrates an interaction between Trp205 and the hinge region of the core domain (37Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This interaction has been proposed to be important for the flexibility of the enzyme clamp, allowing controlled strand rotation. Beside such speculations, the putative enzymatic function(s) of the N-terminal domain of topo I has remained unknown. Based on biochemical analyses, it is assumed to be largely unfolded or highly dynamic (2Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

We have found significant differences between p67 and p91 in DNA binding, cleavage, strand rotation, and ligation. The sum of our results held together with previous reports showing no effect of deleting the first 190 amino acids of the enzyme (14Bronstein I.B. Wynne-Jones A. Sukhanova A. Fleury F. Ianoul A.

Samuels D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1998; 25: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In human topo I, a number of nuclear localization sequences, phosphorylation sites, and protein interaction sites have been mapped to the N-terminal domain (11Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E.

However, the N-terminal domain has long been thought to contribute little to the topo I enzyme activity per se. Here we describe for the first time a significant modulation of in vitro DNA relaxation mediated by residues within this domain.The salient findings from our present work may be briefly summarized as follows. In the absence of the N-terminal domain, relaxation by human topo I becomes more distributive. The p67 enzyme is unaffected in intramolecular ligation but severely depressed in intermolecular ligation. DNA relaxation by p67 is unimpeded by camptothecin, whereas p91 is inhibited ∼16-fold by the drug. The p67 protein also differs from p91 in its cold sensitivity in both DNA cleavage and relaxation, whereas intramolecular strand ligation mediated by p67 is not subject to this temperature effect. As explained below, all of these observations can be accommodated by a model according to which residues within the N-terminal domain participate in the physicochemical steps of topoisomerization by mediating enzyme-DNA contacts either by binding DNA directly or by promoting DNA binding of other regions of the enzyme.The role of N-terminal domain in DNA binding, initially suggested by the distributive relaxation mode of p67, was further supported by nitrocellulose binding assays using double-stranded DNA targets, which demonstrated an inherent DNA binding affinity of this domain. The data are most consistent with the potential interaction site of DNA downstream of the cleavage site. Two pieces of evidence argue in favor of this interpretation: the contrasting effects of the N-terminal domain in intramolecular versus intermolecular ligation as well as the ability of p67 to carry out relaxation unimpeded by camptothecin. A similar effect on camptothecin sensitivity was recently reported for a form of human topo I lacking the linker domain (amino acids 636–712) (9Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Under the assumption that camptothecin inhibits DNA relaxation by blocking a putative controlled strand rotation step of catalysis, the interpretation of this result was that the linker domain participates in controlling rotation of the cleaved strand during topoisomerization. Under the same assumption, our results suggest that the N-terminal domain could also be important for controlling strand rotation. Thus, based on the available data, we propose that residues from both the N-terminal and the linker domain may act together to control this step of catalysis. Two N-terminal-truncated versions of human topo I encompassing amino acids 175–765 or 191–765 (9Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Bronstein I.B. Wynne-Jones A. Sukhanova A. Fleury F. Ianoul A. Holden J.A. Alix A.J. Dodson G.G. Jardillier J.C. Nabiev I. Wilkinson A.J. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 317-327PubMed Google Scholar) have previously been shown to retain camptothecin sensitivity in relaxation. In combination with our results, the region spanning residues 191 through 206 is therefore highlighted as particularly important for catalysis. Interestingly, the recently published structure of human topo I including amino acids 203–214 shows the proximal part of the N-terminal domain to be located close to the cleavage site, supporting that this area of the enzyme could interact with the rotating strand (37Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, circumstantial evidence for our general conclusions on DNA binding is provided by the presence of 13 lysine residues in the region between residues 175 and 202. In principle, the involvement of the N-terminal domain in catalysis is well substantiated alone by its apparent ability to contact DNA downstream of the cleavage site. However, the reduced DNA affinity of p67 could also, completely or in part, result from the lack of Trp205, which has recently been shown to interact with a hinge region within the core domain (37Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This interaction is believed to be important in transition between an open and a closed clamp conformation of topo I upon DNA binding. A possible reduced capacity for this conformational change in the absence of the N-terminal domain would probably result in an overall decrease in DNA binding affinity and a reduced ability to coordinate DNA contacts during the individual steps catalysis.The initially surprising observation that the p67 enzyme is almost inert in relaxation and strongly impaired in cleavage at 0 °C while retaining normal capacity for intramolecular DNA ligation is, in retrospect, not inconsistent with our interpretations. The cold sensitivity likely reflects the inability of p67 to induce conformational changes within itself and/or the DNA at low temperatures. Two non-exclusive explanations for the cold sensitivity of p67 can be hypothesized. One plausible explanation is that p67 is less flexible than the full-length enzyme due to the lack of interaction between the hinge region and Trp205, as discussed above. At low temperatures, the lack of such interaction may restrain transition of the enzyme from an open to a closed clamp conformation and thereby reduce the DNA binding affinity. Alternatively or in combination with the above, the p67 enzyme could be defective in mediating conformation changes in the DNA substrate, e.g.bending or partial unwinding of the DNA helix, which may be inherent to the process of cleavage and topoisomerization. A similar phenomenon has recently been observed for two cold-sensitive mutants of the DnaA protein from Escherichia coli (38Takata M. Guo L. Katayama T. Hase M. Seyama Y. Miki T. Sekimizu K. Microbiol. Mol. 2000; 35: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These mutants are defective in initiating DNA replication at 20 °C due to their inability to unwind the DNA double helix. At higher temperatures the free energy of the DNA is sufficient to overcome the defect of the mutants.The in vitro functions of the N-terminal domain of human topo I suggested by the present study may have important implications for the in vivo activity of the enzyme. It has been shown that topo I can be regulated via phosphorylation of residues located in the N-terminal domain (32Staron K. Samuels D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1998; 25: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 33Samuels D.S. Shimizu Y. Nakabayashi T. Shimizu N. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9418-9422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may in fact change the DNA binding properties of this domain. In addition the relaxation activity of the enzyme is regulated by a number of proteins: SV40 large T-antigen, p53, casein kinase II, PSF, nucleolin, non-histone HMG proteins, and histone H1, all of which interact with and stimulate topo I activity (34Haluska Jr., P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All interaction domains mapped so far involve the N-terminal domain of topo I (34Haluska Jr., P. Rubin E.H. Adv.

In support of the N-terminal domain importance for modulating topo I activity in vivo, band depletion experiments using camptothecin have shown that p67 is strongly impaired in cleavagein vivo, 2M. O. Christensen and C. Mielke, personal communication.suggesting a role of the N-terminal domain for interaction with DNA assembled into chromatin. Eukaryotic topoisomerase I (topo I)1 is a monomeric enzyme that plays a major role in important cellular processes by regulating the topology of DNA. The enzyme relaxes negative and positive supercoils arising as a consequence of DNA processes such as DNA transcription, replication, recombination, and chromosome condensation (1Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, topo I acts by introducing transient single-strand breaks into the DNA double helix. The catalytic cycle can be subdivided into several steps including: (i) non-covalent DNA binding, (ii) cleavage, (iii) strand rotation, (iv) religation, and (v) enzyme turnover. The cleavage and religation events constitute two reverse phosphoryl transfer (transesterification) reactions. During the cleavage reaction, an active-site tyrosine residue of the enzyme is used as a nucleophile to break a phosphodiester bond of the DNA backbone, generating a covalent enzyme-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-DNA linkage and a free 5′-hydroxyl group (2Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J.

This 5′-hydroxyl group provides the nucleophile for the religation reaction that restores intact DNA. The solved crystal structure of an N-terminal-truncated version of the human topo I together with proteolytic analyses show that the enzyme is organized into four structural domains. These consist of an N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–206), a core domain (amino acids 207–635), a linker domain (amino acids 636–712), and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 713–765) (2Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain contains the active-site tyrosine (Tyr723), which together with the catalytic residues Arg488, Lys532, Arg590, and His632 of the core domain constitutes the active site of the enzyme (4Jensen A.D.

Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Structural data show that the core and C-terminal domains form a clamp structure that wraps around the DNA and, together with the helix-turn-helix linker domain (1Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), contacts DNA in a region extending 4 base pairs upstream and 9 base pairs downstream of the cleavage site (3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Based on this structural information of the human topo I-DNA complex, a model for strand rotation (topoisomerization) has been proposed. According to this “controlled rotation” model, rotation of the cleaved strand around the intact strand is partially hindered by contacts between the rotating DNA and part of the core and linker domains (3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The involvement of the linker in controlling strand rotation has recently been supported by biochemical studies showing that the sensitivity of topo I toward camptothecin in relaxation depends on a functional linker domain (9Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The recently published crystal structure of a topo I form encompassing a few residues of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 203–214) demonstrates an interaction between Trp205 and the hinge region of the core domain (37Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This interaction has been proposed to be important for the flexibility of the enzyme clamp, allowing controlled strand rotation. Beside such speculations, the putative enzymatic function(s) of the N-terminal domain of topo I has remained unknown. Based on biochemical analyses, it is assumed to be largely unfolded or highly dynamic (2Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,10Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

Microbiol. Mol. 2000; 35: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These mutants are defective in initiating DNA replication at 20 °C due to their inability to unwind the DNA double helix. At higher temperatures the free energy of the DNA is sufficient to overcome the defect of the mutants.The in vitro functions of the N-terminal domain of human topo I suggested by the present study may have important implications for the in vivo activity of the enzyme. It has been shown that topo I can be regulated via phosphorylation of residues located in the N-terminal domain (32Staron K. Samuels D.S. Mol. Biol.

In addition the relaxation activity of the enzyme is regulated by a number of proteins: SV40 large T-antigen, p53, casein kinase II, PSF, nucleolin, non-histone HMG proteins, and histone H1, all of which interact with and stimulate topo I activity (34Haluska Jr., P.

In support of the N-terminal domain importance for modulating topo I activity in vivo, band depletion experiments using camptothecin have shown that p67 is strongly impaired in cleavagein vivo, 2M. O. Christensen and C. Mielke, personal communication.suggesting a role of the N-terminal domain for interaction with DNA assembled into chromatin. Although divergent in amino acid sequence, the N-terminal domain has been preserved through evolution as a highly basic region in all cellular type IB topoisomerases (32Staron K. Samuels D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1998; 25: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In human topo I, a number of nuclear localization sequences, phosphorylation sites, and protein interaction sites have been mapped to the N-terminal domain (11Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E.

Tazi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These diverse features are suggestive of multiple modes of topo I regulation in vivo. However, the N-terminal domain has long been thought to contribute little to the topo I enzyme activity per se. Here we describe for the first time a significant modulation of in vitro DNA relaxation mediated by residues within this domain. The salient findings from our present work may be briefly summarized as follows. In the absence of the N-terminal domain, relaxation by human topo I becomes more distributive. The p67 enzyme is unaffected in intramolecular ligation but severely depressed in intermolecular ligation. DNA relaxation by p67 is unimpeded by camptothecin, whereas p91 is inhibited ∼16-fold by the drug. The p67 protein also differs from p91 in its cold sensitivity in both DNA cleavage and relaxation, whereas intramolecular strand ligation mediated by p67 is not subject to this temperature effect. As explained below, all of these observations can be accommodated by a model according to which residues within the N-terminal domain participate in the physicochemical steps of topoisomerization by mediating enzyme-DNA contacts either by binding DNA directly or by promoting DNA binding of other regions of the enzyme. The role of N-terminal domain in DNA binding, initially suggested by the distributive relaxation mode of p67, was further supported by nitrocellulose binding assays using double-stranded DNA targets, which demonstrated an inherent DNA binding affinity of this domain. The data are most consistent with the potential interaction site of DNA downstream of the cleavage site. Two pieces of evidence argue in favor of this interpretation: the contrasting effects of the N-terminal domain in intramolecular versus intermolecular ligation as well as the ability of p67 to carry out relaxation unimpeded by camptothecin. A similar effect on camptothecin sensitivity was recently reported for a form of human topo I lacking the linker domain (amino acids 636–712) (9Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Under the assumption that camptothecin inhibits DNA relaxation by blocking a putative controlled strand rotation step of catalysis, the interpretation of this result was that the linker domain participates in controlling rotation of the cleaved strand during topoisomerization. Under the same assumption, our results suggest that the N-terminal domain could also be important for controlling strand rotation. Thus, based on the available data, we propose that residues from both the N-terminal and the linker domain may act together to control this step of catalysis. Two N-terminal-truncated versions of human topo I encompassing amino acids 175–765 or 191–765 (9Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Bronstein I.B. Wynne-Jones A. Sukhanova A. Fleury F. Ianoul A. Holden J.A. Alix A.J. Dodson G.G. Jardillier J.C. Nabiev I. Wilkinson A.J. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 317-327PubMed Google Scholar) have previously been shown to retain camptothecin sensitivity in relaxation. In combination with our results, the region spanning residues 191 through 206 is therefore highlighted as particularly important for catalysis. Interestingly, the recently published structure of human topo I including amino acids 203–214 shows the proximal part of the N-terminal domain to be located close to the cleavage site, supporting that this area of the enzyme could interact with the rotating strand (37Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, circumstantial evidence for our general conclusions on DNA binding is provided by the presence of 13 lysine residues in the region between residues 175 and 202. In principle, the involvement of the N-terminal domain in catalysis is well substantiated alone by its apparent ability to contact DNA downstream of the cleavage site. However, the reduced DNA affinity of p67 could also, completely or in part, result from the lack of Trp205, which has recently been shown to interact with a hinge region within the core domain (37Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This interaction is believed to be important in transition between an open and a closed clamp conformation of topo I upon DNA binding. A possible reduced capacity for this conformational change in the absence of the N-terminal domain would probably result in an overall decrease in DNA binding affinity and a reduced ability to coordinate DNA contacts during the individual steps catalysis. The initially surprising observation that the p67 enzyme is almost inert in relaxation and strongly impaired in cleavage at 0 °C while retaining normal capacity for intramolecular DNA ligation is, in retrospect, not inconsistent with our interpretations. The cold sensitivity likely reflects the inability of p67 to induce conformational changes within itself and/or the DNA at low temperatures. Two non-exclusive explanations for the cold sensitivity of p67 can be hypothesized. One plausible explanation is that p67 is less flexible than the full-length enzyme due to the lack of interaction between the hinge region and Trp205, as discussed above. At low temperatures, the lack of such interaction may restrain transition of the enzyme from an open to a closed clamp conformation and thereby reduce the DNA binding affinity. Alternatively or in combination with the above, the p67 enzyme could be defective in mediating conformation changes in the DNA substrate, e.g.bending or partial unwinding of the DNA helix, which may be inherent to the process of cleavage and topoisomerization. A similar phenomenon has recently been observed for two cold-sensitive mutants of the DnaA protein from Escherichia coli (38Takata M. Guo L. Katayama T. Hase M. Seyama Y. Miki T. Sekimizu K.

https://openalex.org/W2063960483,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-1, which belongs to the tolloid subgroup of astacin-like zinc metalloproteinases, cleaves the C-propeptides of procollagen at the physiologic site and is, therefore, a procollagen C-proteinase (PCP). Cleavage occurs between a specific alanine or glycine residue (depending on the procollagen chain) and an invariant aspartic acid residue in each of the three chains of procollagen. To learn more about how BMP-1 exhibits PCP activity we mapped the primary structure of BMP-1 onto the x-ray crystal structure of astacin and identified residues in the metalloproteinase domain of BMP-1 for subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies. Recombinant wild-type and mutant BMP-1 were expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed for PCP activity using type I procollagen as the substrate. We showed that substitution of alanine for Glu94, which occurs in the HEXXH zinc-binding motif of BMP-1, abolishes PCP activity. Furthermore, mutation of residues Lys87 and Lys176, which are located in the S1′ pocket of the enzyme and are therefore adjacent to the P1′ residue in the substrate, reduced the proteolytic activity of BMP-1 by ∼50%. A surprising observation was that mutation of Cys66 reduced the activity to 20%, suggesting that this residue is crucial for activity. Further experiments showed that Cys66 and Cys63, which are located in the tolloid-specific sequence Cys63-Gly64-Cys65-Cys66in the active site, most likely form a disulfide bridge.

BMP-1, also known as procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) (2Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), is fundamental to the synthesis of the extracellular matrix, because it cleaves the C-propeptides of type I, II, and III procollagen (3Hojima Y. van der Rest M.

The importance of BMP-1 in tissue assembly is exemplified in the BMP-1 knockout mouse, which dies soon after birth from failure of ventral body wall closure associated with abnormal collagen fibrillogenesis (5Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The occurrence of abnormal fibrils in affected tissues of this mouse is consistent with the persistence of partially processed procollagen molecules. In addition to its roles in cleaving procollagen, BMP-1 cleaves other extracellular matrix macromolecules including prolysyl oxidase (6Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V.

Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar), as well as embryo patterning in Drosophila (10Shimell M.J. Ferguson E.L. Childs S.R. O'Connor M.B.

For example, in vertebrates, BMP-1 cleaves chordin (an antagonist of BMP-4) during normal dorsal-ventral patterning (for review see Ref. 14Mullins M.C. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme is relevant to studies of animal development and tissue organization. Furthermore, because collagen is expressed in soft tissues such as liver and lung during progressive fibro-proliferative diseases (e.g. cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and scleroderma), which are characterized by excessive deposition of connective tissue (for review see Ref. 15Trojanowska M. LeRoy E.C. Eckes B. Krieg T. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), structure-function studies of BMP-1 are a step toward the rational design of anti-fibrotic drugs.In all the known substrates of BMP-1 the scissile bond resides between a small side-chained residue and an aspartic acid. For example, the P1 residue in chordin is serine or alanine (16Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), in procollagen it is alanine or glycine (2Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and in prolysyl oxidase it is glycine (6Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V. Gacheru S.N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7113-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the P1′ residue in these substrates is always aspartic acid. Presumably, the shape and size of the active site of BMP-1 accommodates only small residue side chains in the P1 position and a large acidic side chain in the P1′ position. An understanding of the mechanism of cleavage by BMP-1 requires a detailed knowledge of how the P1 and P1′ residues dock into the active site. In the absence of structural information of the metalloproteinase domain of BMP-1 we reasoned that a valid approach was to examine the function of individual residues by site-directed mutagenesis. This approach is made possible by the fact that the metalloproteinase domain of BMP-1 shares high sequence homology with astacin, whose x-ray crystal structure is known (17Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).The metalloproteinase domain of astacin is kidney-shaped and has two domains (at the N and C termini) that are separated by an active site cleft (18Gomis-Ruth F.X. Stöcker W. Huber R. Zwilling R. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 945-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A zinc ion sits at the bottom of the cleft and is coordinated in a trigonal-bipyramidal geometry by three histidine residues, a tyrosine residue (Tyr149), and a water molecule, which is also bound to the carboxylic acid side chain of Glu93. It has been shown for astacin that Glu93and Tyr149 are essential for catalytic activity (19Yiallouros I. Berkhoff E.G. Stöcker W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the metalloproteinase domains of astacin and BMP-1 are homologous and presumably have a similar tertiary structure, it is not obvious why BMP-1 cleaves scissile bonds between a small side chained residue and an aspartic acid.In this study we used information from the three-dimension structure of astacin, the x-ray crystal structure of astacin in complex with a transition state inhibitor (20Grams F. Dive V. Yiotakis A. Yiallouros I. Vassiliou S. Zwilling R. Bode W. Stöcker W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the primary structures of different members of the astacin family to identify residues in BMP-1 that might account for the procollagen C-proteinase activity of BMP-1. We subsequently used site-directed mutagenesis and assay of recombinant enzyme to identify specific lysyl and cysteine residues in the active site of BMP-1 that are important for PCP activity.RESULTSSequence AnalysisIn preliminary studies we performed a multiple sequence alignment of 31 members of the astacin family of metalloproteinases using MultAlin (25Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4263) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This included astacin, BMP-1, mammalian tolloid, mammalian tolloid-like-1, mammalian tolloid-like-2, and meprins. Fig. 1 contains a trimmed down version of this alignment in which only the sequences of astacin and human BMP-1 are shown. The high degree of sequence homology between the metalloproteinase domains of astacin and BMP-1, and the fact that the metalloproteinase domains are similar in size, suggests that the structure of the metalloproteinase domain of BMP-1 is similar to that of astacin (26Stöcker W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Bode W. Zwilling R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). With this information, we identified the following residues for site-directed mutagenesis studies.Glu94In astacin the active site zinc is pentacoordinated by three histidines, a unique tyrosine residue (in the Met turn), and a water molecule. The zinc-bound water is thought to be polarized for nucleophilic attack of the scissile bond by the glutamic acid residue in the consensus sequence HEXXH. In BMP-1, this glutamic acid is at amino acid position 94. To test the hypothesis that Glu94 is important for the PCP activity of BMP-1, this residue was replaced by alanine.Lys87 and Lys176It has been suggested that Lys87 and the Lys176-containing S1′ loop define the S1′ pocket of BMP-1 (26Stöcker W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Bode W. Zwilling R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Lys176-containing S1′ loop of BMP-1 is absent from astacin and non-tolloid members of the astacin family. It was an attractive idea that the positively charged side chains of these lysyl residues might bind to the acidic side chain of aspartic acid in the P1′ position of the procollagen chains.CXCC MotifOf particular interest was the anti-parallel β-strand IV (edge strand), which forms the upper edge of the active site cleft. Noteworthy, when astacin binds its substrate, the residues in the substrate N-terminal to the scissile-bound (i.e. the non-primed side) align with the β-strand IV of the enzyme, forming two or three hydrogen bonds (27Bode W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Tschesche H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It has been pointed out that the β-strand IV in BMP-1 contains three cysteine residues. Two of these, Cys63 and Cys66, might form a disulfide bond with each other (26Stöcker W. Gomis-Ruth F.X.

In astacin, the equivalent cysteine (Cys64) forms a vital disulfide bond with a non-active site cysteine (Cys84). It has been suggested that the equivalent disulfide bond in BMP-1 is formed between Cys65 and Cys85 (26Stöcker W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Bode W. Zwilling R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The strategic position of Cys63, Cys65, and Cys66 in the active site β-strand IV of BMP-1 and the proposed disulfide bond between Cys65and Cys85 made these residues good targets for site-directed mutagenesis studies of the structure and function of BMP-1.Recombinant Latent BMP-1myc Is Correctly Processed and Secreted by COS-7 CellsThe pcDNA3 vector containing the cDNA for BMP-1myc was transfected into COS-7 cells, and the conditioned culture medium and the cell lysate were analyzed by Western blotting using the 9E10 antibody (which detects the c-myc tag at the C terminus of the molecule) and the 1210 neoepitope antibody (which was raised to a peptide corresponding to the 10 residues at the N terminus of mature BMP-1). Fig. 2 shows that the 9E10 antibody detected the latent BMP-1myc in cell lysates and the mature BMP-1myc in the culture medium. The 1210 neoepitope anti-peptide antibody detected only the mature enzyme, which occurred in the culture medium and not in the cell lysate. Furthermore, the culture medium from COS-7 cells transfected with the empty vector contained no immunoreactive proteins, which shows that the endogenous levels of BMP-1 were very low. Furthermore, Western blots using the preimmune rabbit serum were blank (data not shown).Figure 2Expression and characterization of BMP-1myc in COS-7 cells. Wild-type BMP-1myc was transiently expressed in cultured COS-7 cells. After 72 h post-transfection the cells were lysed, and the proteins in the culture medium were concentrated on YM membranes. Proteins from the cell medium (M) and lysates (L) were separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE (10% separating gel) in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. BMP-1myc and BMP-1 were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) and the neoepitope 1210 antibody (1210), respectively. In control samples (pcDNA3 empty vector) COS-7 cells were transfected with the empty vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)BMP-1myc Expressed in COS-7 Cells Exhibits Procollagen C-proteinase ActivityPrevious studies had shown that the addition of the FLAG peptide at the C terminus of BMP-1 has negligible effect on the ability of the molecule to cleave procollagen (16Scott I.C.

Therefore, we anticipated that the c-myc was unlikely to influence the PCP activity of BMP-1. Nevertheless, we assayed c-myc-tagged BMP-1 for PCP activity and compared it to that of native BMP-1. Figs.3 and 4show that type I procollagen is readily cleaved by BMP-1myc. We wanted to know whether BMP-1myc cleaved procollagen at the physiological site. We used a neoepitope antibody that recognized the N-terminal 10 residues of the α1(I) chain C-propeptide. Western blot analysis showed that the antibody recognized the C-propeptides after cleavage of procollagen with recombinant BMP-1 and BMP-1myc (data not shown).Figure 3Cleavage of type I procollagen by recombinant BMP-1myc (analyzed under non-reducing conditions).

A typical result is shown in Fig. 6. The results showed that BMP-1myc was secreted into the culture medium mostly as the mature enzyme. The Cys63 and Cys65 mutants were efficiently secreted into the culture medium as both mature and latent enzymes. C66G was also secreted efficiently into the culture medium. In contrast to the other mutants studied, the C85A mutant was poorly secreted and could only be detected in the culture medium when the gel was overloaded. Cell lysates contained only the latent form of BMP-1.Figure 6Expression of wild-type and C63G, C65A, C66G, and C85A mutant BMP-1myc in COS-7 cells.

This was in agreement with the suggestion that Cys85 bonds with Cys65. However, the fact that the C65A mutant was well secreted raised the possibility that another cysteine residue could substitute for Cys65 in bonding to Cys85. The only candidates were Cys63 and Cys66. We examined the migration of the C63G and C65A mutants in SDS gels under non-reducing conditions. Fig. 7 shows that wild-type BMP-1 migrated mostly as a single band (M-SS). In comparison, the Cys63 and Cys65 mutants migrated as a slower band (M-SH). This indicated that the Cys63 and Cys65 mutant molecules have a more open conformation than the wild-type molecule.Figure 7Analysis of C63G and C65A BMP-1myc by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The migration positions of C63G and C65A mutant BMP-1myc were examined by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. BMP-1myc migrated as a fast migrating oxidized form (M-SS) and a slower migrating reduced form (M-SH) in which the oxidized form was the most abundant. The C63G and C65A mutants migrated exclusively as the slower migrating reduced form. Thefar right lane contains latent BMP-1myc, which migrates at a slower position than the reduced and oxidized form of BMP-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of Residues Important for PCP Activity: Glu94 and Cys66 Are CrucialCulture media from COS-7 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding BMP-1myc and the mutants described above was concentrated on YM30 membranes, and the levels of BMP-1myc were determined by Western blot analysis using the 9E10 antibody. The concentration of BMP-1 molecules was normalized. The preparations were then examined in assays of procollagen C-proteinase. The results are summarized in Fig.8. All the mutants exhibited reduced PCP activity. Most notably, the E94A mutant exhibited no PCP activity. This showed that Glu94 is essential for PCP activity of BMP-1. Furthermore, this result showed that endogenous levels of BMP-1 in the culture medium of COS-7 cells were below the detection limit of the assay and that nonspecific proteinases that might occur in the preparations did not interfere with the PCP assays. The Lys87 and Lys176 mutants had reduced PCP activity, and the PCP activity of the double lysine mutant was 48% of control values. The results also showed that the Cys63 and Cys65 mutants exhibited a marked reduction in PCP activity (38 and 33%, respectively). A surprising result was that the C66G mutant exhibited very low levels of PCP activity (∼20% of control).Figure 8BMP-1myc mutants exhibit decreased PCP activity. COS-7 cells were transfected with vectors encoding BMP-1myc and mutant BMP-1myc, as indicated. The proteins in the culture medium were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and the levels of BMP-1myc were quantitated by Western blot analysis using the 9E10 antibody. The PCP activity of the BMP-1myc mutants, normalized for BMP-1myc concentration, was assayed by cleavage of 14C-labeled type I procollagen. Percentage of procollagen is shown from five separate experiments (three in the case of C65A and C66G) (± S.E.). The results were normalized to the PCP activity of BMP-1myc lacking mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues in the metalloproteinase domain of BMP-1 that are important for its PCP activity. It was first necessary to establish and validate a system capable of expressing recombinant BMP-1 that exhibited PCP activity. We found that COS-7 cells efficiently expressed a cDNA clone encoding the full-length latent BMP-1 (driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter) to produce active procollagen C-proteinase. Furthermore, if these cells synthesized endogenous BMP-1, it was undetectable in assays of procollagen C-proteinase and in Western blotting analyses using a neoepitope antibody that recognizes the N terminus of mature BMP-1. The amino acid sequence within the N-terminal 10 residues of mature BMP-1 that is recognized by the 1210 antibody has not been characterized. However, because the 1210 antibody does not recognize latent BMP-1 and only recognizes the mature BMP-1, it is likely that COS-7 cells convert latent BMP-1 to mature BMP-1 at, or close to, the physiologic site. The study also showed that the introduction of the c-myc tag at the C terminus of BMP-1 did not prohibit subsequent assays of PCP activity.The results show that mature BMP-1 (lacking the prodomain) was not observed in lysates of transfected COS-7 cells. This is consistent with processing of latent BMP-1 by COS-7 cells occurring after, or during, secretion from the cells. Latent BMP-1 contains the dibasic RSRR peptide at the junction of the prodomain and the mature protein. Furin and furin-like subtilisin-related proprotein convertases are known to process a variety of protein precursors at dibasic sequences including growth factors, receptors, and matrix metalloproteinases (28Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 29Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In some experiments we noticed that latent BMP-1 was detected in the culture medium. This might have occurred when the rate of synthesis of latent BMP-1 exceeded the capacity of the BMP-1 convertase to convert all the latent BMP-1 to mature BMP-1. Nevertheless, these experiments demonstrated that, in COS-7 cells, removal of the prodomain is not a prerequisite for secretion of the protein.One of our targets in site-directed mutagenesis experiments was Glu94, which occurs in the zinc-binding consensus motif HEXXHXXGXXH. We showed that substitution of alanine for Glu94 eliminated the PCP activity of BMP-1 and confirmed that this glutamic acid residue is essential for catalytic activity of this enzyme. The observation that the culture medium of cells transfected with the E94A mutant did not contain detectable PCP activity also validated the use of COS-7 cells as a good model cell system in which to express recombinant BMP-1.By mapping the primary structure of BMP-1 onto the secondary structure of astacin, Stöcker et al. (30Stöcker W. Ng M. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10418-10425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that one side of the S1′ pocket of BMP-1 is formed from an S1′ loop containing residues 170–184. This loop contains Lys176. When this residue was mutated to alanine the PCP activity of BMP-1 was reduced by 25%, possibly because the positive charge of its side chain stabilizes the carboxylic side chain of the aspartic acid in the P1′ position of procollagen. The S1′ pocket of BMP-1 is supposedly bigger than the corresponding pocket in astacin, which explains how BMP-1 can accommodate the large polar side chain of aspartic acid in procol"

https://openalex.org/W2014292952,"Three N-terminal basic residues of Tn5 transposase, which are associated with proteolytic cleavages by Escherichia coli proteinases, were mutated to glutamine residues with the goal of producing more stable transposase molecules. Mutation of either arginine 30 or arginine 62 to glutamine produced transposase molecules that were more stable toward E. coli proteinases than the parent hyperactive Tn5 transposase, however, they were inactive in vivo. In vitro analysis revealed these mutants were inactive, because both Arg(30) and Arg(62) are required for formation of the paired ends complexes when the transposon is attached to the donor backbone. These results suggest Arg(30) and Arg(62) play critical roles in DNA binding and/or synaptic complex formation. Mutation of lysine 40 to glutamine did not increase the overall stability of the transposase to E. coli proteinases. This mutant transposase was only about 1% as active as the parent hyperactive transposase in vivo; however, it retained nearly full activity in vitro. These results suggest that lysine 40 is important for a step in the transposition mechanism that is bypassed in the in vitro assay system, such as the removal of the transposase molecule from DNA following strand transfer."

Coiled-coils consist of two to five right-handed amphipathic α-helices that wind around each other to form a slightly left-handed supercoil (1Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 2Kohn W.D. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2583-2586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The formation of a coiled-coil is dependent primarily on the presence of heptad repeat sequences of a form denoted [abcdefg] n , where positions a andd are mostly occupied by hydrophobic residues, and positionse and g are frequently filled with charged residues.The coiled-coil motif was first described as the main structural element of a large class of eukaryotic fibrous proteins such as tropomyosin (284 residues) and myosin (∼1100 residues) (3Cohen C. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of in vitro assembled smooth muscle myosin filaments revealed that they are flat side-polar sheets in which adjacent molecules overlap by ∼14 nm. A noteworthy feature of this assembly mechanism is that the packing is width-limiting but not length-limiting (4Cross R.A. Geeves M.A. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Coiled-coils are also the main structural elements in the assembly of intermediate filament proteins (IFs),1 a superfamily of 10-nm fibers ubiquitous in multicellular eukaryotes (5Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Despite the rather low primary sequence identity, all the IFs have a long and central α-helical domain (∼42 heptads), which is flanked by nonhelical end domains. The α-helical domain has the ability to form a parallel, unstaggered two-stranded coiled-coil. Formation of these dimeric structures constitutes the first step in the assembly of intermediate filaments, which proceeds further by different modes of dimer-dimer interactions (6Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic IFs readily assemble in vitro into ∼10-nm wide filaments. These structures are similar in appearance to those seen in cells (7Chou Y.H. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Unlike cytoplasmic IFs, lamins, a class of nuclear IFs, are also able to assemble into paracrystal structures under certain in vitro conditions (8Aebi U. Cohn J. Buhle L. Gerace L.

In vivo, different lamin proteins form the nuclear lamina, a thin fibrous structure immediately underlying the inner nuclear membrane of most eukaryotic cell nuclei (10Moir R.D. Spann T.P.

This small viral protein (85 residues) presumably assembles in vivo into a structure that associates with the bacterial membrane (11Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, we have proposed that the membrane-associated p1 structure functions as a scaffold to which the φ29 replisome becomes attached to initiate viral DNA replication (13Bravo A. Illana B. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the nature of p1 polymers in vivo is unknown, previous in vitro studies demonstrated that the 53-amino acid protein p1ΔN33, which retains the sequence of p1 spanning amino acids Met34 to Lys85, assembles into large polymers that show a parallel array of longitudinal protofilaments. These structures are two-dimensional protofilament sheets whose length and width depends on the polymerization time (12Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). According to computer algorithms, protein p1 as well as p1ΔN33 contains a short α-helical coiled-coil sequence (∼3 heptad repeats) (this work), suggesting that such a motif might be involved in the intermolecular interactions that lead to the formation of two-dimensional protofilament sheets. To our knowledge, coiled-coils as structural elements in the assembly of such structures have not been previously described. Negatively stained p1ΔN33 sheets examined in the electron microscope resemble polymers formed under particular in vitro conditions by FtsZ (14Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc.

Biol. 2000; 16: 89-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, unlike protein p1ΔN33 (12Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), FtsZ (∼40 kDa) and tubulin (∼50 kDa each monomer) lack a coiled-coil motif (21Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 22Löwe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Furthermore, polymerization of both proteins is regulated by GTP hydrolysis (23Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Thus, the p1ΔN33 protofilament sheets must be structurally different from those formed by FtsZ and tubulin.In this report and as an approach to understanding the assembly mechanism underlying the formation of p1ΔN33 protofilament sheets, we carried out kinetic experiments in which the p1ΔN33 assembly reaction was followed by sedimentation assays and negative-stain electron microscopy analysis. In addition, we performed a mutational analysis to examine whether the α-helical coiled-coil sequence present in protein p1ΔN33 is involved in the formation of sheet structures. Specifically, amino acid residues occupying the d position of the heptad repeats were replaced by other apolar amino acids. The results obtained indicate that a nucleation-elongation mechanism mediated by a coiled-coil sequence is involved in the formation of p1ΔN33 sheets. Furthermore, we show that a single conservative substitution within the hydrophobic core of such a coiled-coil motif is sufficient to shift the pathway of protein assembly from two-dimensional protofilament sheets to ∼10-nm-wide filaments. The α-helical coiled-coil is probably the most widespread subunit oligomerization motif found in proteins. Coiled-coils consist of two to five right-handed amphipathic α-helices that wind around each other to form a slightly left-handed supercoil (1Lupas A. Trends Biochem.

These structures are similar in appearance to those seen in cells (7Chou Y.H. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Unlike cytoplasmic IFs, lamins, a class of nuclear IFs, are also able to assemble into paracrystal structures under certain in vitro conditions (8Aebi U. Cohn J. Buhle L. Gerace L. Nature. 1986; 323: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar,9Goldman A.E. Maul G. Steinert P.M. Yang H. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3839-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In vivo, different lamin proteins form the nuclear lamina, a thin fibrous structure immediately underlying the inner nuclear membrane of most eukaryotic cell nuclei (10Moir R.D. Spann T.P. Lopez-Soler R.I. Yoon M. Goldman A.E. Khuon S. Goldman R.D. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Protein p1 from Bacillus subtilis phage φ29 has the capacity to polymerize in vitro. This small viral protein (85 residues) presumably assembles in vivo into a structure that associates with the bacterial membrane (11Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, we have proposed that the membrane-associated p1 structure functions as a scaffold to which the φ29 replisome becomes attached to initiate viral DNA replication (13Bravo A. Illana B. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5575-5584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the nature of p1 polymers in vivo is unknown, previous in vitro studies demonstrated that the 53-amino acid protein p1ΔN33, which retains the sequence of p1 spanning amino acids Met34 to Lys85, assembles into large polymers that show a parallel array of longitudinal protofilaments. These structures are two-dimensional protofilament sheets whose length and width depends on the polymerization time (12Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). According to computer algorithms, protein p1 as well as p1ΔN33 contains a short α-helical coiled-coil sequence (∼3 heptad repeats) (this work), suggesting that such a motif might be involved in the intermolecular interactions that lead to the formation of two-dimensional protofilament sheets. To our knowledge, coiled-coils as structural elements in the assembly of such structures have not been previously described. Negatively stained p1ΔN33 sheets examined in the electron microscope resemble polymers formed under particular in vitro conditions by FtsZ (14Erickson H.P. Taylor D.W. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 15Löwe J. Amos L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2364-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which forms the cytoskeletal framework for cell division in all bacteria (16Rothfield L.I. Justice S.S. Cell. 1997; 88: 581-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and by the α/β-tubulin heterodimer (17Gaskin F. Kress Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6918-6924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Baker T.S. Amos L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 86-106Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Zhang S.X. Downing K.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which is the structural subunit of the eukaryotic microtubules (20Downing K.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 89-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, unlike protein p1ΔN33 (12Bravo A. Salas M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6096-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), FtsZ (∼40 kDa) and tubulin (∼50 kDa each monomer) lack a coiled-coil motif (21Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 22Löwe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Furthermore, polymerization of both proteins is regulated by GTP hydrolysis (23Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Thus, the p1ΔN33 protofilament sheets must be structurally different from those formed by FtsZ and tubulin. In this report and as an approach to understanding the assembly mechanism underlying the formation of p1ΔN33 protofilament sheets, we carried out kinetic experiments in which the p1ΔN33 assembly reaction was followed by sedimentation assays and negative-stain electron microscopy analysis. In addition, we performed a mutational analysis to examine whether the α-helical coiled-coil sequence present in protein p1ΔN33 is involved in the formation of sheet structures. Specifically, amino acid residues occupying the d position of the heptad repeats were replaced by other apolar amino acids. The results obtained indicate that a nucleation-elongation mechanism mediated by a coiled-coil sequence is involved in the formation of p1ΔN33 sheets. Furthermore, we show that a single conservative substitution within the hydrophobic core of such a coiled-coil motif is sufficient to shift the pathway of protein assembly from two-dimensional protofilament sheets to ∼10-nm-wide filaments. We are very grateful to Dr. M. Espinosa for critical reading of the manuscript, Dr. A. Abril for helpful comments, and M. J. Vicente for help with electrospray-mass spectrometry experiments."
