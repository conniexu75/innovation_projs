Empirical evidence for this cycle of violence has been examined. Findings from a cohort study show that being abused or neglected as a child increases one's risk for delinquency, adult criminal behavior, and violent criminal behavior. However, the majority of abused and neglected children do not become delinquent, criminal, or violent. Caveats in interpreting these findings and their implications are discussed in this article."
https://openalex.org/W1973945079,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a member of a family of cell surface glycoproteins that are produced in excess in essentially all human colon carcinomas and in a high proportion of carcinomas at many other sites. The function of this widely used tumor marker and its relevance to malignant transformation is therefore of considerable interest. We demonstrate here that CEA mediates Ca2+-independent, homotypic aggregation of cultured human colon adenocarcinoma cells (LS-180) and rodent cells transfected with functional CEA cDNA. Furthermore, CEA can effect the homotypic sorting of cells in heterogeneous populations of aggregating cells. CEA can thus be considered a new addition to the family of intercellular adhesion molecules. We also show that, whereas CEA is localized mainly to epithelial cell membranes facing the lumen in normal adult intestine, it is found on adjacent cell membranes in both embryonic intestine and colonic tumors. A model for the role of CEA in the tissue architecture of adult, embryonic, and aberrant tumor intestinal epithelium is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1548863075,"A human small intestine lambda gt11 cDNA library was screened using antisera prepared against the deglycosylated protein backbone of human colon cancer xenograft mucin. Three cDNAs were isolated from this screening, designated SMUC 40-42. These cDNAs were all found to contain tandem repeats of 69 nucleotides which encoded a threonine- and proline-rich protein consensus sequence of PTTTPITTTTTVTPTPTPTGTQT. RNA blots probed with one of these cDNAs, SMUC 41, exhibited large, polydisperse hybridization bands at approximately 7,600 bases. Band intensities were strongest when human small intestine, colon, and colon cancer poly(A)+ RNA was used. In vitro translation of poly(A)+ RNA from human small intestine, colon, and colon cancer cells produced a 162,000-dalton peptide that was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to deglycosylated mucin. SMUC 41 was also used to probe DNA blots, which indicated the presence of restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the intestinal mucin gene. These findings may be important in assessing the abnormal mucins found associated with several human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1534259153,"Nonenzymatic intramolecular reactions can result in the deamidation, isomerization, and racemization of protein and peptide asparaginyl and aspartyl residues via succinimide intermediates. To understand the sequence dependence of these reactions, we measured the rate of succinimide formation in a series of synthetic peptides at pH 7.4. These peptides (Val-Tyr-Pro-X-Y-Ala) contained an internal aspartyl, asparaginyl, aspartyl beta-methyl ester, or aspartyl alpha-methyl ester residue (X) followed by a glycyl, seryl, or alanyl residue (Y). The rates of succinimide formation of the asparaginyl peptides were found to be 13.1-35.6 times faster than those of the aspartyl peptides. The rates of succinimide formation for the glycyl peptides were 6.5-17.6 times faster than those of the alanyl peptides, while the rates for the seryl peptides were 1.6-4.5 times faster than those of the alanyl peptides. The overall 232-fold range in these reaction rates for aspartyl and asparaginyl residues suggests that sequence can be an important determinant in their stability in flexible peptides. In proteins, there may be a much larger range in the rates of succinimide formation because specific conformations may greatly enhance or inhibit this reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1992704051,"A group of rats was trained to escape low-intensity shock in a shuttle-box test, while another group of yoked controls could not escape but was exposed to the same amount and regime of shock. After 1 week of training, long-term potentiation (LTP) was measured in vitro in hippocampal slices. Exposure to uncontrollable shock massively impaired LTP relative to exposure to the same amount and regime of controllable shock. These results provide evidence that controllability modulates plasticity at the cellular-neuronal level."

https://openalex.org/W1638280749,"Incubation of isolated rat liver nuclei with ATP, NAD+, and submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations resulted in extensive DNA hydrolysis. Half-maximal activity occurred with 200 nM Ca2+, and saturation of the process was observed with 1 microM Ca2+. ATP stimulated a calmodulin-dependent nuclear Ca2+ uptake system which apparently mediated endonuclease activation. Ca2+-activated DNA fragmentation was inhibited by the inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, 3-aminobenzamide, and was associated with poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear protein. The characteristics of this endonuclease activity indicate that it may be responsible for the Ca2+-dependent fragmentation of DNA involved in programmed cell death (apoptosis) and in certain forms of chemically induced cell killing."
https://openalex.org/W1551501575,"The 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (gene 5 protein) can be inactivated selectively by reactive oxygen species. Differences in the enzymatic properties between the two forms are exploited to show by a chemical screen that modification of a histidine residue reduces selectively the exonuclease activity. In vitro mutagenesis of the histidine at residue 123, and of the neighboring residues, results in varying reduction of the exonuclease activity, including mutant enzymes that have no detectable exonuclease activity; as a consequence their polymerase activity is increased up to 9-fold. T7 phage containing the mutant genes have a greatly reduced burst size and demonstrate up to a 14-fold increase in the spontaneous mutation rate."
https://openalex.org/W1623210390,"Treatment of mouse hepatoma (Hepa) cells with heme or cadmium chloride in serum-free medium causes a rapid increase in the steady-state level of heme oxygenase (HO) messenger RNA. This increase is both dose- and time-dependent. Maximum accumulation of HO mRNA is observed 3 h after addition of either agent. Treatment of Hepa cells with heme or CdCl2 also stimulates the transcription of the HO gene, as judged by in vitro nuclear transcription run-on assays. The maximum rate of HO gene transcription occurs 2 h after treatment with either agent. Comparison of the relative increase in the rate of HO gene transcription with the relative increase in the level of HO mRNA demonstrates that transcriptional activation is the primary mechanism by which heme and cadmium produce the accumulation of HO mRNA in Hepa cells. Cadmium may also influence other processes involved in the expression of HO, since the time course of mRNA accumulation diverges from that of gene transcription. However, neither heme nor cadmium alters the rate of HO mRNA degradation. Cobalt chloride and heat shock, which are potent inducers of HO mRNA in rat liver and rat C6 glioma cells, respectively, have only a small effect on the level of HO mRNA in mouse hepatoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1594287850,"Abstract Screening of a rat brain cDNA library with a radiolabeled probe made from an alpha 3 cDNA (Boulter, J., Evans, K., Goldman, D., Martin, G., Treco, D., Heinemanns, S., and Patrick, J. (1986) Nature 319, 368-374) resulted in the isolation of a clone whose sequence encodes a protein, beta 3, which is homologous (40-55% amino acid sequence identity) to previously described neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits. The encoded protein has structural features found in other nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. Two cysteine residues that correspond to cysteins 128 and 142 of the Torpedo nAChR alpha subunit are present in beta 3. Absent from beta 3 are 2 adjacent cysteine residues that correspond to cysteines 192 and 193 of the Torpedo subunit. In situ hybridization histochemistry, performed using probes derived from beta 3 cDNAs, demonstrated that the beta 3 gene is expressed in the brain. Thus, beta 3 is the fifth member of the nAChR gene family that is expressed in the brain. The pattern of beta 3 gene expression partially overlaps with that of the neuronal nAChR subunit genes alpha 3, alpha 4, or beta 2. These results lead us to propose that the beta 3 gene encodes a neuronal nAChR subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1535018103,"Toward elucidating molecular details of virus-induced membrane fusion, we have studied the low pH-triggered interaction of the bromelain-solubilized ectodomain of influenza hemagglutinin with liposomes. Polypeptide segments which insert into the apolar phase of the lipid bilayer were first labeled specifically using either of the two membrane-restricted carbene-generating reagents, 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-([125I]iodophenyl)diazirine and 1-palmitoyl-2-[11-[4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)diazirinyl]phenyl] undecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, and were then identified on the basis of cyanogen bromide and 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3'-bromoindolenine-skatole fragment analysis and Edman degradations. Here, we demonstrate that the hydrophobic interaction is mediated solely by the so-called fusion peptide which corresponds to the NH2-terminal segment of the BHA2 subunit of nature influenza hemagglutinin. Predominant sites of labeling within that segment were Phe-3, Ile-6, Phe-9, Trp-14, Met-17, and Trp-21. The average 3-4 residue spacing between consecutive labeled amino acid side chains suggests a helical structure of that segment with an amphiphilic character."
https://openalex.org/W2094984593,"In olfactory receptor neurons, odor molecules cause a depolarization that leads to action potential generation. Underlying the depolarization is an ionic current that is the earliest electrical event in the transduction process. In two preparations, olfactory receptor neurons were voltage-clamped and stimulated with odors and this generator current was measured. In addition, a method was developed to estimate the time course and absolute concentration of odorants delivered to the receptor sites. With this method, olfactory neurons were found to have relatively high stimulus thresholds, steep dose-response relations, long latencies, and an apparent requirement for cooperativity at one or more steps in the pathway from odorant binding to activation of the generator current."

https://openalex.org/W1965174422,"Using short oligoribonucleotides as ligated exon substrates, we show that splicing of the Tetrahymena rRNA group I intron is fully reversible in vitro. Incubation of ligated exon RNA with linear intron produces a molecule in which the splice site sequences of the precursor are reformed. Reversal of self-splicing is favored by high RNA concentration, high magnesium and temperature, and the absence of guanosine. 5' exon sequences that can pair with the internal guide sequence of the intron are required, whereas 3' exon sequences are not essential. Integration of the intron into ligated exon substrates that have the ability to form stem-loop structures is reduced at least one order of magnitude over short, unstructured substrates. We propose that the formation of these structures helps drive splicing in the forward direction. We also show that the Tetrahymena intron can integrate into a beta-globin transcript. This has implications for transposition of group I introns."
https://openalex.org/W1643696444,"Abstract Endothelial cells (EC) synthesize platelet-activating factor (PAF) when stimulated with agonists that bind to cell-surface receptors. We examined events that link receptor binding to synthesis of PAF by EC. Bovine EC stimulated with agonists that interact with specific cell-surface receptors accumulated PAF only in the presence of extracellular calcium. Hormonal stimulation of EC resulted in Ca2+ entry characteristic of that seen with receptor-operated calcium channels; Indo-1 measurements demonstrated that this inward flux of Ca2+ caused prolonged elevated levels of intracellular Ca2+. EC were exposed to melittin or theta toxin from Clostridium perfringens (pore-forming peptides that increase the permeability of the plasma membrane for small molecules) resulting in an inward flux of Ca2+ and accumulation of PAF. Ca2+ appears to be regulatory for PAF production at the level of phospholipase A2-mediated production of the PAF precursor 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, as Ca2+ was required for the stimulated hydrolysis of 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. PAF accumulation in EC is also regulated by protein kinase C. Pretreatment of EC with phorbol esters that activate protein kinase C or with dioctanoylglycerol, followed by stimulation, resulted in a 2-fold increase in stimulated PAF production. The regulatory effect of protein kinase C also appears to be at a phospholipase A2-mediated hydrolysis of 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine."
https://openalex.org/W1662683252,"Monoiodinated radioligands of the homologous 36-amino acid peptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peptide YY, were prepared by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with isocratic elution. [125I-Tyr1]- and [125I-Tyr36]monoiodoNPY bound equally well to a single class of high affinity binding sites on synaptosomal membranes prepared from porcine hippocampus (Kd = 1.0 X 10(-10) M) whereas iodine substitution in Tyr27, for example, partly interfered with the receptor binding. The receptors on the hippocampal membranes did not distinguish between neuropeptide Y and peptide YY either in their monoiodinated or in their unlabeled forms. Six out of twelve human neuroblastoma cell lines had high affinity binding sites for monoiodinated NPY ranging from 2 to 145 X 10(3) sites per cell. The NPY binding to three of the cell lines, SMS-MSN, SMS-KAN, and CHP-234 was of relatively high affinity (Kd = 1.3 to 6.1 X 10(-10) M), and, as in the hippocampal membranes, the long C-terminal fragment, NPY(13-36)peptide was also a relatively potent ligand for these receptors. Two other neuroblastoma cell lines, MC-IXC and CHP-212, expressed NPY receptors characterized by a lower affinity (Kd = 4.8 and 24.6 X 10(-9) M) and negligible cross-reactivity with the C-terminal fragment. It is concluded that monoiodinated radioligands of the tyrosine-rich neuropeptide Y can be prepared and that receptors for these ligands in two apparently different subtypes are found on a series of human neuroblastoma cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2049146947,"The regulation of intracellular calcium concentration in single smooth muscle cells was investigated by simultaneously monitoring electrical events at the surface membrane and calcium concentration in the cytosol. Cytosolic calcium concentration rose rapidly during an action potential or during a voltage-clamp pulse that elicited calcium current; a train of voltage-clamp pulses caused further increases in the calcium concentration up to a limit of approximately 1 microM. The decline of the calcium concentration back to resting levels occurred at rates that varied with the calcium concentration in an apparently saturable manner. Moreover, the rate of decline at any given calcium concentration was enhanced after a higher, more prolonged increase of calcium. The process responsible for this enhancement persisted for many seconds after the calcium concentration returned to resting levels. Thus, the magnitude and duration of a calcium transient appear to regulate the subsequent calcium removal."

The complete amino acid sequence of miraculin purified from miracle fruits by a newly developed method (Theerasilp, S., and Kurihara, Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11536–11539) was determined by an automatic Edman degradation method. Miraculin was a single polypeptide with 191 amino acid residues. The calculated molecular weight based on the amino acid sequence and the carbohydrate content (13.9%) was 24,600. Asn-42 and Asn-186 were linked N-glycosidically to carbohydrate chains. High homology was found between the amino acid sequences of miraculin and soybean trypsin inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W116786207,"We have examined regulation by protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) of thrombininduced inositol polyphosphate accumulation in human platelets. When platelets are exposed to thrombin for 10 s, the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine causes inositol phosphate elevations over control values of 2.7-fold (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)), 1.9-fold (inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4)), and 1.2-fold (inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate). In the same period, phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol are unaffected. The myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML-7 has no effect on inositol phosphate accumulations. Staurosporine does not inhibit Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase and 5-phosphomonoesterase activities in saponin-permeabilized platelets incubated with exogenous Ins(1,4,5)P3 unless the platelets have been exposed to thrombin and protein kinase C is consequently activated. The protein kinase C agonist β-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate increases the Vmax of the 3-kinase 1.8-fold, with little effect on Km. Our results provide strong evidence for a role for protein kinase C in regulating inositol phosphate levels in thrombin-activated platelets. We propose that endogenously activated protein kinase C removes Ins(1,4,5)P3 by stimulating both 5-phosphomonoesterase and Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase. Initial activation of phospholipase C does not appear to be affected by such protein kinase C. Inhibition of protein kinase C by staurosporine decreases 5-phosphomonoesterase activity. The resulting elevated Ins(1,4,5)P3, as substrate for Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase, promotes production of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, which also may accumulate through decreased 5-phosphomonoesterase activity and elevated Ca2+ levels. These factors apparently counteract the inhibitory effect on 3-kinase, yielding a net increase in Ins(1,3,4,5)P4."
https://openalex.org/W2015933480,"Protein engineering and x-ray crystallography have been used to study the role of a surface loop that is present in pancreatic phospholipases but is absent in snake venom phospholipases. Removal of residues 62 to 66 from porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 does not change the binding constant for micelles significantly, but it improves catalytic activity up to 16 times on micellar (zwitterionic) lecithin substrates. In contrast, the decrease in activity on negatively charged substrates is greater than fourfold. A crystallographic study of the mutant enzyme shows that the region of the deletion has a well-defined structure that differs from the structure of the wild-type enzyme. No structural changes in the active site of the enzyme were detected."
https://openalex.org/W1503965672,"The heme-sensitive eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2 alpha kinase regulates translational activity in reticulocytes by phosphorylation of the smallest subunit of eukaryotic peptide initiation factor 2, eIF-2. Highly purified preparations of the kinase contain an abundant 90-kDa polypeptide which appears to modulate the activity of the enzyme. The physical properties and structural characteristics of the reticulocyte 90-kDa peptide are similar to those of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp 90) from HeLa and other mammalian cells. The reticulocyte and HeLa cell proteins are shown to be immunologically cross-reactive. A direct comparison of the two proteins by one-dimensional peptide mapping of large peptides generated by limited proteolysis and by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis of tryptic peptides indicates that they represent the same protein species. Like the 90-kDa reticulocyte protein, HeLa cell hsp 90 causes increased eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation by the heme-sensitive kinase and is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in the reticulocyte lysate system. A potential mechanism for the latter inhibition is inferred. These results implicate hsp 90 in the regulation of protein synthesis via its interaction with and perhaps regulation of the heme-sensitive kinase and phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W49585494,"Abstract Human progesterone receptors (PR) exist as two independent naturally occurring steroid-binding forms of approximately 120 kDa (B-receptors) and 94 kDa (A-receptors). Both are phosphorylated in hormone-untreated T47Dco breast cancer cells. Hormone treatment leads to receptor transformation and an increased phosphorylation state: the 32P-labeling intensity is 3-5 times higher after progestin treatment and 8-10 times higher after RU 486 treatment. Only serine residues are phosphorylated. To determine whether there are unique phosphorylation sites in transformed nuclear PR, we analyzed the phosphopeptides of untransformed and transformed A- and B-receptors by tryptic cleavage and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Untransformed A- and B-receptors share at least five common phosphopeptides, and a sixth is unique to B. Following transformation by either R5020 or RU 486, A-receptors generate at least six and B-receptors seven phosphopeptides. Compared with untransformed PR, there are at least two different phosphopeptides in transformed nuclear PR. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of transformed nuclear A-receptors, which lack the proximal 165 amino-terminal residues of the 933 amino acid B-receptors, produces two large fragments of approximately 43 and 19 kDa. These fragments contain all of the 32P label and comprise amino acids 165-595. Cleavage of transformed B-receptors also produces peptides of 43 and 19 kDa plus an additional 36-kDa fragment corresponding to residues 1-165. No 32P-labeled low molecular mass peptides are detected. Thus, all the hormone-dependent phosphoserine residues produced in nuclei are located in the first 595 amino acids of human PR, representing the amino terminus and 28 residues of the DNA-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1514826684,"We have investigated the potential for the steroid affinity-labeled human glucocorticoid receptor to form both intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds. Glucocorticoid receptors labeled in intact HeLa S3 cells with the covalent affinity label [3H]dexamethasone mesylate ([3H]DM) were analyzed on denaturing 5-12% polyacrylamide gels under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. Under nonreducing conditions the affinity-labeled receptor migrated as a heterogeneous species having an average molecular mass of approximately 96 kDa whereas, under reducing conditions, the receptor migrated as a more discrete form. These data suggest that a reducing environment can influence the structure of the glucocorticoid receptor monomer and further imply that sulfhydryl groups within the affinity-labeled receptor are available for modification. To pursue this observation in greater detail, we tested the effect of oxidizing conditions on the structure of the glucocorticoid receptor. The presence of low concentrations (0.125-0.5 mM) of three oxidizing reagents (sodium tetrathionate, disulfiram, and iodosobenzoate) altered the migration of the affinity-labeled receptor resulting in forms of apparent lower molecular mass (as low as 78 kDa). This altered migration, not seen with most other cytosolic proteins, is consistent with the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds within the receptor which presumably cause it to assume a folded conformation and migrate faster through the gel. At higher concentrations of these reagents (up to 5.0 mM), we also detect a saturably labeled [3H]DM band which has a higher molecular mass (approximately 140 kDa), indicating the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between the [3H]DM-labeled receptor and another closely associated protein(s) having a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa. The effects which these oxidizing reagents have on glucocorticoid receptor structure are completely reversed upon the addition of dithiothreitol, indicating that the observed changes in migration do not reflect receptor proteolysis but rather a folding and unfolding within the receptor monomeric protein. We have also analyzed the effect of this oxidation/reduction on the function of the glucocorticoid receptor. Oxidation of the [3H]DM-labeled receptor complex with 0.5 mM sodium tetrathionate inhibited activation of receptor to a form capable of binding to DNA-cellulose. This inhibition can be reversed with dithiothreitol at 25 degrees C but not at 0 degrees C, suggesting that these oxidizing reagents are inhibitory at the transformation and/or activation steps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1563156812,"Abstract The structures of genes 15 alpha OH-1 and 15 alpha OH-2, within the mouse steroid 15 alpha-hydroxylase (P-450(15) alpha) family were determined. Genes 15 alpha OH-1 and -2 encoded mouse Type I and II P-450(15) alpha, respectively (Squires, E.J., and Negishi, M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 4166-4171). The two genes, which spanned approximately 8 kilobase pairs of total length, showed nearly identical structures and were divided into nine exons at the same positions. A high nucleotide sequence homology (greater than 96%) indicated that 15 alpha OH-1 and -2 were duplicated within 5 million years. The two major transcription start sites were located at 14 and 24 base pairs (bp) upstream from the initiation Met in both genes. No tissue-specific difference in 15 alpha OH-1 and -2 transcriptional start sites was found in mouse liver and kidney. Both 15 alpha OH-1 and -2 had TATA and CAAT boxes at 30 and 100 bp, respectively, upstream from their major transcription start sites. A glucocorticoid regulatory element was present at 336 bp upstream from the start site in both genes. In addition to these motifs, 15 alpha OH-2 had an SV40 enhancer core sequence immediately downstream from its CAAT box. There were only 11 substitutions between Type I and II P-450(15) alpha in their 494-amino acid residues. Type I cDNA-transfected cell homogenates had testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase activity at approximately 9 pmol/min/mg protein. Type I also catalyzed progesterone and androstenedione 15 alpha-hydroxylase activities. Type II, on the other hand, exhibited little activity toward these steroids. The results indicated that Type I was the major steroid 15 alpha-hydroxylase. The differential 15 alpha OH-1 expression, therefore, determined the sexual dimorphism of the tissue-specific 15 alpha-hydroxylase activity in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1492871881,"Abstract While a role has been ascribed to the gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues in vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins and the enzyme catalyzing this posttranslational modification has been identified and partially characterized, both the functional significance of a second posttranslationally synthesized amino acid found in these proteins, beta-hydroxyaspartate (Hya), and the aspartyl beta-hydroxylating enzyme remain to be determined. We now report that inhibitors of 2-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, such as dipyridyl, o-phenanthroline, and pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylate, block hydroxylation of Asp64 in recombinant factor IX molecules produced in three different mammalian expression systems. This hydroxylation was not inhibited by the specific copper chelators 2,9-dimethylphenanthroline or D-penicillamine. The Gla levels in these proteins were unaffected by these compounds and demonstrate that carboxylation proceeds independently of hydroxylation. Using these Hya-deficient recombinant factor IX molecules we demonstrate that this residue does not play a significant role in factor IX binding to endothelial cells under equilibrium conditions. From additional binding studies we have concluded that the Gla domain of factor IX is a major cell binding domain of factor IX. Furthermore, in contrast to studies demonstrating a marked loss of one-stage clotting activity in recombinant factors IX following site-directed mutations of Asp64 to neutral or basic residues (Rees, D. J. G., Jones, I. M., Handford, P. A., Walter, S. J., Esnouf, M. P., Smith, K. J., and Brownlee, G. J. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 2053-2061), we have not found a decrease of one-stage clotting activity with Hya-deficient factor IX. Hya-deficient proteins produced in this manner may prove to be more appropriate to elucidate the function of Hya than those produced by site-directed mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1507606583,"Eye lens senile cataract is a major cause of blindness, affecting the elderly in particular. The etiology of the disorder has been elusive, and attempts to delay the onset of senile cataracts have been unsuccessful. The need for more information is underscored by epidemiologists who estimate that the ability to delay cataract formation in humans by only 10 years would eliminate the need for 50% of the cataract extractions performed annually in the United States. The Emory mouse provides the best model for human senile cataracts. Feeding Emory mice a diet that was restricted in calories by approximately 21% delayed the onset of cataracts. This is the first study that demonstrates in vivo the delay of senile-type cataracts. In these animals, aging and cataracts are associated with diverse changes in the proportion of various proteins (particularly 21, 22, 31-34 kDa) and with transformation of proteins from a soluble to an insoluble state. In advanced cataracts, there is a loss of total protein. Within a cataract grade, there is no difference between restricted and nonrestricted animals in relative proportion of specific lens proteins or in amounts of total or soluble proteins. The transition from a clear to cataractous lens appears when the soluble-to-total protein ratio falls below about 0.58. The exclusive use of γ-crystallin as an indicator of lens viability is questioned. To the extent that cataract formation is due to lens protein oxidation and/or an inability to proteolytically remove damaged protein, it would appear that caloric restriction results in enhanced protection against lens oxidative stress or in prolonged proteolytic function.—Taylor, A.; Zuliani, A. M.; Hopkins, R. E.; Dallal, G. E.; Treglia, P.; Kuck, J. F. R.; Kuck, K. Moderate caloric restriction delays cataract formation in the Emory mouse. FASEB J. 3: 1741-1746; 1989."
https://openalex.org/W1605570908,"Abstract The glucocorticoid receptor is present in cytosol prepared from cell extracts of nonhormone-treated cells as a large nonactivated (i.e. non-DNA binding) 9 S heteromeric complex which contains the Mr approximately 90,000 heat shock protein, hsp90. hsp90 is expressed under physiological conditions in mammalian cells and is also present in reticulocyte lysate, as assessed by Western immunoblotting using specific anti-hsp90 antibodies. We have translated glucocorticoid receptor mRNA in reticulocyte lysates. The receptor synthesized under cell-free conditions also interacts with hsp90 both in the presence and absence of ligand, as determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The in vitro synthesized glucocorticoid receptor does not bind to DNA-cellulose but can be converted to a DNA binding form following labeling with dexamethasone and heat treatment. Thus, the glucocorticoid receptor is synthesized in a nonactivated form under cell-free conditions. These data indicate that the 9 S glucocorticoid receptor complex found in cytosol does not represent an artifact due to cell homogenization and supports the existence in vivo of the glucocorticoid receptor-hsp90 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1984466049,"We have determined the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of mouse α2 (IV) collagen which is 1707 amino acids long. The primary structure includes a putative 28-residue signal peptide and contains three distinct domains: 1) the 7 S domain (residues 29–171), which contains 5 cysteine and 8 lysine residues, is involved in the cross-linking and assembly of four collagen IV molecules; 2) the triple-helical domain (residues 172–1480), which has 24 sequence interruptions in the Gly-X-Y repeat up to 24 residues in length; and 3) the NC1 domain (residues 1481–1707), which is involved in the end-to-end assembly of collagen IV and is the most highly conserved domain of the protein. Alignment of the primary structure of the α2(IV) chain with that of the α1(IV) chain reported in the accompanying paper (Muthukumaran, G., Blumberg, B., and Kurkinen, M. (1989) J. Biol.

The proposed alignment is consistent with the physical data on the length and flexibility of collagen IV."
https://openalex.org/W1588048995,"We have determined the complete amino acid sequence of Mirabilis antiviral protein (MAP). MAP is composed of 250 amino acids having a combined molecular weight of 27,833 and contains 23 lysine residues and 7 arginine residues. The amino acid sequence of MAP has 24% homology with the Ricin D-A chain. To carry out systematic structure-function studies of MAP, we have accomplished the total synthesis of its gene. We designed a synthetic MAP gene containing 12 unique restriction sites that were on the average 65 base pairs apart. Thirty synthetic oligonucleotides were enzymatically joined to form DNA duplexes. These were strategically synthesized to have EcoRI and HindIII cohesive ends and were cloned in pUC19. Nine blocks of the synthetic fragments were assembled in pUC19 to form the MAP gene consisting of 759 base pairs. The correctness of the connecting reactions was confirmed by step-wise sequencing of each assembled fragment as well as the total gene. When expressed under control of the tac promoter in Escherichia coli, the synthetic gene gave a protein similar to the native MAP. This was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1678156835,"Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 contains an active-site arginine residue involved in binding the free carboxylate of substrate peptides and inhibitors. This arginine reacts rapidly with [14C]phenylglyoxal, and its reaction is selectively blocked by the presence of either the substrate Met5-enkephalin, the competitive inhibitor phenylalanylalanine, or the transition state analog phosphoramidon. The phenylglyoxal-modified peptide was isolated by a procedure involving limited digestion by trypsin, separation of the tryptic peptides by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), further digestion of the modified peptide by pepsin, and a final purification by HPLC. By this procedure arginine 102 was identified as the active-site arginine. Verification of this finding came from the use of site-directed mutagenesis in which this arginine was replaced by glutamine. Both the mutant and wild-type enzyme reacted equally well with an amide containing substrate, glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide. However, reaction of the mutant enzyme with a substrate containing a free COOH-terminal carboxylate, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-D-Ala-Gly-(NO2)Phe-Gly, was barely detectable with the mutant enzyme. Similarly the mutant enzyme showed a loss of selectivity in inhibition by D-Ala2-Met5-enkephalin compared to the corresponding amide but exhibited no difference in the maximal velocity for hydrolysis of D-Ala2-Met5-enkephalin and its amide."

https://openalex.org/W1515073440,"The involvement of protein kinase C in the regulation of Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport was investigated in cultured HT29 human colonic adenocarcinoma cells. We have demonstrated previously the presence of a Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport pathway in HT29 cells (Kim, H.D., Tsai, Y-S., Franklin, C.C., and Turner, J.T. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 946, 397-404). Treatment of cells with the phorbol esters phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) caused an increase in membrane-associated protein kinase C activity that was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in cytosolic protein kinase C activity. PMA also produced a rapid transient increase in cotransport to 137% of control values by 5 min followed by a progressive decrease to 19% of control values by 2 h. To determine the underlying mechanism for the reduction in Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport, changes in cotransporter number and/or affinity were determined in radioligand binding studies using [3H]bumetanide. PMA and PDBu produced essentially identical time- and dose-dependent decreases in specific [3H]bumetanide binding that were similar to the observed decreases in cotransport. Analysis of saturation and competition binding data indicated that the decrease in binding was due to a lowered Bmax with no change in affinity. Both the decrease in binding and the changes in cotransport elicited by PMA were prevented by the protein kinase inhibitor H7. These findings suggest that phorbol esters cause a decrease in the number of cotransporters in HT29 cells, resulting in a reduction in Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport activity."
https://openalex.org/W2068956438,"Developing Retzius (Rz) neurons in different segments of the central nervous system of the medicinal leech have different peripheral targets: Rz cells in standard segments innervate the body wall, whereas Rz cells in the reproductive segments innervate reproductive tissue. Early removal of reproductive tissue primordia causes reproductive Rz cells to develop morphologically like their standard segmental homologs, suggesting that Rz cells depend on peripheral targets for signals that determine their central and peripheral morphology. Furthermore, after removal of reproductive tissue, reproductive Rz cells also receive synaptic inputs normally appropriate for standard Rz cells. These results suggest that the functional identity of these neurons is specified by the target they contact during embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2125151736,"Abstract Nitrimyoglobin was formed in greater than 94% yield by a simple reaction between excess nitrite and horse heart metmyoglobin at pH 5.5. This dark green pigment was shown by 1H NMR spectroscopy to be a single, pure product with a well defined tertiary structure that is highly similar to the starting myoglobin. Electronic spin states parallel those of myoglobin, although the relaxation times differ. Ligand binding reactions of nitrimyoglobin parallel those of normal myoglobin, but lead to a unique series of UV-visible spectra. In the ferrous state, nitrimyoglobin reversibly binds O2 with half-saturation of sites at an O2 partial pressure of 10.4 +/- 1.4 mm Hg. 1H NMR data indicate that the altered heme of nitrimyoglobin has not undergone reaction at any meso proton position, nor has it been partially saturated to the level of a chlorin. 15N NMR spectra indicate that only a single nitrogen was added to the protein as a nitro group. Extraction of the modified heme from nitrimyoglobin and spectroscopic characterization of the nitriheme by infrared spectroscopy and of the free base porphyrin methyl ester derived from nitriheme by 1H NMR indicate that the modification is regiospecific. The heme in nitrimyoglobin is 3-(trans-2-nitrovinyl)-2,7,12,18-tetramethyl-8-vinylporphyrin-13,1 7-dipropionic acid. In the Fisher nomenclature scheme, the 2-vinyl substituent is the site of modification and has been converted to a nitrovinyl group by substitution of a proton by -NO2."
https://openalex.org/W1578633979,"24(R,S),25-Iminolanosterol (IL) and triparanol added to cultures of rat hepatoma cells, H4-II-C3 (H4), interrupt the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol and, depending on their concentrations, cause the accumulation in the cells of intermediates in the lanosterol to cholesterol conversion. At 45 microM, both substances cause the accumulation of 5 alpha-cholesta-8(9),24-dien-3 beta-ol (zymosterol), and at the low concentration of 4.5 microM, they cause the accumulation of cholesta-5.24-dien-3 beta-ol (desmosterol). The effect of intermediate concentrations of 9 or 22.5 microM of either substance is to cause the accumulation in the cells of three sterols: cholesta-5,7,24-trien-3 beta-ol, zymosterol, and desmosterol. The synthesis of these intermediary sterols, not found normally in H4 cells, is particularly pronounced in cultures kept in lipid-depleted media that contain the inhibitors and proceeds by the use of endogenous substrates at the expense of cholesterol. The synthesis of cholesterol from [14C]acetate or [2-14C]mevalonate is completely blocked by either inhibitor even at 4.5 microM. IL or triparanol inhibits the growth of H4 cells. Cells seeded into either full growth or lipid-depleted medium containing 22.5 microM IL will not grow unless the media are supplemented with low density lipoproteins (60 micrograms/ml). Supplementation of the media with 4.6 mM mevalonate does not counteract the inhibitory effect of IL on cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1558352148,"This study attempted to characterize proteins cross-linked to DNA of Yoshida lymphosarcoma cells treated with methylene dimethanesulfonate (MDMS) and its hydrolytic products formaldehyde (HCHO) and methanesulfonic acid (MSA). MDMS and HCHO treatments produced a similar extent and type of DNA-protein cross-linking in Yoshida lymphosarcoma cells. All five major histones (H1, H2a, H2b, H3, and H4) were among the nuclear proteins cross-linked to DNA. Certain discrete differences were also apparent in these studies. MDMS cross-linked proteins of 29 and 48 kDa to DNA that were not observed following HCHO treatment alone, and HCHO cross-linked a 26-kDa protein to DNA that was not observed following MDMS treatment. Because semicarbazide prevented all MDMS-induced DNA-protein cross-linking, HCHO must be the component responsible for this lesion. The 26-kDa protein has been identified as an H4-H2b dimer. The formation of this dimer is particularly sensitive to MSA release on hydrolysis of MDMS because, in the presence of MSA, HCHO preferentially cross-linked an H2a-H2b dimer and a 48-kDa non-histone protein to DNA. Differences in DNA-protein cross-linking between these two agents are therefore proposed to arise from discrete changes in chromatin structure induced directly by MSA release."
https://openalex.org/W1604251182,"Sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents are known to inactivate the NAD glycohydrolase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities of the S1 subunit of pertussis toxin, a protein which contains two cysteines at positions 41 and 200. It has been proposed that NAD can retard alkylation of one of the two cysteines of this protein (Kaslow, H.R., and Lesikar, D.D. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 4397-4402). We now report that NAD retards the ability of these alkylating reagents to inactivate the S1 subunit. In order to determine which cysteine is protected by NAD, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct analogs of the toxin with serines at positions 41 and/or 200. Sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents reduced the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the analog with a single cysteine at position 41; NAD retarded this inactivation. In contrast, sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents did not inactivate analogs with serine at position 41. An analog with alanine at position 41 possessed substantial ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. We conclude that alkylation of cysteine 41, and not cysteine 200, inactivates the S1 subunit of pertussis toxin, but that the sulfhydryl group of cysteine 41 is not essential for the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the toxin. These results suggest that the region near cysteine 41 contributes to features of the S1 subunit important for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that changing aspartate 34 to asparagine, arginine 39 to lysine, and glutamine 42 to glutamate had little effect on ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. However, substituting an asparagine for the histidine at position 35 markedly decreased, but did not eliminate, ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Chou-Fasman analysis predicted no significant modifications in secondary structure of the S1 peptide with the change of histidine 35 to asparagine. Thus, histidine 35 may interact with a substrate of the S1 subunit without being essential for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1538580329,"Abstract X-ray absorption spectroscopy has been used to investigate the local environment of the copper sites in bovine dopamine beta-hydroylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine in the adrenal medulla and noradrenergic nerve cells. The marked similarity of the x-ray absorption edge features of the oxidized and ascorbate-reduced forms of the enzyme with those of the corresponding Cu(imidazole)4 complexes suggests that the ligation in both cases is very similar. Furthermore, this similarity is found for the extended x-ray absorption fine structure data, and analysis shows only nitrogen (or oxygen) ligation for both enzyme forms. Thus, four nitrogen atoms provide the best fit to the data at an average distance of 1.97 +/- 0.02 A for the oxidized enzyme and four nitrogen atoms at 2.05 +/- 0.02 A for the ascorbate-reduced form. The present data analysis also indicates that there is little change in the average copper ligand environment upon reduction of the enzyme-bound copper from Cu(II) to the Cu(I). The data for the oxidized form of the enzyme are in agreement with previous spin-echo EPR experiments that show three to four imidazole nitrogen ligands for each copper (McCracken, J., Desai, P. R., Papadopoulos, N. J., Villafranca, J. J., and Peisach, J. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 4133-4137). In addition, the data do not indicate the presence of any heavy atom (sulfur or chlorine) ligation to the ascorbate-reduced form of the enzyme as reported by Scott et al. (Scott, R. A., Sullivan, R. J., DeWolf, W. E., Jr., Dolle, R. E., and Kruse, L. I. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 5411-5417)."
https://openalex.org/W1601968817,"Abstract A growth inhibitory protein named inhibitory diffusible factor 45 (IDF45) has been purified to homogeneity from medium conditioned by dense cultures of mouse 3T3 cells. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of fast protein liquid chromatography-purified bioactive material showed a single band corresponding to a protein of 45 kDa. The molecule is a monomer. The pI of the molecule, as determined by isoelectric focusing, is about 6.5. The amino-terminal sequence of the protein was established as Ser-Ala-Gly-Ala-Val-Gly-Ala-Gly-Pro-Val-Val-Arg. The protein inhibits DNA synthesis in chicken embryo fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (ED50: 40 ng/ml, approximately 1 nM). The chemical properties of IDF45, i.e. molecular weight and amino-terminal sequence, clearly distinguish it from other known growth inhibitory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1517881419,"Abstract Isolated and highly purified mitochondria from rat liver were incubated with [1-14C]myristate, solubilized in boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate, and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Six to eight protein bands were found to be radioactively labeled. If the mitochondria were heated for 5 min at 95 degrees C prior to incubation with this fatty acid, no labeling was observed. By preexposing the mitochondria to unlabeled fatty acids of varying chain lengths, the extent of labeling by [1-14C]myristate was reduced in a chain length-dependent manner, exhibiting maximal inhibition at lauric acid. Reversibility of the labeling was demonstrated by chasing the incorporated radioactivity with unlabeled fatty acids of varying chain length, resulting in a maximal displacement of the tracer again by lauric acid. Fractionation of the labeled mitochondria into mitochondrial matrix and inner mitochondrial membrane components before or after labeling showed that the modified proteins are located inside the inner mitochondrial membrane. In both cases, the pattern of labeling was different from the one observed with intact mitochondria. The labeled bands in the gel were sensitive to alkaline methanol or hydroxylamine treatment. The radioactivity recovered after this treatment co-migrated with myristic acid on thin layer chromatography plates. The chain length specificity and the rapid reversibility of the observed acylation argue for a new type of reaction, different from the acylation observed in whole cells. The possible involvement of the acylated proteins in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1489435666,"Abstract Two forms of calbindin-D9k have sometimes been observed within a single tissue. Sequencing of these proteins has been complicated by the presence of blocked amino termini. Tandem mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for comparing related proteins, and its use does not depend upon an unblocked amino terminus. In the present studies, calbindin-D9k was purified from the intestines of mice (270 animals per purification) by use of gel permeation chromatography and two preparative electrophoresis steps in the presence and absence of EDTA. The purified protein appeared to be homogeneous following electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, but two components were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Two forms of the protein were isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. In each of three preparations, the average ratio of the major:minor isoforms was 2:1. The major form contained 77 amino acids and lacked the amino-terminal serine found in 78-amino acid calbindins from rat and pig. The amino acid sequence was identical with the deduced sequence reported for rat intestinal calbindin-D9k in 73 of 77 positions. In the minor form, a glutamine was found in a location between Lys-43 and Ala-44 of the major form and between the two calcium binding sites of the protein. The minor form was otherwise identical with the major form, including the presence of a blocked amino terminus. The inserted glutamine was located at the site of an intron in the rat calbindin gene, suggesting the possibility that alternative splicing produced the two forms of calbindin-D9k. The functional significance of an inserted amino acid between the two calcium binding sites remains to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W1550276088,"Abstract The precursor protein of pig mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (pre-mAspAT) contains a 29-residue presequence (Joh, T., Nomiyama, H., Maeda, S., Shimada, K., and Morino, Y. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 1-5). Pre-mAspAT produced in an in vitro transcription and translation system was avidly imported into pig and rat liver mitochondria to be processed to the mature form of the enzyme. The pre-mAspAT was also processed to the mature form upon incubation with mitochondrial extracts. We synthesized precursor proteins with alterations within the presequence and compared quantitatively the effects of these mutations on the rates of both import and processing. Single and multiple substitutions of four basic residues with neutral amino acids at positions 5, 8, 18, and 28 showed that each residue contributes differentially to import and processing. Substitutions of His5 and Arg8 with glycines abolished the import activity but did not appreciably affect the rate of processing. Substitution of Arg28 with leucine at the position adjacent to the cleavage site seriously impaired the processing without appreciably affecting the rate of import. Analysis of deletions revealed that the amino-terminal region from position 2 to 8 was essential for both the import and processing. Thus the positive charges in the amino-terminal region are critical for import while the amino-terminal peptide segment and the cleavage site region appear to be requisite for recognition by a processing protease."
https://openalex.org/W1524998796,"Previous studies of chromatin melting had been done at low salt concentrations to maintain optically clear solutions permitting observation of hyperchromic effects that accompany the unstacking of bases in DNA. Scanning calorimetry does not require clear solutions and so allowed more nearly physiological levels of salt to be used in the present work. HeLa chromatin went through two major structural transitions of 73 and 85 degrees C in 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2. Proteinase K treatment eliminated the 73 degrees C transition without affecting the other one. DNase I digestion eliminated the 85 degrees C transition and shifted the other from 73 to 58 degrees C. Supported by previous reports that salt concentrations like these would largely eliminate the effect of histones on the Tm of DNA, the present observations indicate that the collapse of the core histone complex occurs at 73-76 degrees C (transition II) and the nucleosomal DNA unstacks at 85-87 degrees C (transition III). They also show that the thermal stability of the histone octamer is enhanced by the DNA folded around it in the nucleosome; although the histone core raises the Tm of the DNA in low salt, in physiological salt conditions it is the DNA that stabilizes the protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W1599044256,"Abstract The apo very low density lipoprotein II (apoVLDLII) gene is dormant in embryos, chicks, and roosters but can be activated by estrogen. ApoVLDLII mRNA is relatively stable in estrogen-treated birds. However, its stability decreases 4-5-fold following withdrawal of hormone. We have characterized degradative intermediates of apoVLDLII mRNA detected in liver total RNA from estrogen-treated birds and searched for alterations in the pattern of intermediates that occur upon hormone-withdrawal. Primer extension and S1 nuclease analyses have demonstrated that these intermediates consist of fragments of the molecule with intact 5' ends but which lack various 3' regions. Estrogen withdrawal results in a decrease in the steady state levels of several of these intermediates and the detection of two new species. The end points of the major fragments present in RNA from both estrogen-treated and withdrawn birds all map in, or within four nucleotides of, the tetranucleotide, GAUG. The two fragments detected only in RNA from withdrawn birds have 3' ends that immediately precede the sequence, CAGU. Based on secondary structures predicted by a global folding program, the end points also appear to be preferentially located in, or at the base of, internal bulge-loops."
https://openalex.org/W1587395915,"Abstract We have examined the carbohydrate structure of thyrotropin (TSH) secreted in vitro by pituitaries from prenatal, perinatal, and mature rats using concanavalin A (ConA)-agarose chromatography and anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). [3H]Glucosamine-labeled TSH was immuno-precipitated and treated with either Pronase to generate glycopeptides or a mixture of endo-beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase F and peptide:N-glycosidase F to release oligosaccharides. The percentage of secreted TSH glycopeptides not bound to ConA was greater in mature animals (47 +/- 3%) than in either prenatal (29 +/- 3%) or perinatal animals (29 +/- 6%), suggesting more multiantennary oligosaccharides in the older animals. These structural changes were characterized further by performing anion-exchange HPLC on released oligosaccharides. Secreted TSH from prenatal rats predominantly contained oligosaccharides with 1 and 2 negative charges, while TSH from mature rats contained these structures as well as 15% with 3 negative charges. In addition, the ratio of sialylated to sulfated oligosaccharides was greater in mature compared to prenatal animals for species with 1 negative charge (1.9-fold) as well as for species with 2 negative charges (4.3-fold). We also correlated the structural alterations noted by ConA analysis with anion-exchange HPLC. Oligosaccharides that bound to ConA and were eluted with alpha-methylglucoside, when analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC, consisted of species with 1 and 2 negative charges, whereas oligosaccharides that were unbound to ConA were predominantly species with three negative charges. Together, these data suggest that with maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis secreted TSH contains more negatively charged multiantennary oligosaccharides with increased sialylation and decreased sulfation."

https://openalex.org/W1532834948,"Abstract Using the avidin-biotinyl glycan system reported previously (Shao, M.-C., and Wold, F. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2968-2972), we have compared the processing efficiency of oviduct enzymes acting on different glycan-(biotinyl)Asn and glycan-(6-biotinamidohexanoyl)Asn derivatives when they are free and bound to avidin. The glycans were selected to permit exploration of the individual processing steps, and the two different groups of derivatives were used to assess both the close (biotinyl) and more distal (biotinamidohexanoyl) display of the glycan relative to the avidin surface. The direct comparison of the free and avidin-bound glycans demonstrated that mannosidase I is strongly inhibited by avidin in both the close and distal complexes, whereas GlcNAc transferase I and mannosidase II are strongly inhibited only in the close complex. GlcNAc transferases III, IV, and V, which could only be assessed individually by indirect means using different substrates, did not appear to be affected in any major way by the protein matrix; the data suggest that transferase III is inhibited only to a minor extent in the close complex. Gal transferase activity showed a minor effect of the avidin matrix for both complexes in the hybrid processing pathways. The most significant consequence of the avidin effect on Gal transferase was the apparent abolishment of the incorporation of a 2nd Gal residue in the two avidin complexes. This survey of the protein matrix effects on glycan processing by oviduct enzymes appears to provide reasonable clues to the origin of the very different glycan structures observed in oviduct-processed glycoproteins. Thus, ovalbumin and avidin itself, containing a mixture of oligomannose and hybrid glycans at their single glycosylation sites, may well present they glycans to the processing enzymes in a display very similar to that of the avidin close complex observed here. The inhibition of mannosidase I and GlcNAc transferase I lead to preservation of oligomannose structures, whereas the strong inhibition of mannosidase II favors the incorporation of the bisecting GlcNAc by GlcNAc transferase III to yield hybrid structures as the most processed products. Ovomucoid, which contains multiantennary complex structures at all glycosylation sites, may on the other hand display its glycans, unencumbered by the protein surface, in conformations similar to either the free glycans or the distal complexes observed in this work."
https://openalex.org/W1558759791,"The effect of subcutaneous beta-estradiol injection on liver phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol transfer activity of immature chicken has been determined. The estrogen administration significantly enhanced the transfer activity of both phosphatidylcholine (100%), phosphatidylethanolamine (160%), and phosphatidylinositol (150%). In vivo experiments revealed that the hormone-induced changes in liver lipid transfer activity were sensitive to a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. A partial characterization of liver protein transfer on Sephacryl S-200 showed that multiple transfer proteins are involved in the beta-estradiol effect. This is the first time that hormonal modulation of phospholipid transfer activities is described, and the results suggest that the hepatic phospholipid transfer activities might be involved in the biosynthesis of plasma lipoproteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1588639335,"Abstract A mutant of the Escherichia coli lactose repressor (BG124) in which serine at position 77 is replaced by leucine has been examined by physical methods. Consistent with the phenotypic character of this i-d mutant, BG124 protein did not bind lactose operator specifically, but did bind to DNA nonspecifically. Titration with inducer monitoring tryptophan fluorescence changes yielded a biphasic saturation curve, and Scatchard and Hill plots of the fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis data demonstrated heterogeneity of inducer binding sites. Although ultraviolet difference spectra and potassium iodide quenching of fluorescence indicated that BG124 repressor has structural distinctions from wild-type protein, circular dichroism spectra and acrylamide quenching of fluorescence for the two proteins were quite similar. A significantly greater increase of 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate fluorescence was observed in the presence of mutant versus wild-type repressor. Unlike wild-type behavior, changes in both 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate fluorescence intensity and maximum emission wavelength in response to inducer were found for the BG124 protein. These results are consistent with conformational alterations in the interface between NH2-terminal and core domains of this mutant repressor. The single amino acid alteration in the hinge between the core and NH2 terminus yields conformational effects which influence physical and functional properties associated with both domains."
