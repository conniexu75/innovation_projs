These programs range in scope from direct food aid to foreign market development to technical assistance. USDAâ€™s largest responsibility concerning Africa is the administration of the Public Law 480 (P.L. 480) programs in conjunction with the Agency for International Development. In Fiscal Year 1976, USDA spent or helped manage the spending of $349,524,000 in Africa, of which $345,063,000 fell under P.L. 480. Because the P.L. 480 programs are so extensive, and are funded with money appropriated to AID, they are discussed in their own separate section. In this section, USDA programs, aside from P.L. 480, are reviewed."

Striking results were obtained with a crude extract of baker's yeast (containing 3.7 [tg Be per cc in conjugated form) from which 0.2 cc plasma liberated 0.7 [tg folic acid in 1 hr at 370 C. Additional evidence of the enzymatic role of plasma is offered by the use, as substrate, of pure crystalline vitamin B, conjugate,2 which gives identical results."
