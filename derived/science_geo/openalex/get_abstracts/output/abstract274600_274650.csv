https://openalex.org/W2066303036,"No more than 5% of the land area worldwide is being set aside for the protection of nature, and there is little evidence that much tropical biodiversity will survive outside of well-managed reserves. Many international development and conservation organizations recommend that at least 10% of territory be protected, though ecologists generally concur that at least 50% of all species will soon be lost if 90% of the habitat is seriously disrupted. Current policies, therefore, are a prescription for a massive loss of biodiversity."

https://openalex.org/W2043519028,"Many facts of paleontology and biogeography (1, 2) indicate that the Old and New Worlds have sometimes been connected by a continuous land route that extended from Alaska across the present shallow floors of the Bering and Chukchi seas (Fig. 1) to Siberia. Recent geologic studies in western Alaska permit a more detailed consideration of the times at which the land bridge existed during the last 50 million years of Tertiary and Quaternary time. Some wellfounded inferences can also be drawn concerning the climate and vegetation that prevailed on the land bridge during the last (Wisconsin) glacial interval, the most recent period during which the land bridge existed (3)."
https://openalex.org/W2063489439,"An assemblage of structurally and organically well preserved microorganisms, interpreted as both green and blue-green algae, has been found in chert facies of the Bitter Springs limestone from the upper Precambrian of central Australia. This appears to be the earliest known occurrence of green algae in the fossil record. These organisms are among the oldest known multicellular and unicellular fossils exhibiting distinct histological preservation."
https://openalex.org/W2004969770,"The hydrogen emission line n(1l0) --> n(109) at the frequency 5009 megahertz which was predicted by Kardashev has been detected in M 17, Orion, and nine other galactic H II regions with the 42.7-m (140-foot) telescope and a 20-channel receiver at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. The measured product of the half-power width of the line times the ratio of line-to-continuum brightness temperature is larger than that predicted by Kardashev's theory. The radial velocity obtained for M 17 and Orion agrees well with optical measurements. The search for a similar line of excited helium was without success."

https://openalex.org/W1979837177,"Geology has always centered around an effort to decipher records. Until 50 years ago these records were almost exclusively those of the constructional processes, conspicuously those made by sedimentation. Erosion has always been a great destroyer of records. Down to the last half century it was scarcely thought of as offering any compensation by recording a history of its own. Within that time its records have been analyzed with increasing insight. They are made rapidly and in great abundance but always at the surface. Hence, they are much like characters written on wax tablets, always destroyed to make way for newer letters. Only occasionally is a tablet discarded and buried and the writing thus preserved. Such a record is an unconformity. Erosional history mentions relatively few large facts of early geologic date, but of recent events the account is very full, even more so than the parallel account written in . . ."
