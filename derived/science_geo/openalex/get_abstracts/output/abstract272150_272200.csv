https://openalex.org/W2014781793,"Scientists these days tend to keep up a polite fiction that all science is equal. Except for the work of the misguided opponent whose arguments we happen to be refuting at the time, we speak as though every scientist's field and methods of study are as good as every other scientist's, and perhaps a little better. This keeps us all cordial when it comes to recommending each other for government grants. But I think anyone who looks at the matter closely will agree that some fields of science are moving forward very much faster than others, perhaps by an order of mag­ nitude, if numbers could be put on such estimates. The discoveries leap from the head­ lines - and they are real advances in complex and difficult subjects, like molecular biology and high-energy physics. As Alvin Weinberg (1964), says Hardly a month goes by without a stunning success in molecular biology being reported in the Proceed­ ing of the National Academy of Science. Why should there be such rapid advances in some fields and not in others? I think the usual explanations that we tend to think of-such as the tractability of the subject, or the quality or education of the men drawn into it, or the size of research contracts are important but inadequate. I have begun to believe that the primary factor in scienSource: Science (1965), 146:347-353. Copyright 1965 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science and reprinted by permission."
https://openalex.org/W2021074514,"Several features in social insects, particularly in ants, make the behavioral organization of territoriality considerably more complex than that of solitary animals. The establishment and maintenance of territories are based on a division of labor and a complex communication system. The analyses of territorial strategies in ants comprise the study of the design and spatiotemporal structure of the territory, as well as the social mechanisms through which the insect society pursues its territorial strategy. The geometric and behavioral organization of the absolute territories of the African weaver ants (Oecophylla longinoda) and harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex), and of the ""spatiotemporal territories"" of honey ants (Myrmecocystus mimicus) are described, and simple cost-benefit models are developed to illustrate the economic defensibility of each type of territory."
https://openalex.org/W2057973658,Fine platinum wires were used to collect airborne particulate matter along the shore in Hawaii. This matter was examined for surface active material and for sea salt. Droplets that rise from the sea in the surf zone appear to carry a highly compressed surface active film.
https://openalex.org/W196146854,"Twenty spectra of Io (0.26 to 0.33 micrometer), acquired with the International Ultraviolet Explorer spacecraft, have been studied. There is a strong ultraviolet absorption shortward of 0.33 micrometer that is consistent with earlier ground-based spectrophotometry; its strength is strongly dependent on Io's rotational phase angle at the time of observation. This spectral feature and its variation are interpreted as indicative of a longitudinal variation in the distribution of sulfur dioxide frost on Io. The frost is most abundant at orbital longitudes 72 degrees to 137 degrees and least abundant at longitudes 250 degrees to 323 degrees . Variations in spectral reflectivity between 0.4 and 0.5 micrometer, reported in earlier ground-based spectral studies, correlate inversely with variations in reflectivity between 0.26 and 0.33 micrometer. It is concluded that this is because the Io surface component with the highest visible reflectivity (sulfur dioxide frost) has the lowest ultraviolet reflectivity. At least one other component is present and may be sulfur allotropes or alkali sulfides. This model is consistent with ground-based ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectrophotometry. Comparison with Voyager color photographs indicates that the sulfur dioxide frost is in greatest concentration in the ""white"" areas on Io and the other sulfurous components are in greatest concentration in the ""red"" areas."
https://openalex.org/W2009741235,"From physical measurements on glaciers and experimental studies of ice properties a framework of concept and theory is being built which bids fair to place glaciers among the more quantitatively understandable phenomena in the earth sciences. Measurements of flow velocity, deformation and stress, ice thickness and channel configuration, temperature, internal structure of theice, mass and energy balance, and response to meteorological variables all contribute to this understanding, as do still other measurements hardly discussed here, such as electrical properties, radioactive age measurements, and detailed studies of chemical and isotopic composition. The obvious goals of this work-the interpretation of past and present glacier fluctuations in terms of changes in world climate, and the prediction of glacier behavior-remain elusive, even though a good conceptual groundwork has been laid for dealing with the more tractable aspects of these problems. Intriguing recent discoveries have been made about such matters as the way in which glaciers react dynamically to changing conditions, the inter-relations between thermal regime and ice motion, the structural mechanisms of glacier flow, and the changes produced in ice by flow. One can recognize in these developments the possibility that concepts derived from the study of glacier flow may be applicable to phenomena of solid deformation deep in the earth. In this way glacier geophysics may have a useful impact beyond the study of glaciers themselves."

Species with leaves that did not close stomata developed either chlorosis or necrosis, whereas leaves of Metrosideros collina closed stomata and showed no visual symptoms of sulfur dioxide stress."

Studies of the geographical distributions of the different kinds of spread F, sporadic E, and other phenomena will be facilitated by the satellite. More phenomena will undoubtedly be recognized as the records are studied."

He then lists seven major unsolved problems in theoretical high energy physics, describes the ideas central to unification of the electroweak and strong nuclear forces and briefly examines current questions related to the unification of the nuclear forces with gravity and the nature of charge."
https://openalex.org/W2066997098,"During a detailed examination of imaging data taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft within 4.5 hours of its closest approach to Jupiter, a shadow-like image was observed on the bright disk of the planet in two consecutive wide-angle frames. Analysis of the motion of the image on the Jovian disk proved that it was not an atmospheric feature, showed that it could not have been a shadow of any satellite known at the time, and allowed prediction of its reappearance in other Voyager 1 frames. The satellite subsequently has been observed in transit in both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 frames; its period is 16 hours 11 minutes 21.25 seconds +/- 0.5 second and its semimajor axis is 3.1054 Jupiter radii (Jupiter radius = 7.14 x 10(4) kilometers). The profile observed when the satellite is in transit is roughly circular with a diameter of 80 kilometers. It appears to have an albedo of approximately 0.05, similar to Amalthea's."

Its maker, Middle Stone Age man, and his vegetational environment are unkown, though we do have a faint idea of the contemporary fauna."

https://openalex.org/W2038737144,"Saturn was observed in two broad submillimeter photometric bands with the rings nearly edge-on. The observed brightness temperatures fall below the predictions of atmospheric models constructed from data at shorter wavelengths, indicating the presence of an opacity source besides pressure-broadened hydrogen lines in the submillimeter region. In combination with earlier measurements at larger inclination angles, these results yield a 400-micrometer brightness temperature for the rings of ∼75 K."

https://openalex.org/W1986484229,"In fiscal year 1980, the Department of Energy awarded grants for state energy conservation programs that totaled more than $400 million; the proposed figure for fiscal year 1981 is almost $600 million. Many states provide additional funds to implement conservation programs. This suggests that state governments play a major role in delivering conservation services to their citizens and are key agents in the nation's conservation efforts. This article discusses the energy conservation activities and responsibilities of one state energy office, the Minnesota Energy Agency, and the obstacles and constraints it faces in delivering its services. Suggestions are presented for resolving these difficulties and for improving the efficiency with which the agency manages its programs."

https://openalex.org/W1988129176,"This article analyzes distorted views that Weisz and Marshall have presented on the energetics and economics of ethanol production via biomass fermentation. Their conclusion, that with current technology ethanol production represents a net consumption of fuel, results from use of an unrealistically high processing energy and neglect of energy credit for the distillers' dry grains. Other fallacies were mentioned: failure to use insights available through the second law of thermodynamics; inconsistency of comparing cost of net alcohol fuel production with the market price of other fuels. It was concluded that if allowed to stand unchallenged, they could do serious damage to future research and development. (DP)"
