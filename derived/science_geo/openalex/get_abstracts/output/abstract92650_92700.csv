https://openalex.org/W2079337115,"The transcriptional unit boundaries of the mouse β-major globin gene have been investigated in DMSO-induced murine erythroleukemia cells using mainly labeled RNA produced by in vitro transcription in isolated nuclei. Restriction fragments of a genomic β-major globin clone (Tilghman et al. 1977) representing regions of the 5′ and 3′ portions of the mRNA sequence, the large intervening sequence, as well as regions before the cap site and beyond the poly(A) site of the mRNA were recloned for use in DNA excess hybridization experiments. Equimolar amounts of labeled nascent RNA hybridized to the fragment encoding the capped 5′ end of the mRNA and to fragments extending at least 1000 nucleotides beyond the poly(A) addition site. The existence of continuous transcription throughout this region was shown by: samples of labeled RNA each specifically complementary to one of the globin region fragments all bound to a single strand, presumably the coding strand of the separated strands of the β-globin genomic clone; specific T1 oligonucleotides diagnostic of the region immediately following the poly(A) site of the nuclear RNA were identified in hnRNA labeled in isolated nuclei; the shortest labeled nascent RNA chains bound to the fragment containing the cap site and increasingly longer chains bound in the ordered set of fragments as a function of distance from the cap site. These results suggest the necessity for an endonucleolytic cleavage of a primary transcript followed by polyadenylation in the process of creating the 3′ end of this cellular mRNA, as has previously been demonstrated for every virus mRNA so far studied (Nevins and Darnell 1978; Ford and Hsu 1978; Fraser et al. 1979; Nevins et al. 1980). An analysis of the accumulation of the different RNA sequences labeled in vivo demonstrated a confinement of the sequences transcribed past the poly(A) site exclusively to the nucleus and indicated an even higher turnover rate for these than for the intervening sequences. In addition to the equimolar amounts of labeled nascent RNA complementary to DNA fragments from the cap site through and past the poly(A) site, a smaller amount of labeled RNA hybridized reproducibly to DNA fragments upstream from the cap site. Although this RNA was complementary to the coding strand, it did not appear to be part of the majority of the globin primary transcripts based on size analysis and it was present at only 20% or less of the molarity of the RNA from the globin coding regions."
https://openalex.org/W1995482121,"HLA-DR histocompatibility antigens are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum. This assembly has been studied in vitro and in vivo. Three polypeptides are involved in forming the oligomeric structure of HLA-DR antigens, DR alpha chains (molecular weight 35,000), DR beta chains (molecular weight 29,000) and DR gamma chains (molecular weight 33,000). They are cotranslationally inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, and all span the membrane. The size of the cytoplasmic portion of DR alpha and DR beta is about 500- 1000 daltons, whereas that of the DR gamma chain is about 3000 daltons. Oligomeric assembly of DR alpha, DR beta and DR gamma chains occurs shortly after their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. DR gamma chains are synthesized in excess of DR alpha and DR beta chains, and hence in the endoplasmic reticulum they are found either in a complex with DR alpha and DR beta or in a free form. Free DR gamma chains remain in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas DR gamma chains present in the oligomeric complex with DR alpha and DR beta undergo intracellular transport. Their molecular weight increases during transport, probably because of the addition of complex sugars in the Golgi complex. This is followed by the detachment of DR gamma chains from the oligomeric complex and the appearance of DR alpha and DR beta chains on the cell surface. Whether any DR gamma chains appear on the cell surface is uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W1527157268,"The effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on growth, cell protein, and alkaline phosphatase were examined in cultures of a clonal osteoblast-like rat osteosarcoma cell line at different stages of phenotypic maturation, defined by the level of alkaline phosphatase activity. In immature cultures with low alkaline phosphatase specific activity, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at 10(-8)-10(-7) M inhibited cell growth and elevated alkaline phosphatase activity; lower hormone concentrations had no effect. In cultures with higher alkaline phosphatase activity, the hormone had biphasic effects: at concentrations of 10(-8)-10(-7) M, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibited growth and elevated alkaline phosphatase and total cell protein; however, lower hormone concentrations (10(-10) and 10(-9) M) reduced alkaline phosphatase activity. This effect was more pronounced in more mature cultures where half-maximum inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity occurred near 10(-11) M. At this stage, the hormone caused a small increase in cell number. The data suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 exerts differential effects on skeletal cells depending on their state of growth or maturation. This finding may offer new insights into the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on bone and may help resolve apparently conflicting experimental findings on the effects of the hormone on osteoblast-like cells in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2021250298,"A cultured cell line of the K-1735 melanoma was x-irradiated to induce chromosome breakage and rearrangements and then was implanted into the footpads of syngenic C3H mice. Spontaneous lung metastases were isolated from different animals, established in culture as individual lines, and then karyotyped. Within certain metastases, the same chromosomal abnormality (or abnormalities) (recombinant chromosomes) was found in all the cells examined. Most metastases differed from one another in that they exhibited characteristic combinations of chromosomal markers. These findings indicated that the metastases were clonal and that they probably originated from different progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010401784,"Chicken erythroblast cell strains and a cell line transformed by ts mutants of avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) terminally differentiate when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (42 degrees C). The differentiated cells resemble mature erythrocytes with respect to morphology and ultrastructure, expression of differentiation-specific cell-surface antigens, pattern of protein synthesis and hemoglobin content. Terminal differentiation is dependent on conditions favoring the differentiation of normal erythroid progenitor cells, including an erythropoietin-like factor. Colonies of ts AEV cells grown at 42 degrees C semisolid medium resemble erythrocyte colonies derived from normal erythroid progenitor cells. The colonies obtained were comparable in size or slightly larger than the late erythroid precursor (CFU-E) colonies. These results suggest that AEV-transformed cells are blocked at a stage of differentiation that is more advanced than that of the uninfected target cells. ts AEV cells are irreversibly committed to terminal differentiation within 20 to 30 hr after shift to 42 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1553049056,"Rat osteogenic sarcoma cells which have osteoblast properties including the ability to form bone and to mineralize were recently found to possess specific cytoplasmic receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). We have examined now the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 and other vitamin D3 metabolites on the alkaline phosphatase of such cell lines. We found in two cell lines cultured in the presence of 10(-7) M 1,25(OH)2D3 a 3-fold increase in intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity and a 6-fold increase in secreted alkaline phosphatase activity. The cellular response occurred in a dose-dependent fashion at a range of 10(-9) to 10(-7) M. In a third cell line, which does not possess the specific receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3, we could not detect stimulation of alkaline phosphatase. Vitamin D3, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at 10(-7) M had no effect on alkaline phosphatase. The effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 was enhanced in the presence of increased calcium. In view of the postulated role for alkaline phosphatase in calcification, we speculate that the stimulatory effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblast-like cells indicates a direct involvement of 1,25(OH)2D3 in bone mineralization."

https://openalex.org/W1537623701,"Highly purified preparations of rat liver cytosol casein kinase TS (Ck-TS) still contain a phosphorylatable protein (Mr = 25,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) which is also detectable in crude cytosol and which is not phosphorylated by casein kinase S from the same source. When purified Ck-TS is added back to crude cytosol, it promotes the phosphorylation of at least three protein bands (Mr = 89,000, 49,000, and 40,000) besides the 25,000 band. The phosphorylation of the 50,000 and 25,000 bands is greatly enhanced whenever enzymatically dephosphorylated and/or heated (70 degrees C, 5 min) cytosol replaces native cytosol as a substrate for Ck-TS. The electrophoretic mobilities of the 80,000, 49,000, and 25,000 phosphorylatable proteins are consistent with their identification as glycogen synthase, calsequestrin, and protein phosphatase inhibitor-1, respectively. Actually, in vitro all these three proteins readily undergo a Ck-TS-dependent phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1490687714,"Bradykinin stimulates protein production as well as prostaglandin production by lung fibroblasts in culture. When prostaglandin (PG) synthesis by the fibroblasts is inhibited with indomethacin, then bradykinin also stimulates collagen production. In the presence of indomethacin, the increase in protein production by bradykinin is much higher than in its absence. The addition of exogenous PGE2 to the fibroblasts which have been treated with indomethacin inhibited the stimulating effect of bradykinin on total protein production, especially collagen production. The concentration of PGE2 added was in the range of that produced by the fibroblasts. The degree of inhibition by PGE2 was dependent on the concentration of PGE2 added to the cultures. These results point out an interaction between bradykinin and PGE2 in the regulation of protein production by fibroblasts with PGE2 acting as a feedback mechanism to dampen the effect of bradykinin."
https://openalex.org/W1556130489,"Aryl sulfotransferase IV (EC 2.8.2.1), purified to homogeneity from male rat liver, catalyzes the sulfation of a variety of substituted phenols, including catecholamines, tyrosine esters, and peptides containing NH2-terminal tyrosine residues. An investigation of the mechanism of the enzyme was carried out using 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol as a model substrate. Kinetic, inhibition, and binding studies with aryl sulfotransferase IV are all consistent with a random rapid equilibrium Bi Bi kinetic mechanism with two dead end product inhibitor complexes. Studies of the chemical mechanisms of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction demonstrate that electron-withdrawing substituents decrease the maximal velocity of phenol sulfation. The maximal velocity of the reaction correlates with Hammett sigma p- constants (rho = -0.25). Evidence is presented for the mechanism by which adenosine 3‘,5‘-bisphosphate and aryl sulfotransferase catalyze the transfer of sulfate from 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl sulfate to other phenols."

In these patients, cholesterol sulfate is found primarily in the low-density lipoprotein fraction of plasma, and the electrophoretic mobility of these lipoproteins is greatly increased."
https://openalex.org/W2015262361,"The transforming capabilities of FVA, RLV and FVP have been examined using an in vitro transformation assay. Treatment of bone marrow cells with FVP in vitro led to the formation of hemoglobinized erythroid bursts even when these cells were cultured in methylcellulose for 5 days without added erythropoietin (Epo). A variety of FVA and RLV preparations also produced erythroid bursts without Epo but these bursts contained significantly less hemoglobin than those induced by FVP. When very low levels of Epo were added to cultures of FVA- and RLV-infected cells, the bursts were hemoglobinized, that is, similar to FVP-induced bursts. The burst-inducing agent in FVA preparations was shown to be a virus and not Epo. Spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) pseudotypes, derived from FVA or FVP, also produced erythroid bursts in vitro, whereas four helper murine leukemia viruses did not. These studies indicated that the SFFV component was essential for erythroid burst transformation and specified the degree of hemoglobinization in the bursts formed."
https://openalex.org/W1991090636,"The ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor DL-α-difluoromethyl ornithine inhibited a proliferation-associated increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity in cultured human promyelocytic leukemia cells, resulting in a marked suppression of cell proliferation and subsequent cell loss. It also inhibited increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity associated with the phorbol ester-induced conversion of promyelocytic HL-60 cells to monocyte-like cells and the retinoic acid-induced conversion to granulocyte-like cells. However, the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase activity did not prevent cellular differentiation. These results suggest that polyamine biosynthesis has a specific role in cell proliferation rather than in inducing differentiation that is not accompanied by proliferation. The data also demonstrate that cessation of proliferation in HL-60 cells is not necessarily associated with differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2093256815,"The stability of globin mRNA in terminally differentiating MEL cells has been reevaluated. Previously, it had been reported that globin mRNA has a half-life of approximately 17 hr in terminally differentiating MEL cells. We show that the previous measurements of this parameter were confounded by physical instability of differentiating MEL cells. By using culture conditions that physically stabilize end-stage cells we show that the stability of globin mRNA in terminally differentiating MEL cells is equal to the value observed for ribosomal RNA, a half-life greater than 60 hr."

https://openalex.org/W1601925633,"Casein kinase II, purified from reticulocytes, was covalently labeled with the ATP affinity analog, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine. The reaction was monitored by the decrease in enzyme activity and showed saturation kinetics with respect to the sulfonyl compound. This suggested a rapid equilibrium was established between the enzyme and affinity reagent prior to a slower, rate-determining step in the overall inactivation process. The enzyme was protected from the covalent modification by ATP and a series of ATP analogs. Their effectiveness in preventing inactivation by the affinity labeling reagent paralleled their ability to function as inhibitors of the phosphotransferase reaction. When radioactive p-fluorosulfonyl [14C]benzoyl adenosine was used to inactivate the enzyme, the alpha subunit was labeled and incorporation of radioactivity into the alpha subunit was blocked when ADP was included in the reaction mixture. Thus the ATP binding site of casein kinase II was shown to be contained within the domain of the alpha subunit of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex."

https://openalex.org/W1588379914,"Abstract Recently, nearest neighbor patterns were observed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA sequences. These are discussed with respect to some of their biological implications. It is suggested that their origins relate to different specific structures of nearest neighbor base pairs. These patterns strongly constrain the DNA sequence. As such, they explain to some degree the amino acid codon choice and have direct bearing on questions related to evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1572262666,"The metabolites of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid appearing in the intestines of bile duct-cannulated rats were compared to those of similarly treated intact rats. 2.4% of administered radioactivity was found in the small intestines of bile duct-cannulated rats 2 H after dose, while a much larger proportion of the dose (7.2%) was found in the intestines of the intact rats. All-trans- and 3-cis-retinoic acids predominate in the intestinal mucosa of bile duct-cannulated rats shortly after dosing. Retinoyl glucuronide was the major metabolite occurring as a mixture of the all-trans and 13-cis forms. Highly polar metabolites of retinoic acid appear in mucosa at all times in both intact and bile duct-cannulated rats demonstrating rapid metabolism of retinoic acid in intestine. The finding of a similar proportion of the 13-cis isomers in retinoic acids and retinoyl glucuronides suggests that injected all-trans-retinoic acid is isomerized in vivo probably prior to conjugated with glucuronic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1550362035,"Greater than 90% of the cholesterol in small unilamellar vesicles composed of egg lecithin and cholesterol (molar ratio 1:0.7) was oxidized by a cholesterol oxidase from Brevibacterium sp., with a single time constant and a half-time of 1 min at 37 degrees C. The enzyme preparation used was at least 95% pure and possessed no detectable phospholipase C activity. Since cholesterol is present in both halves of the bilayer, it was concluded that transmembrane movement of cholesterol in these vesicles occurs with a half-time of 1 min or less at 37 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1582475615,"Abstract Two soluble activities, beta-estradiol dehydrogenase and 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, present in the cytosol fraction of term human placenta, were co-purified with a constant ratio of specific activities, approximating 100:1, respectively. The pure enzyme is a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. To evaluate whether catalysis of the estrogen and progestin substrates occurs at a single active site, alkylation studies using 16 alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone were designed. This affinity alkylating steroid binds at the enzyme-active site (km 256 microM; Vmax = 0.012 mumol/min/mg), inactivates the in an irreversible and time-dependent manner which follows pseudo-first order kinetics, and causes coincident loss of both the beta- and 20 alpha-activities. Affinity radioalkylation studies using 16 alpha-[2'-3H]bromoacetoxyprogesterone indicate that 2 mol of steroid bind per mol of inactivated dimer (Mr = 68,000). Amino acid analyses of the acid hydrolysate of radioalkylated show that 16 alpha-bromoacetoxyprogesterone dicarboxymethylates a histidyl residue in the active site. These results are identical with those reported for 16 alpha-[2'-3H]bromoacetoxyestradiol 3-methyl ether inactivation and radioalkylation of identically purified 17 beta-estradiol dehydrogenase. Computer graphics were used to construct a model in which: 1) binding of estrogen and progestin substrates at one active site permits stereospecific catalysis; 2) the estrogen and progestin analogs' alkylating side arms have access to a common histidine residue. These observations clearly demonstrate that the catalysis of estrogen and progestin substrates can occur at a single active site of one enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2012035318,"The transplantable Leydig cell tumor of Wistar rats, LTW(m), caused decreased food consumption and weight loss in the host within 2 weeks of implantation. The tumor was small, did not metastasize, and did not affect several parameters of biochemical function. When the tumors were removed, increases in food intake and body weight occurred within 72 hours and were sustained. Reimplantation of tumors caused anorexia to recur. Parabiotic pairs of rats with tumor in one partner also experienced weight loss. Those rats in parabiosis with tumor-bearing rats gained less weight than those in parabiosis with control rats. These observations suggest that the LTW(m) tumor causes anorexia and that this anorexia is mediated by a circulating substance."
https://openalex.org/W2103066583,"The metabolites of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid were studied in the rat bile. In the bile duct cannulated rat 80 to 86% of the dose is excreted into the bile within 24 h after the intravenous administration of either a physiological or pharmacological dose of all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid. Polar metabolites of retinoic acid predominate (73 to 96% of bile 3H) in the bile at all times; some free retinoic acid (0.2 to 4.8% of bile 3H) is excreted into the bile during the initial 6-h period after dosing. Retinoyl glucuronides are excreted into the bile for 12 h after dosing; their excretion is highest during the first 2 h. More retinoyl glucuronide is excreted from the pharmacological dose (10% of the radiolabel dose) than the physiological dose (4.4% of the dose) of all-trans-retinoic acid. The retinoyl glucuronides were separated and were shown to consist of all-trans- and 13-cis-retinoyl glucuronides in a ratio of 1.5 to 1.0. Since the starting material was 99% all-trans-retinoic acid and the methods used do not cause isomerization, it is concluded that cis-trans isomerization of retinoic acid is a physiologically relevant reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2044569955,"We report an analysis by electron microscopy of the differences in the folding of ribosomal gene and adjacent nontranscribed spacer DNA of Xenopus laevis oocytes into supranucleosomal chromatin structures. The chromatin structures identified in gene and spacer regions of transcriptionally active nucleoli (from stage 5 oocytes) were compared with those found in nucleoli prior to transcription (from stage 2 oocytes) to determine whether changes in the chromatin structure occur when transcription is initiated. Chromatin structures were characterized by their morphology and by the extent of folding of DNA in chromatin. Nontranscribed spacer regions from both transcriptionally active and inactive nucleoli appear to be packaged into supranucleosomal structures and are contracted by a factor of at least 20 from the length of B form DNA. The structure of the adjacent gene region, both before and during transcription, is much more extended; the only structures observed are the size of nucleosomes, and the DNA is contracted by a factor of 1.4 from its B form length. Thus a mosaicism in the higher order structure of gene and spacer rDNA is established days or weeks prior to the initiation of transcription of these genes and maintained during transcriptionally active stages."
https://openalex.org/W1501949122,"The enzyme converting 5-cholestene-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol to 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one has been solubilized from rabbit liver microsomes by treatment with a mixture of sodium cholate and the nonionic detergent Renex 690. The enzyme was purified about 200-fold, with a recovery of more than 50%, by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapetite, 2',5',ADP-Sepharose 4B and 5'-AMP-Sepharose 4B. The purified enzyme showed only one protein band, with an apparent molecular weight of 46,000, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was eluted as a single peak on gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 34. The elution volume corresponded to that observed for globular proteins with molecular weights in the 45,000 to 50,000 region. The substrate specificity of the microsomal fraction and of the purified oxidoreductase in oxidation and reduction of various 3-oxygenated C19-, C21-, and C27-steroids was studied in the presence of NAD and NADH. Whereas the microsomal fraction had a broad substrate specificity, NAD-supported oxidation with the purified oxidoreductase only occurred with 5-cholestene-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol as substrate. NADP could not replace NAD in the reaction. NADH-supported reduction with the purified oxidoreductase only occurred with 7 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholestan-3-one as substrate. The results suggest that conversion of 5-cholestene-3 beta, 7 alpha-diol to 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one is catalyzed by a single enzyme specific for certain C27-steroids."
https://openalex.org/W1588270730,"Sulfatide synthesis and its subcellular distribution kinetics was followed in the myelinating brain of 17-day-old mice. Pulse-labeling-chasing conditions were achieved by an intraperitoneal injection of (35S)sulfate followed 2 h later by a second injection of a high dose of unlabeled sulfate. At 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h after the (35S)sulfate injection, the brains were removed, homogenized, and subcellular fractions were obtained by differential and discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation (Eichberg, J., Whittaker, V. P., and Dawson, R. M. (1964) Biochem. J. 92, 91-100). The microsomal membranes were further subfractionated (Siegrist, H. P., Burkart, T., Wiesmann, U. N., Herschkowitz, N. N., and Spycher, M. A. (1979) J. Neurochem. 33, 497-504) into light myelin, plasma membranes, Golgi vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum membranes, and heavy vesicles associated with acid hydrolase activities. The [35S]sulfatide-labeling kinetics was measured in all subcellular fractions. The results indicate that sulfatides are synthesized in the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum complex and transferred in vesicles at least partially associated with lysosomes to the myelin membranes. The association of sulfatides with lysosomes could explain the existence of the previously described labile pool of newly synthesized sulfatides (Burkart, T., Hofmann, K., Siegrist, H. P., Herschkowitz, N. N., and Wiesmann, U. N. (1981) Dev. Biol. 83, 42-48) and also could be a form of vesicular transport to the myelin."
https://openalex.org/W1481304034,"Steroid 5 alpha-reductase in skin fibroblasts varies in two ways: 1) mean activity in uncloned fibroblasts corresponds to the activity in skin from which fibroblasts are derived (high in genital skin and low in nongenital skin); 2) activity in normal genital skin fibroblasts varies over a wide range (more than 200-fold). Studies of activity in fibroblast clones provides an explanation for this variability. Activity in clones of genital skin fibroblasts varies from the limits of detectability to very high levels, whereas activity in fibroblasts cloned from nongenital skin is uniformly low. The mean value of 5 alpha-reductase in genital skin clones is similar to the value in uncloned fibroblasts from the same explant. This suggests that the numbers of high and low activity cells in a given explant influence the overall enzyme activity. Variability among normal genital skin strains is also due to inherent differences in the range of enzyme activities. Furthermore, high activity genital skin clones give rise to a mixture of both high and low-activity subclones, whereas low activity genital skin and nongenital skin clones give rise to populations with uniformly low activity. Thus, with time genital skin gives rise to high activity fibroblasts that continually undergo shift in phenotypic expression to low activity."

The MoFe protein is an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer of 220,000 molecular weight with 1 molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. A 6-A resolution rotation function shows the orientation of the crystallographic diad and pseudo mutually perpendicular diads representing 2-fold relationships between alpha and beta chains.

https://openalex.org/W1579112670,"The difference between the magnetic susceptibilities of native and thionine-oxidized molybdenum-iron protein from Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase was measured by the nuclear magnetic resonance method. Reversible oxidation of the MoFe protein by 4 to 8 electron eq of thionine/mol made the protein more paramagnetic than it was in the native state. The NMR susceptibility results were analyzed in terms of a model for the spin states of the iron centers in the MoFe protein based on low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectral studies. The model proposes that the native protein contains 2 centers (S = 3/2) and 4 centers (S = 0)/mol and that the oxidized protein has diamagnetic M centers and paramagnetic P centers with S greater than or equal to 3/2. Assuming that this model holds at 280 K, the NMR susceptibility results show that the effective magnetic moment of the oxidized P centers is larger than that of the native M centers. Based on an analysis in terms of spin only magnetic moments, the susceptibility results suggest that the P centers in the oxidized protein are S = 5/2 systems."
https://openalex.org/W1524663078,"Abstract An esterase which cleaves the 12-ester group of phorbol-12,13-diesters has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from murine liver cytosol using ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, Con A-Sepharose chromatography, and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. The enzyme is a single chain, hydrophobic glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000 and exhibits optimum activity at pH 7.5 to 8.5. The hydrolase has an isoelectric point (pI) of 5. The enzyme is heat- and acid-labile. Zinc, cobalt, and fluoride ions inhibit its activity. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride is a potent inhibitor of the hydrolase. Sarkosyl also inhibits the enzyme at millimolar concentrations. The enzyme inactivates biologically active phorbol-12,13-diesters in a dose-, time-, and temperature-dependent manner. The enzyme inhibits phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate binding to its receptor in a noncompetitive manner. The inhibition constant (KI) has been found to be 6.6 X 10(-8) M."
https://openalex.org/W1660396503,"Exposure of HTC cells to 6 mM sodium butyrate for 20 h results in significantly reduced amounts of nuclear histone acetyltransferase. While the direct butyrate inhibition of histone deacetylases is rapidly reversed upon removal of cells from butyrate, histone acetyltransferase activity increases only gradually following release of cells from butyrate, requiring several hours to regain control cell levels. As a result, HTC cells released from a 20-h exposure to butyrate display normal kinetics of histone acetate turnover but markedly reduced rates of histone acetylation, the imbalance in these two processes produces histone hypoacetylation."

https://openalex.org/W1485047495,"An endogenous phosphoryl acceptor has been purified 138-fold from wheat germ extracts. This protein, termed T-substrate, is far more effective than casein or phosvitin as a phosphoryl acceptor for a wheat germ kinase recently purified by our laboratory. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the T-substrate preparation is not homogeneous. The T-substrate, which migrates at a Mr = 48,000, constitutes about 90% of the total protein stain on the gel and is the only protein component which is phosphorylated by the wheat germ kinase. The hydrodynamic properties of the T-substrate have been determined by gel filtration and glycerol density gradient centrifugation. The protein exhibits a Stokes radius of 65.5 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 3.85 S, a frictional ratio of 2.11, and a molecular weight of approximately 104,000. The results suggest that the wheat germ T-substrate is a dimer. The protein exhibits a greater substrate specificity for the wheat germ kinase than for the cyclic AMP-dependent and several independent protein kinases isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle and human erythrocytes. The T-substrate can be maximally phosphorylated by the wheat germ kinase to the extent of about 8 mol of phosphate/48,000 g of protein. Complete dephosphorylation of the phospho-T-substrate occurred upon treatment with phosphatases. The phosphorylated amino acid was identified by high voltage electrophoresis of an acid hydrolysate of 32P-T-substrate. The results indicate that phosphorylation occurs mainly on the seryl residues of T-substrate."

https://openalex.org/W29827394,"The kinetics of phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) by two cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinases from rabbit reticulocytes have been studied. The hemin-controlled repressor (HCR) and casein kinase II phosphorylate the alpha and beta subunits of eIF-2, respectively. The apparent Km for eIF-2 with HCR and casein kinase II was determined to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 microM. Using fully dephosphorylated eIF-2, it was possible to show that the phosphorylation state of the beta subunit did not affect the apparent Km of either HCR or casein kinase II for eIF-2. The effects of two inhibitory compounds, hemin and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-DPG), were studied also. Hemin acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor of HCR with respect to eIF-2 with an apparent Ki of 3 microM, while inhibition of casein kinase II by 2,3-DPG was competitive with respect to eIF-2. The apparent inhibitory constant was determined to be 1 mM, a concentration within the physiological range of 2,3-DPG in red blood cells. From the kinetic values obtained with hemin and 2,3-DPG, it appears that these compounds could directly regulate the respective protein kinases in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1492501419,"We have purified a protein (Mr approximately 71,000) from murine sera 104-fold which directly binds biologically active phorbol esters, ingenol esters, and mezerein in a specific, reversible, and saturable manner. The binding of labeled phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) to the purified protein is rapid and dose-dependent. Those phorbol and ingenol esters which stimulate cell growth in culture and have tumor-promoting activity in vivo inhibit the binding of labeled PDBu, while the biologically inactive derivatives fail to do so. Other nonditerpene tumor promoters, retinoids, steroids, and prostaglandins do not interfere with PDBu-protein interaction. Epidermal growth factor, insulin, bovine serum albumin, hemoglobin, ovalbumin, ferritin, myoglobin, fetuin, and lipase do not interact directly with PDBu. The purified binding protein competitively inhibits the binding of PDBu to its specific receptors. It is nonglycosylated and slightly hydrophobic. The protein is heat- and acid-labile and is present in sera of various mammalian species. Its concentration in murine sera is age-, sex-, and strain-independent."
https://openalex.org/W1550735899,"NADP+-linked estradiol-17 beta dehydrogenase has been purified 300- to 400-fold from cell-free extracts of chicken liver in a 20 to 30% yield by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The enzyme is stable for at least 3 months when stored at -20 degrees C in buffer containing glycerol (50%, v/v). Two forms, with molecular weights of 43,000 and 97,000 are present; these show one major band (Rm = 0.27) and one minor band (Rm = 0.25) on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. (Rm is defined as the ratio of the distance migrated by the protein band to that of the tracking dye.) The species of lower molecular weight is the more active, with apparent Km values for estradiol-17 beta of 25 and 17.3 microM in the presence and absence, respectively, of bovine serum albumin in the assay medium. The apparent Km for NADP+ is 7.7 microM, and the optimum pH for dehydrogenation is 9.9. The lower molecular weight form has a lambda max at 280 nm, a shoulder at 290 nm, and an A 1% 1 cm of 12.1 at 280 nm. The fluorescence spectrum corresponds to that of a tryptophan-containing protein with lambda max at 288 nm. Isoelectric focusing in gel at pH 5 to 8 shows three major bands of pI 6.9, 6.8, and 6.0. Cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate followed by electrophoresis reveals five bands. The enzyme is affected by thio reagents and possesses no associated estradiol-sensitive transhydrogenase activity."

Allogeneic effect factor is a soluble mediator derived from mixed secondary murine leukocyte cultures. For several weeks it supported the growth of bone marrow cultures, as indicated by the maintenance of stem cell activity, cellular proliferation, and heterogeneity. Another lymphokine, T cell growth factor, did not, Pre-T lymphocytes could be detected in these cultures for several weeks."
https://openalex.org/W1594508384,"Extremely sensitive methods are described for the measurement of 3 alpha- and 3 beta-hydroxysteroids, as well as 3-ketosteroids, based on their reaction with highly purified bacterial hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and the amplification of the accompanying changes in nicotinamide nucleotides by enzymatic cycling procedures. Conditions have been devised under which the steroid oxidation and reduction reactions lead to the formation of stoichiometric quantities of NADH or NAD+, respectively, even in the presence of large excesses of reaction products. The scope of these methods is illustrated by application to the analysis of minute volumes of human pregnancy urine, high pressure liquid chromatography fractions derived from such urine samples, and human serum. The steroid contents of milligram quantities of rat prostate have been determined. The methods have been applied also to the measurement of the activities of steroid-transforming enzymes, such as the 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of prostate microsomes. At the present time the sensitivity of the described methods allows the accurate determination of 0.2-0.4 pmol of steroids."
https://openalex.org/W1934886232,"Two affinity-labeling steroids (2-bromo[2'-14C]acetamidoestrone methyl ether and 16 alpha-bromo[2'-14C]acetoxyestradiol 3-methyl ether) which bear their reagent groups on the A- and D-ring of the molecule, respectively, and which are both substrates, have been used to elucidate spatial relationships of steroid and cofactor as they undergo the reversible binding step at the active site of human placental estradiol 17 beta-dehydrogenase. The 2-derivative alkylates its evolutive cofactor (NADH) in the presence of the enzyme but not in the absence of enzyme. The rate of cofactor alkylation increases with increasing quantities of enzyme and is slowed by estrone which competes for the enzyme-active site. To the contrary, the 16 alpha-derivative does not detectably alkylate its evolutive cofactor (NAD+). The product of cofactor alkylation by 2-bromoacetamidoestrone methyl ether was treated to effect hydrolytic removal of the adenine moiety from the remainder of the cofactor, reduction of the steroid 17-keto group, and crystallization. The final crystalline product has been identified as 2-[2'-6N-adenyl]acetamidoestradiol 3-methyl ether (IUPAC name: N-(3-methoxy-17 beta-hydroxy-1,3,5(10)-estratrien-2-yl)-2-(purin-6-ylamino) acetamide) by ultraviolet, infrared, NMR, and mass spectral analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1539693546,"In the course of the enzymatic reaction of acetoacetyl-CoA with maleate, catalyzed by CoA transferase, a transient appearance of free CoA-SH occurred. Subsequently, both free CoA and acyl-CoA decreased with time, indicating the formation of an unusual CoA derivative resistant to alkaline hydrolysis. During the chemical reaction of CoA-SH with maleic anhydride, the SH groups of CoA disappeared quickly, but not more than 30% could be accounted for as thioester. The product is unstable at neutrality and is hydrolyzed by nitroprusside reagent. Another product having an acyl bond of low reactivity, which reacts with hydroxylamine and does not undergo ammonolysis, but is susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis, slowly accumulated, accounting for about 25% of the CoA that disappeared. The main product appears to be formed by the addition of CoA-SH to the double bond of maleic anhydride. Column chromatography of the products of the chemical and the enzymatic reaction revealed two products, designated at X1 and X2, showing absorbance of the adenine moiety of CoA, containing 14C-labeled maleate and no free SH groups. Alkaline hydrolysis of X1 resulted in the recovery of CoA and in an increase of X2. The results are interpreted as indicating that maleyl-CoA readily hydrolyzes and reacts spontaneously with the SH group of free CoA to form an addition compound. The thioester of this product slowly hydrolyzes to give rise to the final product, which appears to be the thioether, a stable and metabolically inert compound."
https://openalex.org/W1538480741,"The Mo-Fe protein of Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase was fractionated on 9.5 M urea isoelectric focusing gels and gave three distinct bands (alpha', alpha"", beta'). Protein focused on nondenaturing gels gave a single brown band, which when excised and refocused on a denaturing gel gave the three-band pattern. Partial trypsin digestion of the subunits and fractionation of the peptides by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the alpha' and alpha"" polypeptide moieties were the same. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the alpha' and beta' proteins with appropriate molecular weight standards indicated Mr = 61,000 and 57,000, respectively. This is consistent with an overall alpha 2 beta 2 mass of 236,000 daltons."
