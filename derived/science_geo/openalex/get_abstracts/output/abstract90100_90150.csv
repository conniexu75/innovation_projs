https://openalex.org/W1563690189,"Lactosaminoglycan was isolated from human granulocytes and the structure of neutral lactosaminoglycan was elucidated. The lactosaminoglycan glycopeptides and lactosaminoglycan saccharides obtained by hydrazinolysis were analyzed by permethylation. In addition, the lactosaminoglycan was digested by endo-beta-galactosidase and the portion and released oligosaccharides were analyzed by specific glycosidases, permethylation, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The structure of the major component in the neutral lactosaminoglycan was found to be: sequence in text where m + n + o + p greater than 6, and the mean value of fucose content = 4.5. This structure is unique in that 1) four linear polylactosaminyl chains are attached to the core portions, 2) N-acetylglucosamine residues in the polylactosaminyl side chains are substituted with fucose through an alpha 1----3 linkage and at least 1 mol of Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc terminal structure is present, and 3) the tetraantennary core is a major component. Since this polyfucosylated lactosaminoglycan is abundantly present in human granulocytes, we propose that this lactosaminoglycan is a major carrier for the granulocyte-specific antigen, Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc, which is recognized by the My-1 monoclonal antibody (Huang, L. C., Civin, C. I., Magnani, J. L., Shaper, J. H., and Ginsburg, V. (1983) Blood 61, 1020-1023)."
https://openalex.org/W1556609530,"Bovine retinas or preparations of rod outer segments incorporate [3H]palmitic acid into rhodopsin. The incorporation is both time- and temperature-dependent. The major product retains the chromatographic and electrophoretic properties of rhodopsin and remains photosensitive as demonstrated by alteration of its chromatographic behavior upon exposure to light. The incorporated radioactivity resists extraction with organic solvents and is not dissociated from the protein by detergents or under the denaturing conditions of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radioactive free fatty acid can, however, be released by alkaline hydrolysis. Hydroxylamine treatment yields a mixture of the free fatty acid and the fatty acyl hydroxamate. These results demonstrate the formation of an ester bond between [3H]palmitic acid and rhodopsin. Cycloheximide fails to inhibit the incorporation. This finding along with the ability of rod outer segments to support the incorporation point to the acylation of rhodopsin as a late post-translational event."
https://openalex.org/W1535644751,"The rate and equilibrium constants for the formation and dissociation of the bovine ventricular (BV) actomyosin-S1-ADP have been measured by stopped flow light scattering. A comparison of the rate constants obtained here with those for rabbit skeletal (RS) actomyosin-S1 indicates that there are large differences in several of the rate and equilibrium constants. 1) The rate constant of ADP dissociation from BV actomyosin-S1 is 65 +/- 10 s-1 at 15 degrees C compared to a lower limit of 500 s-1 previously observed for RS actomyosin-S1. 2) The association constant for ADP binding to actomyosin-S1 is increased from 6 X 10(3) M-1 for RS to 1.5 X 10(5) M-1 for BV at 15 degrees C. The following rate and equilibrium constants differ by less than a factor of 2 between RS and BV actomyosin-S1: 1) the second order rate constant for the dissociation of actomyosin-S1 by MgATP; 2) the second order rate constant of myosin-S1 and myosin-S1-ADP binding to actin; and 3) the association constant of myosin-S1 to actin. The rate constant for ADP dissociation from BV actomyosin-S1 is at least 10-fold greater than the Vmax for the steady state ATPase and therefore cannot be the rate-limiting step of ATP hydrolysis. However, at physiological temperature, 38 degrees C, and ATP concentration, greater than 3 mM, ADP dissociation is sufficiently slow to limit the rate of myosin-S1 dissociation from actin by ATP and is likely to be the rate-limiting step of cross-bridge dissociation in muscle. Moreover, the rate constant of ADP dissociation is sufficiently slow to be the molecular step which limits the unloaded shortening velocity in cardiac muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1679156369,"Parallel cytometric and fluorimetric analyses of the interaction of a fluoresceinated N-formyl hexapeptide (N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-fluorescein, Nle = norleucine) with its receptors on human neutrophils are presented. The cytometric analyses take advantage of the ability of the fluorescence flow cytometer to discriminate free and receptor-bound ligand in a homogeneous real-time assay. The spectrofluorometric analysis relies on a high affinity antibody to fluorescein to discriminate free and bound ligand. We find that the number of receptors for formyl peptides on the surface of a resting cell is 53,000 +/- 13,000 (Kd approximately 0.6 +/- 0.2 nM). We use commercially available cytometric standards to calibrate the cytometer and we obtain similar values for the number of receptors. The temperature dependence of the kinetics of ligand-receptor interactions have been examined. The association rate constant varies from approximately 3 X 10(8) M-1 min-1 at 4 degrees C to approximately 10(9) M-1 min-1 at 37 degrees C (delta H approximately 8 kcal/mol). While ligand internalization is blocked at 4 degrees C, at 37 degrees C internalization proceeds at an initial rate of approximately 24% of the occupied receptors/min following a latency period of approximately 20-30 s. Intermediate rates and longer latency periods are found at 15 and 25 degrees C. Dissociation of the ligand is heterogeneous and depends both on the length of time of association and the temperature. After short periods of association, the ligand dissociates with t1/2 approximately 1-5 min. After longer periods (30 min at 15 degrees C or 100 min at 4 degrees C), but while the ligand-receptor complex remains on the cell surface, t1/2 increases to greater than 30 min. It appears that the ligand-receptor complex undergoes an alteration in affinity, with a time course at elevated temperatures, which parallels or lags behind the time course of the participation of the occupied receptors in cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1563813749,"A large scale purification procedure for human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase that involved affinity chromatography on an acridinium resin permitted the routine isolation of about 5 mg of enzyme from 10 liters of outdated erythrocytes. The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 5000-5800 units/mg of protein and was free of polypeptide contaminants by gel electrophoresis criteria. In detergents, the isolated enzyme corresponded to a disulfide-linked dimer (G2) that was converted to 75-kDa subunit monomers (G1) by reduction with dithiothreitol. No free sulfhydryl groups were detected prior to reduction, but reduction under nondenaturing conditions generated active G1 and produced 1.7 mol of free sulfhydryl groups/mol of subunit. These data were interpreted as indicating a single intersubunit disulfide bond in the G2 enzyme. In the absence of nonionic detergents, both the G2 and the G1 enzymes formed aggregates with average Stokes radii of 10 nm. Introduction of Triton X-100 gave enzyme-detergent complexes according to hydrodynamic criteria. Quantitative determination of [3H]Triton X-100 binding to G2 and G1 by a novel affinity chromatography procedure revealed that each G2 molecule bound about 140 detergent molecules and each G1, about 80. These observations indicated that each subunit in both G2 and G1 interacted individually with a Triton X-100 micelle. Molecular weight estimates for the protein components of the G2- and G1-detergent complexes were obtained from the hydrodynamic properties and the detergent binding data and corresponded to 160,000 and 85,000, respectively. Data in this and the accompanying paper (Dutta-Choudhury, T.A., and Rosenberry, T. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5653-5660) provide strong evidence that erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase is an amphipathic protein."
https://openalex.org/W1486089217,"The energy requirement for specific transcription initiation and elongation by the human RNA polymerase II system was studied in vitro using partially purified transcription factors from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The synthesis of the 536-nucleotide long run-off transcript resulting from initiation at the adenovirus major late promoter was found to be dependent upon the presence of either ATP or dATP (with the imido derivative adenyl-5‘-yl imidodiphosphate being used as the substrate for the RNA polymerase elongation reaction). An identical requirement for hydrolysis of the phosphate bond in an adenosine nucleotide was observed for the synthesis of the decanucleotide transcribed from the major late promoter in the absence of the GTP substrate. In contrast, the nonhydrolyzable analog adenyl-5‘-yl imidodiphosphate fully substitutes for ATP during the subsequent elongation of these short transcripts, which demonstrates that the energy requirement occurs at an earlier step of the transcription reaction. Thus the particular transcription factor that requires ATP (or dATP) hydrolysis for its function must act prior to, or concomitant with, formation of the first few phosphodiester linkages by the RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1597931093,"Using RNA synthesized in isolated nuclei, we have measured the effect of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the rate of synthesis of cytochrome P1-450 mRNA in wild type mouse hepatoma (Hepa 1c1c7) cells and in variant (BPrc1) cells, which fail to accumulate the TCDD-receptor complex within the nucleus. In wild type cells, TCDD induces a 20-fold increase in the rate of synthesis of cytochrome P1-450 mRNA within 30 min. This effect persists for at least 18 h. In contrast, TCDD has no effect on cytochrome P1-450 mRNA synthesis in the variant cells. The results demonstrate that TCDD increases the rate of transcription of the cytochrome P1-450 gene and suggest that transcription requires nuclear localization of the TCDD-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1521257112,"Abstract The structure of lactosaminoglycan prepared from Band 3 glycoprotein of umbilical cord blood erythrocytes was elucidated. The glycopeptides were digested by endo-beta-galactosidase and oligosaccharides, core glycopeptides, and intact glycopeptides were analyzed by permethylation, exoglycosidase digestion, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The structure of one of the major components was found to be: sequence in text This structure is unique in that 1) two linear polylactosaminyl chains are attached to the core portion, 2) the polylactosaminyl side chain is much longer on the Man alpha 1----6 side than on the Man alpha 1----3 side, 3) alpha 2----3-linked sialic acid is present at the terminal of the long polylactosaminyl side chain, whereas alpha 2----6-linked sialic acid is present in the other short side chain, and 4) fucose is linked only to the external position of the lactosaminyl side chain and fucose, alpha 1----6-linked to the innermost N-acetylglucosamine, is absent."
https://openalex.org/W1969031921,"Protozoan parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium cause a short-term, flu-like, gastrointestinal illness in immunocompetent persons and severe, persistent, life-threatening diarrhea in immunodeficient individuals. No effective therapy is available for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in the immunodeficient host. Complete development (from sporozoite to sporulated oocyst) of a human isolate of Cryptosporidium was achieved in cultured human fetal lung cells and primary chicken kidney and porcine kidney cells. The growth of this newly recognized zoonotic agent in cell culture now provides a means of studying its behavior, development, and metabolism, and a mechanism for evaluation of potentially useful therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1665980201,"Proteolytic studies of rat liver metallothionein reconstituted in vitro with Cu salts revealed that the 2 metal centers fill in an ordered fashion. The B cluster in the NH2-terminal beta domain fills prior to Cu binding in cluster A. This is in contradistinction to cluster formation induced by the binding of Cd or Zn ions in which cluster A is the center of initial binding. The formation of metal cluster B by Cu occurs in a cooperative fashion yielding a saturated cluster with approximately 6 Cu+ ions bound. The B cluster is saturated with Cd or Zn after binding of only 3 metal ions. The preferential binding of Cd and Cu to the alpha and beta domains, respectively, and the tolerance toward proteolysis of these 2 different half saturated molecules permit the isolation of each domain. The metal cluster in each isolated domain can be reversibly formed with predicted stoichiometries of Cd and Cu. The folding of the polypeptide therefore appears to create each cluster independently. The metal binding data suggest that Cu-metallothionein contains 11-12 Cu ions, 6 bound in the beta domain and 5-6 in the alpha domain. In contrast, Cd-metallothionein contains 7 Cd ions, 3 bound to beta and 4 to alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2139481768,"The mechanism of the heparin-promoted reaction of thrombin with antithrombin III was investigated by using covalent complexes of antithrombin III with either high-affinity heparin (Mr = 15,000) or heparin fragments having an average of 16 and 12 monosaccharide units (Mr = 4,300 and 3,200). The complexes inhibit thrombin in the manner of active site-directed, irreversible inhibitors: (Formula: see text) That is, the inhibition rate of the enzyme is saturable with respect to concentration of complexes. The values determined for Ki = (k-1 + k2)/k1 are 7 nM, 100 nM, and 6 microM when the Mr of the heparin moieties are 15,000, 4,300, 3,200, respectively, whereas k2 (2 S-1) is independent of the heparin chain length. The bimolecular rate constant k2/Ki for intact heparin is 3 X 10(8) M-1 S-1 and the corresponding second order rate constant k1 is 6.7 X 10(8) M-1 S-1, a value greater than that expected for a diffusion-controlled bimolecular reaction. The bimolecular rate constants for the complexes with heparin of Mr = 4,300 and 3,200 are, respectively, 2 X 10(7) M-1 S-1 and 3 X 10(5) M-1 S-1. Active site-blocked thrombin is an antagonist of covalent antithrombin III-heparin complexes: the effect is monophasic and half-maximum at 4 nM of antagonist against the complex with intact heparin, whereas the effect is weaker against complexes with heparin fragments and not monophasic. We conclude that virtually all of the activity of high affinity, high molecular weight heparin depends on binding both thrombin and antithrombin III to heparin, and that the exceptionally high activity of heparin results in part from the capacity of thrombin bound nonspecifically to heparin to diffuse in the dimension of the heparin chain towards bound antithrombin III. Increasing the chain length of heparin results in an increased reaction rate because of a higher probability of interaction between thrombin and heparin in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1598430395,"The biochemical properties of polyamine transport system have been studied in detail in NB-15 mouse neuroblastoma cells in culture by measuring the uptake of [14C]putrescine under various experimentally imposed pharmacological conditions. Putrescine uptake in the NB-15 mouse neuroblastoma cells appeared to be a sodium-dependent process. Iso-osmotic displacement of Na+ in the assay medium with either choline or Li+ resulted in a linear decrease of putrescine uptake. Gramicidin, a channel-former ionophore, inhibited putrescine uptake by more than 90% at 20 nM. N-Ethylmaleimide at 5 mM or p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate at 50 microM completely abolished putrescine uptake. Conversely, oxidized glutathione at 10 mM or 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 5 microM gave a 1.3-1.4-fold stimulation after a 1-h incubation. This polyamine transport system appeared to be subjected to adaptive regulation. Polyamine antimetabolites such as alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine stimulated putrescine uptake whereas preloading of cells with polyamines inhibited putrescine uptake. Preloading cells with neutral amino acids that belong to sodium-dependent transport System A stimulated putrescine uptake by more than 8-10-fold. These results suggested that the polyamine transport system in NB-15 mouse neuroblastoma cells was sodium dependent and shared some characteristics common to other known sodium-dependent transport systems. These characteristics included (a) sensitivity to ionophores, (b) sensitivity to sulfhydryl reagents, and (c) sensitivity to intracellular contents of substrate molecules. Our data also indicated that polyamine transport may be regulated by transport System A amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1564909994,"Parvalbumin, a high affinity Ca2+-binding protein, is known to be expressed only in muscles and brain in the rat. We have investigated its distribution and characteristics in other rat tissues by several biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Evidence for the presence of parvalbumin in teeth, bone, skin, prostate, seminal vesicles, testes, and ovary is given by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting (Western technique) of one-dimensional gels, and its concentration measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The distribution within several parvalbumin-positive organs was monitored by the immunohistochemical peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. In teeth, only ameloblasts reacted with anti-rat parvalbumin serum and in bone the calcified extracellular cartilage was the target of the immunoreaction. The panniculus carnosus was the exclusive site of parvalbumin in the skin. Besides the already known parvalbumin distribution in the brain, parvalbumin is also expressed in distinct cell types of the peripheral nervous system. Leydig cells were found to be the only parvalbumin location in testes. These observations lead us to conclude that parvalbumin in contrast to the multifunctional and constitutive calmodulin must function in Ca2+-dependent processes related to specific cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1589987054,"Transport of S-dinitrophenyl glutathione, a model compound of glutathione S-conjugates, was studied in isolated rat liver canalicular membrane vesicles by a rapid filtration technique. The membrane vesicles exhibited time-dependent uptake of [2-3H]glycine-glutathione conjugate into an osmotically sensitive intravesicular space. Inactivation of vesicle-associated gamma-glutamyltransferase by affinity labeling with L-(alpha-S,5S)-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole-acetic acid had no effect on the initial rate of transport. Chemical analysis revealed that the intact glutathione conjugate accounted for most vesicle-associated radioactivity, reflecting the low transferase activity in the liver and membrane vesicles. The initial rate of transport followed saturation kinetics with respect to conjugate concentrations; an apparent Km of 1.0 mM and Vmax of 1.7 nmol/mg of protein X 20 s were calculated. These results indicate that transport of the glutathione S-conjugate across the canalicular membranes is a carrier-mediated process. Sodium chloride in the transport medium could be replaced by KCl, LiCl, or choline chloride without any changes in transport activity. The rate of conjugate transport was enhanced by a valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential (vesicle-inside-positive). The rate of conjugate uptake was enhanced by replacing KCl in the transport medium with K gluconate, providing a less permeant anion, and was reduced by replacing KCl with KSCN, providing a more permeant anion. These data indicate that conjugate transport is electrogenic and involves the transfer of negative charge. Transport of S-dinitrophenyl glutathione was inhibited by S-benzyl glutathione, oxidized glutathione, or reduced glutathione. This transport system in canalicular membranes may function in biliary secretion of glutathione S-conjugates of xenobiotics whose synthesis in hepatocytes requires glutathione S-transferases."
https://openalex.org/W1621705652,"Singlet oxygen production in the chloroperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-halide system was studied using 1268 nm chemiluminescence. With chloride or bromide ions, singlet oxygen is produced by the mechanism (formula; see text) (formula; see text) where X- is chloride or bromide ion. Under conditions where there is high enzyme activity and when Reaction B is fast relative to Reaction A, singlet oxygen is produced in near stoichiometric amounts. In contrast, when Reaction A is fast relative to Reaction B, oxidized halogen species (chlorine and hypochlorous acid for chloride ion; bromide, tribromide ion, and hypobromous acid for bromide ion) are the principle reaction products. With iodide ion, no 1268 nm chemiluminescence was detected. Past studies have shown that iodine and iodate ion are the major end products of this system."
https://openalex.org/W2160430645,"Labeling of the BC3H1 muscle-like cell line with [3H] palmitate, followed by immunoprecipitation of the acetylcholine receptor, indicated that the alpha and beta subunits of the receptor contain covalently bound fatty acid. After acid hydrolysis, fatty acid methyl esters could be recovered from the isolated [3H]palmitate-labeled alpha subunit. Treatment of differentiated BC3H1 cells with cerulenin, an inhibitor of fatty acid and sterol synthesis and fatty acid acylation of proteins, resulted in a 50% inhibition in expression of the acetylcholine receptor on the cell surface under conditions where there was minimal inhibition of protein synthesis. We conclude that this previously undetected post-translational modification may play a role in assembly and/or surface expression of the acetylcholine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1602078008,"We have studied Fe(III)-citrate and Fe(II)-ascorbate uptake by purified intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles from normal (iron-replete) and iron-deficient mice. In iron-replete mice using a final Fe(III) concentration of 1.43 microM, 25-30 pmol of Fe(III)/mg of protein were bound to the membranes versus 65-70 pmol in iron-deficient mice. Fe(II) uptake in normal mice using a final Fe(II) concentration of 1.79 microM was 1600-1800 pmol/mg of protein versus 3600-4000 pmol in iron-deficient mice. Evidence that Fe(II) was transported into the vesicles by a membrane carrier-mediated process was obtained by observing saturation kinetics under conditions of isotope exchange at equilibrium in mice rendered iron-deficient, but not in iron-replete mice. Eighty per cent of the transported Fe(II) could be removed by strong chelating agents. The remainder was exchangeable with Fe(II) in the medium when measured under equilibrium conditions. We can explain these results by the following model; iron uptake appears to be a 2-fold process. The first step is the transport of Fe(II) across the membrane by a carrier-mediated process which is biologically regulated. The second step is the subsequent binding of iron on the inside of the membrane. The number of binding sites is also regulated by the iron status of the mouse. The membrane binding affinity for Fe(II) appears to be weaker than that for dithiothreitol but stronger than for ascorbate."
https://openalex.org/W1599949829,"Proteoglycan monomer and link protein were prepared from bovine fetal epiphyseal cartilage. Proteoglycan aggregates were reassembled from proteoglycan monomers and hyaluronic acid in the presence or in the absence of link protein at pH 7 and at pH 5. The proteoglycan solutions were spread on nitrocellulose films and examined by electron microscopy. At pH 7, the aggregates formed in the presence of link protein showed dramatic differences in their dimensions, compared with the link protein-free aggregates. The link protein-containing aggregates were five times longer and contained three times as many monomers per aggregates. The mean distance between monomers was twice as long and the spacing between monomers was more regular in the link protein-containing aggregates. Essentially the same differences between link protein-free and link protein-containing proteoglycan aggregates were observed at pH 5. These results show that link protein increases proteoglycan aggregate size by facilitating the binding of more monomers to hyaluronic acid and influences the spacing of monomers along hyaluronic acid chains."
https://openalex.org/W1540207104,"Abstract Structures of the principal O-glycosides from the major cell surface sialoglycoprotein (ASGP-1) of the MAT-B1 and MAT-C1 ascites sublines of the 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma have been determined. Oligosaccharitols were released by alkaline borohydride treatments of ASGP-1 and purified by gel filtration, DEAE-Sephadex ion exchange chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography. On the basis of carbohydrate composition, methylation analysis, periodate oxidation, and exoglycosidase digestion, the five major oligosaccharides released by mild alkaline borohydride were assigned the following structures: Component II-3: (NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6)Ga 1 NAcOH(3----1 betaGa 1 3----2 alpha NeuAc) III-2a: (Ga 1 beta 1----4G1cNAc beta 1----6)Ga 1 NAcOH(3----1 beta Ga 1 3----2 alpha NeuAc) III-2c: (Ga 1 alpha 1----3Ga 1 beta 1----4G1cNAc beta 1----6) Ga 1 NAcOH(3----1 beta Ga 1 3----2 alpha NeuAc) IV-1a: (Ga 1 beta 1----4G 1 cNAc beta 1----6)Ga 1 NAcOH(3----1 beta Ga 1) IV-1c: (Ga 1 alpha 1----3Ga 1 beta 1----4G 1 cNAc beta 1----6) Ga 1 NAcOH(3----1 beta Ga 1) Fucosylated derivatives of III-2a, IV-1a, and IV-1c were found in smaller amounts with the fucose tentatively assigned to the 2-position of the lactosamine galactose. Components II-3, III-2a, and the fucosylated derivative of III-2A were found in both MAT-B1 and MAT-C1 sublines. The alpha-galactosides were found in detectable quantities only in subline MAT-B1. Oligosaccharides from MAT-C1 cells were enriched in sialic acid when compared to those from MAT-B1 cells. These results suggest that the 13762 ascites sublines, which bear different oligosaccharides, will provide models useful for the investigation of mechanisms regulating the expression of structures of the larger O-linked oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1588689785,"Developing embryos of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, incorporate [3H]palmitic acid into at least 20 proteins. The [3H]palmitic acid associated with these proteins is released by alkaline hydrolysis or by treatment with hydroxylamine but not by extensive extraction with chloroform:methanol, indicating that the fatty acids are covalently attached to protein. The finding that the fatty acid is released by hydroxylamine or beta-mercaptoethanol at neutral or even slightly acidic pH suggests that this moiety may be attached to the polypeptide via a thiol ester bond. Concanavalin A-agarose chromatography and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion revealed that 14 of the proteins containing covalently linked fatty acid also contain at least one asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chain. With one exception, all of the fatty acylated proteins are tightly associated with membranes. The rate of incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into the proteins is developmentally regulated. Between fertilization and the onset of gastrulation (approximately 30 h), embryos exhibit a linear, 5.5-fold increase in the rate of incorporation of fatty acid into polypeptide. Incorporation increases an additional 25% during gastrulation, and then remains constant throughout subsequent development to the pluteus stage (approximately 90 h). These findings demonstrate that the fatty acylation of proteins and glycoproteins is not limited to higher organisms, since it occurs during differentiation and embryonic development of a relatively simple invertebrate."
https://openalex.org/W1534179684,"High resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been employed to study the fermentation of glucose to ethanol by Zymomonas mobilis, strain ZM4, a bacterium which uses the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The levels of nucleoside triphosphates, sugar phosphates, UDP-sugars and Pi in intact fermenting cells have been studied with a time resolution of 1 min. It is suggested that a pH gradient is established across the cell membrane during fermentation and that the intracellular pH does not rise above approximately 6.4. 31P resonances from most phosphorus-containing intermediates in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, as well as adenosine and uridine nucleotides and a number of other intracellular metabolites, have been assigned in perchloric extracts of fermenting cells by means of a number of techniques, including two-dimensional homonuclear J-resolved and two-dimensional homonuclear shift-correlated spectroscopy. Quantification of these metabolites in spectra of extracts of fermenting cells indicates that the rate-limiting steps in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in Z. mobilis are the conversions of glucose 6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate and of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate."
https://openalex.org/W1587614597,"The sequences of the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA genes from two divergent species of Paramecium (primaurelia and tetraurelia) were determined. The gene lies near the center of the linear mitochondrial genome, on the same strand as are all other currently identified genes. The sequences generally resemble their counterparts found in cytoplasmic, procaryotic, and other mitochondrial sources. The rDNA gene boundaries were located by nuclease S1 protection. Small subunit rDNA spans about 1680 nucleotides, including an extraneous 83-base pair sequence very near the 3' end which is unique to Paramecium mitochondria. This insert occurs at the apex of the highly variable in length penultimate helix, according to proposed models for small subunit rRNA secondary structure. A discontinuity occurs in isolated rRNA near the start of the insert, resulting in a stable 13 S RNA species and a small segment containing the remaining 3' portion of the gene. The overall rRNA gene sequence was 94% conserved between the two species, and the nucleotide differences consisted of 53% transitions, 37% transversions, and 9% insertions plus deletions. These substitutions were somewhat clustered, and the two most divergent regions coincided with the gene boundaries. The sequence was aligned with Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA for direct comparison of sequence and structure."
https://openalex.org/W1485830865,"Bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH) was oxidized with hydrogen peroxide, and the oxidation products were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Using a shallow gradient, four major peaks (peaks I-IV in order of elution) were identified and completely separated from one another. Peak IV co-eluted with fully reduced PTH. The earliest eluting peak (peak I) could be reduced with mercaptoethylamine to produce all three of the later eluting ones. The second peak could be reduced back to peak IV but not to peak III, while peak III could be oxidized to peak I but not to peak II. These data plus the kinetics of oxidation showed that peaks II and III are intermediate in the generation of I from IV or IV from I, but were not generated from one another. Amino acid analysis showed that peak I contains no methionine and two residues of methionine sulfoxide, peaks II and III one methionine sulfoxide each, and peak IV two residues of methionine and no sulfoxide. Study of the peptides produced from each form of PTH by cleavage with cyanogen bromide showed that peak II is oxidized at methionine 8 and peak III at methionine 18 while peak I is oxidized at both methionines. The biological activity of each peak was determined in the kidney membrane adenylyl cyclase assay. All forms were active but with widely varying potencies (peak IV greater than peak III greater than peak II greater than peak I)."
https://openalex.org/W1587278423,"A stable, reversibly sulfhydryl-modified, Zn2+-free porphobilinogen synthase (mod-apo-PBG synthase) has been prepared using methylmethanethiosulfonate. Mod-apo-PBG synthase prepared from holo-PBG synthase using [methyl-14C]methanethiosulfonate incorporated three thiomethyl groups/subunit. When apo-PBG synthase was prepared using EDTA alone, subsequent reaction with [methyl-14C]methanethiosulfonate resulted in incorporation of only two thiomethyl groups/subunit. Mod-apo-PBG synthase was catalytically inactive and contained less than 0.1 mol of Zn/mol of octameric enzyme; it could be reconstituted to full activity using 2-mercaptoethanol and Zn2+. A variety of metal ions were screened for their ability to reconstitute and/or reactivate mod-apo-PBG synthase. Only Zn2+ and Cd2+ reconstitute mod-apo-PBG synthase to full activity. When comparing mod-apo-PBG synthase prepared from holo-PBG synthase in the presence of EDTA with mod-apo-PBG synthase prepared from holo-PBG synthase in the absence of EDTA, no difference was detected in either Zn content, stoichiometry of 14C-labeling, or kinetic behavior. We have confirmed both the observations that four Zn2+/mol of octameric apoenzyme are necessary for full catalytic activity and that holoenzyme, isolated in the presence of 10 microM ZnCl2, contains eight Zn2+/octamer. The additional four binding sites are not catalytically important. Methylmethanethiosulfonate modification is presented as a generally useful method for the investigation of metalloproteins because it provides a route for the preparation of stable apoproteins and a direct method for metal ion replacement."
https://openalex.org/W1514994753,"The synthesis of poly-gamma-glutamyl derivatives of 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OH-4-NH2-10-CH3-pteroyl-glutamic acid (PteGlu1] was evaluated by direct hydroxylation of the tetraglutamyl derivative of methotrexate (4-NH2-10-CH3-PteGlu4) by a cell-free preparation of rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase and by polyglutamylation of 7-OH-methotrexate in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in vitro. The polyglutamyl derivatives of 7-OH-methotrexate rapidly accumulate in cells to the 7-OH-4-NH2-10-CH3-PteGlu4. While 7-OH-methotrexate monoglutamate does not bind to dihydrofolate reductase, 7-OH-4-NH2-10-CH3-PteGlu4 does bind to the enzyme as established by gel filtration analysis of cell extracts and by use of purified dihydrofolate reductase from Ehrlich cells. Within cells, the rate of formation of 7-OH-methotrexate polyglutamyl derivatives exceeds that for methotrexate by a factor of 2.7 at comparable free monoglutamyl substrate levels, suggesting that 7-OH-methotrexate may be a better substrate than methotrexate for the folylpolyglutamate synthetase. 7-OH-methotrexate slows the rate of methotrexate polyglutamylation in cells, a consequence of the inhibition of methotrexate transport with reduced methotrexate substrate available for polyglutamylation. When 7-OH-methotrexate polyglutamyl derivatives were accumulated inside the cells following which extracellular 7-OH-methotrexate was removed, the monoglutamate, and to a lesser extent the diglutamate, exited the cells whereas the majority of the longer polyglutamyl derivatives were retained and continued to be metabolized to higher forms. These studies suggest that 7-OH-methotrexate and its polyglutamyl derivatives may play a role in modulating methotrexate action, either by their own inhibitory effects on folate-dependent enzymes or by their effects on methotrexate transport and metabolism within cells."
https://openalex.org/W1565016795,"An approach was developed with steady state fluorescence energy transfer measurements to examine the spatial relationship between the two alpha-toxins bound to the acetylcholine receptor. By taking advantage of the slow dissociation rates of alpha-toxins (Naja naja siamensis 3) from the receptor and of the equal probability with which alpha-toxins bind to the two alpha-toxin-binding sites, we derived an equation which allows prediction of a true efficiency of transfer based on the relationship between fractional site occupancy and the observed transfer efficiency ascertained from donor quenching. Using this approach, we examined the efficiency of energy transfer between two fluorescently labeled alpha-toxins, N epsilon-fluorescein isothiocyanate lysine 23 alpha-toxin and monolabeled tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate alpha-toxin bound to the receptor from the Torpedo californica electric organ. Significantly greater (32 versus 14%) energy transfer was observed with the membrane-associated than with the solubilized receptor, suggesting that transfer between fluorophores on separate receptor molecules is greater than that occurring intramolecularly between the two sites on the receptor. The magnitude of the distances calculated from the intrareceptor energy transfer efficiency combined with the considerable inter-receptor energy transfer indicate that the fluorophores would reside on the outer perimeter of the receptor molecule rather than near the central axis perpendicular to the plane of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2026358275,Cone linear sensitivities to red and green stimuli were measured intracellularly in the dark- and light-adapted turtle retina. Test flashes of small diameter were used to minimize horizontal cell feedback. Light adaptation was achieved with either green or red background illumination. The ratio of cone sensitivities to red and green light depended on the color of the background light and differed from the ratio measured in the dark. Electron microscope studies of Golgi-stained turtle cones revealed direct synaptic connections between red and green cones mediated by cone telodendria. These data indicate that the red cone photoresponse is not univariant as has been previously supposed and suggest that mixing of signals from different spectral classes of cones can occur via direct excitatory connections between cones.
https://openalex.org/W1588853694,"Fibronectin synthesized by retinoic acid-treated chondrocytes exhibits a higher apparent subunit molecular weight in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels than fibronectin from untreated cultures. Analyses of peptide fragments show that retinoic acid treatment alters the apparent molecular weight of the collagen-binding fragment. Approximately one-sixth of the carbohydrate moieties on the collagen-binding fragment from control chondrocytes were sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, whereas the collagen-binding fragment from treated chondrocytes was more resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. These findings indicate that chondrocyte fibronectin contains oligosaccharides of the high mannose or hybrid type in contrast to fibroblast fibronectin which only contains complex type carbohydrate chains and that retinoic acid treatment results in a higher proportion of complex type carbohydrate chains on chondrocyte fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1655914581,"Vimentin, the subunit protein of one type of intermediate filament, has been isolated from 32Pi-labeled nonmitotic and mitotic mouse L-929 cells. Analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides by two-dimensional maps indicates that vimentin is phosphorylated at multiple sites in mitotic cells. Comparison of nonmitotic and mitotic vimentin phosphotryptic peptides indicated that in addition to the 6-7 major phosphorylated tryptic peptides found in nonmitotic cells, vimentin isolated from mitotic cells contained an additional 2 distinct phosphorylated peptides following trypsin digestion. Partial acid hydrolysis and one-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis indicates that phosphoserine is present in all 9 major phosphopeptides. Treatment of L-929 cells with 8-bromo-cAMP did not result in a qualitative change in the phosphopeptide map of vimentin isolated from a normal cell population. These results suggest that the reorganization of vimentin filaments during mitosis is accompanied by a site-specific change in phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1518722620,"Abstract Calf thyroid slices were found to incorporate [35S] sulfate into two major plasma membrane glycoproteins, which have been previously designated as GP-1 and GP-3 (Okada, Y., and Spiro, R. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8865-8872). The 35S-glycoproteins were identified on the basis of their characteristic solubility and electrophoretic migration as well as their affinity for Bandeiraea simplicifolia I lectin. After pronase digestion of these glycoproteins, the 35S-label remained associated with the glycopeptides primarily on asparagine-linked carbohydrate units which were released by hydrazinolysis. Examination of the reduced radio-labeled products obtained by nitrous acid cleavage of the hydrazine-liberated oligosaccharides indicated that sulfate esters of N-acetylglucosamine occurred at three locations on the carbohydrate units; two 35S-monosaccharides (2,5-anhydromannitol 4- and 6-sulfate) and one 35S-disaccharide (beta-Gal(1----4)-2,5-anhydromannitol(6-SO4] were formed. The disaccharide is believed to be derived from an internal sulfated N-acetyllactosamine sequence while the monosaccharides most likely originate from 4- and 6-sulfated N-acetylglucosamine residues situated, respectively, at the non-reducing and reducing termini of the oligosaccharide units. Quantitation by NaB[3H]4 reduction of the sulfated saccharides obtained by nitrous acid treatment of hydrazine-released oligosaccharides from unlabeled GP-3 indicated that about 20% of the asparagine-linked carbohydrate units contain sulfate substituents."
https://openalex.org/W1529947068,"Rat liver sterol carrier protein (SCP), a major regulator of lipid metabolism and transport, undergoes a rapid turnover and dramatic circadian variation in amount. The level of SCP was quantitated by a specific immunochemical assay using an antibody to homogeneous liver SCP. During a 12-h dark, 12-h light cycle, liver exhibits a biphasic pattern in SCP level. A 7-fold increase in SCP (i.e. from 1 to 7 mg/g of liver) occurs in the dark period, peaking at the midpoint and returning to basal levels by the beginning of the light period. A similar but smaller pattern of variation in SCP amount occurs in the light cycle. To elucidate the basic mechanism responsible for these changes in SCP level, the relative synthetic rate of SCP and mRNA functional activity for SCP were measured during the dark-light cycle. Alterations in the rate of SCP synthesis can account for the variations in SCP concentration. Although large changes occur in relative synthetic rate, no significant changes were found in the level of mRNA for SCP. Therefore, the circadian rhythm in SCP synthesis and amount does not reflect variations in the concentration of mRNA for SCP, but instead is caused by some mechanism controlling the efficiency of translation of SCP mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1537379107,"We have characterized further the biogenesis in vitro of ornithine transcarbamylase, a homotrimeric mitochondrial matrix enzyme synthesized in the cytoplasm as a larger precursor. When cell-free translation mixtures containing the ornithine transcarbamylase precursor (40 kDa) were chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-200 columns, all of the precursor eluted as aggregates or complexes with molecular weights greater than 200 kDa. None of the precursor bound to a ligand affinity column containing delta-N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-ornithine (delta-PALO), a transition-state analog and competitive inhibitor of carbamyl phosphate binding, which recognizes native ornithine transcarbamylase. In contrast, a significant portion of the labeled mature-sized subunits, formed when intact mitochondria processed the precursor, bound specifically to the delta-PALO column, were eluted by carbamyl phosphate, and chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P-300 column with a mobility identical to that of native, trimeric ornithine transcarbamylase. No such binding to delta-PALO was observed for the mature-sized monomer or dimer, or for the intermediate-sized ornithine transcarbamylase polypeptide. Moreover, processing by a mitochondrial matrix fraction failed to yield trimeric enzyme, despite producing ample amounts of mature-sized monomer. We conclude that delta-PALO recognizes only trimeric ornithine transcarbamylase composed of mature-sized subunits and that such trimers can be assembled in vitro by intact mitochondria following translocation and proteolytic processing."

https://openalex.org/W1575295429,"The direct regulation of testis androgen and progestin biosynthesis by neurohypophysial hormones was investigated in a primary culture of rat testis cells. Treatment with arginine vasotocin (AVT; 10(-6) M) over a 10-day period inhibited the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated testosterone accumulation while enhancing hCG-stimulated progesterone accumulation. Furthermore, treatment with increasing doses (10(-11) - 10(-6) M) of AVT by itself led to dose-dependent increases in the accumulation of pregnenolone (ED50: 8.0 +/- 0.2 X 10(-9) M) and progesterone (ED50: 1.6 +/- 0.3 X 10(-8) M) but not testosterone. Under blockade of pregnenolone metabolism using cyanoketone and spironolactone, AVT, like hCG, stimulated pregnenolone accumulation with an ED50 dose of 5.8 +/- 0.3 X 10(-9) M. Similar effects were observed with several related neurohypophysial hormones, but not with nine unrelated peptides. AVT, arginine vasopressin, and lysine vasopressin were about 100-fold more potent than mesotocin, valitocin, and oxytocin. Pressor (but not antidiuretic or oxytocic)-selective agonists of the neurohypophysial hormones also exerted dose-dependent stimulation of pregnenolone accumulation. Potent pressor (but not oxytocic)-selective antagonistic analogs of the neurohypophysial hormones prevented the AVT-stimulated accumulation of pregnenolone. Thus, the neurohypophysial hormones may exert a direct stimulatory effect on testis pregnenolone and progesterone biosynthesis via putative, pressor-selective recognition sites, and this progestin-stimulatory activity may be partly due to stimulation of steroidogenic steps preceding pregnenolone formation. Since the effective doses of neurohypophysial hormones in vitro are higher than the serum hormone levels, the present results suggest an intratesticular paracrine role for these peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1496975428,"NH+4 ions, at a concentration (0.25 mM) similar to that found in the plasma of patients with hepatic encephalopathy, cause, in vitro, a significant stimulation of the uptake by brain microvessels of large neutral amino acids, without any effect on the uptake of alpha-methylaminoisobutyric acid, glutamic acid, or lysine. Such a stimulation occurs essentially through an increase of the maximal transport capacity (Vmax) of the saturable component. It is apparently mediated by the intracellular formation of glutamine, which is then exchanged, through the L-system of transport, for large neutral amino acids such as leucine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine. At higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 0.5 mM), NH+4 ions cause also a decrease of carrier affinity for neutral amino acids, which counteracts the stimulatory effect on their uptake."

https://openalex.org/W1486934112,"Rates of ferritin accumulation in the L-6 line of rat skeletal myoblasts cultured in the presence of ferric nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA) were measured and found to vary with the extracellular concentration of FeNTA as predicted from dose response experiments. The rate of ferritin accumulation is constant for up to 92 h in these cells after addition of iron, with the exception of the first few hours of synthesis in which the rate is approximately twice that observed at later times. Experiments in which the specific activity of newly synthesized ferritin was calculated implied that the rate of ferritin degradation might be higher in this earlier period as well; pulse-chase experiments confirmed this hypothesis. Ferritin synthesis is thought to be induced by iron in the absence of RNA synthesis. Accordingly, actinomycin D was shown not to inhibit the synthesis of ferritin in response to FeNTA. Rather, a pronounced stimulation of the synthetic rate was observed. Finally, desferrioxamine was shown both to decrease the rate of ferritin synthesis and increase its rate of degradation. Possible mechanisms for these phenomena are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1508135761,"Following preincubation of isolated rat liver mitochondria in the absence of substrate, the carnitine-independent oxidation of octanoate or butyrate was markedly depressed when compared to rates observed with nonpreincubated mitochondria. Carnitine addition prevented the inhibition of octanoate oxidation but not that of butyrate. 2-Tetradecylglycidic acid or Zwittergent 3-08 (Z3-08) completely blocked the effect of carnitine. Replacement of ATP in the nonpreincubated incubation system with ADP mimicked the effect of preincubation by inhibiting octanoate and butyrate oxidation. This inhibition of octanoate oxidation was also prevented by carnitine addition. There was a direct and causal relationship between the ATP/ADP ratio of the total adenine nucleotide pool and the rate of carnitine-independent octanoate oxidation in mitochondria. The depression of octanoate oxidation was associated with a decrease in the intramitochondrial AMP content and intra- and extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios. In a cellular system, incubating isolated hepatocytes with fructose or glycerol to lower the ATP/ADP ratio resulted in greater inhibition of octanoate oxidation by 2-tetradecylglycidic acid. The data suggest that the ATP/ADP ratio may have a role in determining the site of octanoate activation and subsequent route of oxidation."

https://openalex.org/W1587003037,"The fraction of assembled actin and the diffusion coefficients of filamentous and nonfilamentous species have been determined by fluorescence photobleaching recovery. For both Mg2+-induced and K+-induced actin assembly, a higher concentration of cation leads to longer filaments. Cytochalasin D reduces the fraction of actin present as assembled filaments. In the absence of Mg2+, the accompanying increase in diffusion coefficient of the filaments is of an appropriate magnitude to be accounted for by shortening of filaments as a result of net depolymerization. In the presence of Mg2+, cytochalasin D induces a dose-dependent increase in diffusion coefficient up to about a factor of 10. This increase indicates a shortening of filaments consistent with extensive filament cleavage. Under all conditions studied, the unassembled actin is present primarily as monomer."

https://openalex.org/W1555392612,"Two different subcellular sites and mechanisms have been proposed for the hepatic conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide: a microsomal system requiring UDP-glucuronate and a UDP-glucuronate-independent transglucuronidation or dismutase reaction localized at the bile canalicular plasma membrane. To further define these, canalicular plasma membranes were highly purified from rat liver, and the capacity of these to form bilirubin diglucuronide was compared with that of simultaneously isolated hepatic microsomes. The canalicular liver plasma membranes were 48-116-fold enriched over homogenate in various canalicular marker enzyme activities; microsomal contamination was less than 10% based on the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity. No evidence of any conversion of highly purified bilirubin IX alpha monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide was found with canalicular liver plasma membranes either in the absence or presence of UDP-glucuronate. In contrast, digitonin-treated microsomes isolated under similar conditions converted 31% of added bilirubin monoglucuronide (9.4-17.1 microM) into bilirubin diglucuronide in 30 min, the reaction being dependent on UDP-glucuronate. When bilirubin (12.5 microM) was added to the microsomes, 42.3% was converted to bilirubin monoglucuronide and 40.9% to bilirubin diglucuronide in 30 min. These data establish that the endoplasmic reticulum and not the canalicular liver plasma membranes forms bilirubin diglucuronide from bilirubin monoglucuronide and that the reaction requires UDP-glucuronate."

https://openalex.org/W1492847328,"Abstract Measurements of the efficiency of singlet-singlet energy transfer were used to determine the distance between the hydrophobic binding site and the thiol group required for carbohydrate-binding activity of lima bean lectin. 1-Anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate, bound to the hydrophobic binding site by noncovalent interactions, was used as the donor. Two different nonfluorescent probes were used as the acceptors: a mercurial, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, and a maleimide, 4-dimethylaminophenylazophenyl-4'-maleimide. Acceptor was covalently attached to the thiol group at the putative carbohydrate binding site. The efficiency of energy transfer in both the 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate/2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol and and 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate/4-dimethylaminophenylazophenyl-4' -maleimide donor-acceptor systems indicated an apparent distance of 28 A between the two sites, assuming that the transition dipole of the donor is not correlated with respect to that of the acceptor and that each donor is quenched by a single acceptor. Using an alternate model wherein each donor is equally quenched by two acceptors on adjacent subunits, an apparent distance of 33.4 A was calculated. The fact that two donor-acceptor pairs with different Forster's critical distance parameters yielded the same distance between the sites is consistent with our assumption of uncorrelated donor-acceptor transition dipoles."
https://openalex.org/W1580043856,"The action of L-triiodothyronine (T3) on amino acid transport in the GC clonal strain of rat pituitary cells was investigated by measurement of the uptake of the nonmetabolizable amino acid, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB). The uptake of AIB by GC cells appeared to require energy and Na+ and displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In comparison to cultures maintained in the absence of T3, T3 addition resulted in an increase in AIB uptake which seemed due to an increase in the initial rate of AIB transport. T3 addition resulted in increased AIB accumulation at later time points as well. T3 induction of AIB transport did not occur until 3.5 h after addition of T3, and this effect was blocked by cycloheximide. Maximal induction occurred 48 to 72 h later. One-half maximal induction occurred 24 to 48 h after addition of T3. No detectable changes either in AIB uptake or intracellular water space, measured by uptake of the nonmetabolizable sugar, 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, were noted for the first 120 min after addition of T3. Induction of AIB transport occurred at 0.05 nM T3 (total medium concentration) and one-half maximal induction occurred at 0.17 nM T3. The relative potencies of four iodothyronine analogues for AIB transport were in accord with their reported activities in nuclear T3 receptor binding assays. These data suggest that induction of AIB transport by T3 may be mediated by the nuclear T3 receptor and may reflect the pleiotrophic response of GC cells to thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1539933994,"Rabbit cardiac cathepsin D exists as multiple isomeric forms of Mr = 48,000 within cardiac tissue. Their mechanism of formation and their functional role in cardiac protein degradation are unknown. We have previously demonstrated that cathepsin D is initially synthesized as an Mr = 53,000 precursor that is processed by limited proteolysis within cardiac lysosomes to the Mr = 48,000 active forms of the enzyme. To determine if the multiple forms of active cathepsin D originate from a common precursor, isolated perfused Langendorff rabbit hearts were labeled in pulse (15 or 30 min) and pulse-chase (30 or 150 min) experiments with [35S]methionine. Newly synthesized cathepsin D was isolated by butanol/Triton X-100 extraction and immunoadsorption with anti-cathepsin D IgG-Sepharose, and the isomeric forms were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and fluorography. After 15- and 30-min pulse perfusions, 35S-labeled cathepsin D appeared as a single precursor form (Mr = 53,000, pI = 6.6). After 30-min pulse and 30-min chase, the precursor was modified to yield multiple precursor forms, all with molecular weight 53,000, but with differing pI values (6.6-6.0). After 30-min pulse and 150-min chase perfusion, multiple forms of both precursor and proteolytically processed active cathepsin D (Mr = 48,000, pI = 6.2-5.6) were detected. The 35S-labeled, proteolytically processed forms of active cathepsin D co-migrated with the major cathepsin D forms present in cardiac tissue. Subcellular fractionation and perfusions in the presence of chloroquine demonstrated that the multiple precursor forms of cathepsin D originated in a nonlysosomal intracellular compartment. Thus, the multiple forms of active cathepsin D originate from a common high molecular weight precursor, and their synthesis occurs prior to the limited proteolysis of the precursor in cardiac lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1522046040,"Abstract The addition of human fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) (100 units/ml) at the S/G2 boundary of the cell cycle of synchronously grown HeLa cells is characterized by the accumulation of newly synthesized low molecular weight DNA and changes in chromatin assembly. In addition, there is a 3-fold stimulation in the incorporation of tracer amounts of [3H]thymidine, but not [3H] deoxyguanosine, into DNA and a 2-fold increase in the incorporation of [3H]dTTP into the DNA of isolated nuclei. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting by laser flow cytometry revealed that IFN-beta-treated cells were delayed in entering and passing through the S phase. The inhibition of proliferation of HeLa cells treated with IFN-beta is characterized by a 3-fold accumulation of newly synthesized DNA of Mr less than 56 X 10(6) compared to untreated cells as determined by alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation. The newly synthesized DNA in IFN-beta-treated cells was replicative and not repair DNA. The observation that IFN-beta inhibits the processing of newly synthesized low molecular weight DNA into normal DNA might be explained by the intracellular accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine in IFN-beta-treated HeLa cells (de Ferra, F., and Baglioni, C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2118-2121) which could change the soluble ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide pool and ultimately affect DNA processing. Interferon may also affect processing of DNA by interfering with normal chromatin assembly. Evidence for the effect of IFN-beta on chromatin assembly is provided; we have observed a more condensed structure in IFN-beta treated cells by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Simultaneous with the affect on chromatin assembly, there is a 70% decrease in poly(ADP-ribosylation) of either histone and/or non-histone proteins. The loss of coordination between the pool size for DNA synthesis, decreased postsynthetic modifications of chromatin, and normal chromatin formation may explain the inability of the cell to differentiate and to continue cell division."
