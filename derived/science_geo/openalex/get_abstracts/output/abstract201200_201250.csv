https://openalex.org/W1659287181,"A minimal growth medium supplemented with dialyzed serum, which sufficed for the propagation of a wide variety of human cell strains in heavily inoculated monolayer and suspension cultures, did not permit the regular or optimal growth of small numbers of HeLa, HeLa S3, conjunctiva, or KB cells deriving from suspension cultures. At threshold concentrations of serum, the plating efficiency of single cells was greatly reduced as compared with their plating efficiency in a medium containing dialyzed serum instead of whole serum, and the clones which did develop grew at a slower rate. The nutritional deficiency could be overcome by adding the seven amino acids which are ordinarily not nutritionally essential. In most of the experiments serine alone sufficed."

 third author9s name was incorrectly given as John F. Haggerty. The author is John F.

https://openalex.org/W1981924797,"Each mature individual of Serranellus subligarius, regardless of size, has at the same time both motile sperm and eggs. Embryos and larvae were produced from artificial fertilizations and from isolated fish kept in aquaria. Mating behavior of pairs and groups of hermaphrodites shows two types of behavioral patterns involving different color changes."
https://openalex.org/W2073026053,"Pharmacological evidence is presented supporting the theory that the increase in contractile strength of isolated cardiac muscle under suprathreshold stimulation is due to the release of an adrenergic mediator (norepinephrine). However, release of this material does not account for changes in contractile strength associated with changes in frequency of stimulation at threshold levels."

https://openalex.org/W1994834295,The intravenous administration of ammonium acetate to dogs results in measurable levels of free ammonia in expired air. Simultaneous measurement of the physiologic dead space permits the calculation of the partial pressure of ammonia in alveolar air. This finding has implications for ammonium metabolism and transport.
https://openalex.org/W1996892563,The partial pressure of ammonia in alveolar air was measured and found to be the same (within the limits of experimental error) as the calculated partial pressure of ammonia in arterial plasma. It is likely that ammonia is equilibrated between alveolar air and the blood during its passage through the pulmonary capillaries.
https://openalex.org/W2010067743,"The electrical activity of the olfactory bulb was recorded in awake, unrestrained cats with electrodes permanently implanted. It was found that any kind of sensory stimulation producing alertness or arousal brought about the appearance of bursts of rhythmic activity, the magnitude of which was related to the degree of alertness of the cat."
https://openalex.org/W1973329252,"It is concluded that mitochondria are involved in three steps of porphyrin and heme biosynthesis—first, in the formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid from glycine and active succinate; second, in the synthesis of protoporphyrin; third, in the incorporation of iron into the porphyrin ring—that is, in heme formation."

https://openalex.org/W2080301664,Viscosimetric evidence of alginase activity is given for the intestine and the intestinal contents of a sea urchin. The alginase activity of the gut wall and that of the contents of the gut differ in pH optima; this suggests that there may be two sources of alginase. The enzyme (or enzymes) depolymerizes algin.
https://openalex.org/W2067682615,"Moderate doses in rabbits produced hypotension, increased respiratory rate, and myocardial injury. Respiratory arrest occurred with fatal doses when the blood pressure had declined to very low values. The active substance (or substances) was nondialyzable, and the potency of the protein-containing lyophilized or glycerol-treated extracts was maintained well on prolonged storage."

https://openalex.org/W2025068437,"An examination of the molecular architecture of biotin, as determined by x-ray crystallographic analysis, has indicated that biotin may be capable of forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond in solution. A review of various chemical analogs of the vitamin has shown a close correlation between the possibility of forming such a hydrogen bond and biotin-like activity."

https://openalex.org/W1497081616,DE GRAAF1 has recently described a specimen of Xenopus laevis Daudin completely lacking haemoglobin. Another specimen showing a similar condition was found in a practical class in this Department on September 20. The individual was a male measuring 6.5 cm. from the tip of the snout to the vent. Unfortunately it had been partly dissected under tap water and then left for some hours before my attention was directed to the specimen. It was one of a batch of toads delivered from the Trout Hatcheries near Kingwilliamstown in the Eastern Cape Province and had been in the laboratory for only five days before dissection.
https://openalex.org/W1996965744,"Administration of nicotine to rats at any point in pregnancy has no apparent effect upon completion or duration of pregnancy, or upon body development, litter size, weight, or mortality of offspring. These results differ sharply from the effects in mice reported by others. The possible etiologic significance of anoxia in the malformations reported in mice is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1998268373,"Injection of the biocide acrolein into irrigation canals killed submersed weeds, thereby reducing flow resistance and increasing capacity. In a 20-mile canal, 150 gallons raised throughput from 311 to 552 ft(2)/sec. Acrolein also effectively eradicated aquatic snails; it promises to become a useful tool in the battle against Schistosoma blood flukes."
https://openalex.org/W2088271200,"The permissible body burden of Sr(99) is discussed with respect to the mode of intake. It appears that the maximum permissible load may depend on the type of exposure, acute or chronic, the acute being the more serious."

https://openalex.org/W2076407483,"Absolute influx and efflux of potassium-42 have been measured in isolated rabbit atria during acetylcholine-induced fibrillation. The efflux of potassium was increased three to four times; influx was not changed. The data are interpreted as indicating that an inhibition of active K uptake is not involved in the initiation of fibrillation, and that the process results from a marked increase in Na permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2046631457,"Various purification procedures for folic acid were investigated. The criteria of purity were a negative Bratton-Marshall test and the absence of fluorescent spots on paper chromatograms. Since no method provided a pure product, a procedure consisting of cellulose column chromatography followed by filtration through charcoal was developed."

Of 534 Cherokee Indians, both mixed and full bloods, all showed normal hemoglobin. Lumbee Indians of less certain ethnic status had 1.7 percent of hemoglobin S, an equal amount of hemoglobin C, and one possible hemoglobin D trait among 1332 bloods studied."

The descendants of x-rayed survivors showed the following changes, which persisted in culture: destruction and loss of all micronuclei, decrease in vitality and reproductive rate, increase in x-radiation sensitivity, monstrosity, and reduced body size."

https://openalex.org/W2027814175,Approximately 40 microM 2-diethylaminoethanol (DEAE) caused 50-percent inhibition of growth of the main axis. Inhibition was relieved by 2-dimethylaminoethanol and choline but not by ethanolamine. A marked morphogenetic effect of DEAE is attributed to differences in sensitivity of main and lateral meristems and to an effect upon the postulated hormonal system controlling apical dominance.
https://openalex.org/W2080878103,"A substance was extracted from rabbit liver which inhibited the incorporation of formate into bone-marrow thymine in vitro. In view of the important role of thymine biosynthesis in cell division, it is suggested that the inhibitor present in liver is a naturally occurring mitosis inhibitor."

Conditions for occurrence of the illusion are outlined, as well as conditions under which it is not reported."
