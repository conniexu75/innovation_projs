However, the mechanisms of protein retention at the most destructive chromosomal lesions, the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), are poorly understood. We show that RNF8, a RING-finger ubiquitin ligase, rapidly assembles at DSBs via interaction of its FHA domain with the phosphorylated adaptor protein MDC1. This is accompanied by an increase in DSB-associated ubiquitylations and followed by accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 repair proteins. Knockdown of RNF8 or disruption of its FHA or RING domains impaired DSB-associated ubiquitylation and inhibited retention of 53BP1 and BRCA1 at the DSB sites. In addition, we show that RNF8 can ubiquitylate histone H2A and H2AX, and that its depletion sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation. These data suggest that MDC1-mediated and RNF8-executed histone ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by licensing the DSB-flanking chromatin to concentrate repair factors near the DNA lesions.

These data suggest that MDC1-mediated and RNF8-executed histone ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by licensing the DSB-flanking chromatin to concentrate repair factors near the DNA lesions. Among the most prominent cytological manifestations of DNA breakage is formation of the ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF). These nuclear structures reflect local chromatin expansion, posttranslational modifications of histones, and assembly of diverse proteins in the vicinity of chromosomal lesions (Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2004Fernandez-Capetillo O.

In mammals, phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) by the ATM kinase is among the most proximal DSB-induced histone modifications and the prerequisite for the sustained retention of signaling and repair proteins. Specifically, the proteins that avidly accumulate on the γ-H2AX-marked chromatin include the components of the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 (MRN) complex, the ATM kinase, and a group of large adaptor proteins such as MDC1, 53BP1, and BRCA1 (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Kitagawa R. Melander F. Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Spatial organization of the Mamm. Genome surveillance machinery in response to DNA strand breaks.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The increased concentration of these proteins is believed to enhance the effectiveness of genome surveillance mechanisms by amplifying ATM signaling and increasing the efficiency of DSB repair (Lukas et al., 2004bLukas J. Lukas C. Bartek J. Mammalian cell cycle checkpoints: signalling pathways and their organization in space and time.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The assembly of proteins at the DSB-flanking chromatin proceeds with distinct temporal patterns, suggesting that the formation of the DSB-induced chromatin microenvironment is a hierarchical and highly regulated process (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2005Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas J. Dynamic assembly and sustained retention of 53BP1 at the sites of DNA damage are controlled by Mdc1/NFBD1.J.

Lukas J. Mdc1 couples DNA double-strand break recognition by Nbs1 with its H2AX-dependent chromatin retention.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The key interaction module engaged in direct binding to γ-H2AX resides in the BRCT domains of MDC1 (Stucki et al., 2005Stucki M. Clapperton J.A. Mohammad D. Yaffe M.B. Smerdon S.J. Jackson S.P. MDC1 directly binds phosphorylated histone H2AX to regulate cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks.Cell. 2005; 123: 1213-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). MDC1 is among the first proteins to accumulate at the DSB sites (Lukas et al., 2004aLukas C. Melander F. Stucki M. Falck J. Bekker-Jensen S. Goldberg M. Lerenthal Y. Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mdc1 couples DNA double-strand break recognition by Nbs1 with its H2AX-dependent chromatin retention.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and the assembly of the γ-H2AX-MDC1 complex seems to be required for retention of most other proteins in these regions (Stucki and Jackson, 2006Stucki M. Jackson S.P. gammaH2AX and MDC1: anchoring the DNA-damage-response machinery to broken chromosomes.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MDC1 binding shields the C-terminal tail of γ-H2AX against premature dephosphorylation (Stewart et al., 2003Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M. Elledge S.J. MDC1 is a mediator of the mammalian DNA damage checkpoint.Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, Stucki et al., 2005Stucki M. Clapperton J.A. Mohammad D. Yaffe M.B.

MDC1 directly binds phosphorylated histone H2AX to regulate cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks.Cell. 2005; 123: 1213-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), a feature that helps maintain a favorable chromatin configuration until the completion of the DSB repair. Thus, MDC1 emerges as the “master regulator” determining the formation of a specific chromatin microenvironment required for genomic stability. The way MDC1 promotes chromatin retention of other proteins involves at least two distinct mechanisms. First, there is biochemical evidence that the retention of NBS1 at the DSB-flanking chromatin is mediated by its direct interaction with MDC1 (Goldberg et al., 2003Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J. Jackson S.P. MDC1 is required for the intra-S-phase DNA damage checkpoint.Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, Lukas et al., 2004aLukas C. Melander F. Stucki M. Falck J. Bekker-Jensen S. Goldberg M. Lerenthal Y. Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mdc1 couples DNA double-strand break recognition by Nbs1 with its H2AX-dependent chromatin retention.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, Stewart et al., 2003Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M. Elledge S.J. MDC1 is a mediator of the mammalian DNA damage checkpoint.Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Real-time imaging of living cells supports this model by showing that MDC1 and NBS1 accumulate at the DSB-flanking chromatin very rapidly and with the same kinetics (Lukas et al., 2004aLukas C. Melander F. Stucki M. Falck J. Bekker-Jensen S. Goldberg M. Lerenthal Y. Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mdc1 couples DNA double-strand break recognition by Nbs1 with its H2AX-dependent chromatin retention.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Because NBS1 also directly binds ATM (Falck et al., 2005Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Conserved modes of recruitment of ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs to sites of DNA damage.Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, You et al., 2005You Z. Chahwan C. Bailis J. Hunter T. Russell P. ATM activation and its recruitment to damaged DNA require binding to the C terminus of Nbs1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5363-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), the MDC1-mediated retention of NBS1 has a crucial physiological significance for the initial stages of the DSB response as it promotes spreading of γ-H2AX from the initial breakage sites and facilitates other ATM-dependent phosphorylations (Stucki and Jackson, 2006Stucki M. Jackson S.P. gammaH2AX and MDC1: anchoring the DNA-damage-response machinery to broken chromosomes.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Second, although the retention of 53BP1 at the DSB sites is also dependent on MDC1, its accumulation at the DSB-flanking chromatin is significantly delayed (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2005Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas J. Dynamic assembly and sustained retention of 53BP1 at the sites of DNA damage are controlled by Mdc1/NFBD1.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, and the fact that 53BP1 interacts with DSBs via binding to constitutively methylated residues on histones (Botuyan et al., 2006Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G.

Zgheib O. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Gorgoulis V.G. Zacharatos P. Petty T.J. Sheston E.A. Mellert H.S. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Methylated lysine 79 of histone H3 targets 53BP1 to DNA double-strand breaks.Nature. 2004; 432: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that MDC1 promotes higher-order chromatin restructuring that may increase the accessibility of histone marks. Alternatively, the formation of the γ-H2AX-MDC1 complex may promote additional modifications of the DSB-flanking chromatin that in conjunction with methylated histones increase the affinity for 53BP1. Although intriguing, our understanding of the dynamics (and indeed the purpose) of the DSB-induced chromatin response is only rudimentary, and the above concepts leave several unanswered questions. Most notably, although it has been shown that the MDC1-NBS1 interaction requires the intact FHA domain of the latter protein (Lukas et al., 2004aLukas C. Melander F. Stucki M. Falck J. Bekker-Jensen S. Goldberg M. Lerenthal Y. Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mdc1 couples DNA double-strand break recognition by Nbs1 with its H2AX-dependent chromatin retention.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the exact structural requirements for this interaction are not understood, and whether other proteins accumulate at the DSB sites via direct binding to MDC1 has not been determined. Even more elusive are the structural and/or posttranslational events that operate between the rapid assembly of the γ-H2AX-MDC1 complexes and the delayed accumulation of 53BP1. Finally, chromatin retention of BRCA1 is also regulated by MDC1 (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Kitagawa R. Melander F. Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Spatial organization of the Mamm. Genome surveillance machinery in response to DNA strand breaks.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, Lou et al., 2003Lou Z.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13599-13602Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and requires at least two additional proteins, RAP80 and ABRA1 (Kim et al., 2007Kim H. Chen J. Yu X.

The ubiquitin-interacting motif containing protein RAP80 interacts with BRCA1 and functions in DNA damage repair response.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6647-6656Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, how MDC1 functionally interacts with the RAP80-ABRA1 complex to regulate chromatin retention of BRCA1 remains an outstanding puzzle in the biology of this important tumor suppressor. In this study, we attempted to resolve these issues. We performed a bioinformatic search for proteins that contain structural motifs shared by the established DSB regulators and tested their ability to accumulate at the DSB-modified chromatin. By this approach, we identified RNF8, a member of the RING-finger-containing nuclear factors (Ito et al., 2001Ito K. Adachi S. Iwakami R. Yasuda H. Muto Y. Seki N. Okano Y. N-terminally extended human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) mediate the ubiquitination of RING-finger proteins, ARA54 and RNF8.Eur. J.

The RING finger protein RNF8 recruits UBC13 for lysine 63-based self polyubiquitylation.J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which contains a phosphothreonyl-binding FHA domain at its N terminus and a RING-finger domain at the C terminus (Figure 1A). Both domains have been previously identified in chromatin-associated DSB regulators such as NBS1 and MDC1 (the FHA domain) (Stracker et al., 2004Stracker T.H. Theunissen J.W. Morales M. Petrini J.H. The Mre11 complex and the metabolism of chromosome breaks: the importance of communicating and holding things together.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, Stucki and Jackson, 2006Stucki M. Jackson S.P. gammaH2AX and MDC1: anchoring the DNA-damage-response machinery to broken chromosomes.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) or the BRCA1-BARD1 complex (the RING domain) (Boulton, 2006Boulton S.J. Cellular functions of the BRCA tumour-suppressor proteins.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Importantly, both green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged RNF8 (Figures S1A and S1B) and endogenous RNF8 avidly accumulated in IRIF and in microlaser-generated DSB tracks, respectively (Figures 1B–1E), and several pieces of evidence indicated that this DNA damage-induced accumulation reflected targeting of RNF8 to the DSB-flanking chromatin. Thus, GFP-RNF8 spanned the entire chromatin regions marked by γ-H2AX (Figure 1C, left). In addition, GFP-RNF8 accumulation at the DSBs was equally robust throughout interphase (Figure 1C, right), a feature shared by all known components of the DSB-flanking chromatin (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Kitagawa R. Melander F. Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Spatial organization of the Mamm. Genome surveillance machinery in response to DNA strand breaks.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). But most significantly, the DSB-induced accumulation of RNF8 was abrogated after siRNA-mediated ablation of MDC1, the key upstream regulator of the DSB-induced chromatin response (Figure 1F). Together, these data suggest that RNF8 is a new DSB regulator that interacts with the DSB-flanking chromatin. To elucidate how RNF8 interacts with the DSB sites, we asked whether it binds MDC1. Indeed, endogenous RNF8 and MDC1 interacted in a coimmunoprecipitation assay (Figure 2A), and we set out to explore the structural basis of this interaction. While the wild-type (WT) and RING-deficient (C403S; ∗RING) versions of RNF8 bound MDC1 (Figure 2B), a point mutation of a conserved residue within the FHA domain of RNF8 (R42A; ∗FHA) abolished the interaction (Figure 2B). Consistently, the GFP-tagged ∗FHA version of RNF8 failed to form nuclear foci after ionizing radiation (IR), whereas the wild-type protein or the ∗RING mutant avidly accumulated at DSBs (Figure 2C). We then performed a deletion analysis of the MDC1 N terminus and found that the region between amino acids 698 and 800 was necessary and sufficient for RNF8 binding (Figure S2A). This region of MDC1 contains three conserved T-Q-X-F clusters (Figure S2B) fulfilling the criteria for ATM/ATR substrates (Shiloh, 2003Shiloh Y. ATM and related protein kinases: safeguarding genome integrity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). While single or double substitutions of the threonine residues with alanines had little effect on binding of MDC1 to RNF8 (our unpublished data), simultaneous threonine mutations in all three clusters (designated as 3A) completely abolished this interaction (Figure 2D). To validate that the T-Q-X-F clusters could be phosphorylated in vivo, we exposed cells expressing the wild-type or the 3A fragments of MDC1 to IR and analyzed the immunopurified MDC1 proteins by immunoblotting with an antibody to phosphorylated SQ/TQ motifs (the consensus sites for ATM/ATR targets). Although wild-type MDC1 was phosphorylated to some extent even in nonirradiated cells (likely due to the low intrinsic ATM/ATR activity), this phosphorylation markedly increased after exposing the cells to IR, and mutation of the T-Q-X-F clusters impaired both the basal and the IR-induced phosphorylation of MDC1 (Figure 2E). Consistently, while FLAG-RNF8 and endogenous MDC1 interacted to some extent in unstressed cells, this interaction was enhanced after IR (Figure 2F). Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of the conserved T-Q-X-F clusters of MDC1 and the integrity of the FHA domain of RNF8 are required to mediate the interaction between these two proteins. To test the significance of the MDC1-RNF8 interaction directly in cells, we downregulated endogenous MDC1 by shRNA (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Kitagawa R. Melander F. Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Spatial organization of the Mamm. Genome surveillance machinery in response to DNA strand breaks.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and reintroduced into these cells either WT or the 3A version of MDC1 (both full-length and resistant to the shRNA) together with GFP-RNF8. As expected, the MDC1 knockdown abolished accumulation of GFP-RNF8 at the sites of DNA damage (Figure 2G, top). Strikingly, although MDC1-WT and MDC1-3A were expressed to similar levels (Figure S3A) and formed readily discernible IR-induced foci (Figure 2G, bottom), only the WT protein was able to restore GFP-RNF8 accumulation at the DSB sites (Figure 2G, bottom). Interestingly, while mutation of the T-Q-X-F clusters completely uncoupled MDC1 from RNF8 (Figures 2D and 2G), the same MDC1-3A mutant remained fully proficient to interact with NBS1 (Figure S3B) and support NBS1 focus formation (Figure S3C). Because NBS1 also contains an FHA domain, which is required for its interaction with MDC1 and accumulation at the DSB sites (Lukas et al., 2004aLukas C. Melander F. Stucki M. Falck J. Bekker-Jensen S. Goldberg M. Lerenthal Y. Jackson S.P. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mdc1 couples DNA double-strand break recognition by Nbs1 with its H2AX-dependent chromatin retention.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), these data support the emerging concept of MDC1 as a molecular matchmaker capable of organizing multiple signaling and repair factors in the vicinity of DNA breaks and suggest that the main purpose of the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of the T-Q-X-F clusters is to recruit RNF8. To investigate the function of RNF8 at the sites of DNA damage, we applied a kinetic assay based on microlaser-generated DSBs coupled with a real-time imaging of protein redistribution (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Kitagawa R. Melander F. Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Spatial organization of the Mamm. Genome surveillance machinery in response to DNA strand breaks.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, Lukas et al., 2003Lukas C. Falck J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Lukas J. Distinct spatiotemporal dynamics of mammalian checkpoint regulators induced by DNA damage.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). By this approach, we found that the accumulation of GFP-RNF8 in the microirradiated regions was extremely rapid: the first signs of local concentration of GFP-RNF8 were detectable in less than a minute, and the steady-state accumulation in the DSB areas was reached between 6 and 8 min after microirradiation (Figure 3A, top). We noticed that while the assembly kinetics of GFP-RNF8 was similar to that of GFP-MDC1 (Figure 3A, middle), it appeared faster than the accumulation of GFP-BRCA1 (Figures 3A, bottom and S1C). This prompted us to compare the kinetic parameters of all core components of the DSB-flanking chromatin under strictly identical conditions (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2005Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas J. Dynamic assembly and sustained retention of 53BP1 at the sites of DNA damage are controlled by Mdc1/NFBD1.J.

Lukas J. Mdc1 couples DNA double-strand break recognition by Nbs1 with its H2AX-dependent chromatin retention.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2674-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensities of MDC1, NBS1, 53BP1, BRCA1, and RNF8 (all GFP-tagged, stably expressed in an isogenic parental cell line, and tested for their functionality) revealed that their accumulation at the DSB-flanking chromatin clusters into two distinct kinetic groups: the “early” group comprising MDC1, NBS1, and RNF8, followed by the “late” group including 53BP1 and BRCA1 (Figure 3B). The delayed assembly of BRCA1 was confirmed at the level of endogenous proteins by comparing its accumulation with that of 53BP1, the known late component of the DSB-modified chromatin (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2005Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas J. Dynamic assembly and sustained retention of 53BP1 at the sites of DNA damage are controlled by Mdc1/NFBD1.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Figure S4A). Conversely, we found that endogenous RNF8 accumulated at the DSB sites as early as MDC1, the most upstream protein to arrive at the γ-H2AX-marked chromatin (Figure S4B). Finally, the assembly of ATR, a protein that specifically interacts with single-stranded DNA generated by DSB resection (Cortez et al., 2001Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. ATR and ATRIP: partners in checkpoint signaling.Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, Bekker-Jensen et al., 2006Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Kitagawa R. Melander F.

Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), was significantly delayed compared to both early and late chromatin assembly waves (Figure 3B), suggesting that the chromatin response in general precedes the DNA-end resection. Collectively, these results demonstrated that our experimental conditions were sensitive enough to temporally dissect the DSB-induced chromatin formation, and that RNF8 is among the first proteins to assemble in this compartment. The finding that the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 at DSBs was delayed, dependent on MDC1 (Bekker-Jensen et al., 2005Bekker-Jensen S. Lukas C. Melander F. Bartek J. Lukas J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13599-13602Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) yet each independent of the other (Figure S5), suggested that both 53BP1 and BRCA1 share a common, MDC1-regulated denominator required for their productive retention in the DSB-flanking chromatin. Since RNF8 binds MDC1, accumulates rapidly at the DSB sites, and contains a RING domain typical for the E3 ubiquitin ligases (Ito et al., 2001Ito K. Adachi S. Iwakami R. Yasuda H. Muto Y. Seki N. Okano Y. N-terminally extended human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) mediate the ubiquitination of RING-finger proteins, ARA54 and RNF8.Eur. J.

The RING finger protein RNF8 recruits UBC13 for lysine 63-based self polyubiquitylation.J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we reasoned that it, and its enzymatic activity, might couple the assembly of MDC1 with the ensuing accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1. To test this hypothesis, we first asked whether regulatory ubiquitylation as such contributes to the accumulation of DSB regulators on the DNA damage-modified chromatin. We exploited the recent findings showing that inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes a rapid depletion of free nuclear ubiquitin due to accumulation of nondegraded polyubiquitylated proteins in the cytosol (Dantuma et al., 2006Dantuma N.P. Groothuis T.A. Salomons F.A. Neefjes J. A dynamic ubiquitin equilibrium couples proteasomal activity to chromatin remodeling.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Indeed, also in our cellular system proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 triggered progressive translocation of GFP-ubiquitin, as well as the ubiquitin-protein conjugates, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a process that was completed between 60 and 90 min after MG132 addition (Figure S6A). This was accompanied by a loss of monoubiquitylated histones (Figure S6B), confirming a severe impairment of regulatory ubiquitylations in the nucleus (Dantuma et al., 2006Dantuma N.P. Groothuis T.A. Salomons F.A. Neefjes J. A dynamic ubiquitin equilibrium couples proteasomal activity to chromatin remodeling.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Strikingly, such depletion of free nuclear ubiquitin had a very differential impact on the ability of proteins to accumulate at the DSB-flanking chromatin. When cells were pretreated with MG132 and then subjected to laser microirradiation, the pattern and extent of the γ-H2AX-decorated chromatin developed normally, and MDC1, NBS1, and RNF8 (the early kinetic group) accumulated at the DSB sites (Figure 3C, top panels). In contrast, the accumulation of BRCA1 and 53BP1 (the late kinetic group) was abrogated under these conditions (Figure 3C, bottom panels). Consistently, when assayed in cells that had been first microirradiated and only then challenged with MG132, 53BP1 (the late assembly group) but not NBS1 (the early assembly group) dissociated from the microirradiated compartments with the kinetics that mirrored the pace of the nuclear ubiquitin depletion (Figure S6A). Thus, while regulatory ubiquitylation is not required for the initial DSB-induced chromatin response, it appears essential for generating conditions permissive for the second wave of protein accumulation. We then designed two independent RNF8-targeting siRNA oligonucleotides, each of which efficiently downregulated RNF8 (Figure S7A). Strikingly, RNF8 knockdown essentially recapitulated chemical depletion of the free nuclear ubiquitin by allowing normal assembly of MDC1 and NBS1 (Figure 4A, left panels) but preventing accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 at the DSB-flanking chromatin (Figure 4A, right panels). The residual BRCA1 retention in the microirradiated regions was not unexpected given that a fraction of BRCA1 directly binds DNA (Paull et al., 2001Paull T.T. Cortez D. Bowers B. Elledge S.J.

Here we show that RNF8, a FHA/RING domain-containing protein, plays a critical role in the early DNA-damage response. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the FHA domain structure at 1.35 Å. We have shown that RNF8 facilitates the accumulation of checkpoint mediator proteins BRCA1 and 53BP1 to the damaged chromatin, on one hand through the phospho-dependent FHA domain-mediated binding of RNF8 to MDC1, on the other hand via its role in ubiquitylating H2AX and possibly other substrates at damage sites. Moreover, RNF8-depleted cells displayed a defective G2/M checkpoint and increased IR sensitivity. Together, our study implicates RNF8 as a novel DNA-damage-responsive protein that integrates protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation signaling and plays a critical role in the cellular response to genotoxic stress.

Faithful duplication and segregation of DNA is essential to maintain genomic integrity during cell division. DNA lesions elicit a DNA-damage response, which collectively includes DNA repair, activation of cell-cycle checkpoints, chromatin remodeling, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. Mutations in a variety of components involved in these cellular processes directly contribute to tumorigenesis (Bartkova et al., 2005Bartkova J. Horejsi Z. Koed K. Kramer A. Tort F. Zieger K.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX to create γ-H2AX is the initial signal for subsequent accumulation of various mediators/repair proteins to DNA lesions (Bassing et al., 2003Bassing C.H.

A positive feedback loop has been proposed in which ATM/ATR concentrates at γ-H2AX-containing double-strand breaks via MDC1 to further phosphorylate adjacent H2AX molecules and amplify the DNA-damage signal (Lou et al., 2006Lou Z.

Through this signal amplification step, a number of mediator/repair proteins, including BRCA1 and 53BP1, concentrate to sites of DNA damage to facilitate downstream checkpoint activation. We and others have previously demonstrated that tandem BRCT domains serve as phosphopeptide binding motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions (Manke et al., 2003Manke I.A. Lowery D.M.

In addition to tandem BRCT domains, the FHA domain constitutes a separate class of phosphopeptide binding modules (Durocher et al., 2000Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. The molecular basis of FHA domain:phosphopeptide binding specificity and implications for phosphodependent signaling mechanisms.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Many FHA domain-containing proteins have been reported to play a role in DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, and pre-mRNA processing (Sun et al., 1998Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Rad53 FHA domain associated with phosphorylated Rad9 in the DNA damage checkpoint.Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2000Li J. Lee G.I. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. The FHA domain mediates phosphoprotein interactions.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reversibility and sequence selectivity of ligand binding afforded by these and other phosphopeptide binding domain-containing proteins allows individual protein-protein interactions that control downstream responses to be tightly regulated in a stimulus-dependent manner. Recent studies have provided additional insight into the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the DNA-damage signaling network. However, the detailed mechanisms by which the initial γ-H2AX signal at DNA lesions becomes propagated, amplified, and modified to concentrate checkpoint mediator proteins to these sites remain obscure. Here we report our study of an FHA and RING domain-containing protein, RNF8, which serves as the molecular linker for communication between the protein phosphorylation and protein ubiquitylation pathways that are crucial for the activation and maintenance of the DNA-damage response. We have previously studied the role of the FHA domain and RING domain-containing protein Chfr in mitosis (Yu et al., 2005Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. et al.Chfr is required for tumor suppression and Aurora A regulation.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the course of these studies we used a protein named RNF8 as a control because it is the only other known mammalian protein that shares a similar domain organization with Chfr (Figure S1A). RNF8 was initially reported to interact with class III human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) through its RING domain (Ito et al., 2001Ito K. Adachi S. Iwakami R. Yasuda H. Muto Y. Seki N. Okano Y. N-terminally extended human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) mediate the ubiquitination of RING-finger proteins, ARA54 and RNF8.Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2725-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). RNF8 was later shown to bind to the Retinoid X Receptor and regulate its transcriptional activity (Takano et al., 2004Takano Y. Adachi S. Okuno M. Muto Y. Yoshioka T. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Tsurumi H. Ito K. Friedman S.L. Moriwaki H. et al.The RING finger protein, RNF8, interacts with retinoid X receptor alpha and enhances its transcription-stimulating activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18926-18934Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because several FHA domain-containing proteins are known to play a role in DNA-damage signaling, we investigated whether RNF8 or Chfr might participate in the DNA-damage response. Cells stably expressing tagged RNF8 or Chfr were irradiated. Interestingly and surprisingly, RNF8 foci can be readily observed after DNA damage, and these foci colocalized with the DNA-damage marker γ-H2AX (Figure S1A). Despite the resemblance of RNF8 and Chfr (Figure S1A), we did not observe any Chfr focus formation following DNA damage (Figure 1A), indicating that these two related proteins have distinct cellular functions. To confirm the observed IR-induced focus localization of RNF8, we generated a polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing RNF8 (Figure S1B). IR-induced foci (IRIF) of endogenous RNF8 can be readily visualized (Figure 1B). The fact that RNF8 foci overlap with those of γ-H2AX prompted us to speculate that RNF8 might function in the DNA-damage response. We therefore examined the localization of RNF8 with several proteins known to be involved in this damage-induced signaling cascade. As expected, RNF8 colocalizes with MDC1, NBS1, 53BP1, BRCA1, pATM, and MCPH1, further lending credence to the potential role of RNF8 in the DNA-damage response (Figure S1C). The DNA-damage-induced focus formation of checkpoint proteins reflects their localization to chromatin structures at the vicinity of DNA breaks. Indeed, increased amount of RNF8 accumulated in the acid extractable fraction after IR treatment (Figure 1C). Moreover, the less-soluble fraction of RNF8 can be released by nuclease treatment (Figure 1D), suggesting that RNF8 accumulates at the chromatin upon DNA damage. Together, our studies suggest that RNF8 is a novel DNA-damage-responsive protein. It is generally accepted that the phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX is the initial signal upon DNA lesion detection. γ-H2AX is required for the sustained localization of a number of DNA-damage mediator/repair factors at chromatin regions at or near the sites of DNA damage (Paull et al., 2000Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. A critical role for histone H2AX in recruitment of repair factors to nuclear foci after DNA damage.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). To delineate where RNF8 fits in the established DNA-damage signaling cascade, we examined IRIF formation of RNF8 in a number of human or mouse cells with deficiencies in various DNA-damage checkpoint proteins. Our anti-RNF8 antibody could not detect endogenous RNF8 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), so we used retroviral particles containing a RNF8 expression construct to infect these cells (Figure 1E). In sharp contrast to the control wild-type (WT) MEFs, no IR-induced RNF8 focus formation was observed in H2AX-deficient MEFs or those reconstituted with the S139A phosphomutant (Figures 1E and S1D). Likewise, RNF8 focus formation was also abrogated in MDC1-deficient cells. On the other hand, RNF8 relocalization to γ-H2AX-containing foci is not noticeably affected in cells with BRCA1, 53BP1, or NBS1 deficiency (Figure 1E). These data suggest that RNF8 acts downstream of H2AX and MDC1 in the DNA-damage-responsive pathway. The FHA domain is a phosphoprotein-binding module (Durocher et al., 2000Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B.

The FHA domain mediates phosphoprotein interactions.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 1F shows that tagged WT RNF8 formed foci that colocalize with γ-H2AX following IR treatment. Similarly, foci formation can also be observed for the delRING mutant. On the other hand, the FHA deletion mutant (i.e., delFHA) failed to localize to γ-H2AX-containing foci, suggesting that the FHA domain of RNF8 is important for targeting RNF8 to IR-induced DNA-damage sites (Figure S1E). FHA domains, like tandem BRCT domains, recognize amino acid sequences extending 3–4 residues around a central phosphorylated amino acid, with selection determined primarily by residues in the third C-terminal (+3) position (Durocher et al., 2000Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to BRCT domains that recognize both pSer- and pThr-containing sequences, FHA domains appear only to recognize pThr-containing motifs. We determined the optimal phosphopeptide motifs recognized by the RNF8 FHA domain using pThr-oriented peptide library screening (Figure 2A). Intriguingly, the RNF8 FHA domain showed strong selection for Tyr and Phe in the +3 position. This selection for aromatic amino acids differs substantially from the acidic and aliphatic residue selection in the +3 position shown by all other FHA domains for which X-ray crystal structures are available (Durocher et al., 2000Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B.

Instead, this selection for aromatic amino acids at the +3 position closely resembles the optimal phosphopeptide motifs recognized by the tandem BRCT domains of BRCA1 and MDC1 (Manke et al., 2003Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B.

Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. The BRCT domain is a phospho-protein binding domain.Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). To investigate the structural basis for this unusual motif selection, we used limited proteolysis to map the boundaries of the FHA domain and solved the high-resolution structure of the RNF8 FHA:optimal phosphopeptide complex by X-ray crystallography at 1.35 Å (Table S1; the PDB code for the RNF8 FHA domain is 2PIE). The global fold of the RNF8 FHA domain is an 11-stranded β sandwich with the phosphopeptide-binding surface comprised of residues in loops that connect the β-strands at one end of the sandwich (Figure 2B), similar to what has been previously observed in the crystal structures of Rad53 and Chk2 FHA domains (Durocher et al., 2000Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1045-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The bound phosphopeptide is in an extended conformation with extensive contacts between the peptide backbone and side chain and main chain atoms from the RNF8 FHA domain (Figure 2C). Three structural features observed in the RNF8 FHA:phosphopeptide complex are distinct from those in other FHA domains: First, the RNF8 FHA domain contains two divergent loops and a C-terminal α-helical extension that cluster along one face of the domain, well removed from the phosphopeptide-interacting surface (Figure 2B, shaded red). This region is likely involved in phospho-independent interactions with potential substrates or with additional portions of the full-length RNF8 molecule. Second, the RNF8 FHA domain makes extensive direct contacts to the phosphate group, including a novel bidentate interaction involving Arg61 that is not observed in any other FHA domain:phosphopeptide crystal structure (Figure 2D). Third, the selectivity for Tyr/Phe in the +3 position results from its interaction with a flat, mostly nonpolar surface relatively enriched in sulfur-containing amino acids (Cys55, Met58, Val110, and Leu112). Interestingly, the general character of the interaction between the +3 Tyr and the surface of the RNF8 FHA domain is strikingly similar to that observed between the +3 Tyr residue of a γ-H2AX pSer-containing phosphopeptide and the surface of the tandem BRCT domains of MDC1 critical for MDC1 foci formation (Figures 2E and 2F). On the other hand, the RNF8 FHA domain +3 interacting surface bears little resemblance to the analogous surfaces in other FHA domains (Figures 2G and 2H). Thus, it appears that the pThr-binding FHA domain of RNF8 has evolved to bind to similar motifs as those recognized by the BRCT domains of the foci-forming proteins BRCA1 and MDC1. We directly investigated whether phospho-dependent binding was critical for IRIF formation of RNF8. We found that mutation of Arg61 to Gln reduced FHA domain:phosphopeptide binding by over 160-fold (Figures S2A and S2B). When the full-length RNF8 R61Q mutant protein was introduced into cells, no R61Q foci were observed after radiation damage (Figure S2C), indicating that phospho-dependent binding is required for interaction between the RNF8 FHA domain and its upstream binding partner. In an experiment with cell lysates, WT RNF8 could be pulled down with a phospho-Ser-containing peptide derived from γ-H2AX (Figure S2D) but not with the control unphosphorylated peptide. This interaction was totally abolished in experiments with the delFHA or R61Q mutant proteins. Furthermore, consistent with the previous observation that Chfr does not form IRIF, Chfr did not bind to the phosphorylated H2AX peptide (Figure S2E). Although RNF8 bound to phospho-H2AX peptides in a pulldown experiment, we failed to detect any direct binding between the RNF8 FHA domain and a phospho-H2AX peptide by isothermal titration calorimetry (data not shown), raising the possibility that the RNF8:γ-H2AX interaction observed was indirect. Because the BRCT domains of MDC1 mediate its direct binding to phospho-H2AX, and MDC1 is required for RNF8 IRIF, we examined whether RNF8 interacts with MDC1. Intriguingly, the optimal motif for phosphopeptide binding to the RNF8 FHA domain is pTXXY/F (Figure 2A), and inspection of the MDC1 sequence reveals four potential ATM/ATR phophorylation sites that match this motif (T699QCF, T719QAF, T752QPF, and T765QPF). One of these TQPF sites was recently reported to be phosphorylated following DNA damage in a large-scale proteomic study (Matsuoka et al., 2007Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E. Zhao Z. Solimini N. Lerenthal Y. et al.ATM and ATR substrate analysis reveals extensive protein networks responsive to DNA damage.Science. 2007; 316: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar). We therefore synthesized peptides containing each of these four putative phosphorylation sites and measured their binding to the RNF8 FHA domain. Three of the four bound with affinities comparable to the optimal peptide (Figures S2F–S2I), while the fourth bound more weakly. We next generated a deletion mutant spanning residues 698–768 (Del) of MDC1 (Figure 3A) and showed that MDC1, but not Del, specifically bound to purified GST-RNF8 (Figures 3B and 3C). In addition, RNF8 coprecipitated with WT but not Del mutant of MDC1 in vivo (Figure 3D), further implying that these putative phosphorylation sites are required for the interaction between RNF8 and MDC1. A control experiment using the delFHA mutant of RNF8 confirms that this interaction also requires the FHA domain of RNF8 (Figure 3E). Similar results were obtained in reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays. Consistent with the role of MDC1 in mediating RNF8 accumulation at DNA-damage sites, an increased amount of MDC1 bound to RNF8 after IR, and this MDC1 was abolished with prior phosphatase treatment (Figure 3F). Likewise, WT but not Del mutant of MDC1 restored RNF8 IRIF in MDC1-depleted HeLa cells (Figures S3A–S3B). Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo results support a possible direct role of MDC1 in facilitating RNF8 localization, via a phospho-specific interaction conferred by the RNF8 FHA domain, to the chromatin following DNA damage. To further probe the role of RNF8 at DNA-damage sites in vivo, we depleted RNF8 with two different siRNAs and tested whether the IRIF of a number of mediator/repair proteins were RNF8 dependent. RNF8 knockdown did not affect γ-H2AX or MDC1 foci formation at DNA-damage sites (Figures 4A and S4A–S4C); however, localization of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to foci was abrogated (Figure 4A), suggesting that RNF8 lies upstream of these DNA-damage signaling mediator/effectors and facilitates the accumulation of these proteins to the sites of DNA damage. The MDC1/RNF8 interaction experiments presented in Figure 3 imply that MDC1 may interact with RNF8 and regulate RNF8-dependent events following DNA damage. MDC1 was previously shown to be required for IRIF formation of these checkpoint mediator proteins (Goldberg et al., 2003Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J.

MDC1 is a mediator of the mammalian DNA damage checkpoint.Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar; also see Figure S4D). Here, we examined whether the MDC1/RNF8 interaction is crucial for these events in vivo. As expected, ectopically expressed MDC1 restored the accumulation of BRCA1 and 53BP1 in response to IR in MDC1−/− MEFs. The MDC1 deletion mutation, which abolishes its interaction with RNF8, did not affect its own focus localization following IR but failed to restore the RNF8-dependent concentration of BRCA1 and 53BP1 at the foci (Figure 4B), suggesting that the MDC1/RNF8 interaction is likely to be required for RNF8-dependent functions following DNA damage. In order to further explore roles of the RNF8 FHA and RING domains in targeting 53BP1 and BRCA1 to foci, we knocked down RNF8 in HeLa cells using siRNF8#2 (Figure S4E) and reintroduced full-length RNF8, delFHA, or delRING using constructs containing silent mutations within the RNF8 coding sequence that rendered the reintroduced constructs resistant to the siRNA. Unlike the deletion mutants, reconstitution with full-length RNF8 restored 53BP1 and BRCA1 IRIF in cells depleted of endogenous RNF8 (Figures 4C and S4F). Thus, both the phosphopeptide-binding and the ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF8 are required for its function in mediating the accumulation of DNA-damage checkpoint proteins at the sites of DNA damage. Our observation that IRIF formation of BRCA1 and 53BP1 requires the RNF8 RING domain suggests that the accumulation of these checkpoint proteins is dependent on protein ubiquitylation at the site of the damaged chromatin. The finding that DNA-damage-associated ubiquitin conjugates can be visualized using the anti-ubiquitin FK2 antibody (Morris and Solomon, 2004Morris J.R. Solomon E.

A conserved pathway to activate BRCA1-dependent ubiquitylation at DNA damage sites.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2178-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) is consistent with this hypothesis. If RNF8 is involved in the ubiquitylation of proteins at the damaged chromatin, H2AX and MDC1 deficiencies, which abrogate RNF8 accumulation at IRIF, might be expected to disrupt damage-dependent FK2 focus formation. This is indeed the case (see Figures S5A–S5C). Recently, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 was also implicated in the ubiquitylation of protein(s) at the chromatin following DNA damage (Zhao et al., 2007Zhao G.Y. Sonoda E. Barber L.J. Oka H. Murakawa Y. Yamada K. Ikura T. Wang X. Kobayashi M. Yamamoto K. et al.A critical role for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 in initiating homologous recombination.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 663-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, the E3 ligase, which provides substrate specificity, has yet to be identified. That RNF8 was demonstrated to interact with UBC13 for substrate ubiquitylation (Plans et al., 2006Plans V. Scheper J. Soler M. Loukili N. Okano Y. Thomson T.M. The RING finger protein RNF8 recruits UBC13 for lysine 63-based self polyubiquitylation.J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) prompted us to speculate that RNF8 and UBC13 might act in concert in the DNA-damage-signaling cascade. In support of this speculation, we found that damage-associated ubiquitin conjugates were absent in either RNF8-depleted or UBC13-depleted cells (Figures 5A and S5D). UBC13 depletion also suppressed the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 at IRIF but did not affect focus formation of phospho-H2AX and MDC1 (Figure S5E). In addition, RNF8 IRIF can be readily visualized in UBC13-depleted cells, indicating that the damage-dependent RNF8 localization precedes UBC13 function in the DNA-damage response. These data, together with previous reports, imply that RNF8 acts with UBC13 to exert a mediator role in the DNA-damage-signaling cascade. The ubiquit"

https://openalex.org/W2044333227,"The Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's Through The Looking Glass said that one had to run as fast as possible to stay in the same place. Leigh Van Valen applied the concept to host–parasite and predator–prey interactions, in which each participant evolves as fast as is necessary to outpace the other. But how can these so-called Red-Queen dynamics be tracked through time? By stirring around in the slime at the bottom of a pond, it turns out. The water flea Daphnia and one of its microbial parasites are both able to survive many years dormant in lake mud. In a study that compared revived dormant stages of host and parasite from the sediment beneath a pond in Heverlee, Belgium, with present-day descendants, there was steady increase in parasite virulence through time. But to little overall effect: infection rates between the hosts and their parasite contemporaries remained much the same: as in many an 'arms race', the result is a stalemate. Dormant stages of both the water flea Daphnia and its microparasites are conserved in lake sediments, providing an archive of past gene pools. This is used to reconstruct rapid coevolutionary dynamics in a natural setting and show that the parasite rapidly adapts to its host over a period of only a few years. Antagonistic interactions between hosts and parasites are a key structuring force in natural populations, driving coevolution1,2. However, direct empirical evidence of long-term host–parasite coevolution, in particular ‘Red Queen’ dynamics—in which antagonistic biotic interactions such as host–parasite interactions can lead to reciprocal evolutionary dynamics—is rare3,4,5, and current data, although consistent with theories of antagonistic coevolution, do not reveal the temporal dynamics of the process6. Dormant stages of both the water flea Daphnia and its microparasites are conserved in lake sediments, providing an archive of past gene pools. Here we use this fact to reconstruct rapid coevolutionary dynamics in a natural setting and show that the parasite rapidly adapts to its host over a period of only a few years. A coevolutionary model based on negative frequency-dependent selection, and designed to mimic essential aspects of our host–parasite system, corroborated these experimental results. In line with the idea of continuing host–parasite coevolution, temporal variation in parasite infectivity changed little over time. In contrast, from the moment the parasite was first found in the sediments, we observed a steady increase in virulence over time, associated with higher fitness of the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2016976886,"Continental erosion controls atmospheric carbon dioxide levels on geological timescales through silicate weathering, riverine transport and subsequent burial of organic carbon in oceanic sediments. The efficiency of organic carbon deposition in sedimentary basins is however limited by the organic carbon load capacity of the sediments and organic carbon oxidation in continental margins. At the global scale, previous studies have suggested that about 70 per cent of riverine organic carbon is returned to the atmosphere, such as in the Amazon basin. Here we present a comprehensive organic carbon budget for the Himalayan erosional system, including source rocks, river sediments and marine sediments buried in the Bengal fan. We show that organic carbon export is controlled by sediment properties, and that oxidative loss is negligible during transport and deposition to the ocean. Our results indicate that 70 to 85 per cent of the organic carbon is recent organic matter captured during transport, which serves as a net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The amount of organic carbon deposited in the Bengal basin represents about 10 to 20 per cent of the total terrestrial organic carbon buried in oceanic sediments. High erosion rates in the Himalayas generate high sedimentation rates and low oxygen availability in the Bay of Bengal that sustain the observed extreme organic carbon burial efficiency. Active orogenic systems generate enhanced physical erosion and the resulting organic carbon burial buffers atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thereby exerting a negative feedback on climate over geological timescales."

In type 1 diabetes the major genetic susceptibility determinants have been mapped to the MHC class II genes HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 (refs 1-3), but these genes cannot completely explain the association between type 1 diabetes and the MHC region. Owing to the region's extreme gene density, the multiplicity of disease-associated alleles, strong associations between alleles, limited genotyping capability, and inadequate statistical approaches and sample sizes, which, and how many, loci within the MHC determine susceptibility remains unclear. Here, in several large type 1 diabetes data sets, we analyse a combined total of 1,729 polymorphisms, and apply statistical methods-recursive partitioning and regression-to pinpoint disease susceptibility to the MHC class I genes HLA-B and HLA-A (risk ratios >1.5; P(combined) = 2.01 x 10(-19) and 2.35 x 10(-13), respectively) in addition to the established associations of the MHC class II genes. Other loci with smaller and/or rarer effects might also be involved, but to find these, future searches must take into account both the HLA class II and class I genes and use even larger samples. Taken together with previous studies, we conclude that MHC-class-I-mediated events, principally involving HLA-B*39, contribute to the aetiology of type 1 diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2131213682,"SN 2006gy is an extremely luminous super-nova explosion, perhaps a hundred times more energetic than a typical supernova arising from the collapse of the core of a massive star. Current theories suggest that its progenitor was a star more than 100 times the mass of the Sun. That conclusion is at odds with the supernova's spectrum, which indicates the presence of a hydrogen envelope that would have been lost by a massive star long before the explosion. Two groups now present evidence to support alternative explanations for this supernova, both involving collision. Simon Portegies Zwart and Edward van den Heuvel show that the collision frequency of massive stars in a dense young cluster is sufficient to cause an explosion of the scale of SN 2006gy. And Woosley et al. present a model that explains the brightest supernovae as products of collisions between shells of matter ejected by massive stars made unstable by the production of electron–positron pairs. This paper reports that the brightest supernovae arise from collisions between shells of matter ejected by massive stars. An electron-positron 'pair instability' leads to explosive burning that ejects many solar masses of material. When the next explosion occurs, several solar masses of material are again ejected, which collide with the earlier ejecta, radiating 1050 erg of light. The extremely luminous supernova SN 2006gy (ref. 1) challenges the traditional view that the collapse of a stellar core is the only mechanism by which a massive star makes a supernova, because it seems too luminous by more than a factor of ten. Here we report that the brightest supernovae in the modern Universe arise from collisions between shells of matter ejected by massive stars that undergo an interior instability arising from the production of electron–positron pairs2. This ‘pair instability’ leads to explosive burning that is insufficient to unbind the star, but ejects many solar masses of the envelope. After the first explosion, the remaining core contracts and searches for a stable burning state. When the next explosion occurs, several solar masses of material are again ejected, which collide with the earlier ejecta. This collision can radiate 1050 erg of light, about a factor of ten more than an ordinary supernova. Our model is in good agreement with the observed light curve for SN 2006gy and also shows that some massive stars can produce more than one supernova-like outburst."

In theory, it should be possible to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. A few experiments have beaten the standard quantum limit, but none have achieved Heisenberg-limited scaling until now, largely due to the need for difficult-to-generate exotic quantum entangled states. Higgins et al. adopted an alternative approach using unentangled single-photon states, allowing them to achieve Heisenberg-limited phase estimation. This marks a drastic reduction in the complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision. At the fundamental level, measurement precision is limited by the number of quantum resources that are used. Standard measurement schemes lead to a phase uncertainty that scales with this number. In principle, it should be possible to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Here, an approach using unentangled single-photon states enables the achievement of Heisenberg-limited phase estimation. This represents a drastic reduction in the complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision. Measurement underpins all quantitative science. A key example is the measurement of optical phase, used in length metrology and many other applications. Advances in precision measurement have consistently led to important scientific discoveries. At the fundamental level, measurement precision is limited by the number N of quantum resources (such as photons) that are used. Standard measurement schemes, using each resource independently, lead to a phase uncertainty that scales as 1/ —known as the standard quantum limit. However, it has long been conjectured1,2 that it should be possible to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, dramatically improving the scaling to 1/N (ref. 3). It is commonly thought that achieving this improvement requires the use of exotic quantum entangled states, such as the NOON state4,5. These states are extremely difficult to generate. Measurement schemes with counted photons or ions have been performed with N ≤ 6 (refs 6–15), but few have surpassed the standard quantum limit12,14 and none have shown Heisenberg-limited scaling. Here we demonstrate experimentally a Heisenberg-limited phase estimation procedure. We replace entangled input states with multiple applications of the phase shift on unentangled single-photon states. We generalize Kitaev’s phase estimation algorithm16 using adaptive measurement theory17,18,19,20 to achieve a standard deviation scaling at the Heisenberg limit. For the largest number of resources used (N = 378), we estimate an unknown phase with a variance more than 10 dB below the standard quantum limit; achieving this variance would require more than 4,000 resources using standard interferometry. Our results represent a drastic reduction in the complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision."

With CRoPS, hundreds-of-thousands of sequence reads derived from complexity-reduced genome sequences of two or more samples are processed and mined for SNPs using a fully-automated bioinformatics pipeline. We show that over 75% of putative maize SNPs discovered using CRoPS are successfully converted to SNPWave assays, confirming them to be true SNPs derived from unique (single-copy) genome sequences. By using CRoPS, polymorphism discovery will become affordable in organisms with high levels of repetitive DNA in the genome and/or low levels of polymorphism in the (breeding) germplasm without the need for prior sequence information."
https://openalex.org/W2025174361,"Voltage-sensing domains enable membrane proteins to sense and react to changes in membrane voltage. Although identifiable S1–S4 voltage-sensing domains are found in an array of conventional ion channels and in other membrane proteins that lack pore domains, the extent to which their voltage-sensing mechanisms are conserved is unknown. Here we show that the voltage-sensor paddle, a motif composed of S3b and S4 helices, can drive channel opening with membrane depolarization when transplanted from an archaebacterial voltage-activated potassium channel (KvAP) or voltage-sensing domain proteins (Hv1 and Ci-VSP) into eukaryotic voltage-activated potassium channels. Tarantula toxins that partition into membranes can interact with these paddle motifs at the protein–lipid interface and similarly perturb voltage-sensor activation in both ion channels and proteins with a voltage-sensing domain. Our results show that paddle motifs are modular, that their functions are conserved in voltage sensors, and that they move in the relatively unconstrained environment of the lipid membrane. The widespread targeting of voltage-sensor paddles by toxins demonstrates that this modular structural motif is an important pharmacological target. Voltage-dependent ion channels open in response to changes in membrane voltage, but the molecular mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. Pioneering work by MacKinnon and co-workers in 2003 showed that the process involves the motion of a lipid-exposed 'paddle' motif, but the nature of this motion remains controversial. In the first of two complementary articles, Alabi et al. demonstrate the importance of this structural motif by showing that paddle function is faithfully conserved when transplanted into distantly related channels. The work also underscores the mobility of this motif within the membrane. Long et al. describe a high-resolution structure of a modified Kv1.2 potassium channel surrounded by a bilayer-like arrangement of lipids. Critical positive charges in the paddle are stabilized by both lipid and protein interactions, suggesting a way in which the paddle may move in response to voltage to open the channel pore.

Infectious leptospires are resistant to killing by their hosts' alternative pathway of complement-mediated killing, and interact with various host extracellular matrix (ECM) components. The LenA outer surface protein (formerly called LfhA and Lsa24) was previously shown to bind the host ECM component laminin and the complement regulators factor H and factor H-related protein-1. We now demonstrate that infectious L. interrogans contain five additional paralogs of lenA, which we designated lenB, lenC, lenD, lenE and lenF. All six genes encode domains predicted to bear structural and functional similarities with mammalian endostatins. Sequence analyses of genes from seven infectious L. interrogans serovars indicated development of sequence diversity through recombination and intragenic duplication. LenB was found to bind human factor H, and all of the newly-described Len proteins bound laminin. In addition, LenB, LenC, LenD, LenE and LenF all exhibited affinities for fibronectin, a distinct host extracellular matrix protein. These characteristics suggest that Len proteins together facilitate invasion and colonization of host tissues, and protect against host immune responses during mammalian infection."
https://openalex.org/W1996229842,"Aggregation of unfolded proteins occurs mainly through the exposed hydrophobic surfaces. Any mechanism of inhibition of this aggregation should explain the prevention of these hydrophobic interactions. Though arginine is prevalently used as an aggregation suppressor, its mechanism of action is not clearly understood. We propose a mechanism based on the hydrophobic interactions of arginine.We have analyzed arginine solution for its hydrotropic effect by pyrene solubility and the presence of hydrophobic environment by 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid fluorescence. Mass spectroscopic analyses show that arginine forms molecular clusters in the gas phase and the cluster composition is dependent on the solution conditions. Light scattering studies indicate that arginine exists as clusters in solution. In the presence of arginine, the reverse phase chromatographic elution profile of Alzheimer's amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)) peptide is modified. Changes in the hydrodynamic volume of Abeta(1-42) in the presence of arginine measured by size exclusion chromatography show that arginine binds to Abeta(1-42). Arginine increases the solubility of Abeta(1-42) peptide in aqueous medium. It decreases the aggregation of Abeta(1-42) as observed by atomic force microscopy.Based on our experimental results we propose that molecular clusters of arginine in aqueous solutions display a hydrophobic surface by the alignment of its three methylene groups. The hydrophobic surfaces present on the proteins interact with the hydrophobic surface presented by the arginine clusters. The masking of hydrophobic surface inhibits protein-protein aggregation. This mechanism is also responsible for the hydrotropic effect of arginine on various compounds. It is also explained why other amino acids fail to inhibit the protein aggregation."

Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that allow us to extract these two types of information and their specific time-course of acquisition following initial contact with a new language. We report time-related electrophysiological changes that occurred while participants learned an artificial language. These changes strongly correlated with the discovery of the structural rules embedded in the words. These changes were clearly different from those related to word learning and occurred during the first minutes of exposition. There is a functional distinction in the nature of the electrophysiological signals during acquisition: an increase in negativity (N400) in the central electrodes is related to word-learning and development of a frontal positivity (P2) is related to rule-learning. In addition, the results of an online implicit and a post-learning test indicate that, once the rules of the language have been acquired, new words following the rule are processed as words of the language. By contrast, new words violating the rule induce syntax-related electrophysiological responses when inserted online in the stream (an early frontal negativity followed by a late posterior positivity) and clear lexical effects when presented in isolation (N400 modulation). The present study provides direct evidence suggesting that the mechanisms to extract words and structural dependencies from continuous speech are functionally segregated. When these mechanisms are engaged, the electrophysiological marker associated with rule-learning appears very quickly, during the earliest phases of exposition to a new language."

Methodology/Principal Findings soxS mRNA levels surged to near maximal levels within the first few minutes of exposure to paraquat, a superoxide-producing compound, followed by a rise in mRNA levels of known SoxS-regulated genes. Based on a new method for determining the biological significance of clustering results, a total of 138 genic regions, including several transcription factors and putative sRNAs were identified as being regulated through the SoxRS signaling pathway within 10 minutes of paraquat treatment.

Part of the difficulty in preventing relapse is the persisting memory of the intense euphoria or cocaine ""rush"". Most abused drugs and alcohol induce neuroplastic changes in brain pathways subserving emotion and cognition. Such changes may account for the consolidation and structural reconfiguration of synaptic connections with exposure to cocaine. Adaptive hippocampal plasticity could be related to specific patterns of gene expression with chronic cocaine abuse. Here, we compare gene expression profiles in the human hippocampus from cocaine addicts and age-matched drug-free control subjects. Cocaine abusers had 151 gene transcripts upregulated, while 91 gene transcripts were downregulated. Topping the list of cocaine-regulated transcripts was RECK in the human hippocampus (FC = 2.0; p<0.05). RECK is a membrane-anchored MMP inhibitor that is implicated in the coordinated regulation of extracellular matrix integrity and angiogenesis. In keeping with elevated RECK expression, active MMP9 protein levels were decreased in the hippocampus from cocaine abusers. Pathway analysis identified other genes regulated by cocaine that code for proteins involved in the remodeling of the cytomatrix and synaptic connections and the inhibition of blood vessel proliferation (PCDH8, LAMB1, ITGB6, CTGF and EphB4). The observed microarray phenotype in the human hippocampus identified RECK and other region-specific genes that may promote long-lasting structural changes with repeated cocaine abuse. Extracellular matrix remodeling in the hippocampus may be a persisting effect of chronic abuse that contributes to the compulsive and relapsing nature of cocaine addiction."

Smad2 and Smad3 have similar affinity for these components <i>in vitro</i>, and their interactions are primarily mediated by BRG1. <i>In vivo</i>, however, BRG1 predominantly interacts with Smad3, and this interaction is enhanced by TGFβ stimulation.

More than 1.5 billion people worldwide are at risk of contracting lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, a related filarial disease. Drug treatments for filariasis have not changed significantly in over 20 years, and with the risk of resistance rising, there is an urgent need for the development of new anti-filarial drug therapies. The recent publication of the draft genomic sequence for B. malayi enables a genome-wide search for new drug targets. However, there is no functional genomics data in B. malayi to guide the selection of potential drug targets. To circumvent this problem, we have utilized the free-living model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a surrogate for B. malayi. Sequence comparisons between the two genomes allow us to map C. elegans orthologs to B. malayi genes. Using these orthology mappings and by incorporating the extensive genomic and functional genomic data, including genome-wide RNAi screens, that already exist for C. elegans, we identify potentially essential genes in B. malayi. Further incorporation of human host genome sequence data and a custom algorithm for prioritization enables us to collect and rank nearly 600 drug target candidates. Previously identified potential drug targets cluster near the top of our prioritized list, lending credibility to our methodology. Over-represented Gene Ontology terms, predicted InterPro domains, and RNAi phenotypes of C. elegans orthologs associated with the potential target pool are identified. By virtue of the selection procedure, the potential B. malayi drug targets highlight components of key processes in nematode biology such as central metabolism, molting and regulation of gene expression."

RNA is also known to contribute to the regulation of chromatin structure as chromatin-induced gene silencing was shown to depend on the RNAi machinery in S. pombe, plants and Drosophila. Moreover, both in Drosophila and mammals, dosage compensation requires the contribution of specific non-coding RNAs. However, whether RNA itself plays a direct structural role in chromatin is not known. Here, we report results that indicate a general structural role for RNA in eukaryotic chromatin. RNA is found associated to purified chromatin prepared from chicken liver, or cultured Drosophila S2 cells, and treatment with RNase A alters the structural properties of chromatin. Our results indicate that chromatin-associated RNAs, which account for 2%-5% of total chromatin-associated nucleic acids, are polyA(-) and show a size similar to that of the DNA contained in the corresponding chromatin fragments. Chromatin-associated RNA(s) are not likely to correspond to nascent transcripts as they are also found bound to chromatin when cells are treated with alpha-amanitin. After treatment with RNase A, chromatin fragments of molecular weight >3.000 bp of DNA showed reduced sedimentation through sucrose gradients and increased sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease digestion.

Trans. 2004; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Assembly of VLDL begins in the endoplasmic reticulum with synthesis of apolipoprotein B (apoB), a protein that confers structural integrity to VLDL (3Olofsson S.O. Boren J. J. Intern. Med. 2005; 258: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Unlike other secretory proteins, apoB translocates across the membrane to reach the endoplasmic reticulum lumen when lipids are available to associate with the nascent polypeptide chain (4Avramoglu R.K. Adeli K. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2004; 5: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This association requires the activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (5Shelness G.S. Sellers J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Once in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, apoB fuses with lipid droplets that are rich in triglyceride and cholesterol ester, a step also facilitated by MTP (5Shelness G.S. Sellers J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The resulting VLDL particles are secreted through exocytosis (2Gibbons G.F. Wiggins D. Brown A.-M. Hebbachi A.-M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the absence of lipid association, apoB is not exported out of cells but is rapidly degraded by proteasomes (4Avramoglu R.K. Adeli K. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2004; 5: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 6Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).VLDL secretion is also critical for the life cycle of hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family (7Appel N. Schaller T. Penin F. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9833-9836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Like other positive-sense RNA viruses, HCV RNA replicates on intracellular membrane vesicles (8Egger D.

Bienz K. Moradpour D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). We recently purified the vesicles that contain the HCV replication complex from human hepatoma Huh7 cells and found that these vesicles were enriched in apoB, MTP, and apolipoprotein E, three proteins known to be involved in VLDL assembly (10Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The colocalization of HCV replication and VLDL assembly allows the virus to be secreted in complex with VLDL (10Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). When Huh7 cells that constitutively produce infectious HCV (11Cai Z. Zhang C. Chang K.S. Jiang J. Ahn B.C. Wakita T. Liang T.J. Luo G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13963-13973Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) were treated with an MTP inhibitor or siRNA targeting apoB, the secretion of VLDL and HCV were both inhibited (10Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar).The colocalization of HCV replication and VLDL assembly permits isolation of membrane vesicles that assemble both particles, providing an opportunity to identify novel proteins that participate in VLDL assembly. Proteomic analysis of these membrane vesicles revealed that they contained long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) 3 (ACSL3) (10Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). ACSL3 belongs to a family of enzymes that catalyze the activation of fatty acids by conjugating them with coenzyme A (12Fujino T. Kang M.J. Suzuki H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), a reaction required for fatty acids to be incorporated into various lipids including triglyceride, cholesterol ester, and phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (13Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic activity of ACSL3 is well characterized, its specific physiological role is unknown.In the current studies we used human hepatoma Huh7-derived cells, which secret apoB-containing lipoprotein particles with densities similar to those of VLDL (10Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), to study the role of ACSL3 in VLDL assembly. We report that ACSL3 is specifically required for incorporation of fatty acids into PC, a reaction that is essential for VLDL assembly. We show that secretion of VLDL as well as HCV is inhibited when expression of ACSL3 is reduced by RNA interference (RNAi). These studies identify ACSL3 as a new enzyme required for VLDL assembly and confirm the link between VLDL assembly and HCV production.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—MG-132 and Nonidet P-40 alternative (Nonidet P-40) were obtained from Calbiochem. PC (catalog number 840051), PE (catalog number 841118), phosphatidic acid (PA, catalog number 840857), phosphatidylglycerol (PG, catalog number 840457), and phosphatidylserine (PS, catalog number 840034) were obtained from Avanti. [1-14C]Oleate (specific activity 50 mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Coenzyme A, oleoyl-coenzyme A, and triacsin C were obtained from Sigma. Antibody reagents were obtained from the following sources: sheep polyclonal anti-apoB and anti-α1-antitrypsin from Biodesign International; rabbit polyclonal anti-prohibitin from Abcam; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and anti-sheep IgGs (affinity-purified) from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA).Cell Culture—Huh7.5 cells, a mutant line of Huh7 cells that support HCV replication in high efficiency (14Blight K.J. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13001-13014Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), were obtained from Charles Rice (The Rockefeller University, New York). They were cultured and set up in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Huh7-GL cells, a line of Huh7 cells that contain a chromosomally integrated genotype 2a HCV cDNA and constitutively produce infectious virus (11Cai Z. Zhang C. Chang K.S. Jiang J. Ahn B.C. Wakita T. Liang T.J. Luo G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13963-13973Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), were obtained from Guangxiang Luo (University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, KY). They were cultured and set up in medium A supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml blasticidine. Both cells were maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2.RNA Interference—Duplexes of siRNA were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). The two siRNA sequences targeting human ACSL3 (GenBank™ accession number BC041692) are at nucleotide positions (relative to the codon for the initiating methionine) 810–828 and 1223–1241 for ACSL3a and ACSL3b, respectively. The siRNA sequences targeting human long chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) and long chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) (GenBank™ accession numbers BC050073 and BC034959, respectively) correspond to the following nucleotide positions relative to the codon for the initiating methionine: ACSL1 (nucleotides 614–632) and ACSL4 (nucleotides 1653–1671). The sequence for the siRNA targeting green fluorescent protein (GFP) was reported previously (15Adams C.M. Reitz J. De Brabander J.K. Feramisco J.D. Li L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52772-52780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Huh7.5 and Huh7-GL cells cultured in a 60-mm dish were transfected with 400 pmol of siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer, after which the cells were used for experiments as described in the figure legends.Real-time PCR—For measurement of intracellular RNA, the protocol was identical to that was previously described by Liang et al. (16Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Briefly, triplicate samples of first strand cDNA were subjected to real-time PCR quantification using forward and reverse primers for the indicated mRNA with human 36B4 as an invariant control (16Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Relative amounts of mRNAs were calculated using the comparative CT method. For measurement of extracellular HCV RNA, RNA from culture medium was extracted by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using extracted RNA or various amounts of in vitro transcribed HCV RNA. Triplicate samples of cDNA were subjected to real-time PCR quantification using primers specific for HCV RNA. HCV copy numbers were determined by the standard curve generated by the in vitro transcribed HCV RNA using a conversion constant assuming that 1 μg of single-stranded RNA equals to 1.96 × 1011 viral copy numbers (Ambion Technical Bulletin number 165).Immunoblot Analysis—Cell pellets from duplicate dishes were solubilized in 0.1 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates containing 1 μg of protein and 40 μl of culture medium (containing about 20 ng of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis as previously described (17Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences), which were incubated with one of the following antibodies: 1:1000 dilution of anti-apoB, 1:1000 dilution of anti-α1-antitrypsin, and 1:500 dilution of anti-prohibitin. Bound antibodies were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified donkey anti-rabbit or anti-sheep IgG (1:5000 dilution) using the SuperSignal ECL-HRP Substrate System (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film at room temperature for the indicated times.ACSL Activity Measurement—ACSL activity was measured as described (18Fujimoto Y. Itabe H. Kinoshita T. Homma K.J. Onoduka J. Mori M. Yamaguchi S. Makita M. Higashi Y. Yamashita A. Takano T. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1280-1292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells pulled from four 60-mm dishes were homogenized by passing 25 times through needles (22 gauge) in 100 μl of buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). ACSL activity was assayed by mixing buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 0.5 mm coenzyme A, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm [1-14C]oleate (0.25 μCi)) with cell homogenates containing 50 μg of protein in a reaction volume of 100 μl. Following incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, 400 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) was added to terminate the reaction. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, the supernatant was dried, and then dissolved in 60 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2; v/v). 30 μl of the solution was mixed with non-radioactive standard containing 50 nmol of oleoyl-coenzyme A, and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on POLYGRAM™ SIL G membrane (MACHERY-NAGEL, Germany) in a solvent system of 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (5:2:3, v/v/v). After visualization by exposing the TLC plates to I2 vapor, bands containing acyl-CoA were excised, and the amount of radioactivity in these bands was determined by scintillation counting.Lipid Analysis—Following incubation with [1-14C]oleate as described in the figure legends, cells were harvested and homogenized in 0.5 ml of buffer D (250 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Lipids in the homogenates were extracted by 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v), dried, and then dissolved in 120 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1; v/v). 60 μl of the lipid extracts were mixed with non-radioactive phospholipid standards containing 40 μg of PC and PE, and analyzed by TLC on POLYGRAM SIL G membrane in a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v). The remaining lipid extracts were mixed with non-radioactive neutral lipid standard containing 30 μg of cholesterol oleate ester, 10 μg of triglyceride, and 20 μg of oleate, and analyzed by TLC on the same membrane in a solvent system of hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v). After visualization by exposing the TLC plates to I2 vapor, bands containing triglyceride, cholesterol ester, free oleate, PC, and PE were excised, and the amount of radioactivity in these bands was determined by scintillation counting. The activity of lipid synthesis was determined by the radioactivity found in various classes of lipid normalized by the amount of cellular protein.Liposome Preparation—Liposome phospholipids were prepared as previous described (19Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with some modification. PC, PE, PA, PG, or PS was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), dried in glass tubes under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 to reach a final concentration of 6 mm, and sonicated at 35% of amplitude with a Branson Digital Sonifer 15 times (10 s each time) on ice. The liposome suspensions were passed through 0.22-μm pore filters (Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Co. Cork, Ireland) before they were added to culture medium.HCV Titer—HCV titer was determined exactly as previously described (10Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo determine whether ACSL3 is required for VLDL assembly, we transfected Huh7.5 cells with duplexes of siRNA targeting either ACSL3 or GFP, a control mRNA not present in the cells. Following incubation in serum-free medium, cells and culture medium were harvested and the amount of apoB proteins in the cells and medium was analyzed by immunoblot analysis. In control cells receiving the GFP siRNA, apoB was readily detectable by immunoblot analysis, and the amount of apoB did not change when cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 before harvest (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). In cells transfected with two different ACSL3 siRNAs targeting different regions of ACSL3 mRNA, apoB became barely detectable (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 5). The amount of apoB in these cells was significantly elevated when cells were treated with MG132 (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 6). The amount of apoB secreted by cells receiving the ACSL3 siRNA was also reduced (Fig. 1B). Secretion of α1-antitrypsin, another abundant protein produced by hepatocytes (20Lomas D.A. LI-Evans D. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), was not affected by the knockdown of ACSL3 (Fig. 1B). Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that each ACSL3 siRNA duplex decreased the level of ACSL3 mRNA by >80% but had no effect on the level of apoB mRNA (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the amount of apoB protein in cells with less expression of ACSL3 is markedly reduced, presumably through accelerated degradation mediated by proteasomes.We have previously shown that export of HCV from infected cells requires assembly and secretion of VLDL (10Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether siRNA targeting ACSL3 would decrease production of infectious HCV particles. For this purpose, we used Huh7-GL cells, a line of Huh7 cells that contain a chromosomally integrated genotype 2a HCV cDNA and constitutively produce infectious virus (11Cai Z. Zhang C. Chang K.S. Jiang J. Ahn B.C. Wakita T. Liang T.J. Luo G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 13963-13973Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These cells were transfected with duplexes of siRNA targeting either GFP or ACSL3. Following incubation in serum-free medium, culture medium was harvested and the amount of HCV RNA, HCV titer, and apoB in the medium was measured by real-time PCR, foci formation, and immunoblot analysis, respectively. As expected, transfection of cells with the ACSL3 siRNA blocked the secretion of apoB but not α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 2A). Treatment of the cells with the ACSL3 siRNA reduced the amount of HCV RNA in the medium and decreased the viral titer by about 60% (Fig. 2B). The reduction in the amount of HCV in the medium is not due to inhibition of viral RNA synthesis because the amount of intracellular HCV RNA was not reduced in cells receiving the ACSL3 siRNA (Fig. 2B). The failure to accumulate a large amount of intracellular HCV RNA in cells treated with the ACSL3 siRNA was to be expected, because the secretion of HCV RNA was inefficient. Even in the control cells, the amount of HCV RNA detected in the medium was less than 5% of that found in the cells. A decrease in this low level of secretion is not expected to generate a significant increase in cellular HCV RNA.FIGURE 2Decreased secretion of infectious HCV particles from Huh7-GL cells treated with siRNA targeting ACSL3. On day 0, Huh7-GL cells were set up at 2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. On day 1, cells were transfected with 400 pmol/dish of siRNA duplexes targeting GFP or ACSL3 (ACSL3b) as indicated. On day 4, cells were switched to medium A and incubated for 4 h. Cells and culture medium were then harvested. A, aliquots of the culture medium were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. Filters were exposed for 30 s. B, HCV RNA copy number and titer in the medium were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ACSL3 mRNA and intracellular HCV RNA were quantified by real-time PCR analysis. Values (mean ± S.D. of three measurements in the same experiment) are plotted relative to the GFP siRNA-transfected control, which was set at 1. HCV copy number and titer in GFP siRNA-transfected control cells were 1.2 × 105/ml and 4.3 × 102 foci formation units/ml, respectively. Similar results were obtained in two other independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Besides ACSL3, two other long chain acyl-CoA synthetases, ACSL1 and ACSL4 (21Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Gonzalez-Baro M.R. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), were found to be expressed in Huh7.5 cells (data not shown). However, neither of these two enzymes was found in vesicles involved in VLDL assembly (10Huang H. Sun F. Owen D.M. Li W. Chen Y. Gale Jr., M. Ye J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5848-5853Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). To test whether ACSL3 is specifically required for assembly of VLDL, Huh7.5 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting GFP, ACSL1, ACSL3, or ACSL4. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that mRNAs for ACSL1, ACSL3, and ACSL4 were each reduced by >80% in the appropriate cells (Fig. 3A). The amount of apoB protein was markedly reduced in cells treated with the ACSL3 siRNA (Fig. 3B, lane 2) despite a compensatory increase of ACSL1 mRNA in these cells (Fig. 3A). The amount of intracellular apoB was not reduced by RNAi-mediated knockdown of ACSL1 or ACSL4 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate a specific requirement for the ACSL3 isoform in VLDL assembly.FIGURE 3RNAi-mediated knockdown of ACSL3 specifically reduces the intracellular amount of apoB in Huh7.5 cells. On day 0, Huh7.5 cells were set up at 1 × 105/60-mm dish. On day 1, cells were transfected with 400 pmol/dish of siRNA duplexes targeting GFP, ACSL3 (ACSL3b), ACSL1, or ACSL4 as indicated. A, on day 4, total RNA was prepared from cells and subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Values shown are relative to the GFP siRNA-transfected control, which was set at 1. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. B, on day 4, cells were washed with medium A before harvesting for preparation of detergent lysates, which were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. The filters were exposed to film for 10 s. Similar results were observed in two other independent experiments. C, on day 4, cells were treated with or without 5 μm triacsin C as indicated. After incubation for 5 h, cells were harvested and ACSL activity in cell homogenates was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Triacsin C (5 μm) was included in the assay buffer when we measured the activity in homogenates obtained from cells treated with triacsin C. ACSL activity in GFP siRNA-transfected control cells was 56 ± 16 pmol/min/mg of cellular protein. Values (mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments) are plotted relative to the GFP siRNA-transfected control, which was set at 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Judging by CT values of real-time PCR analysis, ACSL4 but not ACSL3 is the predominant ACSL expressed in Huh7.5 cells (data not shown). Thus, knockdown of ACSL3 is not expected to significantly affect total ACSL activity in the cells. To test this hypothesis, we transfected Huh7.5 cells with siRNA targeting ACSL3. As a positive control, we also treated Huh7.5 cells with triacsin C, a known inhibitor of ACSL (22Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Cyong J.C. Omura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4214-4219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, treatment of cells with triacsin C inhibited ACSL activity by about 95%, whereas transfection of siRNA targeting ACSL3 did not significantly affect ACSL activity in these cells, even though ACSL3 mRNA was reduced by more than 80% (data not shown).The above results suggest that ACSL3 is specifically required for synthesis of lipids that are attached to apoB. To test this hypothesis, we transfected Huh7.5 cells with duplexes of siRNA targeting either ACSL3 or GFP as a control. Cells were then labeled with [1-14C]oleate, and the amount of radiolabeled fatty acids incorporated into cholesteryl ester, triglyceride, PC, and PE was determined. The free oleate remained in the cells was also quantified. Compared with control cells treated with the GFP siRNA, incorporation of [1-14C]oleate into PC in these cells was reduced by about 70% and this change was statistically significant (p < 0.005) (Table 1). Incorporation of oleate into other classes of lipids was not significantly affected by the knockdown of ACSL3 (Table 1). Treatment of cells with the ACSL3 siRNA also caused a significant increase in the amount of free [1-14C]oleate (p < 0.005) (Table 1). Unlike ACSL3 RNAi, knockdown of ACSL1 or ACSL4 did not significantly affect incorporation of [1-14C]oleate into these classes of lipids, including PC (Table 1). These results indicate a preferential requirement for ACSL3 in synthesis of PC in Huh7.5 cells.TABLE 1Incorporation of oleate into various lipids in Huh7.5 cells transfected with siRNA targeting different ACSL isoformLipidssiRNAGFPACSL1ACSL3ACSL4Cholesteryl ester0.28 ± 0.090.35 ± 0.070.19 ± 0.050.36 ± 0.10Triglyceride7.34 ± 1.267.51 ± 1.636.00 ± 0.847.76 ± 1.75PC2.27 ± 0.822.58 ± 0.930.80 ± 0.32aThe level of statistical significance (Student's test) between control cells transfected with the GFP siRNA and cells transfected with the indicated ACSL siRNA, p < 0.005.2.41 ± 1.02PE1.09 ± 0.231.12 ± 0.310.78 ± 0.191.24 ± 0.41Free oleate0.35 ± 0.090.31 ± 0.030.63 ± 0.13aThe level of statistical significance (Student's test) between control cells transfected with the GFP siRNA and cells transfected with the indicated ACSL siRNA, p < 0.005.0.26 ± 0.04a The level of statistical significance (Student's test) between control cells transfected with the GFP siRNA and cells transfected with the indicated ACSL siRNA, p < 0.005. Open table in a new tab To test whether the deficiency in PC synthesis is responsible for the degradation of apoB after ACSL3 siRNA treatment, we determined whether expression of apoB protein in these cells could be restored by exogenously added PC. We added PC in the form of liposomes that have been previously shown to support the growth of a mutant line of Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in PC synthesis (19Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the amount of apoB in cells transfected with the ACSL3 siRNA was markedly reduced as expected (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Addition of 0.1 or 0.3 μm PC to the medium slightly increased the amount of apoB in these cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). Adding 1 μm PC to the medium, however, completely restored the amount of intracellular apoB to the level that is observed in control cells treated with GFP siRNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 7). This effect is specific to PC, because exogenously added PE failed to produce the same result (Fig. 4A, lanes 8–10). In contrast to the cells receiving the ACSL3 siRNA, treatment of control cells with 1 μm PC did not further raise the amount of apoB in these cells (Fig. 4A, lane 2). We thus conclude that the deficiency in PC synthesis resulting from the knockdown of ACSL3 is respon"

Thus, blocking the binding of TNF to TNFR1 is an important strategy for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases, such as hepatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we identified a TNFR1-selective antagonistic mutant TNF from a phage library displaying structural human TNF variants in which each one of the six amino acid residues at the receptor-binding site (amino acids at positions 84-89) was replaced with other amino acids. Consequently, a TNFR1-selective antagonistic mutant TNF (R1antTNF), containing mutations A84S, V85T, S86T, Y87H, Q88N, and T89Q, was isolated from the library. The R1antTNF did not activate TNFR1-mediated responses, although its affinity for the TNFR1 was almost similar to that of the human wild-type TNF (wtTNF). Additionally, the R1antTNF neutralized the TNFR1-mediated bioactivity of wtTNF without influencing its TNFR2-mediated bioactivity and inhibited hepatic injury in an experimental hepatitis model. To understand the mechanism underlying the antagonistic activity of R1antTNF, we analyzed this mutant using the surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. Kinetic association/dissociation parameters of the R1antTNF were higher than those of the wtTNF, indicating very fast bond dissociation. Furthermore, x-ray crystallographic analysis of R1antTNF suggested that the mutation Y87H changed the binding mode from the hydrophobic to the electrostatic interaction, which may be one of the reasons why R1antTNF behaved as an antagonist. Our studies demonstrate the feasibility of generating TNF receptor subtype-specific antagonist by extensive substitution of amino acids of the wild-type ligand protein."
https://openalex.org/W2072291558,"RNA polymerases effectively discriminate against deoxyribonucleotides and specifically recognize ribonucleotide substrates most likely through direct hydrogen bonding interaction with the 2'-alpha-hydroxy moieties of ribonucleosides. Therefore, ribonucleoside analogs as inhibitors of viral RNA polymerases have mostly been designed to retain hydrogen bonding potential at this site for optimal inhibitory potency. Here, two novel nucleoside triphosphate analogs are described, which are efficiently incorporated into nascent RNA by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B of hepatitis C virus (HCV), causing chain termination, despite the lack of alpha-hydroxy moieties. 2'-deoxy-2'-beta-fluoro-4'-azidocytidine (RO-0622) and 2'-deoxy-2'-beta-hydroxy-4'-azidocytidine (RO-9187) were excellent substrates for deoxycytidine kinase and were phosphorylated with efficiencies up to 3-fold higher than deoxycytidine. As compared with previous reports on ribonucleosides, higher levels of triphosphate were formed from RO-9187 in primary human hepatocytes, and both compounds were potent inhibitors of HCV virus replication in the replicon system (IC(50) = 171 +/- 12 nM and 24 +/- 3 nM for RO-9187 and RO-0622, respectively; CC(50) >1 mM for both). Both compounds inhibited RNA synthesis by HCV polymerases from either HCV genotypes 1a and 1b or containing S96T or S282T point mutations with similar potencies, suggesting no cross-resistance with either R1479 (4'-azidocytidine) or 2'-C-methyl nucleosides. Pharmacokinetic studies with RO-9187 in rats and dogs showed that plasma concentrations exceeding HCV replicon IC(50) values 8-150-fold could be achieved by low dose (10 mg/kg) oral administration. Therefore, 2'-alpha-deoxy-4'-azido nucleosides are a new class of antiviral nucleosides with promising preclinical properties as potential medicines for the treatment of HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2071138165,"The global emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) has highlighted the importance of mosquito-borne viruses. These are inoculated in vector saliva into the vertebrate skin and circulatory system. Arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses such as WNV are transmitted to vertebrates as an infectious mosquito probes the skin for blood, depositing the virus and saliva into the skin and circulation. Growing evidence has demonstrated that arthropod, and recently mosquito, saliva can have a profound effect on pathogen transmission efficiency, pathogenesis, and disease course. A potentially important aspect of natural infections that has been ignored is that in nature vertebrates are typically exposed to the feeding of uninfected mosquitoes prior to the mosquito that transmits WNV. The possibility that pre-exposure to mosquito saliva might modulate WNV infection was explored.Here we report that sensitization to mosquito saliva exacerbates viral infection. Prior exposure of mice to mosquito feeding resulted in increased mortality following WNV infection. This aggravated disease course was associated with enhanced early viral replication, increased interleukin-10 expression, and elevated influx of WNV-susceptible cell types to the inoculation site. This exacerbated disease course was mimicked by passive transfer of mosquito-sensitized serum.This is the first report that sensitization to arthropod saliva can exacerbate arthropod-borne infection, contrary to previous studies with parasite and bacteria infections. This research suggests that in addition to the seroreactivity of the host to virus, it is important to take into account the immune response to vector feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2054565784,"One physiological significance of the red blood cell (RBC) structure is that NO binding of Hb is retarded by encapsulation with the cell membrane. To clarify the mechanism, we analyzed Hb-vesicles (HbVs) with different intracellular Hb concentrations, [Hb]in, and different particle sizes using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The apparent NO binding rate constant, kon'(NO), of HbV at [Hb]in = 1 g/dl was 2.6 × 107 m-1 s-1, which was almost equal to kon(NO) of molecular Hb, indicating that the lipid membrane presents no obstacle for NO binding. With increasing [Hb]in to 35 g/dl, kon'(NO) decreased to 0.9 × 107 m-1 s-1, which was further decreased to 0.5 × 107 m-1 s-1 with enlarging particle diameter from 265 to 452 nm. For CO binding, which is intrinsically much slower than NO binding, kon'(CO) did not change greatly with [Hb]in and the particle diameter. Results obtained using diffusion simulations coupled with elementary binding reactions concur with these tendencies and clarify that NO is trapped rapidly by Hb from the interior surface region to the core of HbV at a high [Hb]in, retarding NO diffusion toward the core of HbV. In contrast, slow CO binding allows time for further CO-diffusion to the core. Simulations extrapolated to larger particles (8 μm) showing retardation even for CO binding. The obtained kon'(NO) and kon'(NO) yield values similar to those reported for RBCs.

Their efficacy as O2 carriers is comparable with that of RBC (24Sakai H. Masada Y. Horinouchi H. Yamamoto M. Ikeda E. Takeoka S. Kobayashi K. Tsuchida E. Crit.

In this paper, we describe analyses of the influences of intracellular Hb concentration, [Hb]in, and the particle size of HbV on the apparent binding rate constants of NO and CO. Moreover, we attempted computer simulations to recreate the phenomena, clarify the underlying mechanism, and predict the ligand binding profiles of larger particles, such as RBCs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Hb Solution and Hb-vesicles with Various [Hb]in—A concentrated human carbonylhemoglobin solution (40 g/dl, desalted) was obtained through purification from outdated donated blood provided by the Japanese Red Cross Society (Tokyo, Japan), as reported previously (36Sakai H.

This was diluted by 10 times with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Tokyo). It was then concentrated again to 40 g/dl using an ultrafiltration (cut-off Mr 10,000; Advantec, Tokyo) at 4 °C. This solution was diluted to 1, 10, 20, and 35 g/dl using the same PBS solution. They were used for preparation of HbV with different [Hb]in. The viscosities of these Hb solutions were measured using a rheometer (Physica MCR 301; Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria) as 0.9, 1.1, 2.1, and 10.1 centipose, respectively, at 10 s-1 and 25 °C. In this experiment, we added no allosteric effector, such as an organic phosphate, because we intended to compare the Hb solution and HbV with different [Hb]in at the same O2 affinity (P50, oxygen partial pressure at which Hb is half-saturated). A linear relationship exists between P50 and NO affinity of Hb (38Rohlfs R.J. Bruner E. Chiu A. Gonzales A. Gonzales M.L. Magde D. Magde M Jr D. Vandegriff K.D. Winslow R.M. J. Biol.

After removing the unencapsulated Hb solution using ultracentrifugation, HbV was resuspended in the same PBS solution (pH 7.4) at [heme] = 300 μm. Therefore, the carbonylhemoglobin in HbV is converted to HbO2 by photodissociation of CO by illuminating visible light under O2 atmosphere. Briefly, an aliquot of CO-bound HbV was put in a glass flask; this was rotated using a rotary evaporator while the flask was immersed in cold water and illuminated using a halogen lamp (500 watts) with a continuous and gentle O2 flow inside the flask for several minutes. The complete conversion to HbO2 was confirmed by absorption spectroscopy in the Q band. The physicochemical characteristics of the obtained HbVs are listed in Table 1. The particle size distribution was measured using a dynamic light-scattering method (Submicron Particle Size Analyzer, model N4 PLUS; Beckman-Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The P50 values were obtained from the oxygen equilibrium curve measured with a Hemox-Analyzer (TCS Medical Science, Philadelphia, PA); all samples were ∼13–16 torrs at 37 °C.TABLE 1Physicochemical characterization of a series of HbV prepared for the stopped flow spectrophotometry to observe the NO and CO binding profiles Samples 1–4 were used to examine the influence of intracellular Hb concentration ([Hb]in). Samples 4–6 were used to study the influence of particle diameter. The P50 value (oxygen tension at which Hb is half-saturated with oxygen) were regulated in the narrow range of 13–16 torrs to minimize the influence of Hb allostery on the binding rate constants of NO and CO.Sample entry number[HB]inParticle sizeP50g/dlnmtorrs11305 ± 10513210277 ± 10315320278 ± 9415435265 ± 5714535178 ± 7416635452 ± 18414 Open table in a new tab Stopped-flow Analyses—The time course of the ligand binding was analyzed at a rapid mixing of a deoxygenated HbV solution and a NO-containing or CO-containing solution using a stopped-flow rapid scan spectrophotometer (model RSP-1000; Unisoku Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Solutions in the two reservoirs (A and B) are mixed rapidly with an applied pressure of 0.3–0.6 megapascals and a dead time for mixing of <1.5 ms. All measurements were performed at 25 °C. A PBS solution (3 ml each) was poured into both reservoirs and sealed using septum rubber seals. The reservoirs were deoxygenated by N2 bubbling for over 30 min for the complete removal of O2. This is important in the case of NO bubbling to prevent the NO loss and metHb formation. The HbV stock solution (∼30 μl, [heme] = 300 μm) was injected into Reservoir A to adjust [heme] finally to 3 μm; the N2 bubbling was changed to flowing to avoid denaturation of the solutes. Complete deoxygenation was confirmed using preliminary stopped-flow measurements (wavelength: 385–593 nm), where the Soret band showed a maximum absorption (λmax) at 430 nm attributable to the presence of deoxyHb. In Reservoir B, NO or CO gas bubbling was started; a gentle N2 flowing was maintained in Reservoir A. The mixed gases for NO binding (NO, 0.2029%; N2, 99.7971%) and for CO binding (CO, 14.14%; N2, 85.86%) were purchased from Takachiho Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd. (Tokyo). After about 10 min of bubbling, stopped flow measurement was initiated. The sampling interval and the exposure time were set as 1 ms. The measurement time was 210 ms. All measurements were performed three times, and the change of absorbance at 430 nm was plotted as a function of time. The apparent binding rate constants of NO and CO (kon'(NO), and kon'(CO), respectively) were calculated using Equation 1 under the assumption of homogeneous distribution of Hb, irreversible second order reaction, and pseudo-first-order reaction when gas molecules are abundant, lnΔAtΔA0=-kon'·CGas·t(Eq. 1) where ΔAt represents the change of absorbance at 430 nm at time t (equal to At - At = ∞), and ΔA0 is the absorbance at the initial time (equal to At = 0 - At = ∞). CGas is the initial gas concentration. In the case of the NO binding experiment, NO (1.9 μm) is not excessively abundant in comparison with heme concentration (1.5 μm); therefore, we calculated the apparent binding rates from the slopes of the initial phase of reactions.Computer Simulation—We assumed that HbV is spherical and dispersed homogeneously. The gas diffusion constants are much larger than those of Hb molecule (7 nm) and HbV (250 nm) (45Nishide H. Chen X. Tsuchida E. Artif. Cells Blood Substit. Immobil. Biotechnol. 1997; 25: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we analyzed only gas diffusion and the formation of ligand-bound Hb in a single HbV particle. We did not consider the extracellular diffusion barrier because of the rapid mixing of small particles, and also we did not consider the gas permeability constant in the lipid bilayer, because the thickness of the lipid bilayer (∼5 nm) is thin in comparison with the particle diameter. (Our results show that they would not be important parameters in our system.) To simplify the equation, the distance from the surface to the core of HbV, 125 nm, was divided by 12.5 nm into 10 units. For simulation of a larger particle, such as that with an 8000-nm diameter, 4000 nm was divided by 12.5 nm into 320 units. The first unit is located at the HbV surface and is in the concentration boundary condition. The last unit is located in the core of HbV in the closed condition. From the gas diffusion equation (Equation 2), the one-dimensional diffusion from the surface to the core of the particle can be expressed as Equation 3, ∂CGas∂t=D∂2CGas∂x2(Eq. 2) ΔCGas(ti,xj)=D·-Aj·(CGas(ti,xj)-CGas(ti,xj-1))+Aj+1·(CGas(ti,xj+1)-CGas(ti,xj))Vj·Δx·Δt(Eq. 3) where CGas(ti, xj) represents the gas concentration at time i (ti) in 1 unit (xj; distance from the surface of HbV); ΔCGas(ti, xj) is a mass change by diffusion; Aj is the interface area of the units j - 1 and j, and it changes with the distance from the core of HbV; Δt is the step time; Vj is the volume of the unit j; and Δx is the distance between neighboring units. A gas molecule reacts with a heme in Hb. We assumed that the reaction is irreversible. Therefore, the changes of concentrations are expressed as Equations 4 and 5 with a binding rate constant, kon, of an elementary gas binding reaction. dChemedt=-kon·CGas·Cheme(Eq. 4) dCGasdt=dChemedt(Eq. 5) At a step time Δt and in a step unit Δx, the changes of concentrations (ΔCheme, ΔCGas') by the gas bindings are expressed as Equations 6 and 7. ΔCheme(ti,xj)=-kon·CGas(ti,xj)·Cheme(ti,xj)·Δt(Eq. 6) ΔCGas'(ti,xj)=-kon·CGas(ti,xj)·Cheme(ti,xj)·Δt(Eq. 7) At the onset of reaction by mixing two solutions in the stopped-flow apparatus, the gas diffuses into the HbV. Therefore, the initial unbound free gas concentration inside the vesicle is assumed to be zero. The initial unbound free heme concentrations of HbV are 620–21,700 μm ([Hb]in = 1–35 g/dl); they decrease with the reactions of gas molecules. All initial values for calculations are summarized in Table 2. The diffusion constant of the Hb molecule is concentration-dependent and decreases from 77 to 7.4 μm2 s-1 with increasing [Hb]in from 1 to 35 g/dl (46Chen X. Nishide H. Tsuchida E. Bull Chem. Soc.

The diffusion constant of O2 in Hb solutions (DO2) decreases with increasing Hb concentration. The diffusion constants of CO and NO (DNO and DCO, respectively) are calculated from DO2 using Equation 8 (2Coin J.T. Olson J.S. J. Biol.

Both CGas and Cheme at ti were calculated using those at ti - 1. Both ΔCheme and ΔCGas' were calculated using Equations 6 and 7. Gas molecules diffuse depending on a concentration gradient, and the obtained ΔCGas of Equation 3 was combined with ΔCGas' of Equation 7 for the next step calculation of CGas. The time interval, Δt, was set as 0.01 μs, and 107 steps were required to calculate the reaction profile for 100 ms in the case of HbV with a 250-nm diameter. The data were output at every 5 ms.As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of gas in the bulk solution decreases. To reflect this, Equation 9 is used, C2(Gas)=C0(Gas)-C1(GasTotal)·C0(heme)C1(heme)1-C0(heme)C1(heme)(Eq. 9) where the following variables are used. C0(Gas) is the initial gas concentration; C2(Gas) is at the boundary condition (in the bulk solution); C1(GasTotal) is the sum of the bound and unbound gas molecules in HbV; Co(heme) is the total heme concentration in the solution (1.5 μm); and C1(heme) is the heme concentration in HbV (such as 21,700 μm at [Hb]in = 35 g/dl).The level of unbound free heme, R, can be expressed as Equation 10, which is used to calculate the levels of reactions for 100 ms and the apparent rate constants from the initial slopes (5 ms).

Because of the strong light-scattering effect of the HbV suspension in comparison with Hb solution and RBC (49Sakai H. Tomiyama K. Masada Y. Takeoka S. Horinouchi H. Kobayashi K. Tsuchida E. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2003; 41: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the absorption peaks in the Q band region were not clear in this measurement. After rapid mixing with NO, the immediate absorbance reduction at 430 nm and the increase at 418 nm that correspond to the formation of nitrosylhemoglobin were confirmed (Fig. 1). In the case of mixing with CO, the immediate absorption increase at 419 nm was confirmed. The change of absorption at 430 nm in both reactions was single exponential and indicative of the formation of nitrosylhemoglobin or carbonylhemoglobin in the vesicles.Time Courses of NO Binding and CO Binding to HbV with Various [Hb]in—The scans of spectrophotometry in Fig. 1 were performed three times, and the average level of reaction was plotted as a ratio of absorbance at 430 nm (ΔAt) at time t, to the initial absorbance (ΔA0) at time 0 (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W1963598656,"Expansion of trinucleotide repeats in coding and non-coding regions of genes is associated with sixteen neurodegenerative disorders. However, the molecular effects that lead to neurodegeneration have remained elusive. We have explored the role of transcriptional dysregulation by TATA-box binding protein (TBP) containing an expanded polyglutamine stretch in a mouse neuronal cell culture based model. We find that mouse neuronal cells expressing a variant of human TBP harboring an abnormally expanded polyQ tract not only form intranuclear aggregates, but also show transcription dysregulation of the voltage dependent anion channel, Vdac1, increased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and upregulation of genes involved in localized neuronal translation. On the other hand, unfolded protein response seemed to be unaffected. Consistent with an increased transcriptional effect, we observe an elevated promoter occupancy by TBP in vivo in TATA containing and TATA-less promoters of differentially expressed genes. Our study suggests a link between transcriptional dysfunction and cell death in trinucleotide repeat mediated neuronal dysfunction through voltage dependent anion channel, Vdac1, which has been recently recognized as a critical determinant of cell death."

Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the GAF domain of NorR contains a mononuclear non-heme iron center that reversibly binds NO forming a paramagnetic mononitrosyl-iron complex with an S = 3/2 ground state (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic features of this high spin complex suggest that the iron atom in the mononitrosyl adduct is 5 or 6 coordinate with electronic structure {Fe(NO)}7 according to the Enemark and Feltham notation (32Enemark J.H. Feltham R.D. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1974; 13: 339-406Crossref Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Binding of NO to the ferrous ion in the GAF domain stimulates the ATPase activity of the AAA+ domain, enabling NorR to activate transcription by σ54-RNA polymerase (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In this study, we have substituted conserved residues in the GAF domain and further characterized NorR by EPR, electronic absorption, and MCD spectroscopies. This analysis has identified five candidate ligands to the non-heme iron center and additional residues that may be involved in signal transmission. Spectroscopy in combination with structural modeling suggests that the mononuclear non-heme iron in the GAF domain is 5 or 6 coordinate, with distorted octahedral symmetry. Chemicals and Biochemicals—MAHMA NONOate ((Z)-1-(N-methyl-N-[6-(N-methylammoniohexyl)amino])-diazen-1-ium 1,2-diolate) was provided by Alexis chemicals. ATP, CTP, CoCl2, and Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 were from Sigma-Aldrich. All restriction enzymes were from Roche Applied Science. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with pNorR2 plasmid as a template (29Tucker N.P. D'Autreaux B. Studholme D.J. Spiro S. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6656-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was used to introduce mutations into the GAF domain of NorR. The constructs were sequenced on both strands to ensure that only the desired mutation was introduced. Assay of NorR Activity in Vivo—Transcriptional activation by NorR in vivo was measured by introducing wild-type and mutant plasmids into NPT1003, a nor::cat derivative of E. coli strain MC1000 with a lacZ reporter fusion to the norVW promoter inserted at the phage λ attachment site (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown with shaking in 50 ml of LB medium at 37 °C until the A650 nm reached 0.3, at which point glucose was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1%. Cultures were then split into 8-ml Bijou bottles and were grown anaerobically overnight at 37 °C with or without potassium nitrite (4 mm). Under these conditions, NorR is activated by the NO that is generated endogenously by nitrite reduction in E. coli (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Levels of expression of the norV-lacZ fusion were then determined by assaying β-galactosidase activity as described previously (29Tucker N.P. D'Autreaux B. Studholme D.J. Spiro S. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6656-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whole Cell EPR Spectroscopy—Freshly transformed bacteria were grown anaerobically at 30 °C in 25 ml of LB medium containing 1% glucose (w/v) and 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. Expression of NorR and GAFNorR was induced at A600 nm = 0.6 with 50 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h, MAHMA NONOate (final concentration, 200 μm) was added and incubation continued for 15 min (t½ = 3 min, pH = 7.5, 30 °C). The cells were harvested at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v). Cell suspensions were transferred to an EPR tube and immediately frozen. Purification of Mutants and Co2+-substituted NorR—NorR mutants were purified under anaerobic conditions as described previously (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Apo-NorR mutants were obtained after heparin and gel-exclusion chromatography. Because iron was lost during the gel-filtration step, iron-containing proteins were obtained after the heparin step. The Co2+-substituted NorR was purified aerobically according to the previous procedure, except that CoCl2 (5 mm) was added to 40 ml of crude extract instead of iron. The iron content was determined using ferrozine (ϵ565 nm = 27900m–1.cm–1) (33Stookey L.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 779-781Crossref Scopus (3616) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically as described previously (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The concentration of cobalt was determined by EPR titration (see below). Samples for MCD spectroscopy were prepared by dilution of reduced GAFNorR in one volume of deuterated glycerol. Iron Dissociation Rates—The dissociation rate of the iron complex in NorR was estimated using competition between NorR-Fe(II) and ferrozine (34Lin J. Kester D.R. Mar. Chem. 1992; 38: 283-301Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Thompsen J.C. Mottola H.A. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 755-757Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An excess of ferrozine (final concentration, 4 mm) was added in a gas-tight Hamilton syringe to NorR and mutant preparations (8–16 μm in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 40% glycerol), and the rate of Fe(II)-ferrozine formation was monitored under anaerobic conditions at 565 nm. Oxidation and NO Treatment of Iron-containing Proteins—Anaerobically purified GAFNorR, and mutant NorR proteins were oxidized by exposing these solutions to air for 2 h. Anaerobically purified NorR was oxidized by reaction with 5 equivalents of hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. Stock solutions of MAHMA NONOate were prepared in 10 mm NaOH. NO solutions were prepared by decomposition of a solution of MAHMA NONOate in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol at 30 °C for 20 min (t½ = 3 min, pH = 7.5, 30 °C) under anaerobic conditions. Samples for UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy were prepared by reaction of anaerobically purified NorR, GAFNorR, R81L, D99A, and H111L with 5 equivalents of NO from pre-decomposed MAHMA NONOate under anaerobic conditions. Spectroscopic Methods—X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ELEXSYS 500 instrument and a Bruker Super-High-Q Cavity: ER 4122SHQE. Temperature-dependent experiments were performed with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 flow cryostat. EPR spin quantification was achieved by measurement of the total area of the absorption spectrum or integration of simulated EPR spectra or integration of the low field “absorption shaped” feature, using the method of Aasa and Vånngård (36Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). 1 mm aqueous Cu(II)(H2O)6 was used as the concentration standard. E/D ratios were calculated as described previously (37Arciero D.M. Orville A.M. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14035-14044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EPR spectra were simulated using WINEPR SimFonia v. 1.25 (Bruker Analytische Messtechnik GmbH). Electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 35 spectrophotometer. MCD spectra were recorded on a circular dichrograph (JASCO J-730). Structural Modeling—A homology model of the GAF domain of NorR was built using InsightII. Both phyre and Metaserver (38Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) were used to search for a suitable template; both servers returned the GAF B domain of the regulatory segment of mouse 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDB ID 1MC0) as the best hit. An initial working model was developed using the Homology module of InsightII, and sequence alignment was returned by phyre. An iron atom was imported to the structure and placed at a bonding distance from Sγ-Cys-113. The sequence alignment returned by phyre was slightly adjusted in order to bring Asp-131 close to the iron binding site, which was tentatively assigned to a location equidistant from the Sγ of Cys-113 and Oδ of Asp-99. Several homology models were generated with different combinations of candidate ligands with Asp-99 as mono-dentate and Asp-96 and Asp-131 as either mono- or bi-dentate ligands. These models were then optimized by using the steepest descent or conjugate algorithm under a variety of structural constraints. In a typical optimization protocol the entire molecule was fixed except the iron atom and its coordinating residues, which were allowed to move freely and acquire any conformation that satisfied the imposed constraints of 1.8–2.0 Å for the Fe–O and 1.8–2.3 Å for the Fe–S bonds. After every minimization step (∼104 to 106 iterations), the structural statistics, particularly chirality, Ramachandran plot, and omega values were checked. Final minimization always involved a constraints free optimization to check if the resulting structure maintained the established iron coordination. Analysis of the N-terminal GAF domains of 34 presumed NorR orthologues revealed several conserved residues that may act as ligands to the mononuclear non-heme iron center (Fig. 1). As noted by others (19Gardner A.M. Gessner C.R. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10081-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), two histidine residues and a cysteine residue (located at positions 73, 111, and 113, respectively, in E. coli NorR) are invariant in NorR proteins; in contrast Cys-38 and His-21 are less well conserved in NorR homologues. We chose to mutate each of these histidine and cysteine residues (Fig. 1). We also noticed that NorR contains three conserved aspartate residues at positions 96, 99, and 131 that may bind a metal ion. We previously reported that a D99A substitution abolished the in vivo activity of NorR, and the whole cell g = 4 EPR signal is characteristic of the mononitrosyl-iron complex (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to analyze the function of the other aspartate residues in the GAF domain. Guided by a structural model of the N-terminal domain of NorR based upon known GAF domain structures (see below), we also chose to mutate the conserved residues Arg-75 and Tyr-98. In some cases, we substituted more than one amino acid at a given position to fully investigate side-chain functions. In total we constructed the 21 substitutions shown in Fig. 1. Mutants were assayed for transcriptional activation of the norVW promoter using a single copy chromosomal norV-lacZ fusion introduced into a ΔnorR background and complemented by pET-derived constructs carrying the mutant norR genes. Expression in this system relies upon low level transcription of genes cloned in pET plasmids when T7 RNA polymerase is not expressed (39Moore L.J. Kiley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45744-45750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Potassium nitrite was used as a terminal electron acceptor to provide an endogenous source of NO to induce activation of NorR (20Hutchings M.I. Mandhana N. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4640-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mutant proteins fell into three distinct classes on the basis of these results (Fig. 2). First, NorR variants that did not exhibit major differences compared with the wild-type protein (Class I); these include E71L, H73L, D91A, S92G, T129A, and D139A, which were not studied further. The silent phenotype of Y98F was not unexpected, because tyrosine is replaced by phenylalanine at this position in several NorR proteins. The C38G protein exhibited a lower level of activity in the presence of nitrite than the wild type (Fig. 2). Nevertheless it is unlikely that Cys-38 is a ligand to the ferrous iron center as C38G gave a normal whole cell EPR signal (see below and Table 1). Members of the second class of variants were able to activate the norVW promoter in the absence of inducer (Class II). This was a surprisingly large group with one variant, D96A, exhibiting constitutive activity similar to that of a truncated version of NorR lacking the GAF domain (NorRΔGAF) (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), whereas others displayed greater activity either in the presence (e.g. R81L and H111L) or absence (e.g. R75L, C113A, C113G, and D131A) of inducer (Fig. 2). The third class of mutations (Class III) eliminated transcriptional activation by NorR and the response to NO; these include R75K, Y98L, D99A, H111Y, and C113S. A notable outcome of this analysis is that different substitutions of the same residue gave rise to remarkably different phenotypes, for example, R75L is constitutive whereas R75K is inactive. These differences do not appear to relate to stability, because all the mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels under these growth conditions either in the absence or presence of inducer, as assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 2, B and C). Instead, these differences seem to correlate with the hydrophobic nature of the residue, because the R75L, H111L, and C113A proteins are constitutive, whereas the corresponding R75K, H111Y, and C113S substitutions have null phenotypes. In addition, most of the other hydrophobic substitutions (H73L, R81L, D96A, and D131A) lead to a constitutive phenotype.TABLE 1Summary of the properties of mutant proteinsProteinClassIn vivo EPRaThe presence of g = 4 EPR signal in cultures expressing NorR after NO exposure; +, signal intensity equivalent to wild-type NorR; *, signal intensity less than 2.5% of wild-type NorR; -, EPR signal undetectable.Iron contentbIron content expressed as atoms per monomer after iron reconstitution and purification by heparin affinity chromatography.

Open table in a new tab We previously reported that the EPR signal of NO-bound NorR can be detected in anaerobic cultures of E. coli induced for NorR expression and subsequently treated with NO (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Derivative signals at g = 4.21 and 3.88 are characteristic of the {Fe(NO)}7 complex in NorR and provide an indirect method to probe for the presence of the non-heme iron center in vivo (Fig. 3A, spectrum 1). We analyzed the EPR spectra of whole cells induced for expression of the mutant proteins prior to and after treatment of the cells with the NO donor MAHMA NONOate. All the mutant proteins were expressed at similar levels to the wild-type NorR (data not shown). We observed that cultures expressing the H73L, D91A, S92G, and T129A proteins exhibited the characteristic g = 4 EPR signal after exposure to the NO donor, with g values identical to those of wild-type NorR (data not shown), in agreement with their in vivo activities. Although the C38G mutant gave a relatively low level of transcriptional activation in the presence of inducer (Fig. 2), cultures expressing this protein gave rise to EPR signals identical to wild type (data no shown). The constitutive mutants R81L and H111L also exhibited in vivo EPR signals identical to those of wild type as anticipated from their response to inducer in the in vivo activation assays (Fig. 2). The Y98F mutant gave rise to a slightly less rhombic EPR signal than the wild type, with derivative signals at g = 4.17 and g = 3.92 (Fig. 3A, spectrum 2). In contrast, the inactive Y98L mutant gave rise to a complex signal indicative of a mixed species (Fig. 3A, spectrum 3). A very weak EPR signal characteristic of the mononitrosyl-iron complex was detectable in cultures expressing the R75K and R75L mutant proteins after exposure to NO. The g = 4.2 EPR signal was entirely absent in NO-treated cultures expressing the D96A, D99A, H111Y, C113A, C113S, C113G, and D131A proteins, and their features were similar to wild-type NorR in the absence of NO (Fig. 3A, spectrum 4). These results suggest that either these mutants lack a functional non-heme iron center, or possibly that NO is unable to access the center. Wild-type and mutant NorR proteins were purified under anaerobic conditions as described previously (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). NorR retains ∼0.3 atoms of iron when purified under these conditions, but ferrous iron can be reconstituted into the protein to yield ∼0.9 iron atoms per monomer (9D'Autreaux B. Tucker N.P. Dixon R. Spiro S. Nature. 2005; 437: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Using the ferrozine assay we estimate a dissociation rate constant (koff) of 0.02 s–1 for the ferrous iron in reconstituted NorR. In the absence of reconstitution, most of the purified mutant proteins were devoid of iron. When ferrous iron was added in the crude extract prior to the purification, we found that many of the mutant proteins also lacked ferrous iron after the final chromatography step on Superdex 200. All mutants and the wild-type protein eluted at a retention volume, V = 63 ml, on gel-exclusion chromatography, corresponding to a molecular mass of 150 kDa, consistent with a trimeric structure (data not shown). However, many of the mutant proteins retained some iron after the first step of the purification (the heparin column) (Table 1). These results suggest that, although most of the mutant proteins are competent to bind iron, it is lost during purification. In some cases this may explain the absence of signals attributable to an Fe(NO) complex in the whole cell EPR experiments. The absence of iron in many of the mutant proteins after purification to homogeneity precluded spectroscopic analysis. However, because some iron was retained after reconstitution in the crude extract and subsequent chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, it was possible to examine the spectroscopic features of mutant proteins after heparin chromatography. The protein preparations examined in these experiments were >95% pure as judged by Coomassie-stained gels. The properties of wild-type NorR and the mutant proteins are discussed individually below and are summarized in Table 1. NorR—The electronic absorption spectrum in the UV-visible domain of reduced NorR-(FeII) was dominated by the absorption of aromatic amino acid residues at λmax = 280 nm. When incubated with NO the protein solution immediately turned yellow and displayed absorption bands with λmax 435 nm characteristic of nitrosyl-iron complexes and attributed to LMCT NO– → Fe3+ (Fig. 4A). A very similar spectrum was obtained when the iron-reconstituted isolated"
https://openalex.org/W2043723316,"A complete account of the whole developmental process of neurogenesis involves understanding a number of complex underlying molecular processes. Among them, those that govern the crucial transition from proliferative (self-replicating) to neurogenic neural progenitor (NP) cells remain largely unknown. Due to its sequential rostro-caudal gradients of proliferation and neurogenesis, the prospective spinal cord of the chick embryo is a good experimental system to study this issue. We report that the NOTCH ligand DELTA-1 is expressed in scattered cycling NP cells in the prospective chick spinal cord preceding the onset of neurogenesis. These Delta-1-expressing progenitors are placed in between the proliferating caudal neural plate (stem zone) and the rostral neurogenic zone (NZ) where neurons are born. Thus, these Delta-1-expressing progenitors define a proliferation to neurogenesis transition zone (PNTZ). Gain and loss of function experiments carried by electroporation demonstrate that the expression of Delta-1 in individual progenitors of the PNTZ is necessary and sufficient to induce neuronal generation. The activation of NOTCH signalling by DELTA-1 in the adjacent progenitors inhibits neurogenesis and is required to maintain proliferation. However, rather than inducing cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation by a typical lateral inhibition mechanism as in the NZ, DELTA-1/NOTCH signalling functions in a distinct manner in the PNTZ. Thus, the inhibition of NOTCH signalling arrests proliferation but it is not sufficient to elicit neuronal differentiation. Moreover, after the expression of Delta-1 PNTZ NP continue cycling and induce the expression of Tis21, a gene that is upregulated in neurogenic progenitors, before generating neurons. Together, these experiments unravel a novel function of DELTA–NOTCH signalling that regulates the transition from proliferation to neurogenesis in NP cells. We hypothesize that this novel function is evolutionary conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1966745132,"The retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulates transcription of target genes through heterodimerization with several partners, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, retinoic acid receptor, thyroid receptor, and vitamin D receptor (VDR). We have shown previously that signaling through VDR·RXRα heterodimers was attenuated in ras-transformed keratinocytes due to phosphorylation of serine 260 of the RXRα via the activated Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade in these cells. In this study we demonstrate that phosphorylation at serine 260, a site located in the omega loop-AF-2 interacting domain of RXRα, inhibits signaling through several heterodimeric partners of the RXRα. The inhibition of signaling results in reduced transactivational response to ligand presentation and the reduced physiological response of growth inhibition not only of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 but also of retinoic acid receptor α ligands and LG1069 (an RXRα ligand). This partial resistance to ligands could be reversed by inhibition of MAPK activity or by overexpression of a non-phosphorylable RXRα mutant at serine 260 (RXRα Ser-260 → Ala). Importantly, phosphorylation of RXRα at serine 260 impaired the recruitment of DRIP205 and other coactivators to the VDR·RXRα complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays further demonstrated that coactivator recruitment to the VDR·RXR complex could be restored by treatment with a MAPK inhibitor. Our data suggest that phosphorylation at serine 260 plays a critical role in inducing hormone resistance of RXRα-mediated signaling likely through structural changes in the H1-H3 omega loop-AF2 coactivator(s) interacting domain.

The latter study also raised the possibility that RXR phosphorylation on serine 260 induces conformational changes of the VDR·RXR complex. Ser-260 is located at a critical site in the omega loop between H1 and H3 helices of the ligand binding domain of RXRα (11Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

In the present study we show that RXRα phosphorylation at Ser-260 affects several signaling pathways involving recruitment of partners other than the VDR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coactivator recruitment to the VDR·RXR complex is disrupted in HPK1Aras cells and can be restored by treatment with a MAPKK inhibitor or overexpression of a non-phosphorylable human RXRα mutant at serine 260.

Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed by incubating 5 μg of plasmid DNA with 15 μl of FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in fresh serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and adding 10% charcoal-stripped FBS after 6 h of incubation. After 24 h of transfection the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS and treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 at the concentrations indicated or with vehicle alone. Cellular Extracts–24 h later, cellular or nuclear extracts were prepared as described below. Cellular extracts were prepared by lysing HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells using a triple detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). Nuclear Extracts–Nuclear extracts were prepared by scraping the cells in phosphate-buffered saline, washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspending the cells in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, a mini Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF) and incubation on ice for 15 min. 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the samples were vortexed for 15 s. The samples were spun, and the pellets were resuspended in a nuclear buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 400 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, a mini Complete protease inhibitor tablet, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF). The samples were placed in a microcentrifuge tube shaker for 1 h at 4 °C, then spun, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. In some experiments cells were transfected with the RXRα mutant RXRα Ser-260 → Ala or the pCDNA vector alone driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter as described above. In other experiments when HPK1A or HPK1Aras cells in 100-mm2 plates reached 60% confluency, medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS and 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-7 m) or vehicle (ethanol) was added to cells for another 24 h. MAPKK inhibitors PD098059 (Sigma-Aldrich) or UO126 (Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) or vehicle (Me2SO) were added 30 min prior to 1,25(OH)2D3 addition and incubated for 24 h prior to extraction as described above. Synthetic Oligonucleotides Used–The oligonucleotides were as follows: mOP VDRE: 5′-GTACAAGGTTCACGAGGTTCACGTCTTA-3′; TRE (DR-4 consensus oligonucleotide, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) 5′-AGCTTCAGGTCACAGGAGGTCAGAGAGCT-3′; RARE (DR-5 wild-type oligonucleotide, Geneka Biotech Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) 5′-GTAAGGTCAAGGAGAGGTCACTCGC-3′; PPARE (wild-type oligonucleotide, Geneka) 5′-GGAACTAGGTCAAAGGTCATCCCCT-3′; and RXRE (DR1) 5′-TCGACTGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGTTCA-3′. Antibodies–The RARα, VDR C terminus (C-20), RXRα N terminus, PPARγ, TRβ, RIP140, DRIP205, ACTR, SRC1, GRIP1, p21waf1/cip1, Rb (C-15), and HA-probe (sc-805) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. The RXRα LBD-recognizing antibody 4X1D12 was a kind gift from Pierre Chambon (College de France, Illkirch, France). Western Blotting–Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE (6–10% acrylamide), electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), immunoprobed, and detected using Lumiglo chemiluminescence (KPL Laboratories, Washington, D. C.). The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. Growth Assays–At 40% confluency, cells were placed under serum-free conditions to synchronize the cells. The medium was then replaced with DMEM 5% charcoal-stripped FBS in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3, LG1069 (Ligand Pharmaceuticals, a kind gift of E. Allegreto) or ATRA (Sigma-Aldrich) or TTNPB (Sigma). The cells were also pretreated for 1 h with vehicle or 25 μm PD098059 (Sigma-Aldrich) and then treated with 25 μm PD098059 or vehicle during the ligand treatment. Media was replaced after 48 h. After 96 h, cells were trypsinized and counted with a coulter counter (Coulter Electronics, Lufton, United Kingdom). Reporter Assays–Cells were transfected using Fugene transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 4.5 μg of reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency in 6-well plates. Cells were treated with increasing amounts of ligand with or without 25 μm PD098059. The concentration of the MAPKK inhibitor used is consistent with its Kd for the enzyme reported elsewhere (15Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). For all assays the cells were scraped after 24 h and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science). The retinoic acid response element (RARE) reporter and the retinoid X response element (RXRE) consisted of three copies of the RARα RARE or RXRα RXRE in front of a thymidine kinase reporter driving the expression of a CAT gene (Fisher Scientific, Nepean, Ontario, Canada), and assays were performed using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). β-Galactosidase was measured in a β-galactosidase colorimetric assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay–These assays were performed as previously described (9Solomon C. White J.H. Kremer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated for 20 min on ice with 10-7 m ligand and 1 μg of poly(dIdC) in a binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). 5 fmol of 32P-labeled response element oligonucleotide was added followed by 20 min of incubation at room temperature. In some cases, antibodies were added, and the mix was incubated for another 20 min at room temperature. The samples were resolved on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. Streptavidin-Agarose Pulldown Assays Using Biotynylated DNA Probe–Biotinylated mOP was used as a probe to pull down the VDR·RXR·coactivator complex using a method previously published (16Deng W.G. Zhu Y. Montero A. Wu K.K. Analyt. Biochem. 2003; 323: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We used this streptavidin-agarose bead pulldown assay for analyzing the recruitment of coactivators that bind to the biotinylated mOP. Biotinylated mOP oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen Canada (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). A non-relevant biotinylated probe was used as a negative control. The forward sequence (sense) of mOP was 5′-biotin/GTA CAA GGT TCA CGA GGT TCA CGT C-3′, and the reverse sequence (antisense) was 5′-biotin/GAC GTG AAC CTC GTG AAC CTT GTA C-3′. Double-stranded DNA was obtained by annealing the sense and antisense biotinylated sequences using heating at 85 °C for 5–10 min and slowly cooling down. The pulldown assay was performed by incubating nuclear extracts from cells treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10-7 m) or UO126 (10-6 m) or both and prepared as described above under nuclear extracts preparation. Nuclear extracts (1000 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dIdC) and 1 μg of double-stranded biotinylated mOP adjusted to a final volume of 500 μl with HKMG buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCI, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5% Nodinet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF with a complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)) for 1 h at 4 °C and then further incubated with 150 μl of 4% streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for another 3 h at 4 °C. The optimal concentration of the biotinylated probe was assessed by first using increasing concentrations of the probe to reach maximal binding. All subsequent experiments were done using this probe concentration. At the end of incubation the tube was centrifuged at 5000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 30 s. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet washed four times with 1 ml of iced phosphate-buffered saline. The pellet was then resuspended in 500 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min to elute protein and centrifuge at 5000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 30 s. The sample was placed on a 6–10% SDS-PAGE gel for further separation on a polyvinylidene difluoride nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the proteins were viewed using Lumiglo chemiluminescence (KPL Laboratories, Washington D. C.). The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays–ChIP assays were performed using the Upstate Biotechnology Assay (Charlottesville, VA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HPK1Aras cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to 40–50% confluency. Cells were synchronized in serum-free DMEM overnight. Medium was then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS and pretreated for 1 h with 10-6 m UO126 (Promega, Madison, WI) or vehicle (Me2SO), before addition of 10-7 m 1,25(OH)2D3 for 4 h. The concentration of UO126 used is consistent with its Kd for the enzyme reported elsewhere (15Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was then cross-linked by adding 37% formaldehyde directly to the medium to a final concentration of 1%, and the incubation continued at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor (mini complete protease inhibitor tablet, Roche Applied Science), collected, and lysed in SDS lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor. The bulk chromatin was then sonicated to obtain DNA fragments between 200 and 500 bp. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the sonicated chromatin supernatant was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer for the immunoprecipitation assay. An aliquot of the diluted supernatant was used to quantitate the amount of DNA input by PCR. To reduce the nonspecific background the diluted chromatin supernatant was pre-treated with protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (50% v/v slurry) for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. The samples were centrifuged, and the recovered chromatin solutions were incubated with anti-VDR (C-20) or anti-DRIP205 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Negative controls were prepared from pre-treated chromatin supernatant in which the VDR antibody is replaced with IgG. The antibody·chromatin complex was collected by adding 60 μl of protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (50% v/v slurry) and incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The protein A-agarose/antibody·chromatin complex was then washed sequentially 5 min in the following order: 1) low salt immune complex wash buffer; 2) high salt immune complex wash buffer; 3) LiCl immune complex was buffer, and 4) TE buffer. Finally, the chromatin complex was eluted with a freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3), and the cross-linking was reversed by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 0.2 m and incubating overnight at 65 °C. The DNA was purified using the Qiagen QIA quick PCR purification kit prior to analysis. PCR of Chromatin Templates–10 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA was used as a template for each PCR reaction using the following conditions as described previously (17Wang T.T. Tavera-Mendoza L.E. Laperriere D. Libby E. Burton MacLeod N. Nagai Y. Bourdeau V. Konstorum A. Lallemant B. Zhang R. Mader S. White J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar): preincubation for 5 min at 94 °C, denaturation by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, annealing at primer specific temperature for 30 s (Table 1), and elongation for 30 s at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel by electrophoresis, visualized with ethidium bromide, and quantified by laser densitometry.TABLE 1Primers used in this studyPromoterAnnealing temperatureLocationPrimer sequence°CCyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (P21waf1/cip1)60–2029 to –24785′–CACCACTGAGCCTTCCTCAC–3′5′–CTGACTCCCAGCACACACTC–3′Cyclin C60–1786 to –21765′–CAGTCAGCATCTGAGGCAAC–3′5′–GCCACCACACTCCGCTAATT–3′Vitamin D 24 hydroxylase (CYP24)66–64 to –4805′–GTCCAGGCTGGGGGTATCTG–3′5′–CCACTCCGCCCTCCTCTGCG–3′Calmin (calponin-like, transmembrane) (CLMN)60–1522 to –18285′–TCCACAGGAAGTTCTGTCCTGGC–3′5′–AATCCTGGGAGCCCTGCG–3′ Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis–Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance or by Student's t test. A probability value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Expression of Heterodimeric Partners of RXRα and Coactivators in HPK1A and HPK1Aras Keratinocytes–In this study, we performed Western blotting of whole cell extracts to identify the heterodimeric partners of RXRα and coactivators expressed in the keratinocyte cell lines (Fig. 1). In addition to VDR (panel A, lanes 1 and 2) and RXRα (panel A, lanes 3 and 4), RARα (panel A, lanes 5 and 6), TRβ (panel A, lanes 7 and 8), and PPARγ (panel A, lanes 9 and 10) were expressed in these cells. TRα and PPARα protein expression were not found in the cell lines (data not shown). We next examined the nuclear expression of coactivators using specific antibodies and found that DRIP205 and RIP140 were expressed at high levels (panel B, lanes 1–4), whereas ACTR (SRC3/AIB1/TRAM1) was expressed at low levels (panel B, lanes 5 and 6) and SRC1 (panel B, lanes 7 and 8) and GRIP1 (SRC2/TIF2) (panel B, lanes 9 and 10) could not be detected. Several bands of higher and lower molecular weight were observed for some of the receptors or cofactors. In some cases (RIP140) a band of higher molecular weight was observed in HPK1Aras but not in HPK1A cells. However, reprobing of these blots with only an anti-IgG antibody indicated that these bands were nonspecific. β-Tubulin expression of whole cell extracts (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) was used as an indicator of protein loading. Gel Mobility Shift Analysis of RXR-Heterodimeric Partner Binding–Our previous studies suggested that phosphorylation of RXRα on serine 260 induces a conformational change within the receptor (9Solomon C. White J.H. Kremer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), because the LBD antibody, which spans serine 260, was unable to supershift the VDR·RXRα complex, whereas an antibody directed at the NH2-terminal domain of RXRα could recognize this complex. In contrast an antibody directed against the VDR consistently recognized the VDR·RXRα complex in HPK1Aras cells. In the present study, we extended our observations to the interaction between the other heterodimeric partners of RXRα as well as the homodimeric RXRα·RXRα complex formation using specific response element and ligands. Fig. 2 illustrates the ability of nuclear extracts from HPK1A and HPK1Aras to form complexes that recognize a 32P-labeled response element specific for each receptor. Fig. 2A is shown as a positive control experiment using a 32P-labeled mouse osteopontin (mOP) double-stranded oligonucleotide in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3. In Fig. 2A (lanes 1 and 7) a VDR·RXRα complex is observed in both HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells, which binds to the vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE), mOP, in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3. The specificity of this complex is further demonstrated by addition of antibodies directed at the VDR and RXRα in HPK1A and HPK1Aras extracts. The binding of this complex to mOP results in a supershift following the addition of an antibody directed either against the C terminus portion of the VDR (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 8) (17Wang T.T. Tavera-Mendoza L.E. Laperriere D. Libby E. Burton MacLeod N. Nagai Y. Bourdeau V. Konstorum A. Lallemant B. Zhang R. Mader S. White J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) or an antibody directed at the NH2 terminus portion of RXRα (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 9). In contrast an antibody directed at the LBD (C-terminal antibody) of the RXRα shifted the complex in HPK1A extracts (Fig. 2A, lane 4) but not in HPK1Aras extracts (Fig. 2A, lane 10). The supershift normally observed in HPK1A cells incubated with the RXRα LBD antibody (lanes 4 and 6) could be restored in the HPK1Aras cells by either the transient transfection of the non-phosphorylable mutant RXRα Ser-260 → Ala (Fig. 2A, lane 14) or pre-treatment of HPK1Aras cells with the MAPKK inhibitor PD098059 (Fig. 2A, lane 12). The recognition of the VDR·RXR complex in HPK1Aras cell extracts by either a VDR antibody or an RXR antibody (directed against the N terminus of RXR away from Ser-260) indicate that heterodimerization of the VDR·RXR complex takes place. However, the absence of recognition of the VDR.RXR complex by an antibody against the C terminus of RXRα (LBD domain) also indicates that phosphorylation of RXRα at Ser-260 prevents the recognition of this complex by this antibody likely through conformational changes in this region. Furthermore, when phosphorylation of Ser-260 is prevented by either MAPKK inhibition or introduction of an alanine residue at position 260, the VDR·RXR complex is recognized by the C-terminal antibody against the LBD domain indicating that these conformational changes are reversible. We next examined the formation of the homodimeric complex RXRα·RXRα (Fig. 2B). Nuclear extracts from HPK1A and HPK1Aras cells formed a complex with a 32P-labeled RXRE double-stranded oligonucleotide in the presence of the RXRα ligand LG1069 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 6). This complex could be shifted by the addition of an antibody directed at the NH2 terminus portion of the RXRα with both HPK1A and HPK1Aras extracts (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 7). In contrast, and similar to the observation with the VDR·RXRα complex formation, the antibody directed at the LBD of the RXRα shifted the RXRα·RXRα complex in HPK1A extracts (Fig. 2B, lane 3) but not in HPK1Aras extracts (Fig. 2B, lane 8). The supershift could then be restored in HPK1Aras cells by either transient transfection with the mutant RXRα Ser-260 → Ala (Fig. 2B, lane 12) or pre-treatment of HPK1Aras cells with the MAPKK inhibitor PD098059 (Fig. 2B, lane 10) as compared with vector alone (Fig. 2B, lane 8). As controls addition of PD098059 to HPK1A cells had no effect on either RXRα·RXRα complex formation (Fig. 2B, lane 4) or its normal supershift (Fig. 2B, lane 5). These data therefore indicate that Ser-260 phosphorylation in HPK1Aras extracts do not affect homodimerization of the RXR·RXR complex but alters its recognition by a specific antibody raised against the LBD. The next set of experiments was aimed at determining the consequences of RXRα phosphorylation at Ser-260 on the other heterodimeric partners of the RXRα. Similar experiments were performed with specific response elements and antibodies directed at the RARα, TRβ, and PPARγ. Addition of specific ligands to the RARα (ATRA), TRβ (T3), and PPARγ (troglitazone) resulted in complex formation recognized by 32P-labeled RARE (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 7), 32P-labeled thyroid hormone response elemen"

Many inhibitors reverse MDR but, like cyclosporin A (CsA), have significant toxicities. MDR1 is also a translocase that flips glucosylceramide inside the Golgi to enhance neutral glycosphingolipid (GSL) synthesis. We observed partial MDR1/globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) cell surface co-localization, and GSL removal depleted cell surface MDR1. MDR1 may therefore interact with GSLs. AdamantylGb3, a water-soluble Gb3 mimic, but not other GSL analogs, reversed MDR1-MDCK cell drug resistance. Cell surface MDR1 was up-regulated 1 h after treatment with CsA or adaGb3, but at 72 h, cell surface expression was lost. Intracellular MDR1 accumulated throughout, suggesting long term defects in plasma membrane MDR1 trafficking. AdaGb3 or CsA rapidly reduced rhodamine 123 cellular efflux. MDR1 also mediates gastrointestinal epithelial drug efflux, restricting oral bioavailability. Vinblastine apical-to-basal transport in polarized human intestinal C2BBe1 cells was significantly increased when adaGb3 was added to both sides, or to the apical side only, comparable with verapamil, a standard MDR1 inhibitor. Disulfide cross-linking of mutant MDR1s showed no binding of adaGb3 to the MDR1 verapamil/cyclosporin-binding site between surface proximal helices of transmembrane segments (TM) 6 and TM7, but rather to an adjacent site nearer the center of TM6 and the TM7 extracellular face, i.e. close to the bilayer leaflet interface.

The MDR phenotype has been associated with overexpression of P-glycoprotein in cancer cells (1Germann U.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 927-944Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (429) Google Scholar). MDR1 is a 170-kDa plasma membrane glycoprotein that uses ATP to pump hydrophobic molecules out of the cell (2Riordan J. Deuchars K. Kartner N. Alon N. Trent J. Ling V. Nature. 1985; 316: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 3Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). Its efflux function decreases drug concentration in tumor cells that results in chemotherapy failure. MDR1 is expressed in relatively high levels in the apical membranes of epithelial cells of intestine, kidney, liver, and blood-brain/testes barriers (4Thiebaut F. Tsuruo T. Hamada H. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Willingham M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7735-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (2560) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of MDR1 within the endothelial cells' epithelium can affect the bioavailability and the oral availability of therapeutic drugs (5Oswald S. Haenisch S. Fricke C. Sudhop T.

Various attempts have been made to reverse this resistance using MDR1 inhibitors that interact with MDR1 and block drug efflux. First generation modulators such as calcium channel blockers, calmodulin inhibitors, and cyclosporin were developed for pharmacological uses other than reversal of MDR and were relatively nonspecific and weak inhibitors that were also substrates of MDR1, and their deleterious toxicities with their use at required concentrations to inhibit MDR1 have limited their clinical use (6Ford J.M. Yang J.M. Hait W.N. Cancer Treat. Res. 1996; 87: 3-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Sikic B.I. Fisher G.A. Lum B.L. Halsey J. Beketic-Oreskovic L. Chen G. Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 13-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical trials with second generation modulators such as the cyclosporin analog, PSC 833, or dexverapamil VX-710 have demonstrated some clinical benefits in terms of enhancement of pharmacokinetics but also increased toxicity of cytotoxic drugs when administered with these modulators (8Fisher G.A.

To date, a third generation of more potent and specific modulators or inhibitors such as GG918 and LY335979 have overcome toxicity side effects but exhibited no significant pharmacokinetic interaction with doxorubicin, etoposide, and paclitaxel in animal studies to make them suitable for co-administration in cancer therapy (10Hyafil F.

In recent years, links have been established between MDR1 and glycosphingolipids (GSL). Many cells expressing MDR1 show elevated levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and sphingomyelin (12Lucci A. Cho W. Han T. Giuliano A. Morton D. Cabot M. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol.

Cancer. 1999; 81: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Retroviral transfection of MDCK cells with human MDR1 gene results in a major increase in neutral GSLs (17Lala P. Ito S. Lingwood C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showing that CsA inhibits neutral GSL biosynthesis lead us to propose MDR1 as a Golgi glucosylceramide flippase that enhances neutral GSL synthesis (18De Rosa M.F. Sillence D. Ackerley C. Lingwood C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7867-7876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We also observed partial MDR1 and globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) cell surface co-localization and that inhibition of GSL biosynthesis depleted cell surface MDR1. MDR1 may therefore interact with Gb3. In this study, the effect of a water-soluble derivative of Gb3, adamantylGb3 (19Mylvaganam M. Lingwood C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), on MDR/MDR1 was analyzed. Verotoxin was used to probe the potential role of Gb3 in MDR1 function. Materials–AdamantylGb3 was prepared as described previously (19Mylvaganam M. Lingwood C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Dimethylformamide was added to a solution of oxalyl chloride in dichloromethane. Adamantane acetic acid was then slowly added over 30 min. After stirring at room temperature for 2 h, oxalyl chloride in excess and solvent were removed under a stream of N2, and residual adamantane acetic acid was dissolved in dichloromethane. LysoGb3, prepared by hydrolysis of Gb3, was suspended in dichloromethane and pyridine, and then 2 aliquots of the adamantane acetic acid solution were added at 30-min intervals. After the reaction, the mixture was dried under N2 (TLC; chloroform:methanol:water, 80:20:2 (v/v/v)) and the product purified on a mini silica column. Adamantylgalactosylceramide (adaGalCer) was similarly made from lysogalactosylceramide, prepared by hydrolysis of galactosylceramide. Verotoxin 1 B subunit (VT1 B subunit) (20Ramotar K. Boyd B. Tyrrell G. Gariepy J. Lingwood C. Brunton J. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was purified by affinity chromatography as described (21Boulanger J. Huesca M. Arab S. Lingwood C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). VT1B was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Invitrogen) as described (25Khine A.A. Lingwood C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against purified VT1 B subunit was prepared as described previously (22Boyd B. Richardson S. Gariepy J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 750-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclosporin A and vinblastine were purchased from Sigma. Verapamil was a gift from A. Rasymas (Faculty of Pharmacy, Ohio State University). [3H]Vinblastine (11.2 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [14C]Mannitol (55.1 mCi/mmol) was purchased from DuPont. Cell Culture–MDCK cells transfected with the human MDR1 cDNA were a gift from Dr. M. Gottesman (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) (23Pastan I. Gottesman M. Ueda K. Lovelace E. Rutherford A. Willingham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4486-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). SKVLB ovarian carcinoma cell line (MDR variant of the parental SKOV3) and C2BBe1 cell line (“brush border-expressing”), subclone of human colorectal epithelial Caco-2 cell line, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Multicell, Wisent Inc., Quebec, Canada) supplemented with 5 and 15% fetal bovine serum, respectively, as well as 100 units penicillin/ml and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Multicell, Wisent Inc., Quebec, Canada). MDR1-MDCK medium also contained 80 ng/ml colchicine, and SKVLB medium contained 1 μg/ml vinblastine to maintain a continuous selection pressure to express MDR1. C2BBe1 cell line is cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Multicell, Wisent Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.01 mg/ml human transferrin (Sigma). All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Immunostaining of Cell Surface MDR1–MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB cells were grown on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips in a 24-well plate (BD Biosciences). For inhibition of glycolipid biosynthesis, MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB cells were grown in the presence of 5 μm of 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP; Matreya Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA) for 5 days (24Abe A. Inokuchi J. Jimbo M. Shimeno H. Nagamatsu A. Shayman J.A. Shukla G.S. Radin N.S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For MDR1 inhibition studies, MDR1-MDCK cells were grown in the presence of 4 μm CsA or 50 μm adaGb3 for 1, 3, 72 h and 4 days. For cell surface distribution of MDR1, cells previously washed with 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were incubated with MRK-16 monoclonal antibody anti-MDR1 (10 μg/ml; Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) also at 4 °C for 1 h. Following extensive washing with 50 mm PBS, the coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, mounted with Dako Cytomation fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Cytomation, CA), and examined by Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Fluorescent images were captured, stored, and analyzed with LSM software (26Bolte S. Cordelieres F.P. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Digital images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop 8.0 for image handling. Post-embedding Immunogold Cryo-electron Microscopy–Logarithmic phase MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB cells were washed twice with PBS and treated ±5 μg/ml VT1 B subunit at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were then harvested by scraping, pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Sorenson's phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2–4 h. Cells were then lightly pelleted and washed thoroughly in phosphate buffer. The cells were then embedded in 15% gelatin, cut into mm3 pieces, and infused with 2.3 m sucrose for several hours. The blocks were then mounted on aluminum cryo-ultramicrotomy pins and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were then cut on a diamond knife at –95 °C using a Leica Ultracut R cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica Canada). Sections were transferred to Formvar-coated nickel grids in a loop of molten sucrose and the grids washed thoroughly in PBS containing 0.15% glycine and 0.5% bovine serum albumin and PBS containing bovine serum albumin alone. Sections were then incubated with a polyclonal antibody against VT1 B subunit (1:2000) for 1 h. Following a thorough rinse in PBS/bovine serum albumin, samples were incubated in goat anti-rabbit IgG 5 nm gold complex (Amersham Biosciences) for an hour. This procedure was repeated on the same specimens except monoclonal antibody anti-MDR1 (MRK-16, 5 μg/ml) was used as the primary antibody and goat anti mouse IgG 10 nm gold complex as the secondary antibody. Sections were then rinsed thoroughly with PBS followed by distilled water and stabilized in a thin film of methylcellulose containing 0.2% uranyl acetate. Controls included the omission of primary and secondary antisera and the use of an irrelevant antibody (either poly- or monoclonal anti glial fibrillary acidic protein). Samples were then examined in a JEOL JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA) and images recorded either on photographic plates or with a CCD camera (AMT Corp.). Image analysis was performed on a minimum of 100 images from each group at a nominal magnification of ×100,000 using an image analysis program (Image Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics). Cytotoxicity Assay–MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB cells were cultured in the presence of either 4 μm CsA, 20 or 50 μm of adaGb3, or 20 μm of adaGC, and tested for sensitivity to vinblastine over 3 days relative to untreated cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (DDTB) assay (27Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46264) Google Scholar). The parental drug-sensitive cell line, MDCK-1, was also cultured in the presence of either 4 μm CsA or 50 μm of adaGb3 as a control. Briefly, cells pretreated after 4 days with CsA, adaGb3, or adaGalCer were plated into 96-well plates in α-minimal essential medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with increasing dilutions of vinblastine. After 72 h, 20 μl of a 5 mg/ml DDTB solution was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h. Supernatants were removed, and 100 μl of acidified isopropyl alcohol was added and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Plates were agitated for 2–3 min, then read on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 490 nm. The concentration required to inhibit growth by 50% (IC50 values) was calculated from the cytotoxicity curves using GraphPad Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego). The fold reversal of multidrug resistance was calculated by dividing the IC50 values in the absence of the MDR1 inhibitors by those in the presence of the MDR1 inhibitors. Drug Transport–Transport of 0.1 μm [3H]vinblastine, a P-glycoprotein substrate, was measured across a C2BBe1 intestinal epithelial cell monolayer (a polarized subclone of Caco2 cells) grown on a permeable membrane (Costar Transwell: 0.2 μm pore size; polycarbonate filter). After preincubation for 45 min in the incubation media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media) without vinblastine, transport experiments were conducted at 37 °C. At time 0, labeled vinblastine was added to either the basal or apical side of the monolayer in the presence or absence of an inhibitor on both sides. Time course of basal-to-apical transport was examined by monitoring the appearance of radioactivity in the apical side after adding vinblastine to the basal side. Apical-to-basal transport was examined by monitoring appearance of radioactivity from the apical to the basal side. As an extracellular marker, [14C]mannitol was used with [3H]vinblastine to ensure integrity of the monolayer. The data obtained from the filter preparation, which showed more than 4% of mannitol concentration over 2 h (relative to the initial concentration in the opposite side at time 0), were excluded. Rhodamine 123 Efflux Assay–For this assay, all the steps were performed at 37 °C on cells grown in chambers with borosilicate coverglass system at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml. MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB cells were preincubated for 30 min with assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.4 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 3.0 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 122 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose) (28Fontaine M. Elmquist W.F. Miller D.W. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 1521-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 29Hammerle S.P. Rothen-Rutishauser B. Kramer S.D. Gunthert M. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2000; 12: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After the preincubation period, the assay buffer was removed and replaced with 2.5 ml of assay buffer containing 100 μg/ml of rhodamine 123 (rho123) (Sigma). After 20 min, the wells were washed three times for 5 min with assay buffer. For inhibition studies, 50 μm adamantylGb3 or 10 μm cyclosporin A for positive control in assay buffer were added 5 min prior to the addition of rho123 and maintained in all the solutions until visualization. MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB cells were also tested when treatment with 50 μm adamantylGb3 was for 24 h. The efflux of rho123 was directly visualized in these chambers by Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd.). Fluorescent images were captured, stored, and analyzed with LSM software. Disulfide Cross-linking Analysis–Construction of the human P-glycoprotein cross-linkable mutants F343C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), F343C(TM6)/Q725C(TM7), and L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7) was described previously (30Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mutant cDNAs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells (25 10-cm plates). The cells were harvested and washed three times with PBS, and membranes were prepared as described (32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were suspended in 0.3 ml of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and preincubated for 15 min at 22 °C in the presence of different concentrations of the Gb3 analog, verapamil, or no drug. Samples were then cross-linked by incubation with 0.2 mm of the methanethiosulfonate cross-linker, 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M14M, 2.08 nm spacer arm) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Downsview, Ontario, Canada) (a 1/10th volume of 2 mm M14M was added) for 3 min on ice. The cross-linking reactions were stopped by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS containing 50 mm EDTA) and no reducing agent. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide) and immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against MDR1 (18De Rosa M.F. Sillence D. Ackerley C. Lingwood C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7867-7876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Intramolecular disulfide cross-linking between TMD1 and TMD2 can be detected because of slower mobility of the cross-linked product on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (33Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The amount of cross-linking was quantitated by scanning the gel lanes followed by analysis with the NIH Image Program Image J 1.34s (available at www.rsb.info.nih.gov). Western Blot Analysis of MDR1–Untreated MDR1-MDCK cells or cells pretreated overnight with 10 μm CsA, or 4 μg/ml VT1B, or for 1 h, 3 h, overnight, 3 days, or 4 days with 50 μm adaGb3, or for 5 days with PPMP were pelleted by centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed three times with cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% NaN3, 5% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1 h with shaking at 4 °C. After spinning for 20 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, protein was determined in supernatants using a BCA-protein assay (Pierce). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed by loading 5 μg of protein per sample onto a 8% polyacrylamide gel using a standard procedure (34Laemmeli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The transferred nitrocellulose blot was blocked with 5% skim milk powder in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 at 37 °C for 1 h. The membrane was then immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody C219 (1 μg/ml) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) in 1% skim milk overnight and was washed three times with 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG 1:1000 (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature, the blot was developed using Supersignal West PICO enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Pierce). MDR1 in Part Co-localizes with Gb3 at Cell Surface–Our previous immunofluorescence study (17Lala P. Ito S. Lingwood C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) had suggested that Gb3 and MDR1 were, in part, located in similar regions of the plasma membrane. The possible cell surface co-localization of MDR1 and Gb3 was therefore more precisely defined by double labeling cryo-immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 1A). Morphometry established that 33% of MDR1 was within 25 nm of VT1 in MDR1-MDCK cells. This is a conservative estimate of co-localization, because the theoretical maximum distance for co-localized antigens by indirect gold labeling is 50 nm. Prolonged inhibition of GSL synthesis prevented the cell surface detection of MDR1 by confocal immunomicroscopy (Fig. 1B). Similarly treatment with the MDR1 inhibitor, CsA, resulted in the loss of MDR1 surface staining. AdaGb3 Prevents Multidrug Resistance in MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB Cells–MDR1-MDCK cells are resistant to vinblastine compared with the parental cell line MDCK. The ability of adaGb3 to reverse the drug resistance phenotype of MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB was examined and compared with that of CsA, and with adaGalCer to test specificity. Concentrations of 50 μm of either adaGb3 or adaGalCer had no cytotoxic effects on MDR1-MDCK cells within the experimental period. AdaGb3 at 50 μm significantly reversed the resistance of MDR1-MDCK cells to vinblastine (Fig. 2A) and reduced the IC50 values similar to CsA (IC50 MDR1 = 12.6 μg/ml versus IC50 MDR1CsA = 8.8 × 10–6 μg/ml and IC50 MDR1adaGb3–50 = 7.2 × 10–6 μg/ml). Even treatment with adaGb3 at 20 μm reduced the IC50 value (IC50 MDR1adaGb3–20 = 9.6 × 10–2 μg/ml). Treatment with adaGalCer did not reverse the drug resistance phenotype of MDR1-MDCK cells (IC50 MDR1adaGC = 13.9 μg/ml) showing a specific effect for adaGb3 on the modulation of MDR1 function (Fig. 2A). Both CsA and adaGb3, if anything, slightly reduced vinblastine sensitivity of the highly sensitive, parental untransfected MDCK-1 cells.FIGURE 2Effect of adamantylGb3 on cell resistance to vinblastine.

The effect of AdaGb3 and CsA on vinblastine sensitivity was also tested in the parental drug-sensitive cell line MDCK1, with no significant effect, as a control. AdaGb3 Inhibits Cell Surface MDR1 Expression in the Long Term in MDR1-MDCK and SKVLB Cells but Increases Intracellular MDR1 as PPMP, VT1B, and CsA–MDR1-MDCK cells pretreated with adaGb3 for 4 days and stained with anti-MDR1 at 4 °C showed complete loss of cell surface MDR1 expression (Fig. 3A, i, panel b) compared with the control with no pretreatment (Fig. 3A, i, panel a). Treatment with another adamantylGSL analog, adamantylgalactosylceramide (adaGalCer) had no effect on MDR1 staining (Fig. 3A, i, panel d). This absence of MDR1 cell surface expression was also observed when the cells were pretreated with CsA, a standard inhibitor of MDR1 (Fig. 3A, i, panel c). Similar prevention of cell surface MDR1 expression by adaGb3 and CsA was seen for SKVLB cells (Fig. 3A, ii, panels a–d). A time course pretreatment of MDR1-MDCK cells with adaGb3 and CsA for 1, 3, and 72 h showed that adaGb3 up-regulates MDR1 cell surface expression at 3 h, but by 72 h, it is complete"
https://openalex.org/W2134320267,"Supernova SN 2006gy in the galaxy NGC 1260 is the most luminous recorded. Its progenitor might have been a very massive (>100 Mo, where is the mass of the Sun) star, but that interpretation is incompatible with hydrogen in the spectrum of the supernova; stars >40 Moare believed to have shed their hydrogen envelopes several hundred thousand years before the explosion. Alternatively, the progenitor might have arisen from the merger of two massive stars. Here we show that the collision frequency of massive stars in a dense and young cluster (of the kind to be expected near the centre of a galaxy) is sufficient to provide a reasonable chance that SN 2006gy resulted from such a bombardment. If this is the correct explanation, then we predict that when the supernova fades (in a year or so) a dense cluster of massive stars will become visible at the site of the explosion."
https://openalex.org/W1968718587,"The Shaker family potassium channel, Kv1.2, is a key determinant of membrane excitability in neurons and cardiovascular tissue. Kv1.2 is subject to multiple forms of regulation and therefore integrates cellular signals involved in the homeostasis of excitability. The cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway enhances Kv1.2 ionic current; however, the mechanisms for this are not fully known. Here we show that cAMP maintains Kv1.2 homeostasis through opposing effects on channel trafficking. We found that Kv1.2 is regulated by two distinct cAMP pathways, one PKA-dependent and the other PKA-independent. PKA inhibitors elevate Kv1.2 surface levels, suggesting that basal levels of cAMP control steady-state turnover of the channel. Elevation of cAMP above basal levels also increases the amount of Kv1.2 at the cell surface. This effect is not blocked by PKA inhibitors, but is blocked by inhibition of Kv1.2 endocytosis. We conclude that Kv1.2 levels at the cell surface are kept in dynamic balance by opposing effects of cAMP.

The voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.2, plays an important role in modulating membrane potential, and its effects are associated with a wide range of human pathologies. In the brain, Kv1.2 is associated with seizure activity (1Brew H.M. Gittelman J.X. Silverstein R.S. Hanks T.D. Demas V.P. Robinson L.C. Robbins C.A. McKee-Johnson J. Chiu S.Y. Messing A. Tempel B.L.

Disruption of that regulation may underlie some of the pathologies associated with Kv1.2 function. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms of Kv1.2 regulation is essential for understanding a broad range of pathological conditions. A key modulator of Kv1.2 function is the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A (PKA) 2The abbreviations used are: PKAprotein kinase ABFAbrefeldin A, GFP, green fluorescent proteinWTwild typeFAformic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyHEKhuman embryonic kidneyMS/MStandem mass spectrometryPDEphosphodiesteraseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseBAPTA, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′N′-tetraacetic acidsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. signaling pathway. Stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors causes a potent and reversible enhancement of Kv1.2 ionic current. Part of the mechanism for this increase is alteration of the channel's biophysical properties by PKA (9Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); activation of PKA increases the time that single channels spend in higher conductance states. Mutational analysis revealed that an N-terminal threonine (Thr-46) within a PKA consensus sequence is required for the response to PKA, suggesting direct phosphorylation of the channel protein at this site (9Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to positive regulation by PKA, Kv1.2 can be negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (11Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, for example, elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.2 and the resultant suppression of its ionic current (11Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 1145-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.2 also elicits endocytosis of the channel, and this endocytosis is a mechanism for current suppression (10Nesti E. Everill B. Morielli A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4073-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This process is dependent upon the proteins dynamin and cortactin, both of which are well known for their roles in endocytosis (12Williams M.R. Markey J.C. Doczi M.A. Morielli A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17412-17417Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J.

Therefore, tyrosine kinase-dependent trafficking is an important mechanism for regulation of Kv1.2 activity. It is not known whether trafficking plays an equally important role in Kv1.2 regulation by cAMP/PKA. protein kinase A brefeldin A, GFP, green fluorescent protein wild type formic acid high pressure liquid chromatography human embryonic kidney tandem mass spectrometry phosphodiesterase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase N′-tetraacetic acid small interfering RNA. Trafficking of a variety of membrane proteins is modulated by the cAMP/PKA pathway. Elevation of cAMP inhibits the rapid endocytosis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, thus increasing the amount of channel at the cell surface (15Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which cAMP affects the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator are varied and may involve both PKA-dependent and PKA-independent mechanisms (16Chang S.Y. Di A. Naren A.P. Palfrey H.C. Kirk K.L. Nelson D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Howard M. Jiang X. Stolz D.B. Hill W.G. Johnson J.A. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A.

Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10384-10387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); however, this can also occur via a PKA-independent mechanism (20Lu H. Sun T.X. Bouley R. Blackburn K. McLaughlin M. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F233-F243Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Valenti G. Procino G. Carmosino M. Frigeri A. Mannucci R. Nicoletti I. Svelto M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1985-1992PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, increasing cAMP enhances trafficking of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (ENaC) to the plasma membrane, and defects in this trafficking are associated with Liddle syndrome (22Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cAMP/PKA pathway is an important regulator of plasma membrane protein trafficking. Furthermore, the mechanisms involved are varied; in some cases, cAMP modulates trafficking via PKA, but in other cases, cAMP works independently of PKA. Here, we show that the cAMP/PKA pathway influences Kv1.2 trafficking. Our experiments reveal distinct PKA-dependent and PKA-independent effects on Kv1.2 surface levels. Our findings suggest this occurs through cAMP-dependent modulation of channel endocytosis. Low cAMP levels maintain basal PKA activity, which enhances constitutive Kv1.2 endocytosis, and high cAMP levels inhibit constitutive endocytosis of the channel independently of PKA. We conclude that homeostasis of Kv1.2 expression in the plasma membrane is dependent on a critical balance of cAMP levels within the cell. MaterialsAntibody directed against the first extracellular loop of Kv1.2 (anti-Kv1.2e) was developed with assistance from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Anti-phosphorylated RXX(S/T) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), and anti-Kv1.2 and anti-Kvβ2 monoclonal antibodies from the University of California (Davis, CA). A rabbit anti-Kv1.2 antibody raised against a peptide region within the carboxyl terminus of Kv1.2 (anti-Kv1.2p) was developed with assistance from Cocalico (Reamstown, PA). Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies and phalloidin (Invitrogen) were used for immunofluorescence. Non-targeting siRNA (D-0012106) and cortactin siRNA (M-010508) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Isoproterenol, propranolol, and isobutylmethylxanthine were purchased from Sigma; myristoylated PKA inhibitor peptide was from BIOMOL International (Plymouth Meeting, PA); and all other reagents were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA) unless noted otherwise. Tissue CultureTwo different stable cell lines were used: clonal human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (HEK-M) and the HEK-M clonal cell line also stably expressing Kv1.2α and Kvβ2 (HEK-K). Cells were cultured as reported previously (10Nesti E. Everill B. Morielli A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4073-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures were plated to a low density (25,000 cells/cm2) onto poly-d-lysine-coated tissue culture plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and subsequently placed in serum-free medium overnight. Following stimulus treatment where appropriate, cells were metabolically poisoned with 0.5% sodium azide for 30 min at 37 °C to block endocytosis and then processed for flow cytometry or Western blot analysis as described previously (10Nesti E. Everill B. Morielli A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4073-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection of HEK CellsDynamin was expressed using pEGFP-N1. Dynamin K44A was generously provided by Dr. Mark A. McNiven. GFP was expressed using pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Kv1.2α and Kvβ2 were expressed using the pRK5 mammalian expression vector. Mutagenesis primers were purchased from Operon Biotechnologies (Huntsville, AL), and mutagenesis was performed with the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (La Jolla, CA). HEK-M or HEK-K cells were transiently transfected with Kv1.2, mutant Kv1.2 subunit, Kvβ2 subunit, GFP, or dynamin K44A using the TransIT-293 liposomal transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) as per the supplied protocol. siRNA was transiently transfected with calcium phosphate. Detection of Kv1.2 Surface Levels by Flow CytometrySurface Kv1.2 was labeled with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-Kv1.2e) directed against an extracellular epitope within the channel. Secondary labeling was done with a fluorescently conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Kv1.2 surface levels were quantified as the number of cells emitting at 667 nm with fluorescence intensity above a threshold value determined using control IgG-labeled cells. For experiments requiring transient transfection, GFP was used as a marker, and emission at 667 nm was taken only from cells with green fluorescence. Flow cytometry was done with the Easycyte single laser flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA). Analysis of cell populations and histograms was done with FCS Express and WinMDI softwares, respectively. Alkaline Phosphatase TreatmentCell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 95,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (20 units) for 60 min at 37 °C in a buffer designed to support alkaline phosphatase activity (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 8.2) or a buffer designed to inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 4.3). Immunoprecipitation and ImmunoblotCells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 11 mm EDTA, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4 BAPTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (Sigma, catalog no. P8340), phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem, catalog nos. 524624 and 524625), pH 8.0). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 4 min, and the resulting supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 95,000 × g for 10 min. Kv1.2 was immunoprecipitated from the ultracentrifuge supernatant using anti-Kv1.2p antibody. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads and then separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting detection of Kv1.2 was done with anti-Kv1.2 monoclonal antibody. Blots were imaged and quantified with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor, Lincoln NE). ElectrophysiologyHEK-K cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm tissue culture dishes as described above, but were not treated with sodium azide. Kv1.2 ionic current was measured using a whole-cell voltage clamp. The pipette solution contained 120 mm KCl, 3.69 mm CaCl2 (60 nm free Ca2+), 94 μm MgCl2 (100 nm free Mg2+), 5 mm BAPTA, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaHEPES, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.1; the bath saline contained 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 23 mm glucose, and 5 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4. The experimental chamber was maintained at 35 °C. Maximum series resistance error was calculated to be <4% and was not compensated. Currents were evoked with a family of 75-ms voltage steps in 10-mV increments from -70 to +50 mV. Recordings were made immediately after break-in to limit spontaneous current rundown. Data collection was done with an Axopatch 200D amplifier interfaced via a Digi-Data 1322A D/A converter to a Windows-based computer running the pCLAMP data acquisition program Clampex (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data analysis was performed with the pCLAMP data analysis program Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and with Origin (Microcal, Northampton, MA). ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence imaging was performed as described previously (10Nesti E. Everill B. Morielli A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4073-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Images were acquired with the DeltaVision deconvolution restoration microscopy system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Mass SpectrometryA Coomassie-stained band corresponding to Kv1.2 was excised, diced, and subjected to in-gel digestion with sequencing grade modified trypsin (6 ng/μl; Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile (MeCN), 2.5% formic acid (FA) and then dried. Peptides were then resuspended in 2.5% MeCN, 2.5% FA and loaded using a Micro-AS autosampler (Thermo Electron, Waltham, MA) onto a 100-μm inner diameter fused silica microcapillary column prepared in-house and packed with 12 cm of reverse phase MagicC18 material (5 μm, 200 Å; Michrom Bioresources, Inc., Auburn, CA). Using a Surveyor MS HPLC Pump Plus (Thermo Electron), peptides were eluted using a 5-35% MeCN (0.15% FA) gradient over 50 min, after a 14-min isocratic loading at 2.5% MeCN, 0.15% FA. The HPLC solvents used to achieve separation were 2.5% MeCN, 0.15% FA (solvent A) and 97.5% MeCN, 0.15% FA (solvent B). Mass spectra were acquired in an LTQ-XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron) over the entire run using 10 MS/MS scans following each survey scan. Instrument control was performed using the Xcalibur software package (version 2.0, SR2, Thermo Electron). Raw data were searched against a Kv1.2 sequence data base using Sequest software (version 27, revision 12, Thermo Electron) with no enzyme specificity and a 2-Da mass tolerance. Cysteine residues were required to have a static increase in 71 Da for acrylamide adduction. Differential modifications of 80 Da for serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, as well as 16 Da for methionine residues, were permitted, and phospho-specific neutral loss increases to XCorr scoring were turned off. After initially identifying each phospho-tryptic peptide corresponding to serines 440 and 449, targeted MS/MS analyses on the corresponding m/z values were performed, confirming the initial results. Statistical AnalysisDescriptive statistics are provided in figures as bar graphs indicating the sample mean, with error bars indicating S.E. Detection of statistical difference between two independent measurements was by a one-way t test. Comparison of percent changes between pairs of independent measurements was by a two-way analysis of variance. Sample populations were considered to be significant at p ≤ 0.05. cAMP Enhances Surface Expression of Kv1.2Stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol in Xenopus oocytes augments the ionic current of Kv1.2 (9Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that trafficking exists as a possible mechanism for this process. Flow cytometry was used to analyze changes in Kv1.2 surface levels. The basal levels of the channel were measured with cells treated with an antibody directed against an external loop of Kv1.2 (anti-Kv1.2e), as compared with a control group of cells treated with IgG. A representative histogram shift depicting increased fluorescence between the IgG control and the cells labeled with anti-Kv1.2e antibody is shown in Fig. 1A. The inset shows the population of intact cells selected to generate the histogram. Endogenous β2-adrenergic receptors activated with the norepinephrine analog isoproterenol (10 μm, 10 min) caused a significant increase in channel density at the cell surface (n = 12, p ≤ 0.001) (Fig. 1B). This response was blocked by pretreatment with propranolol (10 μm, 30 min; p ≥ 0.1), a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Thus, not only does β2-adrenergic stimulation cause an increase in Kv1.2 ionic current as reported previously, it also causes a significant increase in the quantity of channels present at the surface of the cell. Isoproterenol stimulates a signaling cascade that includes the activation of adenylate cyclase and cAMP, and therefore, we wanted to confirm that this pathway was involved. Increasing concentrations of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, significantly raised levels of Kv1.2 surface channel (n = 5, p ≤ 0.001) (Fig. 2A). A time course experiment revealed that the forskolin-induced change occurred rapidly and decayed over 1 h(n = 5, p ≤ 0.01) (Fig. 2B). Application of the cell-permeable cAMP analog chlorophenylthio-cAMP (250 μm, 30 min) displayed a similar response to forskolin (10 μm, 10 min), suggesting that cAMP is the main downstream effector (n = 12, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2C). To confirm this idea, phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors were used to inhibit the degradation of cAMP, thus increasing the intracellular concentration of the second messenger. The general PDE inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine (100 μm, 30 min), caused a significant increase in Kv1.2 surface levels (n = 18, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2D). Because isobutylmethylxanthine can inhibit both cAMP- and cGMP-specific PDEs, we decided to test a cAMP-specific PDE inhibitor. Rolipram (10 μm, 3 min), which inhibits PDE4, also increased Kv1.2 surface levels (n = 6, p < 0.0001). Therefore, elevating cAMP increases Kv1.2 expression on the cell surface. cAMP Affects Kv1.2 Surface Levels through PKA-independent and PKA-dependent MechanismsBecause increasing cAMP levels enhanced the amount of Kv1.2 on the cell surface, we hypothesized that these effects were mediated by the main cAMP downstream effector, PKA. To investigate this, we treated cells with a panel of PKA inhibitors, including myristoylated PKA inhibitor peptide (10 μm, 10 min), KT5720 (5 μm, 30 min), and H89 (10 μm, 30 min). These inhibitors did not prevent either forskolin or chlorophenylthio-cAMP from increasing Kv1.2 surface levels (n = 12, p ≤ 0.01) (Fig. 3, A-C). This suggests that cAMP can enhance surface levels independent of PKA. Interestingly, PKA does appear to have a role because application of the PKA inhibitors alone caused a significant increase in Kv1.2 surface levels (p ≤ 0.01). Therefore, we sought to confirm the existence of basal PKA activity in unstimulated cells. To that end, we inhibited adenylate cyclase with SQ22536 (500 μm, 30 min), which resulted in a similar increase in Kv1.2 surface levels (n = 25, p ≤ 0.0001). Furthermore, we evaluated the level of substrates phosphorylated by PKA in cell lysates with an antibody directed against a phosphorylated PKA consensus sequence (RXX(S/T)). Forskolin cause a significant increase in the amount of phosphorylated protein (n = 2, p ≤ 0.01). Conversely, both the adenylate cyclase inhibitor, SQ22536, and the PKA inhibitor, H89, decreased phosphorylation (n = 3, p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 3E). This suggests that the mechanism for cAMP regulation of Kv1.2 surface levels can occur in both PKA-dependent and PKA-independent manners. cAMP and PKA Modulate Kv1.2 FunctionWe next asked whether the increased surface expression of Kv1.2 caused by forskolin or inhibitors of PKA was correlated with an increase in Kv1.2 ionic current. Forskolin induced a significant increase in Kv1.2 ionic current relative to the control; 6.4 ± 1.0 nA versus 3.3 ± 1.2 nA (n = 9, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). KT5720 also caused a similar increase in Kv1.2 ionic current relative to the control; 12.6 ± 0.9 nA versus 5.8 ± 3.5 nA (n = 5, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). Half-activation voltage was determined from tail current activation curves fitted by a Boltzmann function. The half-activation voltage was 10.3 ± 1.4 mV in control cells and -11.7 ± 3.3 mV in forskolin-treated cells. These values are not significantly different (p = 0.28). Therefore, the increase in ionic current caused by forskolin is not attributable to a shift in voltage dependence of Kv1.2 activation. Interestingly, KT5720 did produce a significant depolarizing shift in Kv1.2 voltage dependence (-6.6 ± 0.7 mV, p < 0.01). However, because it is a positive shift, it cannot underlie the KT5720-induced increase in Kv1.2 steady-state ionic current. These findings indicate that the additional Kv1.2 channels in the plasma membrane upon treatment with forskolin or with PKA inhibitors are functional and thus capable of affecting membrane excitability. Serines 440 and 449 Are Phosphorylated in Forskolin-treated Cells, but Are Not Responsible for the Forskolin-mediated Increase in Surface Kv1.2In the course of the preceding experiments, we observed that forskolin produced a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Kv1.2. Loss of the higher molecular mass band after treatment of cell lysates with alkaline phosphatase indicates that this shift is caused by channel phosphorylation (n = 2) (Fig. 5A). Because forskolin caused a PKA-independent increase in Kv1.2 surface levels, we hypothesized that this shift was caused by a PKA-independent phosphorylation of Kv1.2. Moreover, the PKA inhibitor, H89 (10 μm, 30 min) (Fig. 5B; n = 2), had no effect on the forskolin-induced band shift. Interestingly, this suggests that PKA is not the kinase involved and indicates that forskolin signals through a different kinase/phosphatase pathway to elicit phosphorylation of Kv1.2. We next used mass spectrometry to identify the phosphorylation sites responsible for the shift in Kv1.2 mobility. Kv1.2 was immunoprecipitated from forskolin-stimulated HEK-K cells and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained bands of Kv1.2 were excised, diced, and digested in-gel with trypsin. Extracted peptides were subjected to liquid chromatography MS/MS and data base search analysis identified two unique phospho-tryptic peptides harboring phosphoserine 440 and phosphoserine 449 (Fig. 6A). To determine whether phosphorylation at these sites causes the mobility shift seen in Fig. 5A, we introduced the serine-to-alanine mutations S440A, S449A, and S440/449A. The forskolin-induced doublet was not observed in any of these mutant channels, confirming that these sites are critical for forskolin-induced phosphorylation of Kv1.2 (Fig. 6B). Given that Ser-440 and Ser-449 are vital to the forskolin-induced band shift, we evaluated their roles in channel surface expression. To our surprise, these point mutations had no effect on the forskolin-mediated increase in Kv1.2 surface levels (n = 18, p ≤ 0.01) (Fig. 6C). The inset to Fig. 6C depicts the percent change induced by forskolin, normalized to saline control. Therefore, the forskolin-induced shift in eletrophoretic mobility and the increase in surface channel levels are not causally related. Interestingly, the serine-to-alanine mutations caused a significant decrease in the unstimulated Kv1.2 surface levels (p ≤ 0.01). Thr-46 Is Necessary for the cAMP-mediated Effects on Kv1.2 Surface LevelsPrevious work has shown that mutation of the Kv1.2 N-terminal threonine 46 to valine (T46V) produces channels that are resistant to PKA-mediated current increases (9Huang X.Y. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This suggests that phosphorylation of this site by PKA underlies the biophysical changes associated with current enhancement. Our findings indicate that the cAMP-mediated increase in surface Kv1.2 is PKA-independent. We therefore sought to clarify the role of Thr-46 in Kv1.2 regulation. Introduction of the T46V mutation significantly decreased Kv1.2 surface levels (n = 31, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, T46V blocked the forskolin-mediated increase (p ≥ 0.36); thus, channels harboring the T46V mutation were refractory to cAMP-dependent effects on surface channel levels. To investigate the role of phosphorylation at Thr-46, we performed mass spectrometry on WT Kv1.2 derived from forskolin-treated cells. Whereas we cannot definitively conclude that Thr-46 is not phosphorylated, we did not find any peptide where Thr-46 was phosphorylated, even when we performed targeted MS/MS analysis on masses consistent with Thr-46 phospho-tryptic peptides in multiple charge states. Conversely, we did detect tryptic peptides that included Thr-46 in its unphosphorylated state. This suggests that channel modulation does not involve phosphorylation of Kv1.2 at Thr-46. To determine whether decreased surface expression caused by the T46V mutation results from a change in Kv1.2 protein expression or stability, we evaluated protein levels by immunoblotting. The levels of T46V protein were not lower than those of WT protein (Fig. 7B), suggesting that the T46V mutation alters surface channel levels by a mechanism that does not involve changes in channel protein levels. We also note that T46V did not alter the forskolin-induced mobility shift, consistent with the idea that the band shift is not involved in stimulus-induced changes in surface levels of Kv1.2. Forskolin-mediated Effects on Kv1.2 Are Independent of Kvβ2The auxiliary Kvβ2 subunit binds to Kv1.2 and can serve as a chaperone protein, guiding newly synthesized channels to the cell surface (23Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This interaction requires an intact T1 domain within Kv1.2, and mutation of Thr-46, which lies within the T1 domain of Kv1.2, disrupts Kvβ2 binding (24Gu C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Sciences (N. Y.). 2003; 301: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our finding that the T46V mutation also blocks forskolin effects on surface channels suggests a role for Kvβ2 in this process. We hypothesized that the effects observed with the T46V mutation result from loss of Kvβ2 binding. To test this we first verified that the T46V mutation blocks interaction of Kv1.2 with Kvβ2. The Kvβ2 subunit does not co-immunoprecipitate with Kv1.2 T46V but does interact with WT Kv1.2 (Fig. 8A)"
https://openalex.org/W2069978019,"Two distinct roles are described for Dorsal, Dif and Relish, the three NF-κB/Rel proteins of Drosophila, in the development of the peripheral nervous system. First, these factors regulate transcription of scute during the singling out of sensory organ precursors from clusters of cells expressing the proneural genes achaete and scute. This effect is possibly mediated through binding sites for NF-κB/Rel proteins in a regulatory module of the scute gene required for maintenance of scute expression in precursors as well as repression in cells surrounding precursors. Second, genetic evidence suggests that the receptor Toll-8, Relish, Dif and Dorsal, and the caspase Dredd pathway are active over the entire imaginal disc epithelium, but Toll-8 expression is excluded from sensory organ precursors. Relish promotes rapid turnover of transcripts of the target genes scute and asense through an indirect, post-transcriptional mechanism. We propose that this buffering of gene expression levels serves to keep the neuro-epithelium constantly poised for neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1975884908,"Wheezing during infancy has been linked to early loss of pulmonary function. We prospectively investigated the relation between bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and progressive impairment of pulmonary function in a cohort of asthmatic infants followed until age 9 years. We studied 129 infants who had had at least three episodes of wheezing. Physical examinations, baseline lung function tests and methacholine challenge tests were scheduled at ages 16 months and 5, 7 and 9 years. Eighty-three children completed follow-up. Twenty-four (29%) infants had wheezing that persisted at 9 years of age. Clinical outcome at age 9 years was significantly predicted by symptoms at 5 years of age and by parental atopy. Specific airway resistance (sRaw) was altered in persistent wheezers as early as 5 years of age, and did not change thereafter. Ninety-five per cent of the children still responded to methacholine at the end of follow-up. The degree of BHR at 9 years was significantly related to current clinical status, baseline lung function, and parental atopy. BHR at 16 months and 5 years of age did not predict persistent wheezing between 5 and 9 years of age, or the final degree of BHR, but it did predict altered lung function. Wheezing that persists from infancy to 9 years of age is associated with BHR and to impaired lung function. BHR itself is predictive of impaired lung function in children, strongly pointing to early airway remodeling in infantile asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2122811204,"Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is a key factor in the regulation of cell proliferation by growth factors. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell cycle arrest in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 requires strong activation of the ERK pathway. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the activation. We constructed a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular domain of the NGF receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of the HGF receptor (c-Met) and introduced a point mutation (N1358H) into the chimeric receptor, which specifically abrogates the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met. The mutant chimeric receptor failed to mediate the strong activation of ERK, up-regulation of the expression of a Cdk inhibitor p16INK4a and inhibition of HepG2 cell proliferation by ligand stimulation. Moreover, the mutant receptor did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab1. Knockdown of Gab1 using siRNA suppressed the HGF-induced strong activation of ERK and inhibition of HepG2 cell proliferation. These results suggest that coupling of Grb2 to Gab1 mediates the HGF-induced strong activation of the ERK pathway, which is required for the inhibition of HepG2 cell proliferation. Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is a key factor in the regulation of cell proliferation by growth factors. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell cycle arrest in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 requires strong activation of the ERK pathway.

In addition to the stimulation of cell proliferation, inhibition of proliferation is a consequence of ERK activation in some cell lines. For instance, nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced activation of ERK1/2 results in cell cycle arrest in NIH3T3 cells (2Pumiglia K.M. Decker S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibits serum-dependent proliferation of the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. We have previously shown that HGF induces strong activation of ERK in HepG2 cells, and a reduction of this strong activation to a weak activation by a low concentration of MEK inhibitors restores the proliferation of HepG2 cells inhibited by HGF (5Tsukada Y. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40968-40976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the activation of ERK is required for both the stimulation and inhibition of HepG2 cell proliferation, and the level of ERK activation determines the opposing proliferation responses: the strong activation is required for the inhibition of proliferation, whereas the weak activation leads to the stimulation of proliferation. The strong activation of ERK by HGF changes the expression of regulators of the cell cycle including cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors, p16INK4a, p21CIP1, and p27KIP1, cyclin A, and E2F1 (6Tsukada Y.

Detailed analysis of the expression of p16 revealed that the activated ERK pathway induces the activation of a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, which up-regulates the expression of p16. The p16 protein forms a complex with Cdk4, leading to the redistribution of p21 and p27 from Cdk4 to Cdk2. The association of p21 and p27 with Cdk2 represses Cdk2 activity, resulting in hypophosphorylation of pRb. The hypophosphorylated pRb eventually causes cell cycle arrest at G1 (6Tsukada Y. Tanaka T. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. 2004; 136: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Han J. Tsukada Y. Hara E. Kitamura N. Tanaka T. J. Biol.

Thus, one crucial molecular pathway linking the strong activation of the ERK pathway to the HGF-induced cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells is the up-regulation of p16 expression. The biological effects of HGF on the proliferation of cells are transduced through the activation of its high affinity receptor, the c-met proto-oncogene product (c-Met) (8Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The association of HGF with c-Met elicits recruitment of the Grb2/Sos complex to the activated c-Met (12Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Mina F. Zonca P.D. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The translocation of Sos to the plasma membrane occurs close to Ras and can stimulate the exchange of GTP for GDP. The binding of GTP to Ras initiates a protein cascade, which leads to ERK activation through the intervening protein kinases Raf and MEK (13Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3532) Google Scholar). Thus, the HGF-induced strong activation of ERK in HepG2 cells is a consequence of the up-regulation of one of these reactions. However, the mechanism of the up-regulation remains to be elucidated. Two mechanisms have been described for the association of Grb2 with c-Met, that is the initial event of the Ras/ERK pathway. One is direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met. The association of HGF with c-Met triggers phosphorylation of two C-terminal tyrosines (Tyr1349 and Tyr1356) essential for the c-Met signaling (12Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Mina F. Zonca P.D. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Tyr1356 is required for Grb2 to directly bind to c-Met. In addition, the asparagine residue (Asn1358) at position +2 of Tyr1356 is also essential for the binding of Grb2 to c-Met, because replacement of the asparagine with histidine impairs the binding (14Ponzetto C. Zhen Z. Audero E. Maina F. Bardelli A. Basile M.L. Giordano S. Narsimhan R. Comoglio P. J. Biol.

Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20811-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The other mechanism of the association of Grb2 with c-Met is through the adaptor protein Shc (16Pelicci G. Giordano S. Zhen Z. Salcini A.E. Lanfrancone L. Bardelli A. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Ponzetto C. Pelicci P.G. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1631-1638PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr1349 and Tyr1356 is involved in the binding of Shc to c-Met, but Asn1358 is not required for the binding (17Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc at Tyr317 (YVNV) forms a consensus binding site for Grb2 (18Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.-H. Batzer A. Vicentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R. Myers M.J.J. Backer J.M. Ullrich A.

Shc has been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells stimulated with HGF (16Pelicci G. Giordano S. Zhen Z. Salcini A.E. Lanfrancone L. Bardelli A. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Ponzetto C. Pelicci P.G. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1631-1638PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined which mechanism is involved in the HGF-induced strong activation of ERK, which is required for cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells. To this end, we constructed a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the NGF receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of c-Met, and introduced a point mutation into this chimeric receptor by replacing Asn1358 with His, which specifically abrogates the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met. We introduced this mutated receptor into HepG2 cells, and analyzed effects of the mutation on the ERK activation and cell proliferation. The results demonstrated that the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met is crucial for the HGF-induced strong activation of ERK, which leads to inhibition of cell proliferation. In addition to the translocation of Sos to the plasma membrane, the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met contributes to the association of the docking protein Gab1 with c-Met, which amplifies the Ras/ERK pathway through the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (20Schaeper U.

Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further examined the involvement of Gab1 in the strong activation of ERK, using the RNAi method. The result demonstrated that Gab1 plays a crucial role in the strong activation of ERK, which is required for the HGF-induced inhibition of HepG2 cell proliferation. Reagents—Reagents were obtained as follows: anti-c-Met (sc161), anti-p16 (sc759), and anti-GST (sc459) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-trkA (06-574), anti-ERK2 (05-157), and anti-Gab1 (06-579) antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology; anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) from Transduction Laboratories; anti-α-tubulin antibody (T9026) from Sigma; antiphospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (9106) from Cell Signaling Technology; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (NA931) and anti-rabbit (NA934) Ig from Amersham Biosciences; recombinant human HGF from the Research Center of Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.; and NGF from Alomone Labs. Construction of TrkA/c-Met Chimeric Receptor cDNA Expression Plasmid—The plasmid including rat TrkA cDNA (pRc/CMV-rat TrkA) was kindly provided by Dr. K. Suzuki of Novartis Pharm Corp. Human c-Met cDNA was amplified from RNA of HepG2 cells by RT-PCR, and cloned into pME18S. The TrkA cDNA was amplified by PCR using primer 1, 5′-ACACAAAAGCTTCAGGGCTC-3′, and primer 3, 5′-GCAATCAATCCTGTGAATTCGTCCTTCTTCTCC-3′. The c-Met cDNA was amplified using primer 2, 5′-GGAGAAGAAGGACGAATTCACAGGATTGATTGC-3′, and primer 4, 5′-GCTCGGTAGTCTACAGATTC-3′. The PCR products were mixed and used as templates for PCR with primers 1 and 4. The obtained chimeric fragment was digested with HindIII and AccI, and ligated to cDNA fragments encoding the extracellular region of TrkA and the intracellular region of c-Met. The full-length chimeric receptor cDNA was inserted into an expression plasmid pcDNA5/FRT. Point mutations were introduced with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Cell Culture—COS7 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HepG2 cells expressing chimeric receptors were cultured in the same medium further containing 120 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cell Lysate Preparation and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% EDTA and 0.2 mm Na3VO4. For the immunoblot analysis of ERK2, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (mobility shift) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3Vo4, 50 mm NaF, and 30 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate) containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For the immunoblot analysis of other proteins, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (RIPA) (137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4·12H2O, 2.68 mm KCl, 14.7 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid) containing the same protease inhibitors. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the protein concentration in the lysate was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of cell lysate were incubated with antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, and then with a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated and washed twice with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 159 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm NaF). Immunoblot Analysis—The cell lysates and precipitated immune complexes were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). The samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (ECL, GE Healthcare). Assay for in Vitro Binding to Immobilized GST Fusion Proteins (GST Pull-down)—The full-length Grb2 cDNA was obtained by PCR using primers, 5′-GCGGATCCATGGAAGCCATCGCC-3′ and 5′-CGAATTCTTAGACGTTCCGGTTCAC-3′, and pME18S-HA-Grb2 (provided by Dr. M. Kato, Tokyo Institute of Technology) as a template. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences). The GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli XL1-blue. COS7 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding chimeric receptors using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences). At 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min, and then cell lysates were prepared. The cell lysate was incubated with purified GST-Grb2 bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, the binding proteins were released by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and then separated by SDS-PAGE, before being analyzed by immunoblotting. Isolation of HepG2 Cell Clones Stably Expressing the Chimeric Receptors—The Flp-In™ System was obtained from Invitrogen. HepG2 cells were transfected with pFRT/LacZeo using FuGENE6 transfection reagent, and cultured for 48 h. The cells were then cultured in selective medium containing Zeocin (250 μg/ml). Cells resistant to Zeocin were selected and expanded. A cell clone was used as a Flp-In host cell clone. The host cell clone was cotransfected with the expression plasmids encoding the chimeric receptors and the Flp-expression plasmid pOG44 using JetPEI transfection reagent (Poly Transfection), and cultured for 48 h. The cells were then cultured in selective medium containing hygromycin B (350 μg/ml). SEAP Receptor Assay—Cells were seeded at a density of 1.25 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and plasmid pRRE (collagenase-1)-SEAP or pSRE (c-fos)-SEAP (2.2 μg) was transfected into the cells using FuGENE6 transfection reagent. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with HGF (50 ng/ml) or NGF (100 ng/ml) for 48 h. The culture medium was harvested, and subjected to a SEAP assay. The SEAP assay was performed using a SEAP reporter assay kit (Toyobo), and chemiluminescence was quantified on a Wallac 1420 ARVOsx multi-label counter. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% FBS, and the cells were treated with HGF (50 ng/ml) or NGF (100 ng/ml) for 4 days. The cells were harvested after trypsinization, and the number of cells was counted using a hemocytometer. RNA Interference—Using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vector pSilencer 1.0-U6 (Ambion Inc.), vectors that target Gab1 mRNA were constructed. The Gab1 siRNA vectors siRNA-1 and 2 target the nucleotide residues at positions 165-183 in the coding region (5′-GCCTATTCGTATTATTGAT-3′) and 2206-2224 in the 3′ non-coding region (5′-AGGACCTTTCTGACATAAT-3′) from the translation initiation codon, respectively. DNA oligonucleotides containing the sense target sequence, a hairpin loop, and the antisense target sequence were synthesized, annealed, and inserted into pSilencer 1.0-U6. The cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and cultured with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were treated with 4 μg of the expression plasmid mixed with 11.2 μl of jetPEI for 24 h. The medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were treated again with 4 μg of the expression plasmid mixed with 11.2 μl of jetPEI for 48 h. The medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were further cultured in the absence and presence of HGF (50 ng/ml). Construction of Mutated Receptors—To distinguish transfected c-Met from the endogenous receptor in HepG2 cells, we constructed a cDNA encoding a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the rat NGF receptor (TrkA), and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of human c-Met, because NGF treatment did not affect the proliferation and morphology of HepG2 cells (data not shown), and the TrkA protein was not detected in HepG2 cells in an immunoblotting analysis (data not shown). To examine the requirement of the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met for the HGF-induced strong ERK activation and the inhibition of proliferation in HepG2 cells, we introduced a point mutation into this chimeric receptor by replacing the asparagine 1358 of human c-Met with a histidine residue (N1358H) by site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA. This mutation has been shown to specifically abrogate the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met (14Ponzetto C. Zhen Z. Audero E. Maina F. Bardelli A. Basile M.L. Giordano S. Narsimhan R. Comoglio P. J.

Tremblay M.L. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20811-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As a negative control for the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Met, we introduced a point mutation at the ATP binding site by replacing lysine 1110 with an alanine residue (K1110A). In addition, as a negative control for the signaling downstream from c-Met, we introduced point mutations at the multifunctional docking site of c-Met by replacing tyrosines 1349 and 1356 with phenylalanine residues (Y1349F/Y1356F). The cDNAs encoding the wild-type and mutated chimeric receptors were inserted into an expression vector, pcDNA5/FRT. The inability of Grb2 to bind to the mutated receptors was confirmed by the GST pull-down method (12Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Mina F. Zonca P.D. Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutated chimeric receptors were transiently expressed in COS7 cells, and the cells were treated with NGF. The expressed receptors were assayed for binding to the GST-fused Grb2. The wild-type receptor bound to GST-Grb2, whereas the mutated receptors did not (Fig. 1). Isolation of HepG2 Cell Clones Stably Expressing the Chimeric Receptors—To obtain HepG2 cell clones equally expressing each receptor, the Flp-In System was used. The plasmid pFRT/lacZeo was transfected into HepG2 cells. Cell clones resistant to Zeocin were selected and expanded. A cell clone, which showed HGF-induced inhibition of proliferation and scattering similarly to parental HepG2 cells, was selected and used as a Flp-In host cell line. The expression plasmids encoding the wild-type or mutated receptors were cotransfected with the Flp-expression plasmid pOG44 into the host cell line. Cell clones resistant to hygromycin B were selected and expanded. They were subjected to an analysis of the expression of receptor proteins by immunoblotting. Two clones for the wild-type and each mutated receptor were selected for further analysis. Receptor proteins were highly expressed in all clones (Fig. 2). To examine the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the receptors, each cell clone was left untreated or treated with HGF or NGF, and phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-c-Met antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The phosphorylation was undetectable in untreated cells expressing the wild-type and mutated receptors. The phosphorylation of endogenous c-Met was detected in all cell clones treated with HGF. NGF treatment phosphorylated the wild-type, N1358H, and Y1349F/Y1356F receptors, but not the K1110A receptor (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the tyrosine kinase of the wild-type, N1358H, and Y1349F/Y1356F chimeric receptors was activated by ligand treatment. Failure of ERK Activation in HepG2 Cells Expressing the N1358H Receptor—ERK activity in HepG2 cells expressing the mutated receptors after ligand treatment was examined using two assay systems. First, the activity was assayed based on the phosphorylation of ERK2, which was detected by a mobility shift of phosphorylated ERK2 in an immunoblot analysis using an anti-ERK2 antibody. The phosphorylation of ERK2 was enhanced in HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type and mutated chimeric receptors after HGF treatment (Fig. 3), indicating that the signaling pathway linking c-Met to ERK was intact in all cell clones. NGF treatment enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK2 in cells expressing the wild-type receptor, but not in cells expressing mutated receptors (Fig. 3). Second, transcription activation controlled by the RRE of the collagenase-1 promoter and the SRE of the c-fos promoter, which are mediated by ERK (22Fafeur V. Tulasne D. Queva C. Vercamer C. Dimster V. Mattot V. Stehelin D. Desbiens X. Vandenbunder B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem.

We previously made constructs that contained the SEAP reporter gene under the control of RRE (collagenase-1) or SRE (c-fos) (5Tsukada Y. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40968-40976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We used these constructs in the present study. Transcriptional activity controlled by RRE (collagenase-1) and SRE (c-fos) was enhanced in all cell clones treated with HGF. NGF treatment also enhanced the transcriptional activity in cells expressing the wild-type receptor, but not in cells expressing the mutated receptors (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met is required for the strong activation of the ERK pathway.FIGURE 4ERK-mediated transcriptional activation in HepG2 cells expressing the chimeric receptors. Cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid pRRE-SEAP or pSRE-SEAP. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with or without HGF (50 ng/ml) or NGF (100 ng/ml) for 48 h. The SEAP assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The average fold-increase compared with untreated cells is indicated. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations from a representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) No Up-regulation of p16 Expression in HepG2 Cells Expressing the N1358H Receptor—We previously demonstrated that the expression of p16INK4a, a Cdk inhibitor, was enhanced in HepG2 cells treated with HGF, and the enhancement is mediated by the strong activation of ERK (7Han J. Tsukada Y. Hara E. Kitamura N. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31548-31556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the enhancement of p16 expression plays a crucial role in the HGF-induced inhibition of the proliferation of HepG2 cells (7Han J. Tsukada Y. Hara E. Kitamura N. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31548-31556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the p16 gene is an important target gene downstream of the strong activation of the ERK pathway. The expression level of p16 was analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-p16 antibody. The expression of p16 protein was enhanced in all cell clones treated with HGF. NGF treatment enhanced the p16 expression in cells expressing the wild-type receptor, but not in cells expressing the mutated receptors (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met is required for the up-regulation of an important target gene downstream of the ERK pathway in HGF-treated HepG2 cells. Requirement of Direct Binding of Grb2 to c-Met for the HGF-induced Inhibition of Proliferation and Scattering of HepG2 Cells—We have previously shown that HGF induced strong activation of ERK in HepG2 cells, and its reduction restored the proliferation of HepG2 cells inhibited by HGF (5Tsukada Y. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40968-40976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, it was assumed that the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met is required for the HGF-induced inhibition of the proliferation of HepG2 cells, because a failure of the binding did not enhance the activation of ERK and the expression of p16. The proliferation of HepG2 cells expressing the chimeric receptors after ligand treatment was tested by counting cell numbers. Proliferation was inhibited in HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type and mutated chimeric receptors after HGF treatment (Fig. 6). NGF treatment inhibited the proliferation of cells expressing the wild-type receptor. In contrast, proliferation was not inhibited among cells expressing the mutated receptors (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the direct binding of Grb2 to c-Met is required for the HGF-induced inhibition of proliferation of HepG2 cells. In addition to affecting proliferation, HGF induces scattering of cell colonies in HepG2 cells (5Tsukada Y. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40968-40976Ab"
https://openalex.org/W2167816093,"The cell surface of African trypanosomes is covered by a densely packed monolayer of a single protein, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). The VSG protects the trypanosome cell surface from effector molecules of the host immune system and is the mediator of antigenic variation. The sequence divergence between VSGs that is necessary for antigenic variation can only occur within the constraints imposed by the structural features necessary to form the monolayer barrier. Here, the structures of the two domains that together comprise the C-terminal di-domain of VSG ILTat1.24 have been determined. The first domain has a structure similar to the single C-terminal domain of VSG MITat1.2 and provides proof of structural conservation in VSG C-terminal domains complementing the conservation of structure present in the N-terminal domain. The second domain, although based on the same fold, is a minimized version missing several structural features. The structure of the second domain contains the C-terminal residue that in the native VSG is attached to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that retains the VSG on the external face of the plasma membrane. The solution structures of this domain and a VSG GPI glycan have been combined to produce the first structure-based model of a GPI-anchored protein. The model suggests that the core glycan of the GPI anchor lies in a groove on the surface of the domain and that there is a close association between the GPI glycan and protein.

African trypanosomes, such as Trypanosoma brucei, proliferate in the bloodstream of mammals and can infect a host for years despite continual exposure to its immune system. Trypanosomes are susceptible to immunoglobulin-mediated complement lysis and have evolved a population survival strategy dependent on the appearance of antigenically novel variants at a rate sufficient to keep ahead of the immunoglobulin response of the host. Antigenic variation in trypanosomes (reviewed in Ref. 1Barry D. Carrington M. Maudlin I. Holmes P.H. Miles M.A. The Trypanosomiases. CABI Publishing, Oxford2004: 25-38Google Scholar) is based on the sequence diversity of members of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) 4The abbreviations used are: VSGvariant surface glycoproteinNOEnuclear Overhauser effectCOSYcorrelation spectroscopyTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyNOESYNOE spectroscopyHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositol. gene family, and during the course of an infection, the trypanosome population expresses a series of antigenically distinct VSGs. In an individual trypanosome, one VSG gene is expressed at any one time from a genomic reservoir of hundreds or thousands. The probability of any one trypanosome switching the expressed VSG gene to one encoding an antigenically novel VSG is low, and thus most trypanosomes do not switch VSGs and are cleared by the immune system of the host. Trypanosomes that do switch to an antigenically novel VSG undergo clonal proliferation until the immunoglobulin response against the new VSG imposes another round of selection for further novel antigenic variants. variant surface glycoprotein nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy total correlation spectroscopy NOE spectroscopy high performance liquid chromatography glycosylphosphatidylinositol. In addition to its role in the population survival strategy, the VSG is also central to processes that have evolved to protect and prolong the life of individual trypanosomes. The cell surface VSG prevents other, invariant, cell surface proteins from triggering immunoglobulin-mediated complement attack. It forms a very densely packed monolayer on the cell surface (2Jackson D.G. Owen M.J. Voorheis H.P. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Mehlert A. Bond C.S. Ferguson M.A.J. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and either the density of VSG packing is sufficient to physically block antibodies binding other cell surface proteins, or the cell has another unknown mechanism to negate binding of antibodies to non-VSG proteins (4Ziegelbauer K. Overath P. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4540-4545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the cell surface VSG monolayer is internalized to the endosome and recycled at a high rate; the entire cell surface pool of VSG can be internalized within 12 min (5Engstler M. Thilo L. Weise F. Grunfelder C.G. Schwarz H. Boshart M. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). While the VSG is in an unidentified part of the endosome, any bound immunoglobulin is degraded before the VSG is recycled to the cell surface (6O'Beirne C. Lowry C.M. Voorheis H.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 165-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Pal A. Hall B.S. Jeffries T.R. Field M.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the trypanosome is able to tolerate moderately high titers of anti-VSG immunoglobulin, and this probably allows individual cells to survive during the rising host immunoglobulin response, therefore increasing the chance of transmission to the insect vector. There are two apparently conflicting selection pressures on the VSG: diversity for antigenic variation and conservation of structure for formation of an effective cell surface barrier and features necessary for rapid internalization and recycling. The sequence diversity is extreme, with VSGs having 15-25% identity with most other VSGs. However, this sequence diversity is accommodated within a conserved structure (8Blum M.L. Down J.A. Gurnett A.M. Carrington M. Turner M.J. Wiley D. Nature. 1993; 362: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), although it remains unclear which structural features are necessary for protection and/or VSG recycling. VSGs are homodimers attached to the external face of the plasma membrane via a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (9Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). VSGs of T. brucei and the closely related species Trypanosoma evansi are composed of an N-terminal domain of 350-400 residues and one or two C-terminal domains of 50-100 residues in total (10Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I. Wiley D. Turner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Attempts made to solve the structure of a complete VSG have been unsuccessful (11Garman, S. C. (1994) The X-ray Crystallographic Analysis of an Intact VSG from the Trypanosome. Ph. D. thesis, Harvard UniversityGoogle Scholar), but progress has been made with the individual domains (8Blum M.L. Down J.A. Gurnett A.M. Carrington M. Turner M.J. Wiley D. Nature. 1993; 362: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Freymann D. Down G. Carrington M. Roditi I. Turner M.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 7227-7235Google Scholar). There are three types of N-terminal domains (A, B and C) based on the number and distribution of conserved cysteine residues (10Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I. Wiley D. Turner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The structures of two N-terminal domains, those of VSGs MITat1.2 and ILTat1.24, have been solved by x-ray crystallography (8Blum M.L. Down J.A. Gurnett A.M. Carrington M. Turner M.J. Wiley D. Nature. 1993; 362: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 12Freymann D. Down G. Carrington M. Roditi I. Turner M.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 141-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and demonstrate a conserved tertiary structure between VSGs despite having only 16% sequence identity. It is likely that all type A VSG N-terminal domains have similar tertiary structures because they share common sequence features including conserved cysteine residues and heptad repeats that form a large coiled coil, which is the core of the structure (8Blum M.L. Down J.A. Gurnett A.M. Carrington M. Turner M.J. Wiley D. Nature. 1993; 362: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Disulfide mapping experiments on type B N-terminal domains have provided experimental evidence that these, too, can adopt the same tertiary structure (14Bussler H. Linder M. Linder D. Reinwald E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32582-32586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). VSG C-terminal domains have been divided into six types (types 1-6) based on conserved cysteine residues, N-linked glycosylation sites, C-terminal residue, and GPI anchor signal sequence (10Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I. Wiley D. Turner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Berriman M. Ghedin E. Hertz-Fowler C. Blandin G. Renauld H.

VSG C-terminal types 2, 4, and 5 are single domains containing four conserved cysteine residues, whereas types 1, 3, and 6 are di-domains, in which each subdomain contains four conserved cysteines. The structure of a type 2 VSG C-terminal domain, that from VSG MITat1.2, has been solved (13Chattopadhyay A. Jones N. Nietlispach D. Nielsen P. Voorheis H. Mott H. Carrington M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7227-7235Google Scholar). Although the structures of both domains of VSG MITat1.2 are now known, there remain 16 unstructured residues between the two domains and 17 unstructured residues between the C-terminal domain and the GPI anchor at the C terminus. Thus, the spatial relationship between the two domains and any interaction between the VSG and its GPI anchor remains uncharacterized. The next goal of research into understanding how the VSG functions is a complete structure-based model of the VSG monolayer. Current models (3Mehlert A. Bond C.S. Ferguson M.A.J. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) are based on the known structure of the N-terminal domain alone and are therefore incomplete. Here, a step toward this goal is reported: the solution structures of the two domains that make up the type 1 VSG C terminus from ILTat1.24. The first domain has a structure very similar to that of the type 2 C-terminal domain, indicating that there is structural conservation between type 1 and 2 C-terminal domains. The second domain has a similar fold but is a smaller, apparently minimal, version and is missing some of the structural features found in the other two VSG C-terminal domains. Unlike the previously determined C-terminal domain structure, the second domain contains the mature C-terminal residue that is attached to the GPI anchor in the native protein, and this has allowed the modeling of the GPI-anchored domain based on the solution structures of this VSG domain and the GPI glycan. The result is the first fully structure-based model of any protein domain and its GPI anchor. The model suggests an interaction of the GPI glycan along the length of one side of the domain. Protein Expression and PurificationThree recombinant polypeptides were produced encoding different regions of the C-terminal part of ILTat1.24 (see Fig. 1). The expression constructs were based on pET15b (Novagen) and encoded polypeptides with a N-terminal sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLEENLYFQG followed by residues Glu368-Asp468 (I1.24C), Lys383-Ser427 (I1.24C1), or Thr422-Asp468 (I1.24C2) of the mature VSG ILTat1.24 (EMBL X56767). The tobacco etch virus protease site is underlined above. The polypeptides were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21trxB(DE3) grown in 2× TY medium. The recombinant C-terminal domains were isolated from the cell lysate by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+ column and removed from the tag by tobacco etch virus protease digestion. This resulted in an additional glycine residue at the N terminus of both I1.24C and I1.24C2, whereas this addition coincides with the presence of that residue (Gly382) in the mature VSG for I1.24C1. As a final purification step the proteins were subjected to reverse phase HPLC using a 25 × 1-cm Hichrom-5 C8 column in an acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluted protein was then concentrated in a SpeedVac to remove the majority of acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid, before buffer exchanging over Sephadex G25 (PD-10 column; Amersham Biosciences) into a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.0. The relative molecular masses of the three polypeptides were determined using electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry by the University of Cambridge Department of Chemistry Mass Spectrometry Facility. Disulfide Isomerization of I1.24CA 0.5 mg/ml solution of I1.24C in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 m guanidinium chloride, and 50 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, was incubated at room temperature for 2 h to reduce disulfide bonds. The completely reduced protein was then exchanged into reshuffling buffer containing 0.2 m Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm oxidized glutathione, and 2.5 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.5, at a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The reshuffling reaction was incubated at 35 °C for 3 h, after which the reaction was stopped by exchanging into 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. NMR SpectroscopyNMR samples were composed of 0.5 mm I1.24C1 or I1.24C2 or of 0.3 mm I1.24C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.0, and 10% D2O. The spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Bruker DRX500 (I1.24C2), Bruker DRX600 (I1.24C), and Bruker DRX800 (I1.24C1) spectrometers. 1H DQF-COSY, 1H TOCSY (72-ms DIPSI-2 mixing time), and 1H NOESY (150- and 200-ms mixing time for I1.24C1 and I1.24C2, respectively) were recorded on I1.24C1 and I1.24C2. A 1H NOESY (170-ms mixing time) was recorded on I1.24C. The spectra were processed using AZARA (W. Boucher, University of Cambridge) and analyzed using ANSIG (16Kraulis P.J. Domaile P.J. Campbell-Burk S.L. Van Aken T.V. Laue E.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 868-878Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Structure CalculationsStructure calculations were carried out using ARIA1.2 (17Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.J. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) interfaced to CNS1.0 (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Celano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

The structures were calculated with 90 ps of high temperature dynamics and 30 ps of cooling from 10,000 to 1,000 K in torsion angle space. This was followed by 24 ps of cooling from 1,000 to 50 K using dynamics in Cartesian space. Figures of structures were produced with Molscript (19Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 627-633Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3d (20Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). Docking the GPI Anchor and C2 DomainThe NMR structure closest to the mean of the ensemble was selected for both I1.24C2 and the VSG GPI glycan (21Homans S.W. Edge C.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2881-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Visual inspection of the properties of the surface-exposed charges was used to identify a possible binding site. Manual docking of the GPI anchor was performed, guided to reduce atomic clashes, and maximize potential electrostatic interactions. An amide bond was manually formed between the C-terminal aspartic acid residue (Asp468) of the protein and the exposed ethanolamine group of the GPI anchor using the Sybyl suite of programs (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The resulting glycoprotein structure was subjected to 100 iterations of energy minimization using the Tripos force field and Gasteiger-Marsili partial charges (22Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Org. Magn. Reson. 1981; 15: 353-360Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The figures were produced using Pymol (DeLano, W. L., The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (2002) DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). T. evansi VSGsT. evansi field isolates were collected from a domesticated deer (Cervus timorensis) and buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in the Selangor province of Malaysia. The isolates were passaged four or five times through mice, a statutory requirement prior to import into the UK. RNA was prepared using RNAeasy kits (Qiagen), and VSG cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR as previously described (10Carrington M. Miller N. Blum M. Roditi I. Wiley D. Turner M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T, and three independent plasmids were sequenced for each VSG. Protein Expression and PurificationThe construct I1.24C (Fig. 1) encoded residues Glu368-Asp468 of VSG ILTat1.24 and was designed to determine the structure of the C-terminal di-domain. Each of the two domains contains four cysteines that are disulfide-bonded in the native VSG. Expression in three different E. coli trxB mutants, used to favor disulfide bond formation, and subsequent purification yielded protein that, although homogeneous by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, was heterogeneous under nonreducing conditions (data not shown). The pattern of bands under nonreducing conditions suggested that there was a mixture of different intramolecular disulfide-bonded and partially reduced forms of the protein. It was not possible to purify a single isoform from the mixture, and therefore the approach taken was to express the two domains separately. Expression of the individual domains, I1.24C1 and I1.24C2 (Fig. 1), also yielded proteins that were homogeneous using reducing SDS-PAGE and heterogeneous using nonreducing SDS-PAGE. For both I1.24C1 and I1.24C2, the slowest migrating monomeric form (nonreducing SDS-PAGE) was readily purified by reverse phase HPLC. Preliminary one-dimensional 1H NMR experiments showed that for both domains the slowest migrating form was structured, whereas the more rapidly migrating forms were not (data not shown). The purified polypeptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm identity and disulfide status. I1.24C1 had an average mass of 5124.8 g/mol, close to the expected mass of 5125.7 g/mol for the disulfide-bonded form. The second subdomain, I1.24C2, had an average mass of 4915.26 g/mol, close to the expected mass of 4915.4 g/mol for the disulfide-bonded form. Solution Structure of ILTat1.24C1I1.24C1 1H resonances were assigned using two-dimensional 1H COSY, 1H TOCSY, and 1H NOESY experiments. Full assignments were made for residues Ser384-Ser427. The NOESY yielded 946 unambiguous and 706 ambiguous NOEs. At the end of the eighth iteration of structure calculation, there were 192 ambiguous and 786 unambiguous distance restraints. In the last iteration, 100 structures were calculated, and the 35 with the lowest energy were used for further analyses. The core structure begins at Pro385, the fourth residue in the construct, and ends at Phe419, adjacent to an N-linked glycosylation site in the native VSG (Figs. 1 and 2A and Table 1). There are two α-helices comprising residues Pro385-Ile392 and Glu395-Glu400, which are connected by a tight turn, followed by another turn leading to two short β-strands comprising residues Cys404-Trp406 and Cys417-Phe419 that form an antiparallel β-sheet. The β-strands are connected by a long, 12-residue loop, and there are two hydrophobic residues, one located at the end of each β-strand (Trp406 and Phe419) that flank the disulfide bonds. A strong NOE was identified between the Hβ of Cys389 and Cys404, the first (CysI) and third (CysIII) cysteines in the domain, so these residues are likely to be linked by a disulfide bond. Because mass spectrometry analysis showed that there were no free sulfydryl groups present, the second (CysII) and fourth (CysIV) cysteines must also be disulfide-bonded, so the disulfide-bonding pattern in this domain is CysI-III and CysII-IV. This is the same disulfide-bonding pattern as has been shown previously for two other VSG C-terminal domains, those of MITat1.2 and MITat1.4 (13Chattopadhyay A. Jones N. Nietlispach D. Nielsen P.

Asp468 is the C terminus of the mature VSG, to which the GPI anchor is attached (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The secondary structure of this domain begins with residues Glu444%Lys449, which are not well defined but resemble a short bent α-helix followed by one turn of a 310-helix between residues Glu451 and Asp453 and another turn of a 310-helix between residues Ser456 and Asp458. This is immediately followed by an antiparallel β-sheet, formed by residues Lys460-Glu462 and Thr465-Lys467. The first β-strand contains a hydrophobic residue (Trp461) that caps the disulfide bonds on one side. Hβ NOEs were observed between Cys446 (CysI) and Cys459 (CysIII) and between Cys454 (CysII) and Cys466 (CysIV), confirming the pattern of disulfide bond formation as CysI-III and CysII-IV. A single NOE between one Hβ of Cys446 and one of Cys466 was identified, highlighting the close proximity of all four cysteines in the compact core structure. The I1.24C Di-DomainAfter the structures of the two individual subdomains had been determined, a procedure was developed for the successful reduction and reoxidization of the four disulfide bonds in I1.24C, the recombinant C-terminal di-domain. The product of the protocol was homogeneous on nonreducing SDS-PAGE and had a monoisotopic molecular mass of 11034.22 g/mol, very close to the expected mass of 11034.19 g/mol. An overlay of the NOESY spectrum of this di-domain with the NOESY spectra of the C1 and C2 domains showed that there were no significant changes in chemical shifts in the C2 subdomain resonances between the I1.24C2 and I1.24C polypeptides (data not shown). Slight changes in some backbone amide chemical shifts were observed for resonances in the C1 subdomain, but these could be attributed to small changes in the sample conditions. No NOEs were observed between the two subdomains, and there was no indication of additional secondary structural elements in the NOESY spectrum of I1.24C. The similarity of the spectra provides strong evidence that the structures of the isolated domains are repeated in the di-domain and that there is no interaction between the domains in the recombinant polypeptide. In the native VSG there is an N-linked glycosylation site in the linker between the C1 and C2 domains that is occupied by an oligomannose-type oligosaccharide (24Zamze S. Wooten E. Ashford D. Ferguson M. Dwek R. Rademacher T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and it is possible that the oligosaccharide mediates an interaction between the two domains. However, this cannot be applicable to the many type 1 VSGs that do not contain an N-linked glycosylation site in the linker between the two domains. The Type 1 C1 Domain from ILTat1.24 Is Similar to the Type 2 C-terminal Domain from MITat1.2Comparison of the structure of the type 2 C-terminal domain of VSG MITat1.2 and that of the first domain of the type 1 di-domain of ILTat1.24 (Fig. 2B) shows that the overall fold is conserved. Both form a compact domain comprising two α- or 310-helices and an antiparallel β-sheet. The core structure is held together by the formation of two disulfide bonds in a CysI-III and CysII-IV pattern in both structures. A second conserved feature is the presence of two hydrophobic residues that flank the disulfide bonds. The major difference between the two structures is the C-terminal α-helix present in the type 2 domain, which is absent in the type 1 domain (Fig. 2). Comparison of VSG Type 1 C1 with Type 2 DomainsA sequence alignment was used to determine whether there is a systematic difference between C1 domains from type 1 VSGs and type 2 VSGs (Fig. 4A). The alignment was based on the cysteine residues that are in conserved locations in the structure and the number of residues between cysteines in any one VSG sequence reflected the size of secondary structure elements and/or connecting loops present. For example, there are fewer residues between CysI and CysII and between CysII and CysIII in MITat1.2C than in I1.24C1, and the two N-terminal α-helices are shorter in MITat1.2C than in I1.24C1. The"

To clarify the mechanism of cell death mediated by Daxx, a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed. Sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) was identified as a Daxx-interacting protein. During ischemic stress, Daxx translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it colocalizes with NHE1. Daxx binds to the ezrin/radixin/moesin-interacting domain of NHE1, in competition with ezrin. Consistent with this finding, transfection of the constitutively cytoplasmic mutant, Daxx(W621A), inhibited ezrin-mediated Akt-1 activation. Moreover, transfection of Daxx(W621A), but not the Daxx(S667A) mutant that is confined to the nucleus, accelerated pHi recovery from an acid load, indicating that the cytoplasmic protein activates NHE1. Based on the results, we propose that ischemic insult triggers the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of Daxx, following which cytoplasmic Daxx stimulates the NHE1 transporter activity and suppresses activation of the NHE1-ezrin-Akt-1 pathway. Our data support a novel molecular function of Daxx as an upstream regulator of NHE1 in ischemic cell death."

GTP acts as an allosteric effector promoting Gln hydrolysis but inhibiting Gln-dependent CTP formation at concentrations of >0.15 mm and NH3-dependent CTP formation at all concentrations. A structure-activity study using a variety of GTP and guanosine analogues revealed that only a few GTP analogues were capable of activating Gln-dependent CTP formation to varying degrees: GTP ≈ 6-thio-GTP > ITP ≈ guanosine 5′-tetraphosphate > O6-methyl-GTP > 2′-deoxy-GTP. No activation was observed with guanosine, GMP, GDP, 2′,3′-dideoxy-GTP, acycloguanosine, and acycloguanosine monophosphate, indicating that the 5′-triphosphate, 2′-OH, and 3′-OH are required for full activation. The 2-NH2 group plays an important role in binding recognition, whereas substituents at the 6-position play an important role in activation. The presence of a 6-NH2 group obviates activation, consistent with the inability of ATP to substitute for GTP. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogues of GTP and guanosine, respectively, all inhibited NH3- and Gln-dependent CTP formation (often in a cooperative manner) to a similar extent (IC50 ≈ 0.2-0.5 mm). This inhibition appeared to be due solely to the purine base and was relatively insensitive to the identity of the purine with the exception of inosine, ITP, and adenosine (IC50 ≈ 4-12 mm). 8-Oxoguanosine was the best inhibitor identified (IC50 = 80 μm).

The de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides is highly regulated in E. coli, and consequently, CTPS is regulated in a complex fashion (1Koshland Jr., D.E. Levitzki A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 539-559Google Scholar). GTP is required as a positive allosteric effector to increase the efficiency (kcat/Km) of Gln-dependent CTP synthesis (10Levitzki A.

Recently, we reported that GTP not only activates the glutaminase activity of CTPS, but, at concentrations of >0.15 mm, it inhibits Gln-dependent CTP formation (22MacDonnell J.E. Lunn F.A. Bearne S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, GTP inhibits NH3-dependent CTP formation at all concentrations. The detailed mechanism by which GTP induces the conformational changes to activate the glutaminase activity and inhibit NH3-dependent CTP formation remains unknown despite the recent solution of the structures of apo-E. coli CTPS (no nucleotides bound) (3Endrizzi J.A.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6447-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) crystallized E. coli CTPS in the presence of GTP, no GTP was bound in the crystalline enzyme. Modeling studies by Baldwin and co-workers (3Endrizzi J.A. Kim H. Anderson P.M. Baldwin E.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6447-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) indicate that GTP binds in a cleft located adjacent to the entrance to the glutaminase site, formed by residues 50-55, 297-301, 353-356, 438-441, 468, and 470. Replacement of Gly351 by proline in E. coli CTPS abolishes Gln-dependent CTP formation but has little effect on NH3-dependent CTP formation (5Weng M.L. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3023-3028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the residues Arg359 and Gly360 (Arg356 and Gly357 in E. coli) that reside near the oxyanion hole of L. lactis CTPS suggests that these residues play a role in binding GTP and mediate the allosteric effects of GTP on the glutaminase activity (24Willemoës M. Mølgaard A. Johansson E. Martinussen J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with GTP binding at the site identified by Baldwin and co-workers (3Endrizzi J.A. Kim H. Anderson P.M. Baldwin E.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6447-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, mutational analyses have also revealed that residues 105-110 located on the L4 loop of a symmetrically related subunit play a role in GTP-dependent activation (25Iyengar A. Bearne S.L. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Lunn F.A. Bearne S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4204-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these residues do not interact with GTP in the model, suggesting that the conformation of the enzyme observed in the crystal structure is altered upon GTP binding (Fig. 1). In addition, Arg429 (and possibly Lys432) in E. coli CTPS (27Simard D. Hewitt K.A. Lunn F. Iyengar A. Bearne S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2195-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Thr431 and Arg433 in L. lactis CTPS (Thr438 and Arg440 in E. coli) (28Willemoës M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9407-9411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) play a role in both GTP binding and GTP-dependent activation of the glutaminase activity. These residues reside on a mobile loop that is not fully visible in the crystal structure of E. coli CTPS. Hence, the precise interactions between CTPS and GTP remain unknown, thereby precluding detailed modeling studies. Because of the absence of detailed crystallographic structural information on the effects of the interaction of GTP with CTPS, we have used a series of guanosine and GTP analogues to determine the structural features that are required for activation and inhibition of E. coli CTPS. We show that the 5′-triphosphate, 2′-OH, and 3′-OH are required for activation but not inhibition. The 2-NH2 group of GTP plays an important role in binding recognition, whereas substituents at the 6-position play an important role in activation. The presence of a 6-NH2 group obviates activation, consistent with the inability of ATP to activate the glutaminase activity of CTPS.

Unless stated otherwise, all other chemicals were purchased form Sigma. His·Bind resin and thrombin cleavage capture kits were purchased from Novagen, Inc. (Madison, WI). Expression and Purification of CTPS—Recombinant wild-type CTPS was overexpressed and purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells containing the pET15b-CTPS1 plasmid as described previously (11Bearne S.L. Hekmat O. MacDonnell J.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes wild-type E. coli CTPS bearing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPR ↓ GSHMLEM1... CTPS). The soluble histidine-tagged CTPS was purified using metal ion affinity chromatography, and the histidine tag was subsequently removed using thrombin-catalyzed cleavage (new N-terminus, GSHMLEM1..., where M1 represents the first residue of the wild-type enzyme). The results of purification and cleavage procedures were routinely monitored using SDS-PAGE. Typically, enzyme preparations were ≥98% pure. Enzyme Assays and Protein Determinations—CTPS activity was determined at 37 °C using a continuous spectrophotometric assay by following the rate of increase in absorbance at 291 nm due to the conversion of UTP to CTP (Δϵ = 1338 m-1 cm-1) (12Long C.W. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture consisted of Hepes buffer (70 mm, pH 8.0) containing EGTA (0.5 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), CTPS (20-80 μg/ml), and saturating concentrations of UTP (1 mm) and ATP (1 mm) in a total volume of 1.0 ml. Enzyme and nucleotides were preincubated together for 2.5 min at 37 °C, and then the reaction was initiated by the addition of either NH4Cl or Gln. GtetraP, 2′-dGTP, ddGTP, ACVMP, 2-NH2-PRTP, 6-thio-GTP, 2-NH2-ATP, N7-Me-GTP, 8-oxo-GTP, 7-deaza-GP, and O6-Me-GTP were kept on ice prior to addition to the assay solution. The concentrations of nucleosides and nucleotides were estimated spectrophotometrically using their molar extinction coefficients (see Table 1S). The effects of varying concentrations of guanosine (0-0.5 mm) and O6-Me-G (0-0.3 mm) on Gln-dependent CTP formation were examined using fixed concentrations of Gln (0.30, 0.75, 2.50, and 10.0 mm). The effects of varying concentrations of guanosine (0-0.6 mm), GMP (0-0.6 mm), GDP (0-0.6 mm), GTP (0-1.0 mm), ITP (0-8.0 mm), and ACV (0-0.6 mm) on NH3-dependent CTP formation were examined using fixed concentrations of NH4Cl (25, 50, 100, and 150 mm). The [NH3] present at pH 8.0 was calculated using a pKa (NH4+) of 9.24 (41Jencks W.P. Regenstein J. Sober H.A. Handbook of Biochemistry. The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1968: J-165Google Scholar) (i.e. [NH3] = 0.0544·[NH4Cl]total). The ionic strength was maintained at 0.3 m in all assays by the addition of KCl. The observed sigmoid dependence of the relative velocities (vi/vo) on the concentration of the guanosine or corresponding nucleotides was analyzed by fitting the data to Equation 1 using nonlinear regression analysis. In Equation 1, vi and vo are the initial velocities in the presence and absence of the inhibitor, [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor, n is the Hill number, and IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor that yields 50% inhibition (42Loftfield R.B. Eigner E.A. Science. 1969; 164: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 43Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1975: 470-473Google Scholar). νiνo=IC50n(IC50n+[I]n)(Eq. 1) The activation of Gln-dependent CTP formation by GTP (0-1.0 mm), O6-Me-GTP (0-1.0 mm), 6-thio-GTP (0-1.0 mm), GtetraP (0-1.0 mm), ITP (0-8.0 mm), dGTP (0-1.0 mm), and other nucleotides (0-1.0 mm; see Table 1) were examined using a fixed Gln concentration of 10 mm. The activation data were analyzed using the kinetic mechanism shown in Scheme 2. The initial velocity expression corresponding to this mechanism is given in Equation 2, where ko and kact are the rate constants for the formation of product as defined in Scheme 2, KA is the dissociation constant for the E·GTP complex, and Kin is the apparent dissociation constant for the E·(GTP)n complex. Previous studies had indicated that the E·(GTP)n·Gln complex is nonproductive (22MacDonnell J.E. Lunn F.A. Bearne S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To simplify the kinetic analysis, inhibition by GTP was examined only at saturating concentrations of Gln (i.e. [Gln] = 10 mm >> Km (assumed to approximate KS) = 0.32 mm (11Bearne S.L. Hekmat O. MacDonnell J.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). Under these maximal velocity conditions, Equation 2 simplifies to Equation 3, and the initial velocity data for the inhibition of Gln-dependent CTP formation by GTP were fit to this latter equation.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for the activation of Gln-dependent CTP formation by GTP analogues Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting vi/[E]T data (Fig. 3) to Equation 3 for [nucleotide] ≤ 0.6 mm (except for ITP, for which data were fit for [ITP] ≤ 8 mm) and with ko = 0.73 ± 0.06 s-1 (average and S.D. from nine trials). Concentrations of guanosine exceeding 0.2 mm were not studied due to the high total absorbance at 291 nm.NucleotideaNo activation was observed with guanosine, GMP, GDP, ddGTP, ACV, ACVMP, 2-NH2-PRTP, XTP, 2-NH2-ATP, 8-oxo-GTP, 7-deaza-GTP, N7-Me-GTP, and S6-Me-GTP up to concentrations of 1.0 mm[Guanosine]kactKAKinmms–1mmmmGTP010.6 ± 0.40.081 ± 0.0070.28 ± 0.014.0 ± 0.2GTP0.1010.3 ± 0.50.088 ± 0.0080.22 ± 0.013.4 ± 0.1GTP0.208.2 ± 0.40.078 ± 0.0070.12 ± 0.013.6 ± 0.16-Thio-GTP08.5 ± 0.20.035 ± 0.0030.27 ± 0.014.8 ± 0.2GtetraP04.0 ± 0.20.19 ± 0.030.50 ± 0.015.8 ± 0.6ITP05.2 ± 0.62.9 ± 0.64.5 ± 0.14.3 ± 0.3O6-Me-GTP02.8 ± 0.30.13 ± 0.030.29 ± 0.015.4 ± 0.42′-dGTP01.5 ± 0.30.21 ± 0.150.36 ± 0.024.3 ± 0.4a No activation was observed with guanosine, GMP, GDP, ddGTP, ACV, ACVMP, 2-NH2-PRTP, XTP, 2-NH2-ATP, 8-oxo-GTP, 7-deaza-GTP, N7-Me-GTP, and S6-Me-GTP up to concentrations of 1.0 mm Open table in a new tab ν[E]T=ko+kact[A]KA[S]1+[A]KA+[A]Kin(KS+[S])(Eq. 2) ν[E]T=ko+kact[A]KA1+[A]KA+[A]Kin(Eq. 3) The effect of fixed concentrations of guanosine (0.1 and 0.2 mm) on the GTP-dependent activation of Gln-dependent CTP formation was examined for GTP concentrations ranging between 0 and 0.5 mm. The IC50 values for the inhibition of both NH3-dependent CTP formation and Gln-dependent CTP formation by the GTP analogues were determined by fitting the observed relative velocities to Equation 1. For NH3-dependent CTP formation, assays were conducted with the concentration of NH4Cl fixed at 150 mm. For the Gln-dependent CTP formation, the concentrations of Gln and GTP were fixed at 10 mm and 0.15 mm, respectively. The concentrations of all purines and of purine nucleosides and nucleotides used in these assays ranged between 0 and 0.6 mm with the exception of inosine (0-8 mm), ITP (0-8 mm), N7-Me-G (0-0.35 mm), 2-NH2-PR (0-0.3 mm), adenosine (0-6 mm), O6-Me-G (0-0.4 mm), 7-deaza-G (0-0.5 mm), 8-oxo-G (0-0.2 mm), and 6-thioguanine (0-0.8 mm). Due to the limited solubility of 6-thioguanine in aqueous solution, assays with this compound were conducted in solutions containing Me2SO (20%, v/v). The concentrations of CTP used in inhibition studies ranged between 0.1 and 0.6 mm. The effect of guanosine (0, 0.15, 0.30, and 0.50 mm) on the glutaminase activity of CTPS (2.6-2.8 μg/ml) was assayed using a high pressure liquid chromatography-based assay as described previously (44Iyengar A. Bearne S.L. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 308: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and using a saturating concentration of Gln (10 mm) in the presence of GTP (0.15 mm) to estimate the value of kcat. The ability of 2-NH2-ATP (2 mm) to replace ATP as a substrate was examined in the presence of UTP (5 mm to ensure tetramerization of CTPS), NH4Cl (150 mm), and CTPS (20 μg/ml) using the standard assay conditions. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin standards. Data Analysis—Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting initial rate kinetic data to the appropriate equations by nonlinear regression analysis using the program KaleidaGraph version 3.5 from Synergy Software (Reading, PA). Values of ko and kact (per subunit) were calculated for CTPS with the hexahistidine tag removed using a molecular mass of 61,029 Da. Reported errors on all kinetic constants and IC50 values are the S.D. values from triplicate determinations. Both purine (ATP and GTP) and pyrimidine (UTP and CTP) nucleotides are ligands for CTPS, and the ability of CTPS to utilize these different nucleotides for unique roles implies that the enzyme is able to discriminate effectively among them at the molecular level. For example, the enzyme has two overlapping binding sites for UTP and CTP (9Endrizzi J.A. Kim H. Anderson P.M. Baldwin E.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13491-13499Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This arrangement permits the spontaneous development of resistance to drugs such as cyclopentenylcytosine and release from feedback inhibition by CTP (45Aronow B. Ullman B. Adv. Exp. Med.

Consequently, designing drugs targeted at CTPS based solely on the structure of CTP or UTP may not be an effective strategy. An alternative strategy is to block GTP-dependent activation. We reported previously that GTP functions as both a positive and negative allosteric effector of E. coli CTPS (22MacDonnell J.E. Lunn F.A. Bearne S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At concentrations less than 0.15 mm, GTP activates Gln-dependent CTP formation by CTPS; however, at c"

To gain insight into chlamydial disulfide bond catalysis, the structure, function, and substrate interaction of a novel periplasmic oxidoreductase, termed DsbH, were determined. The structure of DsbH, its redox potential of –269 mV, and its functional properties are similar to thioredoxin and the C-terminal domain of DsbD, i.e. characteristic of a disulfide reductase. As compared with these proteins, the two central residues of the DsbH catalytic motif (CMWC) shield the catalytic disulfide bond and are selectively perturbed by a peptide ligand. This shows that these oxidoreductase family characteristic residues are not only important in determining the redox potential of the catalytic disulfide bond but also in influencing substrate interactions. For DsbH, three functional roles are conceivable; that is, reducing intermolecular disulfides between proteins and small molecules, keeping a specific subset of exported proteins reduced, or maintaining the periplasm of Chlamydia in a generally reducing state.

Chlamydia are obligate intracellular eubacteria that are phylogenetically distant from other bacterial divisions (1Pace N.R. Science. 1997; 276: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). Virtually every human being will be infected with Chlamydia pneumoniae in their lifetime, and this organism accounts for ∼10% of pneumonia cases and 5% of bronchitis cases in the United States (2Grayston J.T. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: S402-S410Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 3Kuo C.C. Jackson L.A. Campbell L.A. Grayston J.T. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 451-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acute infections are usually mild in immunocompetent hosts, but severe pneumonias are observed in immunocompromised patients. Chronic C. pneumoniae infections have been associated with arterial disease (4Sako T. Takahashi T. Takehana K. Uchida E. Nakade T. Umemura T. Taniyama H. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 162: 253-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), where C. pneumoniae act to continuously stimulate inflammation and thereby contribute to stroke and coronary heart disease. Chlamydia have an unique developmental cycle in which the extracellular infectious form, the elementary body, is metabolically inactive and highly resistant to lysis. This is thought to be due in large part to a complex of outer envelope proteins that are highly cross-linked by disulfide bonds (5Everett K.D.E. Hatch T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 877-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disulfide cross-linked envelope proteins appear to substitute for peptidoglycan in the elementary body (6Hatch T.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the intracellular, non-infectious but metabolically active reticulate body which employs peptidoglycan (7McCoy A.J. Maurelli A.T. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 70-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), like other Gram-negative bacteria. The reliance of the elementary body on disulfide bond-linked proteins suggests that interference with chlamydial disulfide bond catalysis offers a potential avenue for treating chlamydial infections in addition to antibiotics administration. Despite the extensive use of disulfide cross-linked envelope proteins, Chlamydia exhibit an unusually high number of unpaired cysteines in their secreted proteins compared with Escherichia coli. Is the machinery for periplasmic disulfide bond catalysis in Chlamydia different from E. coli?

In comparison, E. coli K-12, for which the catalysis of periplasmic disulfide bond formation has been characterized best (9Glockshuber R.

DsbB and DsbA form the functional pair that acts, respectively, to create disulfide bonds and transfer them to substrate proteins. The lack of DsbA, which is the primary periplasmic dithiol oxidant, greatly reduces the virulence of several bacterial species (11Yu J. Kroll J.S. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Peek J.A. Taylor R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reduced DsbA is reoxidized by the integral inner membrane protein DsbB (13Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The soluble DsbC and DsbG proteins are kept in their active reduced state by the transmembrane protein DsbD (17Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol.

In turn, DsbD gains its reducing equivalents from the cytosolic protein thioredoxin, which ultimately gains its reduced equivalents from NADPH (18Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). DsbE(CcmG), which is also kept reduced by the DsbD protein, is required for cytochrome c maturation. DsbE is thought to be responsible for keeping two cysteine residues in cytochromes reduced, a prerequisite for heme attachment (19Grove J. Busby S. Cole J. Mol. Gen.

The present study identifies two new subfamilies of periplasmic oxidoreductases in Chlamydia, termed DsbH and DsbJ, besides orthologs of DsbA, DsbB, and DsbD. As a first step in the characterization of the chlamydial disulfide bond catalysis, the solution structure of DsbH was determined to establish its structural relationship to the known oxidoreductases. To learn more about DsbH-substrate interactions, the interaction of DsbH with a peptide ligand was examined. The functional characterization of DsbH enzymatic properties was carried out, and the results suggest that DsbH plays the role of a reducing thiol disulfide oxidoreductase in Chlamydia. Compared with for example E. coli, the disulfide bond catalysis machinery of Chlamydia exhibits substantial differences. Molecular Biology—The DsbH gene of C. pneumoniae TW-183 (CpB0958) was assembled from overlapping oligonucleotides (Retrogen, Inc.). A C41G substitution was implemented based on sequence alignment with Chlamydia caviae GPIC (data not shown). For efficient periplasmic expression in E. coli, the DsbA signal sequence from E. coli was used instead of that from DsbH. A high sequence homology between the two signal sequences and the unambiguously predicted DsbH signal peptide cleavage site using the program SignalP 3.0 (20Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5640) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1) form a sound rationale for this approach. The DsbH gene was cloned into the pET-44 vector (Novagen, Inc.) for expression in conjunction with a C-terminal His6 tag. For in vivo functional assays, another periplasmic expression vector (pET44-DsbH) was prepared that is devoid of a His6 tag. A third expression construct in which the His6 tag is shifted to the N terminus and replaces the signal sequence was also constructed for cytosolic protein localization. The DNA of the peptide ligand encompassing two disulfide bond motifs (Fig. 5D) and a preceding tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site was synthesized from overlapping oligonucleotides and ligated into pET-44 as a fusion to the third IgG binding domain (GB3). Protein Biochemistry—Periplasmic DsbH expression was induced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells growing in M9 minimal media at 20 °C at an A600 of 0.6 by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. After overnight expression, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in ice-cold 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole solution. The clarified lysate was applied on a HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+ for immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Bound proteins were eluted using a two-step gradient (50 and 300 mm imidazole). Subsequently, DsbH was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S100 column (GE Healthcare) in 25 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl buffer. The cytosolic DsbH expression vector was used in E. coli BL21Star(DE3) cells (Stratagene, Inc.), and DsbH expression was induced at A600 = 0.8 for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 8 m urea, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol solution, and the cleared lysate was again applied on the immobilized metal affinity chromatography column. After extensive washing in lysis buffer, urea was eliminated from the wash buffer, and subsequently, β-mercaptoethanol was also eliminated, allowing protein folding and disulfide bond formation before protein elution. The remainder of the purification was identical to that for periplasmic DsbH. The GB3-peptide construct was expressed and purified analogously to cytosolic DsbH. The monomeric GB3-peptide fraction from gel filtration containing only intramolecular disulfide bonds was cleaved with tobacco etch virus protease in the absence of any reducing agents at a molar ratio of 1:200 overnight at room temperature. Fusion protein and tobacco etch virus protease were removed from the peptide by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. NMR Sample Preparation—Samples of 300-μl volumes were prepared in 50 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.0, and 0.02% w/v NaN3 buffer to contain 1.0 mm of DsbH (cytosolic; ϵ280 nm = 21,030 m–1cm–1). Besides a sample in isotropic solution, the alignment of DsbH relative to the magnetic field was achieved in the presence of bicelles and stretched polyacrylamide gel. A 5% solution of bicelles consisting of 1,2-di-O-tridecanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DTPC), 1,2-di-O-hexyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) at molar ratios of DTPC:DHPC = 3:1 and (DTPC+DHPC):CTAB = 30:1 was employed. Stretched, negatively charged polyacrylamide gels (21Ulmer T.S. Ramirez B.E. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9179-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) were polymerized from a 5.1% w/v solution of acrylamide, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate (AMPS), and bisacrylamide with a monomer to cross-linker ratio of 39:1 (w/w) and a molar ratio of 98:2 of acrylamide to AMPS, employing the previously described conventions and procedures (22Ulmer T.S. Bax A. Cole N.B. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9595-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The bicelle solution gave rise to a 2H splitting of 22.8 Hz at 29 °C, corresponding to a DsbH alignment tensor magnitude of 10.4 Hz. For the stretched gel a 2H splitting of 2.4 Hz was detected at 25 °C, corresponding to a tensor magnitude of 10.1 Hz. DsbH samples containing the employed peptide ligand (Fig. 5D) were prepared to contain 0.1 mm15N-labeled DsbH and 0.05 mm peptide in the above phosphate buffer. NMR Spectroscopy—All experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance 700 spectrometer at 25 °C except for the bicelle solution, which was measured at 29 °C to maintain the liquid crystalline phase. Data were processed and analyzed with the nmrPipe package and CARA. HN, N, Cα, Cβ, and C′ assignments were made from HNCA, HNCACB, HNCO, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments. Subsequently, Hα and partial Hβ assignments were obtained from total correlation spectroscopy-heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiments (tmix = 35.9 ms). The side-chain assignments were completed using H(C)CH-J-correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and (H)CCH-COSY experiments (23Gehring K. Ekiel I. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 135: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Partial assignments of the highly overlapped aromatic side chains were obtained from their constant time (CT)-heteronuclear single quantum correlation and NOE spectroscopy patterns (24Lin Z. Xu Y.Q. Yang S. Yang D.W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 1960-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 15N- and 13C-edited NOE spectroscopy spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 100 ms. NOE cross-peak assignments were performed manually. 3JC′Cγ and 3JNCγ couplings for aromatic and aliphatic residues were obtained from quantitative J-correlation spectroscopy (25Hu J.S. Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1803-1804Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with dephasing times of 50 and 100 ms, respectively. 1JNH, 1JCαC′, 1JC′N and 1JNH+1DNH, 1JCαC′+1DCαC′, 1JC′N+1DC′N couplings were determined from mixed-constant time, HN-coupled HNCO (26Cornilescu G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 10143-10154Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and quantitative J-correlation HNCO experiments (27Jaroniec C.P. Ulmer T.S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Chou J.J. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) of isotropic and aligned samples, respectively. {1H}-15N NOE measurements were carried out at 70.9 MHz (29Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) using 3 s of presaturation preceded by a recycling delay of 2 s for the NOE experiment and a 5-s recycle delay for the reference experiment. Structure Calculation—ϕ, θ backbone dihedral angle restraints were extracted from Hα, N, Cα, Cβ, and C′ chemical shifts using the program TALOS (30Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). χ1 side-chain angle restraints were derived from the 3JC′Cγ and 3JNCγ coupling constants (25Hu J.S. Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1803-1804Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Proline cis/trans assignments were based on the proline 13C chemical shift pattern (31Schubert M. Labudde D. Oschkinat H. Schmieder P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). NOE peak amplitudes were converted into interproton distances using an empirical 1/r4 correlation between amplitude and distance (32Guntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Distances were calibrated in α-helical regions by matching interproton dNiNi+1 and dNiNi+3 distances for 15N-edited and interproton dαiNi+1 and dαiNi+2 distances for 13C-edited NOE spectroscopy spectra to values found in α-helical conformation. The distance restraints were grouped into four ranges, 1.8–2.7 Å (1.8–2.9 Å for NOEs involving HN protons), 1.8–3.3 Å (1.8–3.5 Å for NOEs involving HN protons), 1.8–5.0 Å, and 1.8–6.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs, respectively. To account for the higher apparent intensity of methyl resonances, the upper distance bound for NOEs involving methyl groups was extended by 0.5 Å. Interproton distances involving non-stereospecifically assigned methylene protons, methyl groups, and Hδ and Hϵ protons of Tyr and Phe were represented as a (Σr–6)–1/6 sum (33Nilges M. Proteins. 1993; 17: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The alignment tensor magnitude and rhombicity for each residual dipolar coupling data set were estimated from molecular fragment replacement (34Delaglio F. Kontaxis G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2142-2143Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and were kept fixed during structure calculations. Alignment tensor magnitudes of 10.4 and 10.1 Hz were obtained for the employed bicelle and gel media, respectively, eliminating the need for media-specific weighting factors. DsbH structures were calculated by simulated annealing starting at 3000 K using the program XPLOR-NIH (35Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Besides standard force field terms for covalent geometry (bonds, angles, and improper torsions) and nonbonded contacts (van der Waals repulsion), the following experimental and empirical potentials were included. Dihedral angle restraints and interproton distance restraints were implemented using quadratic square-well potentials. The difference between predicted and experimental residual dipolar couplings was described by a quadratic harmonic potential. A pseudopotential for the radius of gyration was used (36Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2337-2338Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar) as well as a backbone-backbone hydrogen-bonding potential (37Grishaev A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 7281-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and torsion angle potentials of mean force (38Kuszewski J.J. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 146: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). An ensemble of 20 structures was calculated. The structural statistics are summarized in supplemental Table 1. Atomic coordinates, structural restraints and chemical shift assignments for DsbH have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank under ID codes 2ju5 and 15431, respectively. Redox Potential Measurement—Proteins whose redox potentials were to be measured were incubated with DsbDγ, a protein of known redox potential, –235 mV (39Rozhkova A. Stirnimann C.U. Frei P. Grauschopf U. Brunisholz R. Grutter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At equilibrium different protein species were separated by reverse-phase HPLC, and the equilibrium constant (Keq) of the reaction and the standard redox potential (Eo′) of the protein were determined as described (40Collet J.F. Riemer J. Bader M.W. Bardwell J.C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26886-26892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To verify that equilibrium was reached, it was approached from both directions. To do this DsbDγ was incubated separately with the reduced and the oxidized forms of the protein. Values obtained from these parallel experiments were within 1 mV of each other, showing that equilibrium had been closely approached. A value of –240 mV was used for the standard redox potential of glutathione at pH 7.0 to calculate the standard redox potential of DsbH (41Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Insulin Turbidity Assay—The ability of DsbH to catalyze the reduction of bovine insulin was tested using an insulin turbidity assay. The reaction mixture, containing 131 μm insulin, 0.35 mm dithiothreitol, and 1, 5, or 8 μm reduced protein (thioredoxin and DsbH) and the insulin stock were prepared in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 2 mm EDTA. The final volume was 1 ml, and the reaction was started by adding insulin. The measurements were performed at 650 nm. The uncatalyzed reduction of insulin by dithiothreitol was monitored in a control reaction without adding reduced protein. Measurement of Oxidase Activity by Stopped Flow—Stopped flow fluorescence measurements were performed on a KinTek SF-2004 instrument in single-mixing mode. The typical reaction contained 0.5 μm oxidized protein (DsbA, thioredoxin, DsbH) and 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 μm reduced hirudin, respectively. The oxidized proteins and reduced hirudin were incubated in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, at 25 °C before mixing. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a bandpass filter were used to monitor the fluorescence change of the proteins. Isomerization of Scrambled Hirudin—21 μm scrambled hirudin and 21 μm freshly reduced protein (DsbH, E. coli DsbC, and thioredoxin) were incubated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm sodium chloride, 0.13% polyethylene glycol 8000 at 25 °C. Aliquots of 120 μl were removed after different reaction times and quenched with 15 μl of formic acid and 15 μl of acetonitrile. Hirudin folding intermediates were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column at 55 °C in a 19–25% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The absorbance was recorded at 220 nm. Spot Titers for Cadmium and Copper Resistance—Spot titers for cadmium resistance were performed to assay the ability of DsbH to complement DsbA. For this assay, the strain JP120 (supplemental Table 2) was transformed with the periplasmic DsbH expression vector (pET44-DsbH) by electroporation. Briefly, mid-log phase cells (A600 ≈ 1) were serially diluted in sterile 170 mm NaCl solution. 2 μl of each dilution was plated onto LB plates supplemented with CdCl2 in a concentration of 5, 6, and 7.5 μm. After 16 h at 37 °C, the growth of each strain at different cadmium concentrations was compared, and the cadmium resistance was ranked 1–7, with higher values indicating increased resistance (supplemental Table 3). To assay the ability of DsbH to complement DsbC, the spot titers for copper resistance were made. The strains BW25113 and BW25113 dsbC::kan (supplemental Table 2) were transformed with the periplasmic DsbH expression vector (pET44-DsbH) by electroporation. As controls, the wild type strains and the untransformed strains were also spotted on the copper plates. Serial dilution was performed in a similar way as in cadmium resistance assays. 2 μl of each dilution was plated onto brain heart infusion plates containing 5 mm CuCl2 and on TB plates containing 15 mm CuCl2. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the growth of each strain was compared and ranked (Table 2).TABLE 2Rank order copper resistanceStrainaStrain descriptions are given insupplemental Table 2.Rank orderbCopper resistance was ranked 1-7, with higher values indicating increased resistance.SQ4162SQ416 pET44-DsbH2SQ4514SQ451 pET44-DsbH4SQ4176SQ4537a Strain descriptions are given insupplemental Table 2.b Copper resistance was ranked 1-7, with higher values indicating increased resistance. Open table in a new tab Motility Assay—The motility assay was performed in M9 minimal soft agar plates (0.2%) supplemented with 18 amino acids (excluding cysteine and methionine), 0.4% glycerol, 2 μg/ml nicotinamide, 0.2 μg/ml riboflavin B2, 2 μg/ml thiamine B1, 2 μg/ml biotin, 1 mm MgSO4 as described previously (42Quan S. Schneider I. Pan J.L. Hacht A.V. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28823-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mid-log phase liquid cultures were diluted based on the absorbance at 600 nm to normalized cell density for 1 absorbance unit. 2 μl of cells were then inoculated into the center of the motility plate. After 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, the diameter of the swarm was measured (supplemental Table 4). Functional Gene Assignment of Chlamydial Disulfide Oxidoreductases—The amino acid sequences of the five predicted periplasmic oxidoreductases of Chlamydia (8Kalman S. Mitchell W. Marathe R. Lammel C. Fan L. Hyman R.W. Olinger L. Grimwood L. Davis R.W. Stephens R.S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) were subjected to position-specific iterative BLAST searches to identify homologies to Dsb proteins. Chlamydial orthologs of DsbA, DsbC, and DsbD were identified this way (Table 1). However, the remaining two proteins, although distantly related to a number of thioredoxin family proteins, were not closely related to any described Dsb protein including DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD, DsbE, DsbG, or any other thioredoxin-related protein of known function. Thus, they appear to represent new subfamilies of thioredoxin related proteins. Because the common function of thioredoxin-related proteins is thiol-disulfide exchange, the two proteins are termed DsbH and DsbJ, respectively (Table 1), to highlight their putative involvement in periplasmic disulfide bond manipulation. It is further noted that for both proteins signal peptides are predicted with very high probabilities of 0.987 and 0.999 using the program SignalP 3.0 (supplemental Fig. 1) (20Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5640) Google Scholar), clearly indicating the periplasmic localization of DsbH and DsbJ.TABLE 1C. pneumoniae oxidoreductase functional gene assignmentsLocus tagaLocus tag refers to strain TW-183 of C. pneumoniae.CpB0685CpB0234CpB0233CpB0814CpB0958CpB0968GenBank™ accession no.NP_876957NP_876510NP_876509NP_877086NP_877230NP_877239Length102233137714166348AssignmentThioredoxinDsbADsbBDsbDDsbHDsbJPSI-Blast E-value to E. coli orthologue (third iteration)3 × 10-434 × 10-122 × 10-116 × 10-70No clear orthologue detectedNo clear orthologue detecteda Locus tag refers to strain TW-183 of C. pneumoniae. Open table in a new tab Significant similarities to DsbH can be detected using position-specific iterative BLAST searches for a wide variety of thioredoxin-related proteins, including DUF255 (a thioredoxin-related protein family of unknown function), the C-terminal domain of DsbD (DsbDγ), and somewhat more distantly, to thioredoxin itself (Fig. 1). It is noted that the term DsbH has previously been used in GenBank™ for proteins found in Pseudomonas (e.g. YP_001171076) and Chromobacter, but these proteins are clearly DsbB homologues and, thus, do not represent a new Dsb protein family. To learn more about the new DsbH family of thioredoxin-related periplasmic oxidoreductases, DsbH from C. pneumoniae is structurally and functionally characterized. DsbH Structure Determination—The solution structure of oxidized DsbH was determined by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, making use of uniformly 13C,15N-labeled protein. As reflected by its rotational correlation time of 10.0 ns and gel filtration profile (supplemental Fig. 2), DsbH is a monomer in solution. A wealth of local structural information on interproton distances and dihedral angles was provided by NMR observables such as NOEs, coupling constants, and chemical shifts. In addition, an extensive set of residual dipolar couplings was used to improve the spatial relationship of more remote protein segments by relating the respective internuclear bond vector orientations to a common molecular alignment frame. The final ensemble of structures was calculated by simulated annealing on the basis of a total of 3410 experimental NMR restraints.

https://openalex.org/W2092737316,"Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells that possess specific and efficient mechanisms to initiate immune responses. Upon encounter with pathogens, immature DC will go through a maturation process that converts them to highly immunogenic mature DC. Despite the fact that nitric oxide (NO) was produced in large amounts in maturing DC, it is still unclear whether NO is the key molecule that initiates and enhances DC maturation and T cell proliferation, respectively. Here, we report that NO donor and overexpression of either nitric-oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) or nitric-oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) alone can induce surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) and both the essential co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in immature DC. Consistently, NO donor-treated immature DC were capable of enhancing T cell proliferation in vitro in the absence of lipolysaccharide. Interestingly, NOS2 interacts with CD74 (the MHC II-associated invariant chain), and the degradation of CD74 by caspases in immature DC was inhibited upon treatment with NO donor. Because the trafficking of MHC II is CD74-dependent, the increase in cell surface localization of MHC II in maturing DC is in part due to the increase in CD74 protein expression in the presence of NOS2 and NO.

Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules bind peptides derived from internalized proteins that have entered the endocytic pathway and present them at the cell surface for the activation of CD4+ T cells. Upon encounter with pathogens, immature DC go through a maturation process that converts them to highly immunogenic mature DC. Immature DC are good at capturing pathogens or foreign antigens, but most of the intracellular MHC II molecules that can bind and present antigens to T cells are localized to the late endosomes. In mature DC, MHC II molecules are free to traffic to the cell surface together with their peptides to present to T cells. Some protein molecules play essential roles in controlling the retention and trafficking of MHC II in DC. We previously showed that in the immature DC, a number of endosomal proteins were degraded by caspases (1Wong S.H. Santambrogio L. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17783-17788Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 2Santambrogio L. Potolicchio I. Fessler S.P. Wong S.H. Raposo G. Strominger J.L. Nat.

Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17783-17788Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

Here, we report that NO donor-treated immature DC were capable of enhancing T cell proliferation in vitro in the absence of LPS. In addition, the MHC II-associated invariant chain (CD74) was up-regulated in immature DC upon treatment with NO donor. CD74 is a type II integral membrane protein essential for proper MHC II folding (in the endoplasmic reticulum) and targeting of MHC II-CD74 complex to the endosomes (5Matza D. Kerem A. Shachar I. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 264-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Degradation of CD74 is highly regulated via stepwise proteolysis events, in which only the downstream degradation pathway is well understood. Full-length CD74 (p31) bound to MHC II molecule is cleaved by proteases to form p22 and then to p10 that is further digested into CLIP (class II-associated invariant chain peptide), which then dissociates from MHC II with the help of H2-DM that facilitates the exchange of CLIP for antigenic peptides (6Denzin L.K. Cresswell P. Cell. 1995; 82: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 7Hsing L.C. Rudensky A.Y. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 207: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of the various degradation products of CD74, the exact pathway of CD74 degradation remains unclear (8Manoury B. Mazzeo D. Li D.N. Billson J. Loak K. Benaroch P. Watts C.

Here, we found that CD74 was a substrate for caspases, and the degradation of CD74 was inhibited in DC treated with either LPS or NO donor (NONOate), which released NO nonenzymatically at physiological pH (11Mohr S. Zech B. Lapetina E.G. Brune B. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 387-391Google Scholar). Furthermore, NOS2 interacts and enhances the stability of CD74 in maturing DC. Mouse DC and Macrophage Culture—Bone marrow-derived DC and macrophages from 6 to 7 weeks old C57/BL 6J wild type and NOS2-/- mice (I-Ab, I-Eb) (The Jackson Laboratory) were established by the bulk culture method as previously described (1Wong S.H. Santambrogio L. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17783-17788Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells were harvested from the long bones and plated on dishes in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum containing either 20 ng/ml of mouse recombinant granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (for DC) or macrophage-CSF (for macrophages). The cells were fed every 2 days with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either 15 ng/ml granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (for DC) or macrophage-CSF (for macrophages). For immature DC and macrophages, the cells were harvested after day 7. As for mature DC, the cells were further subcultured in media containing 1 μg/ml LPS (Sigma) for 48 h. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Untreated or DC treated with either LPS or NONOate were harvested with 2 mm EDTA and then washed with staining buffer (5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline) followed by incubation for 30 min on ice with the mouse FITC-conjugated anti-MHC class II, anti-CD80, anti-CD86, and hamster anti-CD11c antibodies (all of the antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories). After washing with staining buffer, the cells were fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence—DC seeded on coverslips were treated with LPS for 48 h and fixed in chilled methanol for 4 min at -20 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated with rat anti-CD74 and rabbit anti-NOS2 antibodies and visualized with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Measurement of NO—NO was assayed by measuring the concentration of stable end product NO2-. NO2- production was determined by a Griess reaction. Aliquots of culture supernatant (100 μl) were incubated with 100 μl of Griess reagent (Sigma) at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance was measured at 550 nm in an automated plate reader. Concentration was determined with reference to a standard curve of NaNO2. Co-immunoprecipitation—Proteins were extracted from mature DC and incubated on ice for 1 h in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1% Brij98, and protease inhibitor) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein extracts (1 mg) were incubated overnight with 5 μg of the corresponding antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) in lysis buffer plus 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5% Brij98) and three times in buffer B (identical to buffer A except without Brij98) before being resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins and 5% of the supernatant were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot. Construct for Overexpression of CD74 and Its Mutants—Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow-derived DC using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's conditions and used as template for reverse transcription-PCR. cDNA was generated using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo(dT) and subsequently amplified with PCR using forward primer (5′-GGAATTCCATGGATGACCAACGCGGCCTCATCTCTAACCAT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTCTAGAGCTCACAGGTGACTTGACCCAG-3′). The resulting CD74 PCR product was inserted into pDMyc vector using the XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites. Mutagenesis of Asp to Ala in CD74 was performed by PCR using same reverse primer (see above) and mutagenic forward primer (5′-GGAATTCCATGGATGACCAACGCGCCCTCATCTCTAACCAT-3′), changing Asp to Ala. Both of the constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. The constructs were transfected into DC2.4 cells using the Effectene (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's conditions. After incubation for 48 h, the transfected cells were lysed for further analysis. Caspase Activity Assay—1 × 107 cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 7.4) for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein (20 μg) was incubated at 37 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm DTT, with the respective colorimetric substrates (Z-YVAD-pNA, Z-WHED-pNA, and Z-DEVD-pNA) (all from Calbiochem), in a 96-well, flat-bottomed microtiter plate. The cleavage of the substrates was quantified after 2 h by using measurement of O.D.405 nm absorbance. In Vitro Transcription of Capped mRNA and Electroporation of Primary DC—The pDMyc/NOS2 plasmids were linearized with XbaI. The in vitro transcription was performed with T7 polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). DC were harvested at day 6, washed twice with serum-free Opti-MEM, and resuspended to a final concentration of 4 × 107 cells/ml in Opti-MEM medium. Subsequently, 100 μl of cell suspension was mixed with 20 μg of mRNA and electroporated in a 0.2-cm cuvette (voltage, 300V; capacitance, 150 microfarads; resistance, 100 Ω) using the GenePulser II (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, the cells were transferred to fresh culture medium containing granulocyte/macrophage-CSF or induced with 1 μg/ml LPS and were cultured for 24 h to allow them to fully mature. Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction Assay—CFSE-labeled thymocytes from BALB/c mice were incubated with DC that were cultured in medium alone (Ctrl) or stimulated for 48 h with 1 μg/ml LPS or 16 h with 100 mm NONOate. After 7 days, the T cell proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry. Control labeled T cells (red histograms) were performed with the same protocol but in the absence of DC. For CFSE labeling, purified thymocytes were resuspended with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml and were labeled for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.3 μm CFSE. CFSE-labeled cells were “quenched” with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% fetal calf serum and were washed twice. T cell division was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis 48 or 72 h later. Statistics—Student's t test was used for statistical analyses. NO Donor Enhanced T Cell Activation by Immature Dendritic Cells—During DC maturation, NO was produced in large amounts presumably catalyzed by NOS2, which was also upregulated during DC maturation. Despite the fact that NOS2 is the major NOS that catalyzes the production of NO during LPS-induced DC maturation, it is still unclear whether NOS2 is the only NOS that contributes to the production of NO in maturing DC. To examine this issue, DC derived from wild type, NOS2-/-, or NOS3-/- mice were either uninduced or induced with LPS prior to detection for NO production. Uninduced DC derived from wild type, NOS2 -/-, and NOS3-/- mice produced very little NO, presumably because of low basal expression of NOS (Fig. 1A, group 1). On the other hand, LPS induction increased the production of NO in both wild type and NOS3-/- but not in NOS2-/- immature DC (Fig. 1A, group 3). However, the increase in NO production observed in LPS-treated NOS3-/- DC was lower as compared with LPS-treated wild type DC (Fig. 1A, group 3), suggesting that NOS3 did contribute to NO production during LPS-induced DC maturation. As control, wild type, NOS2-/-, and NOS3-/- DC were incubated with l-NMMA to inhibit all forms of NOS (Fig. 1A, group 2). Furthermore, we observed that NOS3 was up-regulated at both the mRNA and protein level in LPS-treated DC (Fig. 1B). Taken together, our results suggest that both NOS2 and NOS3 contribute to NO production in LPS-induced DC. However, NOS2 was the major NOS that catalyzed NO synthesis. Despite the fact that NO was produced in large amounts in LPS-treated DC (data not shown), it is still unclear whether NO alone can contribute directly to the initiation and induction of DC maturation and T cell proliferation, respectively, in the absence of LPS. To examine this point, immature DC were incubated with NO donor (NONOate) alone and stained for cell surface MHC II, CD80, and CD86 by flow cytometry. Interestingly, we observed that NONOate alone was able to up-regulate cell surface expression of MHC II as well as both the essential co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in the absence of LPS (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, an increase in surface expression of MHC II, CD80, and CD86 was also observed in DC overexpressing NOS2 and NOS3. In this experiment, LPS-treated DC was used as control. Because other than MHC II, both the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 were also up-regulated upon NONOate treatment, we hypothesized that NONOate alone was able to enhance antigen presentation in the absence of a general maturation signal such as LPS. To examine this possibility, immature DC were either untreated or treated with NONOate or LPS (as positive control) prior to incubation with thymocytes in an mixed lymphocyte reaction assay to detect DC-induced T cell proliferation. Interestingly, DC treated with NONOate alone were able to enhance T cell proliferation, although the enhancement was slightly lower than that observed in LPS-treated DC (Fig. 1D). NO Inhibits CD74 Protein Degradation—We have recently shown that proteases such as caspases are involved in the degradation of molecules localized to the endosomal membrane trafficking pathway in immature DC (1Wong S.H. Santambrogio L. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17783-17788Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, the activity of caspase is partially inhibited by exogenously added NO and endogenous NO produced by the enzymatic activity of NOS2 in the mature DC (Refs. 1Wong S.H. Santambrogio L. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17783-17788Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 12Tannenbaum S.R. White F.M. ACS Chem Biol. 2006; 1: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Fig. 2A). Because NO can induce higher expression of MHC II on the cell surface of DC, it is interesting to determine whether NO can also regulate expression of protein molecules essential for the stability and intracellular trafficking of MHC II complex in DC. Day 5 immature DC were either untreated (control) or treated with NONOate for 12 h at 37 °C. Protein extracts from either untreated or treated DC were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibody against CD74, the MHC II-associated invariant chain essential for MHC II trafficking and antigen presentation in antigen-presenting cells (5Matza D. Kerem A. Shachar I. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 264-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). NONOate significantly increased the expression of CD74 (at the protein level) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B, lane 6, and D) but not at the mRNA level as shown by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 2C, lane 6). LPS, which induced NOS2 expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels, also increased CD74 protein expression (Fig. 2, B, lane 3, and C, lane 3). To further demonstrate the importance of NO in controlling the expression of CD74 protein, immature primary DC were either treated with l-NMMA (inhibitor of NOS1, NOS2, and NOS3 activities) alone or treated with both l-NMMA and LPS. l-NMMA treatment alone did not vary the level of CD74 protein expression in the immature DC (Fig. 2B, lane 2). However, LPS-induced CD74 expression was repressed by l-NMMA even in the presence of NOS2 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4 and 3). Interestingly, we also observed that the expression of NOS2 was significantly increased in the presence of both LPS and l-NMMA (LPS/l-NMMA) as compared with LPS treatment alone (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Unexpectedly, no increase in NOS2 at the transcriptional level was observed upon LPS/l-NMMA treatment as compared with LPS treatment alone (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). Instead, a decrease in NOS2 mRNA synthesis was observed. This indicates the presence of a positive feedback machinery where the inhibition of NOS activity by l-NMMA treatment enhances the stability of the NOS2 protein. Next, we asked the question of whether the loss of the NOS2 gene alone would enhance cleavage of CD74 in the immature DC and/or cause a decline in the cleavage inhibitory effect in LPS-treated DC. Primary DC prepared from wild type and NOS2-/- mice were either untreated or treated with LPS and checked for CD74 protein expression. As expected, in the absence of NOS2, LPS-induced CD74 protein expression in DC was significantly reduced but not totally inhibited (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 4). Based on our observation that both LPS and NONOate treatment up-regulates CD74 expression in DC, we hypothesized that CD74 could be a substrate for caspases in immature DC. Immature DC were either untreated (control) or treated with 200 μm caspase inhibitor I for 4 h at 37 °C. Protein extracts from either untreated or treated DC were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibody against CD74. Interestingly, both the p31 and p41 isoforms of CD74 were significantly up-regulated in caspase inhibitor (CI)-treated DC (Fig. 2B, lane 1 and 5). This up-regulation of CD74 protein expression in CI-treated DC was not due to the increase in CD74 mRNA level (Fig. 2C, lane 5). Furthermore, both LPS and CI treatment did not show significant changes to CD74 expression in the mouse bone marrow-derived primary macrophages, suggesting that the effects of LPS and CI on the expression of CD74 are DC-specific (Fig. 2B, lanes 7-9). Caspase-1 and Caspase-4 Are Potentially Involved in the Degradation of CD74 in DC—Because DC treated with CI expressed a higher level of CD74 proteins, we next made attempts to identify the classes of caspases that potentially utilized CD74 as a substrate. Primary DC were either untreated or treated with peptide-based caspase inhibitors: Z-VAD-FMK (for caspases-1, -3, -4, and -7), Z-WHED-FMK (for caspases-1, -4, -5, and -8), Z-YVAD-FMK (for caspases-1 and -4), or Ac-DEVD-CMK (for caspases-3, -6, -7, -8, and -10). All of the inhibitors except Ac-DEVD-CMK caused an increase in CD74 protein expression in DC. (Fig. 3A). To determine the specificity of these inhibitors, primary DC were incubated with various concentrations of either Z-WHED-FMK or Z-YVAD-FMK and then detected for the expression of CD74 proteins by Western blotting analysis. Although both inhibitors were able to inhibit CD74 degradation even at concentration as low as 0.1 μm, the inhibitory effect of Z-YVAD-FMK was relatively more specific than Z-WHED-FMK based on its ability to inhibit CD74 degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Because Z-YVAD-FMK and Z-WHED-FMK are strong inhibitors of both caspase-1 and caspase-4, it is highly possible that CD74 is a substrate for either caspase-1 and/or caspase-4. We identified a putative caspase recognition/cleavage site DQRD by screening the amino acid sequence of cytoplasmic domain of CD74 (Fig. 3C). First, we determined whether the DQRD motif was important for intracellular localization of CD74. Myc-CD74 (wild type) and Myc-(D-A)CD74 (Asp → Ala mutant) were expressed in DC2.4 and detected using specific antibody against c-Myc. Interestingly, changing the DQRD motif to the DQRA motif by point mutation did not cause mislocalization of CD74 in DC (Fig. 3D). To determine whether the DQRD motif is a caspase recognition and cleavage site, protein extracts derived from either untreated or CI-treated DC (expressing either Myc-CD74 or Myc-(D-A) CD74, respectively) were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against c-Myc and CD74. The degradation inhibitory effect of CI on Myc-CD74 was more drastic as compared with the effect on Myc-(D-A)CD74 (Fig. 3E, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). In addition, we consistently observed that the quantity of total Myc-(D-A)CD74 proteins was significantly higher as compared with the amount of Myc-CD74 proteins in the untreated DC. This strongly suggests that the DQRD motif is indeed a caspase cleavage site and that D-A mutation significantly enhances the stability of CD74 in DC. As expected, CI treatment increased the expression of endogenous CD74 detected by IN-1 mAb (Fig. 3E, lower panel). To further confirm that CD74 was a substrate for caspases and that the DQRD motif on the N terminus of CD74 was a caspase cleavage site, Myc-CD74 and Myc-(D-A)CD74 was expressed in DC2.4, immunoprecipitated using CD74-specific mAb (IN-1) and digested with recombinant caspase-1, and caspase-4 in vitro prior to detection using anti-Myc polyclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitated Myc-CD74 but not Myc-(D-A)CD74 was preferentially cleaved by caspase-4 (Fig. 3F, lane 3). On the other hand, Myc-CD74 was not cleaved by caspase-1 (Fig. 3F, lane 2). However, it is worth noting that a small amount of Myc-(D-A)CD74 was cleaved by caspase-1 (Fig. 3F, lane 2, lower panel). The reason for this is unclear, but there is a possibility that the D-A mutation on the DQRD motif might have created a site more receptive to caspase-1 activity. NOS2 Forms Complexes with CD74—Nitric oxide is a labile free radical gas that functions as a signaling and effector molecule in the control of a variety of cellular functions. Because of its potent reactivity and diffusibility, NO production by NOS2 is expected to be stringently controlled to ensure target specificity. One way to achieve target specificity is by forming stable NOS2 target protein complexes. NOS had been reported previously to form complexes with intracellular proteins (3Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 13Cao S. Yao J. McCabe T.J. Yao Q. Katusic Z.S. Sessa W.C. Shah V. J. Biol.

Interaction of NOS with specific heterologous proteins could be an effective mechanism to regulate functions of essential protein complexes. Based on our observation that CD74 is a substrate for caspases and NO could inhibit degradation of CD74 presumably via its ability to inhibit caspases activity, it is therefore interesting to determine whether NOS2, the key enzyme that catalyzes the production of NO in maturing DC, can form complexes with CD74. First, we determined whether CD74 co-localizes with NOS2 in maturing DC. LPS-induced DC were double-labeled with CD74 and NOS2-specific antibodies and analyzed by confocal microscopy. CD74 partially co-localized with NOS2 to the endosomal-like (Fig. 4A) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-like (Fig. 4, B and C) structures in mature DC. Next, we investigated whether both NOS2 and CD74 can form complexes with each other. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation studies using anti-NOS2 and anti-CD74 antibodies showed that NOS2 indeed formed complex with CD74 (Fig. 4D). In addition, the DQRD motif was shown to be essential for the NOS2-CD74 interaction based on the observation that wild type Myc-CD74 but not the mutant Myc-(D-A)CD74 interacted with NOS2 (Fig. 4E). Overexpression of CD74 Enhances MHC II, CD80, and CD86 Cell Surface Expression in Immature DC—The importance of CD74 in MHC II trafficking and antigen presentation had been reported previously (5Matza D. Kerem A. Shachar I. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 264-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because NO treatment increased the expression of total CD74 protein and several essential protein molecules of the endosomes and at the same time up-regulated cell surface expression of MHC II, CD80, and CD86 in primary DC, it is of great interest to determine whether overexpression of CD74 alone can cause an increase in expression of MHC II and the two essential co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on the surface of immature DC. Our results showed that overexpression of either wild type (Myc-CD74) or D-A mutant CD74 (Myc-(D-A)CD74) by mRNA electroporation enhanced cell surface expression MHC II, CD80, and CD86 in immature DC (Fig. 5). Enhanced CD74 expression alone can thus result in an increase of MHC II, CD80, and CD86 expression on the surface of immature DC. NO is a free radical gas molecule that intervenes in a large number of fundamental cellular processes such as vascular regulation, neurotransmission, and immunity (3Bogdan C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 4Maniscalco M. Sofia M. Pelaia G. Inflamm. Res. 2007; 56: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). NO reacts in water with oxygen and its reactive intermediates to yield (i) stable anions such as NO-2 and NO-3, (ii) unstable higher oxides such as N2O3, and (iii) unstable peroxides (ONOO-). We showed that NO can partially initiate DC maturation based on the fact that NONOate (a NO donor) treatment and overexpression of NOS2 and NOS3 have the ability to induce the expression of cell surface MHC II, CD80, and CD86, hallmarks of DC going through maturation. In addition, the MHC II-associated invariant chain CD74 was up-regulated in DC upon treatment with NONOate. CD74 is essential for proper MHC II folding (in the ER) and targeting of MHC II-CD74 complex to the endosomes (15Becker-Herman S. Arie G. Medvedovsky H. Kerem A. Shachar I. Mol. Biol.

In the endosomes, CD74 protein undergoes degradation via several stepwise proteolytic processes (executed by various specific proteases) and formed cleavage products, p31, p22, and p10 according to their molecular weight. The final cleavage product, CLIP (a product derived from the cleavage of p10), is a short peptide of 23 amino acids still"

Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Subspecies equi causes the serious horse respiratory disease called strangles. Subspecies zooepidemicus is considered as an opportunistic commensal, often occurring in the upper respiratory tract of horses. In subspecies zooepidemicus, two cell wall-anchored fibronectin (FN)-binding proteins have been identified, FNZ (4Lindmark H. Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. Guss B. Infect.

In subspecies equi the analogues of these proteins are denoted FNE (6Lindmark H. Nilsson M. Guss B. Infect.

We have previously shown that a recombinant protein representing the N-terminal half of FNZ, denoted FNZN, binds both FN and native collagen type I and in addition, stimulates collagen gel contraction (8Liden A.

Connective tissue cells participate actively in the fluid balance by controlling the IFP that is normally around zero but lowered during anaphylactic and inflammatory reactions (10Wiig H. Rubin K. Reed R.K. Acta Anaesthesiol. Scand. 2003; 47: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A reduction in IFP provides a driving force for edema formation during inflammation and burn injuries. Edema formation is one of the classical signs of inflammation induced by e.g. tissue reactions to invading bacteria. The pathophysiological relevance of edema formation is most likely to increase drainage from the tissue, as well as to facilitate for phagocytes and soluble antimicrobial proteins to reach the infectious foci. Data from our laboratories suggest that control of IFP and edema formation depends on integrins (10Wiig H. Rubin K. Reed R.K. Acta Anaesthesiol.

Because the recombinant FNZN stimulates collagen gel contraction and, especially, the fact that the homologous FNE is secreted we hypothesized that FNE could modulate edema formation in infected tissues. If so, it could function as a novel virulence factor during subspecies equi infection by rendering bacteria less accessible for the innate immune system.

C2C12 cells were stably transfected with either integrin α2or α11, therefore only expressing collagen-binding integrins α2β1 and α11β1, respectively (C2C12-α2 and C2C12-α11). Cells were propagated in DMEM with Glutamax (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) and 50 μg/ml Gentamicin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Reagents—Bovine dermal collagen type I (Purecol, 3 mg/ml) was from Inamed (Fremont, CA). Calf nasal collagen type II, rat skin collagen type III, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS)-sarcoma collagen type IV and collagen α1(I) cyanogen bromide (CB) peptides 3, 7 and 8, were produced as described previously (24Miller E.J.

Res. 1982; 27: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Recombinant platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) was purchased from Invitrogen. The anti-human FN polyclonal IgG has been described elsewhere (28Gullberg D. Tingström A. Thuresson A.C. Olsson L. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The specific integrin αVβ3 inhibitor cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val) was obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland) and the specific monoclonal antimurine β3 integrin antibody (HMβ3) was from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Recombinant S. equi Proteins—The proteins used in this study were recombinant forms of the S. equi subspecies equi and zooepidemicus proteins FNZ, FNE, FNEB, and SFS. FNZ is a cell surface-bound FN-binding protein expressed by subspecies zooepidemicus (4Lindmark H. Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3993-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the recombinant 34-kDa protein, FNZN, represents the N-terminal part of FNZ (6Lindmark H. Nilsson M. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3159-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 32-kDa protein FNE, the truncated FN-binding FNZ homologue found in subspecies equi and SFS, are special in this panel of proteins because they are secreted proteins (6Lindmark H. Nilsson M. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3159-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Lindmark H. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2383-2388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following primers were used to PCR-amplify the fne gene using genomic DNA from subspecies equi strain 1866 as template: FNE F2: 5′-CATGGCTAGCCTTTATTATGGGTGGAATGATGGA-3′, FNE R: 5′-CATGCCCGGGATCCTGGAAAGGATCTCGTTT-3′. The underlined nucleotide sequences of the primers hybridize to the fne gene, and the introduced restriction endonuclease cleavage sites are written in bold. The PCR products were digested with NheI and SmaI and ligated into the pTYB4-vector (New England Biolabs) previously digested with the same restriction endonucleases. After ligation, the plasmid was electroporated into Escherichia coli ER2566. FNEB is a cell surface-bound FN-binding protein of subspecies equi, and the characterization and production of the recombinant 40 kDa protein FNEB L, used in this study, was described in Ref. 7Lannergård J. Flock M. Johansson S. Flock J.I. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7243-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar. SFS is an extracellular FN-binding protein (29Lindmark H. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2383-2388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the recombinant 36-kDa protein, corresponding to the mature protein, used in this study is described in Ref. 7Lannergård J. Flock M. Johansson S. Flock J.I. Guss B. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7243-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar. All constructions and purifications of the recombinant proteins were performed using the IMPACT™ system (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). A schematic representation of the streptococcal proteins is given in Fig. 1. Microwell Assay for Determination of Protein Interactions—125I was obtained from GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden) and labeling of protein (collagen and FN) was performed using Iodo-Beads as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). Microwells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of FN or 10 μg of collagen diluted in 100 μl of 0.05 m NaHCO3. The wells were blocked with 200 μl of PBS supplemented with BSA (100 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C.100 μl 125I-labeled collagen or FN in the presence of BSA (100 μg/ml) was added to the wells together with different concentrations of FNE for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed two times with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and binding was measured using a γ-counter (Searle). As a control, the streptococcal protein SFS was used instead of FNE. To measure unspecific binding, wells were coated with 0.05 m NaHCO3 only, and the obtained cpm values were subtracted from the values of the tested ligands. For determining binding of FNE to different collagen types and to cyanogen bromide (CB) fragments 3, 7, and 8, microwells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of the collagens or CB fragments diluted in 100 μl of 0.05 m NaHCO3. For denaturing, collagens were heated at 55 °C for 20 min, and microwells were coated overnight at the same temperature. The wells were incubated with 200 μl of PBS supplemented with BSA (20 mg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Different concentrations of biotinylated FNE were added in the presence of BSA (100 μg/ml) and wells incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were further incubated with 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase streptavidin (1:500) (Vector, Burlingame, CA) to detect binding. Rotary Shadowing of the Procollagen I/FNZN Complex and Negative Staining of the Procollagen I/FNE Complex—For Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) involving rotary shadowing, procollagen I, isolated as described before (30Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and FNZN were dialysed against 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.9. Both binding partners were allowed to react for 3 min before they were mixed with an equal volume of 80% (v/v) glycerol and squeezed between two freshly cleaved mica pieces. Specimens were then dried for 2 h under high vacuum. Subsequently, they were decorated with 3-nm platinum/carbon at a low angle on a rotating table, followed by coating with 10-nm carbon at a 90° angle. Replicas were floated off on distilled water and picked up on 400 mesh copper grids. Finally, complexes were visualized in a Jeol JEM 1230 electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. For the negative staining a mixture of both protein solutions dissolved in TBS were allowed to react for about 1 min before 5-μl aliquots were adsorbed for 1 min on carbon-coated copper grids, which had been rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure beforehand. Adsorbed samples were washed twice with water and stained with 0.75% (w/v) uranyl formate. Specimens were visualized as described above. Cell Adhesion—24-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with human plasma FN (2 μg/ml), FNE (10 μg/ml), or collagen type I (50 μg/ml) in Buffer 3 consisting of (in mm): NaCl 140, KCl 4.7, MgSO4 0.65, CaCl2 1.2, HEPES 10, pH 7.4. Plates were washed three times with Buffer 3 and 200 μl of Buffer 3 were added per well. Cells were trypsinized and washed twice with ice-cold Buffer 3 and diluted to 500,000 cells/ml in the same buffer. 100,000 cells were allowed to adhere at 37 °C and when indicated, FNE was added together with the cells at a concentration of 500 nm. Non-adherent cells were removed, and the wells were washed gently two times with prewarmed Buffer 3. The number of adhered cells was quantified using a hexosaminidase assay, as described elsewhere (31Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-FNE to Cells—24-well plates were blocked in 2% BSA overnight at 37 °C. Cells were trypsinized and washed twice in cold PBS with BSA (1 mg/ml) and diluted to a final concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml in PBS with BSA. In each well, 100 μl of cells was mixed with 100 μl of 125I-labeled FNE (∼270,000 cpm and final concentration at 2 nm) without or with 100 μl human plasma FN to a final concentration of 5 or 110 nm. FNE was labeled with 125I as described above. The final volume was adjusted to 500 μl using PBS with BSA (1 mg/ml). Plates were incubated at 37 °C on a rocking table; the latter to prevent cell sedimentation. At indicated time points, the cell suspension was transferred to tubes containing a preformed 10% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 209 × g. Percoll was aspirated and pelleted viable cells were lysed in 1 m NaOH overnight at 4 °C. Radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter (COBRA auto-γ, Packard), and values represent the percentage of total radioactivity added. Collagen Gel Contraction—Collagen gel contraction was quantified as described elsewhere (28Gullberg D. Tingström A. Thuresson A.C. Olsson L. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were blocked in 2% BSA, and a collagen solution was prepared from double concentrated DMEM, HEPES, and collagen type I (Purecol). One part cell suspension (106 cells/ml) was mixed with 9 parts collagen solution. When indicated, bacterial proteins, FN, antibodies, and/or inhibitors were added to the cell-collagen solution. Cell-collagen gels (100 μl) were allowed to form, and the gels were detached by ejection of 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, with or without PDGF-BB, into the wells. The relaxed, free-floating gels were further incubated at 37 °C, and gel diameters were measured microscopically at indicated time points. The degree of contraction is presented as the gel area in percentage of the original area. Reverse Transcription and PCR—C2C12 and 4D cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and grown to ∼90% confluency. mRNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated with the Reverse Transcription System (Promega), and PCR fragments for FN and cyclophilin-B (CP-B) were generated with 30-cycle PCR using the following primers: FN forward, 5′-CCTGGTTCAAACTGCAGTGA-3′; FN reverse, 5′-ACCCGGTAGCCAGTGAGCTG-3′; and CP-B forward, 5′-GGAGATGAATCTGTAGGACGAGTC-3′; CP-B reverse, 5′-CGTACCACATCCATGCCCTCT-3′. Samples were run on a 1% agarose gel, and DNA fragments were visualized with UV light. Metabolic Labeling with [35S]Cysteine/Methionine to Detect FN Synthesis—24-well plates were blocked in 2% BSA overnight at 37 °C. Collagen gels were made as described above, but with a total gel volume of 500 μl and a total of 100,000 cells. 35S-Redivue Promix (GE Healthcare) was added to the cell-collagen suspension (1:100), and gels were allowed to form for 1.5 h. Gels were detached with EMEM (supplemented with 2 μm methionine and 45 mm HEPES) containing 35S-Redivue Promix (1:100) and where indicated, PDGF-BB was added at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. Gels were incubated at 37 °C for 2 and 4 h. Collagen gels were centrifuged at 1877 × g for 10 min and subsequently heated to 55 °C for 15 min. Collagen/cell suspensions were lysed in a final concentration of 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of (in mm): Tris/HCl 50, NaCl 150, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.0. Supernatants were cleared with preimmune rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 1.5 h at 37 °C, and cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-human FN antibody for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide SDS-gel, and the gel was fixed for 30 min in fixing buffer (25% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid, 65% H2O). Then the gel was drenched in Amplify (GE Healthcare) for 15 min and dried on a gel dryer before it was exposed to x-ray film (Fujifilm Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Knockdown of FN with siRNA—C2C12 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 90,000 cells per well and grown for 24 h in antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were transfected with a final concentration of 20 nm siRNA (Sigma-Proligo) directed against murine FN mRNA (Pubmed accession number: NM_010233) or control (scrambled) siRNA that has no binding interaction with any known mRNA. Transfection agent was N-TER™ Nanoparticles (Sigma) that was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested at 24–48 h, and FN protein levels were assessed by immunoprecipitating 35S-labeled FN as described above. Transfected cells were used in collagen gel contraction assays. In Vivo Measurement of Interstitial Fluid Pressure (IFP)—Male and female BALB/c mice were used. Mice were fed ad libitum before experiments and anesthetized by a s.c. injection of Ketamin (Ketalar, Pfizer, New York, NY; 12.2 mg/ml) combined with Medetomidin (Domitor, Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland; 24.3 μg/ml) (0.1 ml/10 g body weight). The mice were catheterized in the external jugular vein for i.v. injections. Circulatory arrest was induced by an i.v. injection of saturated KCl. Experiments were performed with the approval of and in accordance with the recommendations laid down by the Norwegian State Commission for Laboratory Animals. IFP was measured using sharpened glass capillaries (tip diameter 3–5 μm) filled with 0.3 m NaCl colored with Evans Blue and connected to a servo-controlled counter pressure system. The punctures were performed through intact skin using a stereomicroscope (Wild M5, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). Care was taken not to cause any compression or retraction of the skin while puncturing. The animal was placed in a supine position and the left hind paw was carefully fixed to the table with surgical tape. Control IFP was measured with the circulation still intact. 200 μg C48/80 (Sigma) in 0.1 ml 0.9% NaCl was injected i.v. and allowed to circulate for 2 min before circulatory arrest was induced. C48/80 causes a lowering of the IFP through degranulation of mast cells. Circulatory arrest was induced to prevent a potential underestimation of the lowered IFP due to an increase in interstitial fluid volume as a result of increased transcapillary fluid flux. The lowering of the IFP was monitored for 30 min and 1 μl FNE (∼40 μm) or control vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was injected subdermally using a 10-μl chromatography syringe (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland) with a 33-gauge needle. Measurements were continued for another 60 min. The pressure measurements were averaged in the following periods: 0–10, 11–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60, and 61–90 min after C48/80 injection. For a measurement to be accepted, the following criteria had to be fulfilled: (1) feedback gain could be changed without changing the pressure; (2) applying suction to the pipette by the pump increased the resistance in the pipette. This ensured contact between the pipette and the interstitial fluid, i.e. the pipette was open; and (3) zero pressure did not change during the measurement. Statistical Analyses—For collagen gel contractions, adhesion assays, solid phase assays, FN-production, and binding of 125I-labeled FNE to cells, statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test, and data are mean ± S.E. For the in vivo experiments, all data are mean ± S.E.; each experimental group was compared for control and 21–30 min and 61–90 min using one-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni-corrected t-tests. For all experiments p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. FNE Bound to Collagens and Stimulated the Interaction between Native Collagen Type I and FN—FNE bound with equal affinity to native collagen types I and II, less effectively to collagen type III and not at all to collagen type IV (Fig. 2A). FNE did not bind heat-denatured collagens or CB fragments (data not shown). Furthermore, binding of FNE was not affected by additions of EDTA, Ca2+, or Mg2+ at concentrations up to 10 mm, or by a 20-min pretreatment with 20 mm NaIO4 to remove carbohydrate residues from the collagen substrate (data not shown). Adhesion to collagen type I by cells expressing only either α2β1 or α11β1 as collagen-binding integrins was not affected by addition of 500 nm FNE (Fig. 2B). Rotary shadowing experiments demonstrated that the FNE homologue FNZN binds to a single distinct binding site of the procollagen type I monomer (Fig. 2C). The inset in Fig. 2C shows the appearance of FNZN in the absence of procollagen. Negative staining showed that also FNE binds to a single distinct binding site of the procollagen molecule (Fig. 2D). Measurements on the location of the FNZN/FNE binding site on procollagen revealed it to be situated at 122 ± 6 nm (mean ± S.D.) from the C terminus (Fig. 2E). FN binds to denatured collagen type I with high affinity whereas binding to native collagen type I has a several orders of magnitude lower affinity (32Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Miller E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 147: 1584-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Because FNE binds FN and, in addition, bound to procollagen we investigated whether FNE could increase binding of soluble FN to immobilized native collagen type I and, conversely if FNE increased binding of soluble collagen type I to immobilized FN. Binding of 125I-labeled FN to immobilized native collagen type I was negligible in the absence of FNE but increased with increasing concentrations of FNE up to around 50 nm whereafter binding declined (Fig. 3A). 125I-labeled native collagen type I bound to immobilized FN in the presence of added FNE, again with a bell-shaped concentration curve showing maximal binding at around 5 nm of FNE (Fig. 3B). The secreted streptococcal FN-binding protein SFS had no significant effect on the interaction between collagen and FN (data not shown). Scatchard plot analyses of solid-phase binding assays with 125I-labeled FNE to immobilized FN and collagen showed Kd values of ∼20 and ∼50 nm, respectively. Bound 125I-labeled FNE was displaced by a 100 times molar excess unlabeled FNE, validating the obtained Kd values (data not shown). Our results show that FNE stimulated the interaction between native collagen type I and FN in a saturable fashion. A plausible mechanism fo"
https://openalex.org/W2155998425,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is extensively applied in gene cloning. But due to the existence of introns, low copy number of particular genes and high complexity of the eukaryotic genome, it is usually impossible to amplify and clone a gene as a full-length sequence directly from the genome by ordinary PCR based techniques. Cloning of cDNA instead of genomic DNA involves multiple steps: harvest of tissues that express the gene of interest, RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis (reverse transcription), and PCR amplification. To simplify the cloning procedures and avoid the problems caused by ubiquitously distributed durable RNases, we have developed a novel strategy allowing the cloning of any cDNA or open reading frame (ORF) with wild type sequence in any spliced form from a single genomic DNA preparation.Our ""Genomic DNA Splicing"" technique contains the following steps: first, all exons of the gene are amplified from a genomic DNA preparation, using software-optimized, highly efficient primers residing in flanking introns. Next, the tissue-specific exon sequences are assembled into one full-length sequence by overlapping PCR with deliberately designed primers located at the splicing sites. Finally, software-optimized outmost primers are exploited for efficient amplification of the assembled full-length products.The ""Genomic DNA Splicing"" protocol avoids RNA preparation and reverse transcription steps, and the entire assembly process can be finished within hours. Since genomic DNA is more stable than RNA, it may be a more practical cloning strategy for many genes, especially the ones that are very large and difficult to generate a full length cDNA using oligo-dT primed reverse transcription. With this technique, we successfully cloned the full-length wild type coding sequence of human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, which is 2295 bp in length and composed of 10 exons."
https://openalex.org/W2082205106,"Thioredoxin exported into the Escherichia coli periplasm catalyzes the oxidation of protein thiols in a DsbB-dependent function. However, the oxidative activity of periplasmic thioredoxin is insufficient to render dsbA– cells susceptible to infection by M13, a phenotype that is critically dependent on disulfide bond formation in the cell envelope. We sought to examine the molecular determinants that are required in order to convert thioredoxin from a reductant into an efficient periplasmic oxidant. A genetic screen for mutations in thioredoxin that render dsbA– cells sensitive to infection by M13 led to the isolation of a single amino acid substitution, G74S. In vivo the TrxA(G74S) mutant exhibited enhanced catalytic activity in the oxidation of alkaline phosphatase but was unable to oxidize FlgI and restore cell motility. In vitro studies revealed that the G74S substitution does not affect the redox potential of the thioredoxin-active site or its kinetics of oxidation by DsbB. Thus, the gain of function afforded by G74S stems in part from its altered substrate specificity, which also rendered the protein more resistant to reduction by DsbD/DsbC in the periplasm. Thioredoxin exported into the Escherichia coli periplasm catalyzes the oxidation of protein thiols in a DsbB-dependent function.

Thus, the gain of function afforded by G74S stems in part from its altered substrate specificity, which also rendered the protein more resistant to reduction by DsbD/DsbC in the periplasm. Cells have evolved elaborate mechanisms for the spatial and temporal control of disulfide bond formation in proteins. Normally, protein oxidation occurs in exocytoplasmic compartments (the endoplasmic reticulum or the bacterial periplasm), whereas in the cytoplasm disulfide bond formation is strongly disfavored (1Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 2Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Thiol oxidation, disulfide reduction, and isomerization are all accomplished by the action of multiple thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases. In the course of these reactions, the enzyme transfers electrons to or from substrate proteins and becomes oxidized or reduced in the process. To complete the catalytic cycle, the proper redox state of the thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase has to be restored by specialized enzymes that transfer electrons from non-thiol redox couples (such as NAD: NADH) or to the respiratory chain. For example, in the bacterial periplasmic space, disulfide bond formation is catalyzed by the highly efficient protein thiol oxidase DsbA (3Messens J. Collet J.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1050-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Upon transferring its disulfide to a substrate protein, DsbA becomes reduced and has to be recycled by the action of the membrane enzyme DsbB, which then transfers the electrons to the quinones. Similarly, in the cytoplasm, disulfide bond reduction is catalyzed by thioredoxin that is recycled by thioredoxin reductase (the product of the trxB gene), which in turn uses NADPH as electron donor (1Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Interestingly, thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases with broad substrate specificity, such as DsbA, DsbC, thioredoxin, and glutaredoxin, all employ catalytic domains that belong to the thioredoxin superfamily. In contrast, the enzymes that recycle the general thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases (respectively DsbB, DsbD, thioredoxin reductase, and glutaredoxin reductase) are more structurally diverse. Although DsbA and thioredoxin (TrxA) display a high degree of structural homology, in the cell they catalyze opposite reactions, namely thiol oxidation and disulfide reduction, respectively. At least two features have been shown to be responsible for the distinctly different functions of the two enzymes. First, the active site of DsbA is much more oxidizing than that of TrxA (4Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The redox state of these and other thioredoxin superfamily enzymes is critically dependent on the identity of the dipeptide sequence within the conserved Cys-X-X-Cys active site (5Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Substitution of the PH sequence found in DsbA active site in thioredoxin, TrxA(G33P,P34H), imparts a more oxidizing redox potential E′0 = –204 mV. By comparison, wild-type TrxA, which has a GP sequence in the active site, has an E′0 = –270 mV (6Mossner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Second, in the periplasm DsbA is maintained in an oxidized state by DsbB, whereas in the cytoplasm TrxA is kept reduced by TrxB. Upon export of TrxA into the periplasm following fusion to an appropriate bacterial signal peptide, it becomes oxidized by DsbB and in turn serves as a general protein oxidant. Consequently, it can partially complement dsbA– strains, allowing, for example, the formation of small levels of active alkaline phosphatase (7Jonda S. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Mossner E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3271-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Debarbieux L. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The ability of periplasmic TrxA to catalyze the oxidative folding of alkaline phosphatase and restore motility is improved by replacing its active site dipeptide with that of DsbA, TrxA(G33P,P34H) (7Jonda S. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Mossner E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3271-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Debarbieux L. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, as shown in this study, TrxA(G33P,P34H) is still unable to catalyze the folding of Escherichia coli cell envelope proteins required for infection by filamentous bacteriophages. In this study, we sought to identify additional features in thioredoxin that enhance its ability to function as a periplasmic oxidant. We asked what are the molecular features that are important for converting thioredoxin, the prototypical member of the thioredoxin superfamily from an efficient reductant into an oxidant that can fully replace the native periplasmic catalyst of disulfide bond formation, DsbA. To address this question we first developed a novel genetic approach for isolating mutants of thioredoxin that exhibit improved ability to complement certain phenotypes observed in dsbA– cells. Specifically, we identified a single amino acid substitution that appears to improve the ability of thioredoxin to serve as a periplasmic oxidant via a subtle alteration in its specificity but with no change in its redox potential. Such change in specificity results in the prevention of non-productive reduction of thioredoxin by the DsbC-DsbD pathway in addition to an altered reactivity with substrate proteins that receive the disulfide bonds. Strikingly, this amino acid substitution is present in the wild-type sequences of a wide variety of prokaryotic thioredoxins. Strains and Plasmids—The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. LM strains were constructed by P1 transduction following standard protocols (9Miller J.H.

All other TrxA variants, TrxA(G74S), TrxA(G33P,P34H), and TrxA(G33P,P34H,G74S), were PCR-amplified from the corresponding pTrc99a-ssTorA plasmids with primers Sal1-TrxA-F and R-trxA-Hind3, digested with SalI and HindIII, and finally ligated into SalI- and HindIII-digested pTrc99a-ssDsbA-TrxA resulting in the constructs pTrc99a-ssDsbA-TrxA(G74S), pTrc99a-ssDdsbA-TrxA(G33P,P34H), and pTrc99a-ssDsbA-TrxA(G33P,P34H,G74S). pET28a-TrxA(G74S) was constructed as follows.

TrxA Library Construction—Randomization of the trxA gene was performed by error-prone PCR (13Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) with primers Sal1-TrxA-F and R-trxA-Hind3, then digested with SalI and HindIII, and finally ligated into SalI- and HindIII-digested pTrc99a-ssTorA-TrxA. Ligated plasmid DNA was first electroporated into E. coli Jude-1 resulting in a library size of 2 × 106 clones. This library was then was transferred by electroporation into LM106 resulting in 2 × 106 transformants. Minimal Media—MOPS low phosphate minimal medium was prepared as follows: MOPS minimal media (11Sambrook J.C. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) with 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 0.2% (w/v) casein enzymatic hydrolysate (C0626, Sigma), 0.05 mg/ml thiamine, and a total concentration of inorganic phosphates of 0.1 mm. M9 minimal medium was prepared as follows: 1× M9 minimal salts (M6030, Sigma), 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 0.1% (w/v) casein enzymatic hydrolysate (C0626, Sigma), 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.05 mg/ml thiamine. M13 Phagemid Packaging—A single colony of MC1000 F′ cells harboring the plasmid pBAD18-CmR, which contains the M13 intragenic region, was inoculated in 6 ml of 2× YT media (244020; BD Biosciences) with tetracycline (30 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking. At an A600 of 0.4–0.5, 1.0 ml of cells were infected with M13 KO7 (11Sambrook J.C. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 20 and incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then transferred to a flask containing 40 ml of 2× YT with 0.2% (w/v) glucose with the antibiotics tetracycline (30 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C with shaking. After 1 h, kanamycin (25 μg/ml) was added, and cells were grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The overnight culture was centrifuged for 30 min at 3500 rpm and at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected (∼40 ml), and 8 ml of 20% (w/v) PEG-6000 with 2.5 m NaCl were added and then the mixture was kept on ice for 2 h and centrifuged again for 30 min at 3500 rpm and at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the packaged M13 phagemid pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4 °C. M13 Infectivity Assay—Cells were inoculated into 5.5 ml of fresh MOPS low phosphate minimal media and grown for ∼14.5 h at 37 °C with shaking. Cell culture A600 was adjusted to 1.0, and 1000 μl were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and mixed with 5 μl of pBAD18-CmR packaged M13 phagemid (titer of ≈3 × 109 colony-forming units/ml). The tubes were incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min and then transferred to a 37 °C incubator with shaking for 1 h. Cells were plated in LB-Miller plates with chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) with the corresponding serial dilutions so there would be ∼100 single colonies per plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the number of single colonies was then determined. M13 Infectivity Library Screening—75 μl of MC1000 F′ dsbA pTrc99a-ssTorA-TrxA EPPCR library frozen stock (∼4 × 109 cells) was inoculated in a flask with 400 ml of fresh MOPS low phosphate minimal media. Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking for 7.5 h (final A600 = 1.23) and then normalized to A600 = 1.0, and 1.0 ml was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and infected with 20 μl of pBAD18-CmR packaged M13 phagemid (titer of ≈3 × 109 colony-forming units /ml). The tube was incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min and then transferred to a 37 °C incubator with shaking for 1 h. All cells were plated in four 150 × 15-mm LB-Miller plates with chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown at 37 °C overnight. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity Assay—Cells were grown in MOPS low phosphate minimal media. The low phosphate concentration induces the synthesis of alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) from the chromosomal copy of the alkaline phosphatase gene (phoA). Cells were inoculated into 5.5 ml of fresh media and grown for ∼14.5 h at 37 °C with shaking. Cell culture A600 was adjusted to 1.0, and 20 μl were transferred to a 96-well plate and mixed with 30 μl of lysis buffer, a 2:1 mixture of B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (78248 Pierce), and a 0.4 m iodoacetamide solution. Lysis took place for 30 min with shaking and then 200 μl of 250 μg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, was added to each well. Hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was followed at A405 on a plate reader (Beckman Instruments). Cell Motility Assay—Cells were grown overnight in M9 minimal media with the appropriate antibiotic at 37 °C with shaking. The amount of cells was normalized to a final A600 of 1.0, and 1.5 μl were spotted at the center of M9 minimal media motility plates (M9 minimal media with 0.3% (w/v) agar). Cells were grown at 37 °C for 29 h at which point the motility halos were determined. Purification of TrxA(G74S)—BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) cells harboring the pET28a-TrxA(G74S) plasmid were grown in 2 liters of LB-Miller medium with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 30 °C until an A600 of 0.7–0.8 was reached. Isopropyl β-thiogalactoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and shaking was continued for 5 h. Cultures were then centrifuged at 8000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min (JA-10 rotor, Beckman Instruments). Cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in 35 ml of BugBuster protein extraction reagent (70584-4, Novagen) with 35 μl of Benzoase (25 units/μl) (Novagen) and 1 tablet of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (11-873-580-001, Roche Applied Science). Bacterial extracts were then centrifuged for 40 min at 16,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was incubated at 60 °C for 10 min in a water bath, then cooled down to 4 °C on ice, and finally centrifuged for 40 min at 16,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, filtered with a 0.22-μm filter (GeneMate, ISC BioExpress), and concentrated to a final total protein concentration of 20 mg/ml as determined with BCA protein assay kit (523225, Pierce). 2 ml of this solution was loaded into a HiPrep 16/10 DEAE FF ion exchange column (17-5090-01, Amersham Biosciences), and the presence of TrxA(G74S) in the eluate was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The buffer of the collected fractions (≈21 ml) was exchanged to 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and the solution was concentrated to a final volume of 1.5 ml. 0.75 ml of this solution was loaded into a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (17-1088-01, Amersham Biosciences). The buffer of the collected fractions that contained TrxA(G74S) (≈3 ml) was exchanged to 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and the solution was concentrated to a final volume of 0.25 ml with a final protein concentration of 39 mg/ml. The purity of the preparation was examined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and was found to be >99%. Determination of Protein Concentrations—Protein concentrations for the in vitro assays were determined using their extinction coefficients at 280 nm and were calculated as described (14Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar). Absorbance at 280 nm for the corresponding proteins was measured in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. Kinetics of Oxidation by DsbB in Vitro—Stopped flow absorbance measurements were performed on a Hi-Tech Scientific SF61 instrument (1.0-cm path length) in single-mixing mode. The typical reaction contained around 100 μm of thioredoxin variants, 10 μm DsbB, and 200 μm ubiquinone-1 (coenzyme Q1; Sigma). Thioredoxin variants and a DsbB/Q1 mix were incubated in PND buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 0.04% dodecyl maltoside, pH 8.0) at 10 °C before mixing. Thioredoxin variants were freshly reduced as described above. The fractions of reduced protein were determined by Ellman's assay, and the values were more than 95%. The absorbance after mixing was recorded at 510 nm. One data set contained three to four successive shots, and data for each trace was simulated separately using Program A (developed by Chung-Yen Chiu, Rong Chang, and Joel Dinverno under the direction of David P. Ballou, University of Michigan (15Grzyska P.K. Ryle M.J. Monterosso G.R. Liu J. Ballou D.P. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3845-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) based on the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear fit algorithm. The resulting data were further fit by SigmaPlot using the Michaelis-Menten equation to give the value of Km and Vmax. Kinetics of Hirudin Oxidation in Vitro—Stopped flow fluorescence measurements were performed on a KinTek SF-2004 instrument in single-mixing mode. The typical reaction contains 0.5 μm of oxidized TrxA and 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 μm reduced hirudin, respectively. The oxidized proteins and reduced hirudin were incubated in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, at 25 °C before mixing. An excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a bandpass filter were used to monitor the fluorescence change of the proteins. Each stopped flow trace was fit to a single exponential according to the following equation: F = Fo + ΔF(1 – e–kobst), where F is the fluorescence emission at known times; Fo is the fluorescence emission of completely oxidized protein, and ΔF is the difference between the fluorescence emission of completely reduced and oxidized protein. kobs is the pseudo first-order rate constant. Different kobs values are plotted against hirudin concentrations. The slope is the observed second-order rate constant of the reaction. Kinetics of Hirudin Isomerization in Vitro—21 μm scrambled hirudin and 21 μm freshly reduced protein (wild-type TrxA and TrxA(G74S)) were incubated in the isomerization buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm sodium chloride, 0.13% polyethylene glycol 8000) at 25 °C. Aliquots of 120 μl were removed after different reaction times and quenched with 15 μl of formic acid and 15 μl of acetonitrile. Hirudin folding intermediates were separated by reverse-phase HPLC 4The abbreviations used are:HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographym.o.i.multiplicity of infectionTattwin arginine transporterMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. on a C18 column at 55 °C in a 19–25% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid.

Distribution of Gly74 and Ser74 among Bacterial Thioredoxins—Protein BLAST from NCBI was used to identify which amino acids are present at the –2 position with respect to the highly conserved Pro76 of thioredoxin cis-Pro loop. Specifically, the nonredundant data base was searched with the E. coli K12 TrxA protein sequence (GenBank™ accession number AAC76786) using the PSI-BLAST algorithm with a threshold of 0.005 and four rounds of iterations. The first 500 Blast hits with the exception of three-dimensional structures from the Protein Data Bank were used to determine the corresponding amino acids at the –2 position with respect to Pro76 of thioredoxin cis-Pro loop. Taxonomy of the different species was obtained from the NCBI Taxonomy web page. See the Supplemental Material for a detailed list of the results of this search. A Screen for Periplasmic Protein Oxidation Using M13 Infectivity—One of the phenotypes of dsbA– mutant strains is resistance to the single-stranded filamentous phage M13 (16Bardwell J.C.A. Mcgovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Infection of E. coli by M13 is initiated by the binding of the pIII protein of the phage onto the conjugative sex pili encoded by the F factor (17Karlsson F. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Nilsson N. Malmborg-Hager A.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2628-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The F pili are extracellular protein structures that participate in bacterial conjugation (18Firth N. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham III, J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M.M.S. Umbarger H.E. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2377-2401Google Scholar). dsbA– null mutant strains seem to be resistant to M13 infection due to their inability to properly assemble the F pilus (16Bardwell J.C.A. Mcgovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the dependence of M13 infection on disulfide bond formation in the host cell to develop an efficient screen for protein oxidation in the periplasm. Briefly, E. coli is infected with filamentous phage that packages the phagemid pBAD18-CmR, a plasmid containing a filamentous phage packaging sequence as well as a chloramphenicol resistance gene cassette (19Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3959) Google Scholar). Upon infection by M13, F+ cells receive the CmR gene cassette and are able to form colonies on antibiotic-containing plates. As expected, infection of dsbA– mutant cells resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of chloramphenicol-resistant colonies because they lack functional F pili and are therefore resistant to infection by the M13 phagemid (Table 2). In addition, no colonies could be obtained in a dsbA–dsbB– background where periplasmic protein oxidation is completely abolished.TABLE 2M13 infectivity titersStrainPlasmidPhage titeraAverage values are ± S.E.; cfu indicates colony-forming units.cfu/mlWild typebThis is MC1000 F′.1 × 107 ± 3 × 106dsbA10 ± 10dsbA dsbB0dsbApTrc99a-ssTorA-TrxA10 ± 5dsbApTrc99a-ssTorA-TrxA(G33P,P34H)0dsbApTrc99a-ssTorA-TrxA(G74S)4 × 103 ± 1 × 103dsbApTrc99a-ssTorA-TrxA(G33P,P34H,G74S)2 × 104 ± 4 × 103a Average values are ± S.E.; cfu indicates colony-forming units.b This is MC1000 F′. Open table in a new tab In earlier studies it had been observed that post-translational export of TrxA using the PhoA signal sequence is inefficient because the rapid folding of thioredoxin in the cytoplasm interferes with its translocation through the Sec pore (20Schierle C.F. Berkmen M. Huber D. Kumamoto C. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5706-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, thioredoxin can be exported with high efficiency by using a signal peptide that engages the co-translational SRP-dependent pathway (20Schierle C.F. Berkmen M. Huber D. Kumamoto C.

https://openalex.org/W2079755003,"The substantial differences between trypanosomal and leishmanial DNA topoisomerase IB concerning to their homologues in mammals have provided a new lead in the study of the structural determinants that can be effectively targeted. Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, contains an unusual heterodimeric DNA topoisomerase IB. The catalytically active enzyme consists of a large subunit (LdTopIL), which contains the non-conserved N-terminal end and the phylogenetically conserved “core” domain, and of a small subunit (LdTopIS) which harbors the C-terminal region with the characteristic tyrosine residue in the active site. Heterologous co-expression of LdTopIL and LdTopIS genes in a topoisomerase I deficient yeast strain, reconstitutes a fully functional enzyme LdTopIL/S which can be used for structural studies. An approach by combinatorial cloning of deleted genes encoding for truncated versions of both subunits was used in order to find out structural insights involved in enzyme activity or protein-protein interaction. The role played by the non-conserved N-terminal extension of LdTopIL in both relaxation activity and CPT sensitivity has been examined co-expressing the full-length LdTopIS and a fully active LdTopIΔS deletion with several deletions of LdTopIL lacking growing sequences of the N-terminal end. The sequential deletion study shows that the first 26 amino acids placed at the N-terminal end and a variable region comprised between Ala548 to end of the C-terminal extension of LdTopIL were enzymatically dispensable. Altogether this combinatorial approach provides important structural insights of the regions involved in relaxation activity and for understanding the atypical structure of this heterodimeric enzyme."
