PZQ causes Ca2+ influx and spastic paralysis of adult worms and rapid vacuolization of the worm surface. However, the mechanism of action of PZQ remains unknown even after 40 years of clinical use. Here, we demonstrate that PZQ activates a schistosome transient receptor potential (TRP) channel, christened Sm.TRPMPZQ, present in parasitic schistosomes and other PZQ-sensitive parasites. Several properties of Sm.TRPMPZQ were consistent with known effects of PZQ on schistosomes, including (i) nanomolar sensitivity to PZQ; (ii) stereoselectivity toward (R)-PZQ; (iii) mediation of sustained Ca2+ signals in response to PZQ; and (iv) a pharmacological profile that mirrors the well-known effects of PZQ on muscle contraction and tegumental disruption. We anticipate that these findings will spur development of novel therapeutic interventions to manage schistosome infections and broader interest in PZQ, which is finally unmasked as a potent flatworm TRP channel activator.

Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a parasitic worm infection that infects millions of people worldwide (1Hotez P.J. Fenwick A.

Mature blood flukes living in the vasculature lay eggs, which become deposited in host tissues, where they trigger local inflammatory responses. Chronic infections become associated with fibrosis and obstructive disease in gastrointestinal tissues and liver (Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japonicum), genitourinary disease (Schistosoma haematobium), anemia, undernutrition, and a heightened risk for other comorbidities (3Yegorov S.

In 2017, ∼100 million people (∼80 million school-aged children) received free preventive treatment for schistosomiasis. This treatment depends on a drug called praziquantel (PZQ), 2The abbreviations used are: PZQpraziquantelTRPtransient receptor potentialAITCallyl isothiocyanateTRPMTRP melastatinTMtransmembraneADPRADP-riboseHEKhuman embryonic kidneyHBSSHanks' balanced salt solution. as no effective vaccine currently exists (4Bergquist R.

The clinical formulation of PZQ is a racemate (±PZQ) composed of the enantiomers (R)-PZQ and (S)-PZQ. (R)-PZQ is the antischistosomal eutomer, known to cause Ca2+ influx and spastic paralysis of adult worms and rapid vacuolization of the worm tegumental surface (5Andrews P. Thomas H. Pohlke R.

From a therapeutic perspective, it is problematic that despite decades of clinical usage, as well as demonstration of strains with lower sensitivity to PZQ in both laboratory and field, the flatworm target(s) of PZQ remains unknown (7Greenberg R.M.

Here, we demonstrate that (R)-PZQ activates a Ca2+-permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) channel expressed in PZQ-sensitive flatworms. The addition of (R)-PZQ (100 nm) to adult schistosome worms ex vivo caused a rapid, spastic paralysis (Fig. 1A). The addition of the same concentration of (S)-PZQ was ineffective at causing contraction (Fig. 1A). This demonstrates the differential potency of the two PZQ enantiomers against adult schistosome worms (EC50 for (R)-PZQ = 68 ± 7 nm, EC50 for (S)-PZQ = 1.1 ± 0.4 μm; Fig. 1B) observed both ex vivo and in vivo (6Kovač J.

Although no binding site(s) for these enantiomers has been identified in parasitic flatworms, there has been considerable recent progress in identifying targets for (R)-PZQ and (S)-PZQ in the human host (9Day T.A.

Following this logic, we searched for flatworm TRP channels exhibiting sequence homology to hTRPM8. One candidate, christened Sm.TRPMPZQ, mediated robust Ca2+ signals in response to ±PZQ and (R)-PZQ in transfected HEK293 cells that were not observed in either untransfected or vehicle-treated cells expressing Sm.TRPMPZQ (Fig. 2A). (S)-PZQ also evoked a response in Sm.TRPMPZQ-expressing cells, but with slower kinetics suggestive of a stereoselectivity toward the PZQ enantiomers that would be poorly discriminated at the high concentration of the primary screening (50 μm; Fig. 2A). Established mammalian TRP ligands (menthol, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), icilin, and capsaicin) did not activate Sm.TRPMPZQ (Fig. 2A). The PZQ-evoked Ca2+ signal depended on Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, as removal of extracellular Ca2+ abolished the sustained cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation (Fig. 2B). Full concentration–response curves were performed with (R)-PZQ (Fig. 2, C and D), (S)-PZQ, and ±PZQ (Fig. 2D). Sm.TRPMPZQ was activated by ±PZQ (EC50 = 1.08 ± 0.14 μm; Fig. 2D), and activation was stereoselective, with (R)-PZQ evoking Ca2+ signals over a considerably lower concentration range (EC50 = 597 ± 10 nm) than (S)-PZQ (EC50 = 27.9 ± 3.1 μm; Fig. 2D). When the incubation temperature was increased to 37 °C, (R)-PZQ activated Sm.TRPMPZQ over an even lower concentration range (EC50 = 154 ± 33 nm; Fig. 2D). Early work on schistosomes established key pharmacological characteristics of PZQ action on parasite muscle contraction and/or 45Ca2+ uptake. These include (i) conversion of contraction from sustained to phasic in the presence of elevated Mg2+, (ii) inhibition by La3+, and (iii) insensitivity to several voltage-operated Ca2+ channel (Cav) blockers at specific doses. We therefore examined the impact of these same manipulations on Sm.TRPMPZQ activity. First, increasing the Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio to a level (75:1) that resulted in transient muscle contraction (15Blair K.L. Bennett J.L. Pax R.A. Praziquantel: physiological evidence for its site(s) of action in magnesium-paralysed Schistosoma mansoni.Parasitology. 1992; 104 (1614741): 59-6610.1017/S0031182000060807Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Pax R.

Second, preincubation of worms with La3+ (10 mm) inhibited both PZQ-evoked 45Ca2+ accumulation and PZQ-evoked contraction (17Fetterer R.H. Pax R.A. Bennett J.L. Praziquantel, potassium and 2,4-dinitrophenol: analysis of their action on the musculature of Schistosoma mansoni.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1980; 64 (7449814): 31-3810.1016/0014-2999(80)90366-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). La3+ (10 mm) also inhibited Sm.TRPMPZQ activity (Fig. 2F). Third, three Cav blockers (methoxyverapamil, nifedipine, and nicardipine) that failed to block PZQ action on worms (17Fetterer R.H. Pax R.A. Bennett J.L.

Therefore, the pharmacological properties of Sm.TRPMPZQ mirror the characteristics of PZQ action on schistosome muscle. Consistent with the homology-based search strategy, Sm.TRPMPZQ is a member of the TRP melastatin (TRPM) subfamily. Sequence analysis revealed an architecture characteristic of TRPM channels (Fig. 2G), a well-represented family within flatworm genomes (19Bais S. Greenberg R.M. TRP channels in schistosomes.Int. J. Parasitol. Drugs Drug Resist. 2016; 6 (27496302): 335-34210.1016/j.ijpddr.2016.07.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Features include a long N-terminal TRPM homology region (MHR) domain, followed by six predicted transmembrane (TM) domains with a pore-forming re-entry loop between TM5 and TM6, a conserved TRP helix juxtaposed to coiled-coil regions, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal enzymatic domain (Fig. 2G). This enzyme domain displayed homology with the human ADP-ribose (ADPR) pyrophosphatase NUDT9, a feature characteristic of TRPM2 channels (20Wang L. Fu T.M. Zhou Y. Xia S. Greka A. Wu H.

TRPM2 and TRPM8 are closely related “long” TRPM channels, and Sm.TRPMPZQ displays the highest sequence identity with these human TRPM variants (29.5 and 28.5% sequence identity with hTRPM2 and hTRPM8, respectively). Analysis of flatworm genomic and transcriptomic data sets revealed the presence of Sm.TRPMPZQ homologs in other parasitic flatworms, including cestodes and flukes, known to exhibit PZQ sensitivity (Fig. S1A). To assess the broader PZQ sensitivity of schistosome TRP channels, we screened three other TRPs. First, we examined the previously characterized Sm.TRPA, which has been shown to activated by the ligands AITC and capsaicin (14Bais S. Berry C.T. Liu X. Ruthel G. Freedman B.D. Greenberg R.M. Atypical pharmacology of schistosome TRPA1-like ion channels.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2018; 12 (29746471): e000649510.1371/journal.pntd.0006495Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Sm.TRPA did not respond to PZQ but, as expected, did respond to the other two compounds (Fig. S1B). Next, we focused on the schistosome TRPM subfamily, which is predicted to contain seven members (Fig. S1A). The two members most closely related to Sm.TRPMPZQ (Smp_130890 and Smp_000050) did not respond to PZQ (Fig. S1, C and D). With the caveat that there is no control for functional expression, as endogenous agonists of these TRPM channels are unknown, these data suggest that schistosome TRP (and TRPM) channels are not broadly sensitive to PZQ. Next, to resolve the single-cell kinetics of Sm.TRPMPZQ activity, we performed confocal Ca2+ imaging. In HEK cells transfected with empty vector, the addition of ±PZQ (10 μm) failed to evoke a cytoplasmic Ca2+ signal (Fig. 3, A and B), although cells responded to ATP (100 μm), which activated endogenous purinoceptors. In contrast, in HEK cells transiently transfected with Sm.TRPMPZQ, the addition of ±PZQ (1 μm) evoked a rapid and protracted rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A and B). Responses were evoked by (R)-PZQ, with (S)-PZQ being ineffective at the same concentration (1 μm; Fig. 3, A and B). The large and persistent increase in fluorescence evidenced little Sm.TRPMPZQ desensitization in the presence of ±PZQ and contrasted with the smaller, transient nature of Ca2+ signals evoked by ATP. This signal was triggered by Ca2+ influx, as this response was seen only when Ca2+-containing medium was re-added to HEK cells initially exposed to ±PZQ in Ca2+-free medium (Fig. S2A). Activation of Sm.TRPMPZQ by ±PZQ was also reversible, as ±PZQ washout resulted in a decrease of signal to baseline (Fig. S2B). Electrophysiological analysis of Sm.TRPMPZQ was performed by measuring whole-cell currents in HEK cells expressing GFP alone or expressing GFP and Sm.TRPMPZQ. In cells expressing GFP alone, the addition of ±PZQ (2 μm) did not evoke currents (0 of 18 cells examined). In contrast, in HEK cells co-transfected with cDNA encoding both Sm.TRPMPZQ and GFP, the addition of ±PZQ evoked rapidly activating inward currents in all GFP-positive cells (22 of 22 cells, holding potential of −40 mV). Characterization of current magnitude after various voltage steps, in the absence and presence of PZQ (2 μm), revealed PZQ-activated Sm.TRPMPZQ-conducted large inward and outward currents with a linear I-V relationship (Fig. 3C), resembling the linear I-V relationship displayed by hTRPM2 channels (24Du J. Xie J. Yue L. Modulation of TRPM2 by acidic pH and the underlying mechanisms for pH sensitivity.J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 134 (19917732): 471-48810.1085/jgp.200910254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology with another invertebrate TRPM2 channel (Nematostella vectensis TRPM2, Nv.TRPM2) that has been structurally and functionally characterized (25Zhang Z. Tóth B. Szollosi A. Chen J. Csanády L. Structure of a TRPM2 channel in complex with Ca2+ explains unique gating regulation.eLife. 2018; 7 (29745897): e3640910.7554/eLife.36409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated that the substantial Ca2+ permeability of Sm.TRPMPZQ (Fig. 3, B and C) is supported by the presence of a negatively charged residue in the predicted pore filter of Sm.TRPMPZQ (FGD in Fig. 3D). This closely resembles the pore filter sequence of Nv.TRPM2 (YGE in Fig. 3D), which displays substantial Ca2+ permeability (25Zhang Z. Tóth B. Szollosi A. Chen J. Csanády L. Structure of a TRPM2 channel in complex with Ca2+ explains unique gating regulation.eLife. 2018; 7 (29745897): e3640910.7554/eLife.36409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, PZQ-evoked Ca2+ signals were strongly attenuated in HEK cells expressing the mutant Sm.TRPMPZQ[D1602A] (Fig. 3E). Sm.TRPMPZQ therefore displays several characteristics consistent with the properties of TRPM2 channels. These data represent the first report of a flatworm target activated by PZQ. Although further experiments would be needed to confirm Sm.TRPMPZQ as the clinically relevant target in worms, our data clearly evidence Sm.TRPMPZQ as a schistosome target of PZQ. The properties of Sm.TRPMPZQ, a TRPM2-like channel, are, however, consistent with several key facets of PZQ action on worms. These include (i) nanomolar sensitivity to PZQ (Fig. 2, C and D); (ii) stereoselectivity toward (R)-PZQ (Figure 2, Figure 3); (iii) mediation of a sustained Ca2+ entry in response to PZQ (Fig. 3B) that parallels the kinetics of worm contracture and tegumental disruption (15Blair K.L.

Therefore, there are many similarities between the properties of Sm.TRPMPZQ and the characteristics of PZQ action on schistosomes. This discovery also prompts new questions. What are the endogenous agonists and/or environmental cues that regulate Sm.TRPMPZQ activity across the parasite life cycle? In what cell type(s) is Sm.TRPMPZQ expressed? How is Sm.TRPMPZQ activity regulated in juvenile worms known to be less sensitive to PZQ? Is Sm.TRPMPZQ activity altered in schistosome strains that show refractoriness to PZQ action? Mutagenesis demonstrates that single amino acid changes in Sm.TRPMPZQ can dramatically alter channel responses to ±PZQ (Fig. 3E). This discovery also prioritizes analyses of TRPMPZQ homologs in other flatworms as well as all other schistosome TRPM channels to assess broader PZQ sensitivity. Finally, we note that (R)-PZQ is a potent activator of Sm.TRPMPZQ (Fig. 2). Known regulators of hTRPM2, including the endogenous agonist ADPR (23Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P.

Lipofectamine 2000 was from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Adult schistosomes were recovered by dissection of the mesenteric vasculature in female Swiss Webster mice previously infected (∼49 days) with S. mansoni cercariae (NMRI strain) by the Schistosomiasis Resource Center at the Biomedical Research Institute (Rockville, MD). All animal experiments followed ethical regulations approved by the Medical College of Wisconsin institutional animal care and use committee. Harvested schistosomes were washed in RPMI 1640 supplemented with HEPES (25 mm), 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml) and incubated overnight (37 °C/5% CO2) in vented Petri dishes (100 × 25 mm). The following day, movement assays were performed using male worms in 6-well dishes (∼5 individual worms/3 ml of medium per well). Video recordings were captured using a Zeiss Discovery v20 stereomicroscope with a QiCAM 12-bit cooled color CCD camera controlled by Metamorph imaging software. Recordings (1 min) of worm motility (4 frames/s), during the addition of various drug concentrations were analyzed as described previously (13Chan J.D. McCorvy J.D. Acharya S. Johns M.E. Day T.A.

For cloning of Sm.TRPMPZQ, total RNA was isolated from adult schistosome worm pairs using TRIzol® and poly(A)-purified using a NucleoTrap® mRNA minikit. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScriptTM III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Using the predicted sequence (Smp_246790) as a template, cDNA from transcribed sequences was amplified by PCR (LA TaqTM polymerase) and ligated into pGEM®-T Easy (Promega) for sequencing. Several splice variants of Sm.TRPMPZQ were identified within both the N-terminal TRPM homology region (MHR) and cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, which will be characterized elsewhere. The sequence used here for functional analyses represents the reference sequence (2268 amino acids, Smp_246790.5). HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573.3) and U2OS cells (ATCC HTB-96; Fig. S2A and B) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (290 μg/ml). For screening parasite TRP channels, codon-optimized cDNAs and mutants (Genscript) were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine-2000 at a density of 3 × 106 cells/dish (100 mm). Ca2+-imaging assays were performed using a fluorescence imaging plate reader (FLIPRTETRA, Molecular Devices). HEK293 cells (naive or transfected) were seeded (50,000 cells/well) in a black-walled clear-bottomed poly-d-lysine–coated 96-well plate (Corning) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS. After 24 h, growth medium was removed, and cells were loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator (Fluo-4 direct dye, Invitrogen) by incubation (100 μl per well, 1 h at 37 °C) in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) assay buffer containing probenecid (2.5 mm) and HEPES (20 mm). Drug dilutions were prepared in assay buffer, without probenecid and dye, in V-shaped 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany). After loading, the Ca2+ assay was performed at room temperature. Basal fluorescence was monitored for 20 s, and then 25 μl of each drug was added, and the signal (raw fluorescence units) was monitored over an additional 250 s. For quantitative analyses, peak fluorescence in each well was normalized to maximum -fold increase over baseline. For confocal Ca2+ imaging, HEK cells were loaded with Fluo-4-AM (4 μm) and Pluronic F127 (0.4%) for 25 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with HBSS and incubated at room temperature for de-esterification (30 min). Experiments in U2OS cells (Fig. S2A and B) were done using the genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6M. Fluorescence was imaged on an Olympus IX81 microscope, and fluorescence changes (λex = 488 nm (λem = 513 ± 15-nm bandpass) were monitored using a Yogokawa spinning disk confocal (CSU-X-M1N) and an Andor iXon Ultra 888 EMCCD camera. Data were expressed as a ratio (F/F0) of fluorescence at any given time (F) relative to fluorescence prior to drug addition (F0). For whole-cell current recordings, HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP or co-transfected with plasmids encoding GFP and Sm.TRPMPZQ. One day later, cells were replated onto round 18-mm glass coverslips. After overnight incubation, coverslips were secured in a recording chamber over a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted microscope. Cells were continuously superfused (6 ml/min) with an extracellular buffer consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4, 310 ± 3 mosm at room temperature). HEK293 cells were held at a holding voltage of −40 mV, and responses were resolved after superfusion of extracellular buffer containing ±PZQ (2 μm). Recordings were made using borosilicate pipettes (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) pulled on a Sutter micropipette puller (model P-87) to resistances of 2–5 megaohms. Patch pipettes were filled with intracellular buffer containing 135 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm Na.GTP, 2.5 mm ATP.Na2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.20, 290 ± 3 mosm at room temperature). Cell capacitance was compensated, and series resistance was kept <10 megaohms. Cells were included in analyses if the leak current stayed <200 pA. Recordings were made using an EPC10 USB amplifier (HEKA Electronics) and Patch Master software (HEKA Electronics). Patch-clamp data were analyzed using Pulse, PulseFit, or Fitmaster software (HEKA Electronics). For current-voltage measurements of HEK293 cells expressing Sm.TRPMPZQ, step potentials of 250 ms spanning the voltage range from −80 to +120 mV were delivered from a holding potential of −80 mV. For I-V curves, patch pipettes were filled with intracellular buffer containing: 140 mm CsMeSO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES-CsOH (pH 7.2 with CsOH, 300–310 mOsm/kg adjusted with sucrose). S.

https://openalex.org/W2982612094,"A diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning in sheep living on pastures in the vicinity of a smelting facility in the Wumeng mountain area of China was based on laboratory tests and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, heavy metal contamination in the food chain was found to have a deleterious effect on the health of local residents. The levels of copper(Cu), zinc(Zn), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in irrigation water, soil, forages, and animal tissues were measured in samples taken from the vicinity of a smelting facility and control samples. Heavy metal contents in food (corn, rice, and wheat), as well as in human tissues (blood and hair) obtained from local residents were also determined. Hematological values were also determined in human and animal samples. The content of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in irrigation water, soils, and forages were markedly higher in affected areas than in samples from healthy pastures. Concentrations of Cd and Pb were 177.82 and 16.61 times greater in forages than controls, respectively, and 68.71 and 15.66 times greater in soils than controls, respectively. The heavy metal content in food (corn, rice, and wheat) from affected areas was markedly higher than in the control samples. Cd and Pb content in the tissues of affected sheep were markedly higher than in control animals (P < 0.01), while concentrations of Cd and Pb in blood and hair samples from local residents were markedly higher than in control samples (P < 0.01). The occurrence of anemia in affected humans and animals followed a hypochromic and microcytic pattern. The intake of Cd and Pb was estimated according to herbage ingestion rates. It was found that the levels of Cd and Pb which accumulated in sheep through the ingestion of vegetation growing in the sites closest to the smelter were approximately 3.36 and 38.47 mg/kg body wt./day, respectively. Such levels surpassed the fatal dosages for sheep of 1.13 mg Cd/kg body wt/day and 4.42 mg Pb/kg body wt./day. The serum total antioxidant capacity in affected humans and animals was significantly lower than in the controls (P < 0.01). Serum protein parameters in affected humans and animals were significantly reduced (P < 0.01); therefore, it was concluded that heavy metal contamination caused harm to sheep, and also posed a significant risk to humans living in the vicinity of the zinc smelting facility."

How this low-dimensional manifold scales with cognitive complexity, and which brain regions regulate this process, are not well understood. We addressed this issue by analyzing sub-second high-field fMRI data acquired during performance of a task that systematically varied the complexity of cognitive reasoning. We show that task performance reconfigures the low-dimensional manifold and that deviations from these patterns relate to performance errors. We further demonstrate that individual differences in thalamic activity relate to reconfigurations of the low-dimensional architecture during task engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2981335896,"Honey has been used as a traditional remedy for skin and soft tissue infections due to its ability to promote wound healing. Manuka honey is recognized for its unusually abundant content of the antibacterial compound, methylglyoxal (MGO). The Unique Manuka Factor (UMF) grading system reflects the MGO concentration in Manuka honey sold commercially. Our objective was to observe if UMF values correlated with the antibacterial activity of Manuka honey against a variety of pathogens purchased over the counter. The antibacterial effect of Manuka honey with UMF values of 5+, 10+, and 15+ from the same manufacturer was assessed by the broth microdilution method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined against 128 isolates from wound cultures representing gram-positive, gram-negative, drug-susceptible, and multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms. Lower MICs were observed with UMF 5+ honey for staphylococci (n = 73, including 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 22, including 10 MDR) compared to UMF 10+ honey (p<0.05) and with UMF 10+ compared to UMF 15+ (p = 0.01). For Enterobacteriaceae (n = 33, including 14 MDR), MIC values were significantly lower for UMF 5+ or UMF 10+ compared to UMF 15+ honey (p<0.01). MIC50 for UMF 5+, UMF 10+, and UMF 15+ honey against staphylococci was 6%, 7%, and 15%, and for Enterobacteriaceae was 21%, 21%, and 27%, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa MIC50 was 21% and MIC90 was 21–27% for all UMFs. Manuka honey exhibited antimicrobial activity against a spectrum of organisms including those with multi-drug resistance, with more potent activity overall against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. Manuka honey with lower UMF values, in our limited sampling, paradoxically demonstrated increased antimicrobial activity among the limited samples tested, presumably due to changes in MGO content of honey over time. The UMF value by itself may not be a reliable indicator of antibacterial effect."
https://openalex.org/W2981928743,"Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding human protein DJ-1 cause early onset of Parkinson's disease, suggesting that DJ-1 protects dopaminergic neurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection are unclear; however, DJ-1 has been suggested to be a GSH-independent glyoxalase that detoxifies methylglyoxal (MGO) by converting it into lactate. It has also been suggested that DJ-1 serves as a deglycase that catalyzes hydrolysis of hemithioacetals and hemiaminals formed by reactions of MGO with the thiol and amino groups of proteins. In this report, we demonstrate that the equilibrium constant of reaction of MGO with thiols is ∼500 m-1 at 37 °C and that the half-life of the resulting hemithioacetal is only 12 s. These thermodynamic parameters would dictate that a significant fraction of free MGO will be present in a fast equilibrium with hemithioacetals in solution. We found that removal of free MGO by DJ-1's glyoxalase activity forces immediate spontaneous decomposition of hemithioacetals due to the shift in equilibrium position. This spontaneous decomposition of hemithioacetals could be mistaken for deglycase activity of DJ-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher initial concentrations of hemithioacetals are associated with lower rates of DJ-1-mediated conversion of MGO, ruling out the possibility that hemithioacetals are DJ-1 substrates. Experiments with CRISPR/Cas-generated DJ-1-knockout HEK293 cells revealed that DJ-1 does not protect against acute MGO toxicity or carboxymethylation of lysine residues in cells. Combined, our results suggest that DJ-1 does not possess protein deglycase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2982136515,"Background Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for identifying and structuring several informative variables for predictive tasks. Here, we investigated how ML algorithms may assist in echocardiographic pulmonary hypertension (PH) prediction, where current guidelines recommend integrating several echocardiographic parameters. Methods In our database of 90 patients with invasively determined pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) with corresponding echocardiographic estimations of PAP obtained within 24 hours, we trained and applied five ML algorithms (random forest of classification trees, random forest of regression trees, lasso penalized logistic regression, boosted classification trees, support vector machines) using a 10 times 3-fold cross-validation (CV) scheme. Results ML algorithms achieved high prediction accuracies: support vector machines (AUC 0.83; 95% CI 0.73–0.93), boosted classification trees (AUC 0.80; 95% CI 0.68–0.92), lasso penalized logistic regression (AUC 0.78; 95% CI 0.67–0.89), random forest of classification trees (AUC 0.85; 95% CI 0.75–0.95), random forest of regression trees (AUC 0.87; 95% CI 0.78–0.96). In contrast to the best of several conventional formulae (by Aduen et al.), this ML algorithm is based on several echocardiographic signs and feature selection, with estimated right atrial pressure (RAP) being of minor importance. Conclusions Using ML, we were able to predict pulmonary hypertension based on a broader set of echocardiographic data with little reliance on estimated RAP compared to an existing formula with non-inferior performance. With the conceptual advantages of a broader and unbiased selection and weighting of data our ML approach is suited for high level assistance in PH prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2981520484,"Adults with comparatively short or long leukocyte telomere length (LTL) typically continue to display comparatively short or long LTL throughout life. This LTL tracking stems from the inability of person-to-person variation in age-dependent LTL shortening during adulthood to offset the wide interindividual LTL variation established prior to adult life. However, LTL tracking in children is unstudied. This study aimed to examine LTL shortening rates and tracking in children and their parents. Longitudinal study in children (n = 67) and their parents (n = 99), whose ages at baseline were 11.4 ± 0.3 and 43.4 ± 0.4 yr, respectively. LTL was measured by Southern blotting at baseline and ∼14 yr thereafter. LTL displayed tracking in both children [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.905, P < 0.001] and their parents (ICC = 0.856, P < 0.001). The children's rate of LTL shortening was twice that of their parents (40.7 ± 2.5 bp/yr; 20.3 ± 2.1 bp/yr, respectively; P < 0.0001). LTL tracking applies not only to adulthood but also to the second decade of life. Coupled with previous work showing that the interindividual variation in LTL across newborns is as wide as in their parents, these findings support the thesis that the LTL-adult disease connection is principally determined before the second decade of life, perhaps mainly at birth.-Benetos, A., Verhulst, S., Labat, C., Lai, T.-P., Girerd, N., Toupance, S., Zannad, F., Rossignol, P., Aviv, A.

Identification of the factors that regulate PPARγ expression and activity is therefore crucial for combating obesity. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor with a known role in xenobiotic detoxification. Recent studies have suggested that AhR also plays essential roles in energy metabolism. However, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported that experiments with adipocyte-specific Cullin 4b (Cul4b)-knockout mice showed that CUL4B suppresses adipogenesis by targeting PPARγ. Here, using immunoprecipitation, ubiquitination, real-time PCR, and GST-pulldown assays, we report that AhR functions as the substrate receptor in CUL4B-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4B) complex and is required for recruiting PPARγ. AhR overexpression reduced PPARγ stability and suppressed adipocyte differentiation, and AhR knockdown stimulated adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, we found that two lysine sites on residues 268 and 293 in PPARγ are targeted for CRL4B-mediated ubiquitination, indicating cross-talk between acetylation and ubiquitination. Our findings establish a critical role of AhR in regulating PPARγ stability and suggest that the AhR–PPARγ interaction may represent a potential therapeutic target for managing metabolic diseases arising from PPARγ dysfunction.

Furthermore, we found that two lysine sites on residues 268 and 293 in PPARγ are targeted for CRL4B-mediated ubiquitination, indicating cross-talk between acetylation and ubiquitination. Our findings establish a critical role of AhR in regulating PPARγ stability and suggest that the AhR–PPARγ interaction may represent a potential therapeutic target for managing metabolic diseases arising from PPARγ dysfunction. Exorbitant body fat in obese people is thought to be a major reason for insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes (1Rocha V.Z. Libby P. Obesity, inflammation, and atherosclerosis.Nat.

Obesity-related insulin resistance is associated with dysregulation of lipid storage and chronic inflammation in adipose tissue (2Jung U.J. Choi M.S.

Insulin resistance is likely to be induced by inappropriate regulation of gene expression required for adipocyte differentiation or functions. Adipocyte differentiation from preadipocytes is controlled by a number of transcriptional cascades, particularly PPARγ 2The abbreviations used are: PPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorAhRaryl hydrocarbon receptorCUL4BCullin 4BSIAH2seven in absentia homolog 2MKRN1makorin ring finger protein 1TRIM23tripartite motif protein 23NEDD4neural precursor cell–expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4DCAFDDB1–CUL4 association factorCRL4BCUL4B-RING E3 ubiquitin ligaseUbubiquitinLMBleptomycin BPLAproximity ligation assayGSTGSH S-transferaseaaamino acidsNAMnicotinamideCHXcycloheximideHAhemagglutininNEMN-ethylmaleimideDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumNTAnitrilotriacetic acid.

PPARγ1 is expressed in a number of tissues. PPARγ2 is only observed in adipocytes and is crucial in maintaining normal insulin sensitivity (4Semple R.K. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S.

PPARγ protein is post-translationally regulated by several modifications. Phosphorylation on Ser-273 of PPARγ is modified by Cdk5 to dysregulate the expression of specific genes, such as adiponectin (5Choi J.H. Banks A.S. Estall J.L. Kajimura S. Boström P. Laznik D.

Acetylation on Lys-268 and Lys-293 of PPARγ is a signal of lipid storage and cell proliferation, whereas deacetylation of these two sites results in energy expenditure and promotes insulin sensitivity (6Qiang L.

PPARγ degradation is linked to the regulation of its transcriptional activity. Recently, several E3s have been identified in adipocytes, including seven in absentia homolog 2 (SIAH2) (7Kilroy G.

These E3s are located predominantly in the cytoplasm, and not all of them target PPARγ toward proteasomal degradation. Cullin 4B (CUL4B) acts as a scaffold protein that assembles DDB1, ROC1, and DDB1–CUL4 association factor (DCAF) to form CUL4B-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRL4B). CRL4B uses a variety of DCAFs to assemble different E3 ligases to specifically target substrate (11Jackson S. Xiong Y. CRL4s: the CUL4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases.Trends Biochem.

By targeting different substrates for Ub-dependent degradation or modification, CRL4B has been shown to participate in the regulation of diverse physiologically and developmentally controlled processes. Patients with CUL4B mutations manifest mental and growth retardation as well as central obesity (12Zou Y. Liu Q. Chen B. Zhang X. Guo C. Zhou H. Li J. Gao G. Guo Y. Yan C. Wei J. Shao C. Gong Y.

Using adipocyte-specific Cul4b-knockout mice, we previously showed that CUL4B functions as a negative regulator of adipogenesis (16Li P. Song Y. Zan W. Qin L. Han S. Jiang B. Dou H. Shao C. Gong Y.

However, the DCAF in CRL4B complex that recruits PPARγ remains unknown. AhR, also known as dioxin receptor, was reported to play essential roles in xenobiotic and energy metabolism (17Wada T.

In this study, we identified AhR as a novel factor that negatively regulates PPARγ protein stability via forming the CRL4B E3 ligase complex. The physiological function of AhR in adipocyte differentiation was further demonstrated using AhR-overexpressing and -knockdown 3T3-L1 cell lines. Our study provides a direct link between AhR and PPARγ and indicates that AhR–PPARγ interaction is a potential therapeutic target in PPARγ-related diseases. To investigate the role of AhR in adipocyte differentiation, we first examined the expression level of AhR in mouse adipose tissues. Similar to CUL4B and PPARγ, AhR was detected in white adipocyte tissues, including inguinal (subcutaneous) and epididymal (visceral) fat pads. AhR was expressed highly in brown adipose tissue (Fig. 1A). We also examined the mRNA and protein levels of AhR, CUL4B, and PPARγ as well as its target genes at different time points during differentiation. mRNA levels and protein levels of PPARγ and adipogenic markers were increased dramatically from day 0 postinduction. The transcriptional level of Cul4b was eventually reduced, and its protein level was also decreased dramatically at late stages of adipogenic differentiation, which is consistent with our previous study (16Li P. Song Y. Zan W. Qin L. Han S. Jiang B. Dou H. Shao C. Gong Y. Lack of CUL4B in adipocytes promotes PPARγ-mediated adipose tissue expansion and insulin sensitivity.Diabetes. 2017; 66 (10.2337/db16-0743, 27899484): 300-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Notably, the mRNA level of Ahr was also ultimately decreased during the process of differentiation, consistent with its protein level (Figs. S1 and 1B). We next studied whether AhR negatively regulates adipocyte differentiation like CUL4B does. Overexpression of AhR using a retrovirus suppressed the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, as demonstrated with Oil Red O staining (Fig. 1C and S2). In contrast, knockdown of AhR expression led to increased lipid accumulation (Fig. 1D and S2). Consistently, overexpressed AhR led to decreased expression of adipogenic markers, such as CD36, Adipsin, and Fabp4 (Fig. 1E), whereas knockdown of AhR induced increased expression of adipocyte-specific genes (Fig. 1F). To determine whether AhR regulates adipogenesis via modulating the PPARγ level, we examined the expression of PPARγ when AhR expression was knocked down or overexpressed. Although transcriptional levels of PPARγ in 3T3-L1 cells were not obviously changed by either AhR knockdown or overexpression (Fig. S3), knockdown of AhR expression significantly increased the endogenous protein level of PPARγ (Fig. 2A). Conversely, overexpression of AhR in 3T3-L1 cells induced a decrease of endogenous PPARγ. Importantly, the decreased PPARγ led by the overexpression of AhR was efficiently blocked by the administration of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that AhR may down-regulate PPARγ by a proteasome-dependent degradation mechanism (Fig. 2B). To further confirm this notion, we measured the half-life of PPARγ in AhR-overexpressing HEK293T cells. As expected, overexpression of AhR significantly increased PPARγ decay (Fig. 2, C and D). Consistently, the administration of MG132 significantly increased the accumulation of polyubiquitinated PPARγ in HEK293T cells transfected with AhR and PPARγ plasmids (Fig. 2E). Knockdown of AhR in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes also resulted in a reduction of polyubiquitinated PPARγ (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, in the presence or absence of leptomycin B (LMB) or MG132, we observed that PPARγ was ubiquitinated and targeted for proteasomal degradation in the nucleus (Fig. 2G). Immunofluorescence analysis results also showed that PPARγ accumulated in the nucleus upon MG132 treatment (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these results suggest that AhR decreases the stability of PPARγ protein via a proteasome-dependent mechanism. The fact that AhR decreases the stability of PPARγ protein prompted us to determine whether AhR acts as a substrate receptor for CRL4B-mediated PPARγ degradation. When overexpression of CUL4B decreased PPARγ in 3T3-L1 cells, knockdown of AhR could efficiently block the reduction of PPARγ caused by CUL4B overexpression (Fig. 3A), suggesting that AhR is required for the CRL4B-mediated PPARγ degradation. To further strengthen this notion, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays in 3T3-L1 cells to determine possible physical association among AhR, CUL4B, and PPARγ. As shown in the figure, when AhR was immunoprecipitated from 3T3-L1 cells, both CUL4B and PPARγ were brought down as well (Fig. 3B). Consistently, AhR was also coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against PPARγ or CUL4B (Fig. 3, C and D). Interactions between PPARγ and AhR were also confirmed in mouse adipose tissue using proximity ligation assay (PLA). Consistent with increased PPARγ level led by CUL4B deletion, more positive signals showing PPARγ–AhR interactions were detected in adipose tissues of adipocyte-specific knockout mice (Fig. 3, E and F). GSH S-transferase (GST) pulldown experiments were performed to further examine whether AhR binds PPARγ. Our results showed that AhR directly interacts with PPARγ (Fig. 3G). We next determined whether CUL4B–AhR complex represented an E3 ligase for PPARγ. To this end, His-Flag-AhR was expressed in HEK293T cells, and cellular extracts were prepared by affinity purification. As expected, the components of AhR complex, including endogenous CUL4B, DDB1, and ROC1, were detected in the affinity-purified fractions, thereby forming CRL4BAhR E3 complex (Fig. 3H). Importantly, the affinity-purified AhR complex significantly increased the amount of polyubiquitinated PPARγ, as indicated by an in vitro ubiquitination assay (Fig. 3I). Taken together, these results suggest that AhR functions as the substrate receptor in CRL4BAhR complex by recruiting PPARγ and facilitating its ubiquitination. To map out the region where PPARγ (isoform 2) binds AhR, we designed several plasmids expressing truncated PPARγ. Full-length AhR and PPARγ truncations were expressed in Escherichia coli. Our results showed that PPARγ binds AhR mainly on its DNA-binding domain (136–232aa). The N-terminal region of PPARγ (1–135aa) seemed to assist in binding AhR, whereas the C-terminal region of PPARγ, including its ligand-binding domain (233–505aa), did not contribute to binding (Fig. 4A). Meanwhile, we investigated the region of AhR that contributes in binding PPARγ. All truncated AhRs were expressed in E. coli and purified separately. Because neither AhR nor GST antibodies recognize all of the AhR truncations, we performed two sets of experiments. AhR 403–848aa was assayed in both experiments. Our results demonstrated that the C-terminal fragment of AhR (403–848aa) does not pull down PPARγ (Fig. 4B). Instead of full-length AhR, AhR fragment (188–403aa), including its ligand-binding domain, tends to pull down more PPARγ, suggesting that this region mainly contributes to recruiting PPARγ (Fig. 4C). Lys-184 and Lys-185 on PPARγ were previously reported as ubiquitination sites mediated by MKRN1 (8Kim J.H. Park K.W. Lee E.W. Jang W.S. Seo J. Shin S. Hwang K.A. Song J. Suppression of PPARγ through MKRN1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation prevents adipocyte differentiation.Cell Death Differ. 2014; 21 (10.1038/cdd.2013.181, 24336050): 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To examine whether CRL4BAhR targets the same residues, we mutated Lys-184/185 to alanines and performed a ubiquitination assay. Our results showed that K184A/K185A mutant exhibited a level of ubiquitination similar to that of WT PPARγ, suggesting that CRL4BAhR catalyzes PPARγ ubiquitination on novel site(s) (Fig. 5A). PPARγ is a lysine-rich protein. To identify the amino acid residue(s) targeted by CRL4BAhR, we first mapped the ubiquitinated region using different PPARγ truncations. Truncations 1–135aa, 136–232aa, and 233–505aa were barely ubiquitinated, suggesting that the targeted lysine was not located within these regions. Truncations 136–333aa and 136–505aa that contain the major AhR-binding region (136–232aa) were both ubiquitinated with levels similar to that of WT PPARγ, indicating that the 233–333aa region of PPARγ is required for ubiquitination by CRL4BAhR. Additionally, retaining the ability to bind AhR, truncation 1–232aa was also ubiquitinated but with a lower level compared with WT PPARγ, possibly due to nonspecific modifications (Fig. 5B). We next characterized the specific ubiquitination site(s) on PPARγ by mass spectrometry (MS). This can be accomplished by affinity purification of Myc-tagged PPARγ, isolating the captured proteins by SDS-PAGE, extracting the high-molecular-weight modified protein, and performing in-gel tryptic digestion. According to MS results, three peptide fragments gave GG–K ubiquitin-modification signals (a mass shift of +114.0429 Da) with high scores (experiments were done by Applied Protein Technology Co.). These peptides contain Lys-268, Lys-293, and Lys-329 individually (Fig. 5C), which are also located in the 233–333aa region of PPARγ (Fig. 5D). Lys-268 and Lys-293 were reported as two evolutionally conserved residues in the hinge domain (6Qiang L. Wang L. Kon N. Zhao W. Lee S. Zhang Y. Rosenbaum M. Zhao Y. Gu W. Farmer S.R. Accili D. Brown remodeling of white adipose tissue by SirT1-dependent deacetylation of Pparγ.Cell. 2012; 150 (10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.027, 22863012): 620-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5E). We then used point mutation analysis to confirm the residue(s) that is polyubiquitinated. As shown in the figure, mutation on a single site of these three residues did not affect the substrate ubiquitination level (Fig. 5F). However, the ubiquitination levels of K268A/K293A double mutant or K268A/K293A/K329A triple mutant were significantly decreased, suggesting that Lys-268 and Lys-293 were both targeted by CRL4BAhR (Fig. 5G). Consistently, in the presence of AhR, mutations on Lys-268 and Lys-293 could remarkably prolong PPARγ half-life in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5, H and I). SirT1 was previously reported to deacetylate PPARγ on its Lys-268 and Lys-293 (6Qiang L. Wang L. Kon N. Zhao W. Lee S. Zhang Y. Rosenbaum M. Zhao Y. Gu W. Farmer S.R. Accili D. Brown remodeling of white adipose tissue by SirT1-dependent deacetylation of Pparγ.Cell. 2012; 150 (10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.027, 22863012): 620-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In the presence of NAM, an inhibitor of SirT1 (21Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A.

However, inhibiting ubiquitination by knockdown of AhR does not increase the acetylation level of PPARγ (Fig. S4). In adipocytes, PPARγ protein has a short half-life (22Hauser S. Adelmant G.

Some E3s were not associated with PPARγ degradation. TRIM23 regulates PPARγ ubiquitination and stabilizes it (9Watanabe M. Takahashi H. Saeki Y. Ozaki T. Itoh S. Suzuki M. Mizushima W. Tanaka K.

Although WDTC1 binds PPARγ in adipocytes, CRL4BWDTC1 complex promotes histone H2A Lys-119 monoubiquitination and plays a role in transcriptional repression (26Groh B.S. Yan F. Smith M.D. Yu Y. Chen X. Xiong Y.

However, our previous study demonstrated that knockdown of CUL4B and DDB1 resulted in a significant increase in the half-life of PPARγ, indicating that CRL4B complex might use a different DCAF rather than WDTC1 to promote PPARγ ubiquitination and degradation. AhR, a nuclear receptor, has been shown to recruit estrogen receptor-α for proteasomal degradation in a ligand-dependent manner (27Ohtake F. Baba A. Takada I. Okada M. Iwasaki K. Miki H. Takahashi S.

In this study, we have shown here that AhR functions as the substrate receptor and recruits PPARγ onto CRL4BAhR E3 complex. Up-regulation of AhR shortens the PPARγ protein half-life via forming the CRL4BAhR E3 complex to facilitate Lys-268– and Lys-293–linked polyubiquitination of PPARγ, thereby blocking adipocyte differentiation. Knockdown of AhR stabilizes PPARγ and promotes adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. PPARγ plays a central role during adipocyte differentiation (28Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D.

This definition has been assessed according to Duke criteria by checking a sample of medical charts of IE giving a predictive positive value of 86.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 82.7% - 89.5%). The impact of heart valve surgery on survival has been studied if performed during the initial stay, and over the year of follow-up. Risk factors of in-hospital mortality were identified using logistic regression model for the initial stay and Cox Time-dependent model for the 1-year mortality.The analysis included 6,235 patients. The annual incidence of definite IEs was 63 cases/million residents. Staphylococci and Streptococci were the most common bacteria (44% and 45%, respectively). A valvular surgery was performed in 20% of cases, but substantial variations existed between hospitals. The in-hospital mortality was 21% (ranging 12% to 27% according to the region of patients), associated with age>70, chronic liver disease, renal failure, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa or candida infection and strokes whereas valvular surgery, a native valve IE or intraveinous drug use (right heart IE) were significantly protective for an initial death. The same factors were associated with the one-year mortality, except for valvular surgery which was associated with a 1.4-fold higher risk of death during the year post IE.We reported a high IE incidence rate. Valvular surgery was considerably less frequent in this study than in the previous published data (near 50%) whereas mortality was similar. Surgery was associated with higher survival if undergone within the initial stay. There were significant regional differences in frequency of surgery but it did not impact mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2982477590,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) catalyze oxidative cleavage of recalcitrant polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin and play an important role in the enzymatic degradation of biomass. Although it is clear that these monocopper enzymes have extended substrate-binding surfaces for interacting with their fibrous substrates, the structural determinants of LPMO substrate specificity remain largely unknown. To gain additional insight into substrate specificity in LPMOs, here we generated a mutant library of a cellulose-active family AA10 LPMO from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (ScLPMO10C, also known as CelS2) having multiple substitutions at five positions on the substrate-binding surface that we identified by sequence comparisons. Screening of this library using a newly-developed MS-based high-throughput assay helped identify multiple enzyme variants that contained four substitutions and exhibited significant chitinolytic activity and a concomitant decrease in cellulolytic activity. The chitin-active variants became more rapidly inactivated during catalysis than a natural chitin-active AA10 LPMO, an observation likely indicative of suboptimal substrate binding leading to autocatalytic oxidative damage of these variants. These results reveal several structural determinants of LPMO substrate specificity and underpin the notion that productive substrate binding by these enzymes is complex, depending on a multitude of amino acids located on the substrate-binding surface."
https://openalex.org/W2981476361,"Land-use change is threatening biodiversity worldwide, affecting above and below ground animal communities by altering their trophic niches. However, shifts in trophic niches with changes in land use are little studied and this applies in particular to belowground animals. Oribatid mites are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. We analyzed shifts in trophic niches of six soil-living oribatid mite species with the conversion of lowland secondary rainforest into plantation systems of different land-use intensity (jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm monoculture plantation) in two regions of southwest Sumatra, Indonesia. We measured stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) of single oribatid mite individuals and calculated shifts in stable isotope niches with changes in land use. Significant changes in stable isotope ratios in three of the six studied oribatid mite species indicated that these species shift their trophic niches with changes in land use. The trophic shift was either due to changes in trophic level (δ15N values), to changes in the use of basal resources (δ13C values) or to changes in both. The trophic shift generally was most pronounced between more natural systems (rainforest and jungle rubber) on one side and monoculture plantations systems (rubber and oil palm plantations) on the other, reflecting that the shifts were related to land-use intensity. Although trophic niches of the other three studied species did not differ significantly between land-use systems they followed a similar trend. Overall, the results suggest that colonization of very different ecosystems such as rainforest and intensively managed monoculture plantations by oribatid mite species likely is related to their ability to shift their trophic niches, i.e. to trophic plasticity."

Yet, restoration attempts have generally been limited to small spatial extensions, with the principal aim of developing efficient restoration techniques. Here, the success of outplanting Cystoseira amentacea v. stricta germlings cultured in aquaria was experimentally explored at a scale of tens of kms, by means of a multifactorial experimental design. In the intertidal rocky shores of SE Italy, locations with a continuous distribution for hundreds of meters or with few thalli forming patches of few centimeters of C. amentacea canopy were selected. In each location, the effects of adult conspecifics and the exclusion of macrograzers (salema fish and sea urchins) on the survival of germlings were tested. We evaluated the most critical determinants of mortality for germlings, including the overlooked pressure of mesograzers (e.g. amphipods, small mollusks, polychaetes). Despite the high mortality observed during outplanting and early settlement stages, survival of C. amentacea germlings was consistently favored by the exclusion of macrograzers, while the presence of adult conspecifics had no effects. In addition, the cost analysis of the interventions showed the feasibility of the ex-situ method, representing an essential tool for preserving Cystoseira forests. Large scale restoration is possible but requires baseline information with an in-depth knowledge of the species ecology and of the areas to be restored, together with the development of specific cultivation protocols to make consistently efficient restoration interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2982313279,"Direct-to-consumer canine genetic testing is becoming increasingly popular among dog owners. The data collected therein provides intriguing insight into the current status of morphological variation present within purebred populations. Mars WISDOM PANELTM data from 11,790 anonymized dogs, representing 212 breeds and 4 wild canine species, were evaluated at genes associated with 7 coat color traits and 5 physical characteristics. Frequencies for all tested alleles at these 12 genes were determined by breed and by phylogenetic grouping. A sub-set of the data, consisting of 30 breeds, was divided into separate same-breed populations based on country of collection, body size, coat variation, or lineages selected for working or conformation traits. Significantly different (p ≤ 0.00167) allele frequencies were observed between populations for at least one of the tested genes in 26 of the 30 breeds. Next, standard breed descriptions from major American and international registries were used to determine colors and tail lengths (e.g. genetic bobtail) accepted within each breed. Alleles capable of producing traits incongruous with breed descriptions were observed in 143 breeds, such that random mating within breeds has probabilities of between 4.9e-7 and 0.25 of creating undesirable phenotypes. Finally, the presence of rare alleles within breeds, such as those for the recessive black coloration and natural bobtail, was combined with previously published identity-by-decent haplotype sharing levels to propose pathways by which the alleles may have spread throughout dog breeds. Taken together, this work demonstrates that: 1) the occurrence of low frequency alleles within breeds can reveal the influence of regional or functional selection practices; 2) it is possible to visualize the potential historic connections between breeds that share rare alleles; and 3) the necessity of addressing conflicting ideals in breed descriptions relative to actual genetic potential is crucial."
https://openalex.org/W2938793817,"Background Populations in coastal cities are exposed to increasing risk of flooding, resulting in rising damages to health and assets. Adaptation measures, such as early warning systems for floods (EWSFs), have the potential to reduce the risk and impact of flood events when tailored to reflect the local social-ecological context and needs. Community perceptions and experiences play a critical role in risk management, since perceptions influence people’s behaviors in response to EWSFs and other interventions. Methods We investigated community perceptions and responses in flood-prone periurban areas in the coastal city of Machala, Ecuador. Focus groups (n = 11) were held with community members (n = 65 people) to assess perceptions of flood exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and current alert systems. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded by topic. Participatory maps were field validated, georeferenced, and digitized using GIS software. Qualitative data were triangulated with historical government information on rainfall, flood events, population demographics, and disease outbreaks. Results Flooding was associated with seasonal rainfall, El Niño events, high ocean tides, blocked drainage areas, overflowing canals, collapsed sewer systems, and low local elevation. Participatory maps revealed spatial heterogeneity in perceived flood risk across the community. Ten areas of special concern were mapped, including places with strong currents during floods, low elevation areas with schools and homes, and other places that accumulate stagnant water. Sensitive populations included children, the elderly, physically handicapped people, low-income families, and recent migrants. Flood impacts included damages to property and infrastructure, power outages, and the economic cost of rebuilding/repairs. Health impacts included outbreaks of infectious diseases, skin infections, snakebite, and injury/drowning. Adaptive capacity was weakest during the preparation and recovery stages of flooding. Participants perceived that their capacity to take action was limited by a lack of social organization, political engagement, and financial capital. People perceived that flood forecasts were too general, and instead relied on alerts via social media. Conclusions This study highlights the challenges and opportunities for climate change adaptation in coastal cities. Areas of special concern provide clear local policy targets. The participatory approach presented here (1) provides important context to shape local policy and interventions in Ecuador, complimenting data gathered through standard flood reports, (2) provides a voice for marginalized communities and a mechanism to raise local awareness, and (3) provides a research framework that can be adapted to other resource-limited coastal communities at risk of flooding."
https://openalex.org/W2982014265,"Geese are extremely well-adapted to utilizing plant-derived roughage in their diet, so the grass must be added to commercial diets under intensive rearing systems. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading microbiota such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut microbiota were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading microbiota (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese."

We conducted a cross-sectional assessment of sanitary conditions and E. coli counts in soils and on surfaces of compounds (household clusters) in low-income neighborhoods of Maputo, Mozambique. We adapted the World Bank’s Urban Sanitation Status Index to implement a sanitary survey tool specifically for compounds: a Localized Sanitation Status Index (LSSI) ranging from zero (poor sanitary conditions) to one (better sanitary conditions) calculated from 20 variables that characterized local sanitary conditions. We measured the variation in the LSSI with E. coli counts in soil (nine locations/compound) and surface swabs (seven locations/compound) in 80 compounds to assess reliability. Multivariable regression indicated that a ten-percentage point increase in LSSI was associated with 0.05 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.11) log10 fewer E. coli/dry gram in courtyard soil. Overall, the LSSI may be associated with fecal contamination in compound soil; however, the differences detected may not be meaningful in terms of public health hazards."

https://openalex.org/W2981682735,"Visual aesthetic experiences unfold over time, yet most of our understanding of such experiences comes from experiments using static visual stimuli and measuring static responses. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics of subjective aesthetic experience using temporally extended stimuli (movie clips) in combination with continuous behavioral ratings. Two groups of participants, a rate group (n = 25) and a view group (n = 25), watched 30-second video clips of landscapes and dance performances in test and retest blocks. The rate group reported continuous ratings while watching the videos, with an overall aesthetic judgment at the end of each video, in both test and retest blocks. The view group, however, passively watched the videos in the test block, reporting only an overall aesthetic judgment at the end of each clip. In the retest block, the view group reported both continuous and overall judgments. When comparing the two groups, we found that the task of making continuous ratings did not influence overall ratings or agreement across participants. In addition, the degree of temporal variation in continuous ratings over time differed substantially by observer (from slower “integrators” to “fast responders”), but less so by video. Reliability of continuous ratings across repeated exposures was in general high, but also showed notable variance across participants. Together, these results show that temporally extended stimuli produce aesthetic experiences that are not the same from person to person, and that continuous behavioral ratings provide a reliable window into the temporal dynamics of such aesthetic experiences while not materially altering the experiences themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2981970925,"The P16 (CDKN2Aink4a) gene is an endogenous CDK4/6 inhibitor. Palbociclib (PD0332991) is an anti-CDK4/6 chemical for cancer treatment. P16 is most frequently inactivated by copy number deletion and DNA methylation in cancers. It is well known that cancer cells with P16 deletion are more sensitive to palbociclib than those without. However, whether P16 methylation is related to palbociclib sensitivity is not known. By analyzing public pharmacogenomic datasets, we found that the IC50 of palbociclib in cancer cell lines (n = 522) was positively correlated with both the P16 expression level and P16 gene copy number. Our experimental results further showed that cancer cell lines with P16 methylation were more sensitive to palbociclib than those without. To determine whether P16 methylation directly increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to palbociclib, we induced P16 methylation in the lung cancer cell lines H661 and HCC827 and the gastric cancer cell line BGC823 via an engineered P16-specific DNA methyltransferase (P16-Dnmt) and found that the sensitivity of these cells to palbociclib was significantly increased. The survival rate of P16-Dnmt cells was significantly lower than that of vector control cells 48 hrs post treatment with palbociclib (10 μM). Notably, palbociclib treatment also selectively inhibited the proliferation of the P16-methylated subpopulation of P16-Dnmt cells, further indicating that P16 methylation can increase the sensitivity of cells to this CDK4/6 inhibitor. These results were confirmed in an animal experiment. In conclusion, inactivation of the P16 gene by DNA methylation can increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to palbociclib."

We found that metformin treatment down‐regulated integrin β1 concomitant with the loss of inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) in murine myocytes, adipocytes, and hepatocytes. To determine if IPMK was upstream of integrin β1 expression, we examined IPMK ‐/‐ mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and found that integrins β1and β3 gene expression was reduced by half, relative to wild‐type cells, whereas focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity and Rho/Rac/Cdc42 protein levels were increased, resulting in migration defects. Using nanonet force microscopy, we determined that cell:extracellular matrix adhesion and cell contractility forces were decreased, confirming the functional relevance of integrin and Rho protein dysregulation. Pharmacological studies showed that inhibition of both FAK1 and proline‐rich tyrosine kinase 2 partially restored integrin β1 expression, suggesting negative regulation of integrin β1 by FAK.

Data from two separate prospective studies on dogs with spontaneous mammary carcinomas were used for this research. All dogs underwent standardized diagnostic testing, staging, surgery and follow-up examinations. Serum estrogen was analyzed by competitive enzyme immunoassay or radioimmunoassay, and tumor estrogen receptor (ER) expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. A total of 159 dogs were included; 130 were spayed and 29 remained. High serum estrogen was associated with an overall longer time to metastasis (p = 0.021). When stratifying based on spay group, the effect was only significant in spayed dogs, (p = 0.019). Positive tumor ER expression was also associated with a longer time to metastasis (p = 0.025), but similar to above, only in dogs that were spayed (p = 0.049). Further subgroup analysis revealed that high serum estrogen was significantly associated with improved survival in dogs with ER positive tumors, but only in spayed dogs (p = 0.0052). Interestingly, the effect of spaying was the opposite in dogs with ER negative tumors; here, intact dogs with high serum estrogen but ER negative tumors had a significantly longer time to metastasis (p = 0.036). Low serum estrogen was associated with increased risk for the development of non-mammary tumors in the post-operative period (p = 0.012). These results highlight the dual effect of estrogen in cancer: Estrogen acts as a pro-carcinogen in ER positive mammary tumors, but a may have a protective effect in ER negative tumors, potentially via non-receptor mechanisms. The latter is supported by the decreased risk for non-mammary tumors in dogs with high serum estrogen, and explains the increased incidence of certain non-mammary tumors in in dogs spayed at an early age."

We show that mtrB loss reduces the bacterium's ability to survive in macrophages and increases its association with autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Notably, the ΔmtrB strain was markedly defective in establishing lung infection in mice, with no detectable lung pathology following aerosol challenge. ΔmtrB was less able to withstand hypoxic and acid stresses and to form biofilms and had decreased viability under hypoxia. Transcriptional profiling of ΔmtrB by gene microarray analysis, validated by quantitative RT-PCR, indicated down-regulation of the hypoxia-associated dosR regulon, as well as genes associated with other pathways linked to adaptation of M. tuberculosis to the host environment. Using in vitro biochemical assays, we demonstrate that MtrB interacts with DosR (a noncognate RR) in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that MtrB enhances the binding of DosR to the hspX promoter, suggesting an unexpected role of MtrB in DosR-regulated gene expression in M. tuberculosis. Taken together, these findings indicate that MtrB functions as a regulator of DosR-dependent gene expression and in the adaptation of M. tuberculosis to hypoxia and the host environment.

https://openalex.org/W2982365357,"Improved systems for detection of measurable residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are urgently needed, however attempts to utilize broad-scale next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels to perform multi-gene surveillance in AML post-induction have been stymied by persistent premalignant mutation-bearing clones. We hypothesized that this technology may be more suitable for evaluation of fully engrafted patients following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). To address this question, we developed a hybrid-capture NGS panel utilizing unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to detect variants at 0.1% VAF or below across 22 genes frequently mutated in myeloid disorders and applied it to a retrospective sample set of blood and bone marrow DNA samples previously evaluated as negative for disease via standard-of-care short tandem repeat (STR)-based engraftment testing and hematopathology analysis in our laboratory. Of 30 patients who demonstrated trackable mutations in the 22 genes at eventual relapse by standard NGS analysis, we were able to definitively detect relapse-associated mutations in 18/30 (60%) at previously disease-negative timepoints collected 20–100 days prior to relapse date. MRD was detected in both bone marrow (15/28, 53.6%) and peripheral blood samples (9/18, 50%), while showing excellent technical specificity in our sample set. We also confirmed the disappearance of all MRD signal with increasing time prior to relapse (>100 days), indicating true clinical specificity, even using genes commonly associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). This study highlights the efficacy of a highly sensitive, NGS panel-based approach to early detection of relapse in AML and supports the clinical validity of extending MRD analysis across many genes in the post-transplant setting."
https://openalex.org/W2981326543,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are important hormones involved in the regulation of multiple physiologic functions. GCs are also widely used in anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1)ΔIEC mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells in vivo. Nr3c1 deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic inflammation at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/inflammatory changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after 2 wk. The mechanism may involve augmented inflammatory signaling by epithelial cells or defective barrier function. We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term. Future studies are required to assess the impact of Nr3c1 deletion in other conditions such as experimental colitis.-Aranda, C. J., Arredondo-Amador, M., Ocón, B., Lavín, J. L., Aransay, A.

However, patients may not be aware of the importance of FHH, and thus, may fail to accurately or completely share FHH with health providers, thereby limiting its utility. In this study, we conducted an online survey of 294 young adults and employees based at a US university setting regarding their knowledge, sharing behaviors, and perceived importance of FHH, and use of electronic clinical tools to document and update FHH. We also evaluated two educational interventions (written and video) to promote knowledge about FHH and its importance to health. We found that 93% of respondents were highly aware of their FHH, though only 39% reported collecting it and 4% using an online FHH tool. Seventy-three percent of respondents, particularly women, had shared FHH with their doctor when prompted, and fewer had shared it with family members. Participants in the video group were significantly more likely to understand the benefits of FHH than those in the written group (p = 0.02). In summary, educational resources, either video or written, will be helpful to promote FHH collection, sharing, and use of online FHH tools."
https://openalex.org/W2981813469,"The success of immunotherapy treatment in oncology ushered a new modality for treating a wide variety of cancers. However, lack of effect in some patients made it imperative to identify other pathways that are exploited by cancer cells to circumvent immune surveillance, and possibly synergize immune checkpoint treatment in those cases. It has been recently recognized that adenosine levels increase significantly in the tumor microenvironment and that adenosine/adenosine receptors play a powerful role as immunosuppressive and attenuating several effector T cell functions. The two main enzymes responsible for generating adenosine in the microenvironment are the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, the former utilizes both ATP and ADP and produces AMP while the latter utilizes AMP and generates adenosine. Thus, these two enzymes combined are the major source for the bulk of adenosine produced in the microenvironment. They were shown to be validated targets in oncology leading to several clinical trials that include small molecules as well as antibodies, showing positive and encouraging results in the preclinical arena. Towards the development of novel drugs to target these enzymes, we have developed a platform that can be utilized to monitor the activities of both enzymes in vitro (biochemical) as well as in cells (cell based) assays. We have developed very sensitive and homogenous assays that enabled us to monitor the activity of both enzymes and demonstrate selectivity of known inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies. This should speed up screening for novel inhibitors that might lead to more effective cancer therapy."

Recent studies, however, have shown that 8‐oxoG in gene regulatory elements may serve as an epigenetic mark, and OGG1 has distinct functions in modulating gene expression. Genome‐wide mapping of oxidative stress‐induced OGG1 enrichment within introns was documented, but its significance has not yet been fully characterized. Here, we explored whether OGG1 recruited to intron 1 of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase‐1 (TIMP1) gene and modulated its expression. Using chromatin and DNA:RNA hybrid immunoprecipitation assays, we report recruitment of OGG1 to the DNA:RNA hybrid in intron 1, where it increases nascent RNA but lowers mRNA levels in O 3 ‐exposed human airway epithelial cells and mouse lungs. Decrease in TIMP1 expression is alleviated by antioxidant administration, small interfering RNA depletion, or inhibition of OGG1 binding to its genomic substrate. In vitro studies revealed direct interaction between OGG1 and 8‐oxoG containing DNA:RNA hybrid, without excision of its substrate. Inhibition of OGG1 binding to DNA:RNA hybrid translated into an increase in TIMP1 expression and a decrease in oxidant‐induced lung inflammatory responses as well as airway remodeling. Data documented here reveal a novel molecular link between OGG1 at damaged sites and transcription dynamics that may contribute to oxidative stress‐induced cellular and tissue responses.—Pan, L., Wang, H., Luo, J., Zeng J., Pi, J., Liu, H., Liu, C., Ba, X., Qu, X., Xiang Y., Boldogh, I., Qin, X.

https://openalex.org/W2981656307,"Background Methylation patterns in circulating cell-free DNA are potential biomarkers for cancer and other pathologies. Currently, bisulfite treatment underpins most DNA methylation analysis methods, however, it is known to fragment DNA. Circulating DNA is already short, and further fragmentation during bisulfite treatment is of concern, as it would potentially reduce the sensitivity of downstream assays. Methods We used high molecular weight genomic DNA to compare fragmentation and recovery following bisulfite treatment with 2 commercially available kits (Qiagen). The bisulfite treated DNA was visualised on an agarose gel and quantified by qPCR. We also bisulfite treated, visualised and quantitated circulating DNA from plasma. Results There was no difference in DNA fragmentation between the two kits tested, however, the Epitect Fast kit gave better recovery than the standard Epitect kit, with the same conversion efficiency. We also found that bisulfite treated circulating DNA migrates as distinct bands on agarose gels, suggesting that, in contrast to genomic DNA, it remains largely intact following treatment. Bisulfite treatment of 129 and 234 base PCR products confirmed that this was due to the short length of the circulating DNA fragments. Compared to double stranded DNA, bisulfite treated single stranded DNA gives a very weak signal on gel electrophoresis. Conclusions DNA fragmentation during bisulfite treatment does not contribute to loss of sensitivity in methylation analysis of circulating DNA. The absence of DNA fragments below approximately 170 bases from agarose gel images of purified circulating DNA raises the possibility that these fragments are single stranded following the DNA extraction step."
https://openalex.org/W2982012522,"Introduction Although shoulder girdle injuries are frequent, those of the medial part are widely unexplored. Our aim is to improve the knowledge of this rare injury and its management in Germany by big data analysis. Methods The data are based on ICD-10 codes of all German hospitals as provided by the German Federal Statistical Office. Based on the ICD-10 codes S42.01 (medial clavicle fracture, MCF) and S43.2 (sternoclavicular joint dislocation, SCJD), anonymized patient data from 2012 to 2014 were evaluated retrospectively for epidemiologic issues. We analyzed especially the concomitant injuries and therapy strategies. Results A total of 114,003 cases with a clavicle involving shoulder girdle injury were identified with 12.5% of medial clavicle injuries (MCI). These were accompanied by concomitant injuries, most of which were thoracic and craniocerebral injuries as well as injuries at the shoulder/upper arm. A significant difference between MCF and SCJD concerning concomitant injuries only appears for head injuries (p = 0.003). If MCI is the main diagnosis, soft tissue injuries typically occur as secondary diagnoses. The MCI are significantly more often associated with concomitant injuries (p < 0.001) for almost each anatomic region compared with lateral clavicle injuries (LCI). The main differences were found for thoracic and upper extremity injuries. Different treatment strategies were used, most frequently plate osteosynthesis in more than 50% of MCF cases. Surgery on SCJD was performed with K-wires, tension flange or absorbable materials, fewer by plate osteosynthesis. Conclusions We proved that MCI are rare injuries, which might be why they are treated by inhomogeneous treatment strategies. No standard procedure has yet been established. MCI can occur in cases of severely injured patients, often associated with severe thoracic or other concomitant injuries. Therefore, MCI appear to be more complex than LCI. Further studies are required regarding the development of standard treatment strategy and representative clinical studies."

Identification and analysis of candidate genes encoding for key plant cell-wall degrading enzymes including GH5 cellulases, PL3 pectate lyases and GH28 polygalactouranase revealed a pattern of occurrence similar to other PPNs, although with closest phylogenetic associations to the sedentary cyst nematodes. We also observed the absence of a suite of effectors essential for feeding site formation in the cyst nematodes. Clustering of various orthologous genes shared by R. similis with other nematodes showed higher overlap with the cyst nematodes than with the root-knot or other migratory endoparasitic nematodes. The data presented here support the hypothesis that R. similis is evolutionarily closer to the cyst nematodes, however, differences in the effector repertoire delineate ancient divergence of parasitism, probably as a consequence of niche specialization. These similarities and differences further underscore distinct evolutionary relationships during the evolution of parasitism in this group of nematodes."

However, the molecular mechanism that contributes to the aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling cascade in ovarian cancer has not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R (PTPRR) suppressed the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in ovarian cancer. We performed an shRNA-based biochemical screen, which identified PTPRR as being responsible for tyrosine dephosphorylation of β-catenin on Tyr-142, a key site controlling the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Of note, PTPRR was down-regulated in ovarian cancers, and ectopic PTPRR re-expression delayed ovarian cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Using a proximity-based tagging system and RNA-Seq analysis, we identified a signaling nexus that includes PTPRR, α-catenin, β-catenin, E-cadherin, and AT-rich interaction domain 3C (ARID3C) in ovarian cancer. Immunohistochemistry staining of human samples further suggested that PTPRR expression is inversely correlated with disease prognosis. Collectively, our findings indicate that PTPRR functions as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer by dephosphorylating and inactivating β-catenin. These results suggest that PTPRR expression might have utility as a prognostic marker for predicting overall survival.

https://openalex.org/W2982569415,"Cucurbitacins are highly oxygenated triterpenoids characteristic of plants in the family Cucurbitaceae and responsible for the bitter taste of these plants. Fruits of bitter melon (Momordica charantia) contain various cucurbitacins possessing an unusual ether bridge between C5 and C19, not observed in other Cucurbitaceae members. Using a combination of next-generation sequencing and RNA-Seq analysis and gene-to-gene co-expression analysis with the ConfeitoGUIplus software, we identified three P450 genes, CYP81AQ19, CYP88L7, and CYP88L8, expected to be involved in cucurbitacin biosynthesis. CYP81AQ19 co-expression with cucurbitadienol synthase in yeast resulted in the production of cucurbita-5,24-diene-3β,23α-diol. A mild acid treatment of this compound resulted in an isomerization of the C23-OH group to C25-OH with the concomitant migration of a double bond, suggesting that a nonenzymatic transformation may account for the observed C25-OH in the majority of cucurbitacins found in plants. The functional expression of CYP88L7 resulted in the production of hydroxylated C19 as well as C5-C19 ether-bridged products. A plausible mechanism for the formation of the C5-C19 ether bridge involves C7 and C19 hydroxylations, indicating a multifunctional nature of this P450. On the other hand, functional CYP88L8 expression gave a single product, a triterpene diol, indicating a monofunctional P450 catalyzing the C7 hydroxylation. Our findings of the roles of several plant P450s in cucurbitacin biosynthesis reveal that an allylic hydroxylation is a key enzymatic transformation that triggers subsequent processes to produce structurally diverse products."

Formin-mediated actin assembly is one of the two major assembly machineries in plants in generating long actin cables for polarized plant growth and defense mechanism. During actin elongation, profilin transiently associates with the polyproline (Poly-P) of formins to deliver G-actin into the filament growing end and after that released quickly for next rounds of G-actin recruitment (2Romero S.

During pattern-triggered immunity, AtPRF3 was dynamically regulated to protein degradation or synthesis to attenuate formin-mediated actin assembly. However, the molecular basis for understanding the potential conformational regulation of the AtPRF3 NTE is unknown. Studies of the dynamic association of AtPRF3 NTE with formin Poly-P is essential to understand how NTE dynamically regulates profilin activities by modulating its binding states toward Poly-P in plant development and defense mechanisms. To elucidate the mechanism by which AtPRF3 NTE confers a dynamic but high-affinity binding to Poly-P, we carried out structural studies of the AtPRF2, AtPRF3 and the complex structure with Poly-P. We solved the crystal structures of AtPRF2 both in apo and Poly-P–bound forms, as well as of AtPRF3Δ37 and AtPRF3Δ22, respectively. In vivo functional studies of AtPRF3Δ22 partially recapitulated its negative regulation in actin assembly using yeast reconstitution system by introducing AtPRFs. By integrating both structural studies and mathematical modeling, we found that AtPRF3Δ22 NTE adopts a “closed” conformation and trespasses the Poly-P–binding pocket, which should be able to open upon Poly-P binding. Therefore, we performed the molecule simulation of AtPRF3 NTE in the presence and absence of Poly-P, and the results suggest that AtPRF3 adopts various conformations to modulate the Poly-P binding. Moreover, the NTE in the isolated AtPRF3Δ22 structure likely adopts a “closed” conformation. Our simulation results demonstrated that the NTE evolves dynamically by adopting different interaction modes toward Poly-P, through which an effective Poly-P binding and negative regulation in actin assembly have remained. Taken together, our results suggest that the unique ability of the AtPRF3 NTE by adopting various conformations, which enables precise modulations of actin assembly in defense mechanisms. To understand how formin-mediated actin assembly is balanced in the presence of both negative and positive profilin isoforms, we designed a profilin competition assay by comparing the AtFH1-mediated actin assembly in the presence of AtPRF3, AtPRF1, or both. AtPRF3 has a stronger inhibitory effect on spontaneous actin polymerization than AtPRF1 (Fig. 1). A profilin mix of 0.5 μm AtPRF3 and 0.5 μm AtPRF1 results in actin assembly in the middle of 1 μm AtPRF3 and 1 μm AtPRF1, indicating a balanced effect on spontaneous actin assembly using both profilin isoforms. Interestingly, the presence of formin AtFH1 with a coexistence of 0.5 μm AtPRF3 and AtPRF1 at 1:1 ratio showed an overall negative regulation in AtFH1-mediated actin assembly, which is at a similar level of F-actin polymerization by using 0.5 μm AtPRF3 only (Fig. 1). Such inhibition of actin polymerization in the presence of formin strongly indicates the unique function of AtPRF3. To better understand the unique function of AtPRF3 in vivo, we reconstituted the AtPRF1–5, AtPRF3 truncating the N-terminal 22 amino acids (AtPRF3Δ22), and 37 amino acids (AtPRF3Δ37) in budding yeast by replacing the only profilin ScPFY1 with AtPRF genes, taking advantage of the highly conserved machinery of profilin–formin–actin–mediated actin assembly among eukaryotes. Because haploid deletion mutant pfy1Δ is lethal, we therefore first generated a diploid strain with one ScPFY1 copy replaced by the cgLEU2 gene, ScPFY1/pfy1Δ::CgLEU2. Then the pfy1Δ::CgLEU2 gene was replaced by AtPRFs (Fig. 2A). AtPRFs were transcribed at the ScPFY1 chromosomal locus under the control of the ScPFY1 promoter in haploid. ScPFY1/AtPRF3 diploid showed 2:2 segregation viability, yielding only two viable Hygro− segregants per tetrad (Fig. 2B), which demonstrated that AtPRF3 is a lethal recessive gene and is highly consistent with its strong adverse effects on formin-mediated actin assembly (3Sun H. Qiao Z. Chua K.P. Tursic A. Liu X. Gao Y.G. Mu Y. Hou X. Miao Y. Profilin negatively regulates formin-mediated actin assembly to modulate PAMP-triggered plant immunity.Curr.

All other segregants with full-length AtPRF isoform genes, AtPRF3Δ37, and AtPRF3Δ22 were viable but showed slower growth than the WT, perhaps because of the in vivo functional difference between yeast and plant profilin (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1A). To perform a direct comparison among all viable AtPRF isoform-expressing stains, we measured yeast growth in liquid culture at 25 °C and found that AtPRF1, AtPRF2, AtPRF3Δ22, AtPRF4, and AtPRF5 yeasts showed growth defect more than AtPRF3Δ37 (Fig. 2C), consistent with lower affinity of AtPRF3Δ37 to Poly-P and positive function in formin-mediated actin assembly (3Sun H. Qiao Z. Chua K.P. Tursic A. Liu X. Gao Y.G. Mu Y. Hou X. Miao Y. Profilin negatively regulates formin-mediated actin assembly to modulate PAMP-triggered plant immunity.Curr.

To compare in vivo functions between AtPRF3 and AtPRF3Δ37, we generated heterozygotes diploids ScPFY1/AtPRF3 and ScPFY1/AtPRF3Δ37 expressing actin cable marker Abp140 (Abp140–3GFP) and actin endocytic patch marker Abp1-mRFP. AtPRF3 and AtPRF3Δ37 were expressed normally in diploids, which were detected by anti-Myc antibodies against the N-terminal Myc tags (Fig. S1D). By having the functional allele of ScPFY1, both ScPFY1/AtPRF3 and ScPFY1/AtPRF3Δ37 showed the intact structures of actin cables and patches, although a slight depolarization of Abp1-mRFP was observed (Fig. 3, A and B). To better characterize the mild actin cable defect, we measured the cable elongation rate by following the elongating tip of individual actin cables. ScPFY1/AtPRF3 showed slower cable elongation speed (1.56 ± 0.52 μm/s) compared with that in the ScPFY1/AtPRF3Δ37 (1.71 ± 0.42 μm/s) and ScPFY1/ScPFY1 cells (2.10 ± 0.52 μm/s), respectively (Fig. 3C). We also characterized the in vivo functions of AtPRF isoforms in yeast haploid by examining the actin assembly and actin-mediated endocytosis. Abp1 lifetime records the appearance and disappearance of Abp1 on the plasma membrane that is a sensitive diagnostic approach for investigating endocytosis efficiency (Fig. S1, B and C). An extended lifetime indicates a delayed internalization of the endocytic pit from the plasma membrane. The living cell fluorescence imaging of Abp1 showed a different endocytosis efficiency for each profilin isoform strain (ScPFY1 < AtPRF3Δ37 < AtPRF4 ∼ AtPRF2 < AtPRF1 < AtPRF5 and AtPRF3Δ22) (Fig. 3, D and E). To better understand the functionality of AtPRF3, we solved the crystal structure of AtPRF3Δ37 beyond 1.5 Å resolution. AtPRF3Δ37 is composed of seven anti-parallel β-sheets that are sandwiched by four α-helices (Fig. 4A), demonstrating a canonical profilin fold (1Krishnan K. Moens P.D.J. Structure and functions of profilins.Biophys. Rev. 2009; 1 (28509986): 71-8110.1007/s12551-009-0010-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We also successfully crystallized AtPRF3Δ22, whereas the full-length AtPRF3 was recalcitrant to be crystallized. Eventually, we solved the crystal structure of AtPRF3Δ22 at 3.6 Å resolution by introducing the surface residue mutation AtPRF3Δ22M1 (K33A/K34A/K35A) according to SERP server prediction (7Goldschmidt L. Cooper D.R. Derewenda Z.S. Eisenberg D. Toward rational protein crystallization: a Web server for the design of crystallizable protein variants.Protein Sci. 2007; 16 (17656576): 1569-157610.1110/ps.072914007Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), as well as the additional L136Q mutation AtPRF3Δ22M2 (K33A/K34A/K35A+L136Q) (Fig. S2A). The protein identity of AtPRF3Δ22M2 was verified by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, which showed the molecular mass of ∼16,482.6 Da, in line with the theoretical molecular mass (16,450.8 Da) (Fig. 4C). To characterize AtPRF3Δ22 mutants, we compared their binding affinities to AtFH1 Poly-P (RVPPPPPPPPPLP) by microscale thermophoresis (MST). The dissociation constant (Kd) values of AtPRF3Δ22, AtPRF3Δ22M1, and AtPRF3Δ22M2 to Poly-P were 69.6 ± 2.1, 115.8 ± 7.1, and 114.8 ± 6.7 μm, respectively, suggesting a negligible effect on binding affinity by the L136Q mutation (Fig. 4D). AtPRF3Δ22 moderately decrease the binding affinity to Poly-P, given the Kd values of 29.6 and 175.6 μm for full-length AtPRF3 and the truncated AtPRF3Δ37, respectively (3Sun H. Qiao Z. Chua K.P. Tursic A. Liu X. Gao Y.G. Mu Y. Hou X. Miao Y. Profilin negatively regulates formin-mediated actin assembly to modulate PAMP-triggered plant immunity.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 (29861135): 1882-1895.e710.1016/j.cub.2018.04.045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The structure of AtPRF3Δ22M2 showed a protruding N terminus from Lys31 to Asn37 (KKAAATN), compared with AtPRF3Δ37 (Fig. 4B). However, we were unable to model the residues 23–30 (QRRSRAKV) because they lack clear electron density. This region Lys31–Asn37 does not directly interact with the profilin core domain, appearing to be dynamic. We generated the unbiased Fo − Fc map for all the NTE of 10 chains in the asymmetric unit (Fig. S3, A–J). The main chains of the NTE K31-N37 were well-fitted to the Fo − Fc map. It appears that the AtPRF3Δ22M2 proteins were paired during crystal packing. However, the closest atom distance between the two N termini was 5.0 Å, indicating no direct interaction; therefore crystal packing has little influence on the structural conformation (Fig. S3K). To validate the functionality of AtPRF3Δ22M2 used for crystallization, we examined the in vitro biochemical activities of AtPRF3Δ22, AtPRF3Δ22M1, and AtPRF3Δ22M2. Pyrene-actin–based assay showed that both variants inhibit AtFH1-mediated actin assembly, without distinguishable efficacy to AtPRF3Δ22 (Fig. 5A). Haploid stains expressing AtPRF3Δ22, AtPRF3Δ22M1, and AtPRF3Δ22M2 showed similar growth defects by liquid culturing assay at 25 °C (Fig. 5B). Diploid strains ScPFY1/AtPRF3Δ22, ScPFY1/AtPRF3Δ22M1, and ScPFY1/AtPRF3Δ22M2 expressing fluorescent actin cable and patch markers were generated similarly. By tracking the actin cable growing end in time-lapse imaging of Abp140–3GFP, we measured cable elongation speed of ScPFY1/AtPRF3Δ22 (1.67 ± 0.30 μm/s), ScPFY1/AtPRF3Δ22M1 (1.63 ± 0.16 μm/s), and ScPFY1/AtPRF3Δ22M2 (1.60 ± 0.29 μm/s), respectively, in which no functional difference of AtPRF3Δ22M2 was observed (Fig. 5C). In addition, we quantitatively analyzed in vivo endocytosis efficiency of the AtPRF3Δ22 mutants. Consistently, AtPRF3Δ22M1 and AtPRF3Δ22M2 cells showed no significant difference in the Abp1-mRPF lifetime than that of AtPRF3Δ22 (Fig. 5D), supporting the unchanged in vivo endocytosis in AtPRF3Δ22M2 cells when compared with AtPRF3Δ22. To better understand how Arabidopsis profilins interact with Poly-P, we determined the crystal structures of AtPRF2 in both apo and Poly-P–bound forms at 2.4 and 1.9 Å resolutions, respectively. The structure of AtPRF2 shares the same fold as that of AtPRF1 and AtPRF3Δ37 with RMS deviation values of 0.41 and 0.40 Å for C-α atoms, respectively (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the overall core structure of Arabidopsis profilin is highly conserved. As for the Poly-P–bound AtPRF2, all of the 13 amino acids except for the first arginine in Poly-P can be modeled (Fig. 6B). The Poly-P is held in a hydrophobic groove formed by the first and the fourth helix of AtPRF2, involving the residues His10, Trp33, Leu122, Leu126, Ser129, and Leu131. Notably, Poly-P binds to AtPRF2 with a 1:1 stoichiometry in a similar way as that of plant pollen allergenic profilin (8Offermann L.R. Schlachter C.R. Perdue M.L. Majorek K.A. He J.Z. Booth W.T. Garrett J. Kowal K. Chruszcz M. Structural, functional, and immunological characterization of profilin panallergens Amb a 8, Art v 4, and Bet v 2.J. Biol.

Three key residues (Trp3, Tyr6, and Tyr125) in AtPRF2 and three essential prolines (Pro4, Pro7, and Pro8) in Poly-P are involved in hydrogen-bond formation (Fig. 6C). To test whether these three prolines contribute to AtPRF3 binding directly, we synthesized the mutated mPoly-P (P4A/P7A/P8A). mPoly-P showed a drastic decrease in binding toward AtPRF3Δ22, with a Kd over 400 μm (Fig. 6D), which validated the importance of the three prolines (Pro4, Pro7, and Pro8) in profilin binding. No significant conformational change of AtPRF2 was observed upon the binding of Poly-P compared with its apo form. Given that the profilin core of AtPRF2 and AtPRF3 is highly conserved, we compared the structure of AtPRF3Δ22M2 with the Poly-P–bound AtPRF2 and found that Lys31–Asn37 residues of AtPRF3Δ22M2 occupied the Poly-P–binding pocket (Fig. S4A). To test whether AtPRF3 NTE is able to open and thereby enable the Poly-P binding, we examined its flexibility using Hamiltonian replica-exchange molecular dynamics (H-REMD) simulations, with L136Q mutation corrected to Leu136 during modeling (9Wang L. Friesner R.A. Berne B.J. Replica exchange with solute scaling: a more efficient version of replica exchange with solute tempering (REST2).J. Phys. Chem. B. 2011; 115 (21714551): 9431-943810.1021/jp204407dCrossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The H-REMD simulation was summarized in the free-energy surface that was shown as a function of the dihedral angle formed by α carbons of the residues Thr36–Ser39 against the center of the mass distance between the NTE and the C-terminal helix (CTH) (Fig. S4B). Seven local minima with representative structures were extracted by geometric clustering, which describes the conformational states of the AtPRF3Δ22M1 (Fig. 7, A and B, and Table S1). Each representative structure of the local minimum was defined as an “open” state if no structural clash was observed between the AtPRF3Δ22M1 and the Poly-P; otherwise, a “closed” state was defined. We found that minimums 1–4 represent closed conformations, whereas minimum 6 represents an open conformation. We consider minimums 5 and 7 to be “semiopen” conformations because a minor structural clash with the Poly-P was observed; thus Poly-P–binding sites were not occluded by AtPRF3Δ22M1. We also used various simulated time from 550 and 650 ns to show that the simulation of NTE is converged (Fig. S4, C and D). The free-energy landscape reveals the dynamic nature of the AtPRF3Δ22M1, which adopts diverse conformations to occlude or accommodate the Poly-P binding, thus fine-tune regulating actin filament assembly. Two positive charged clusters, Arg24/Arg25/Arg27 and Lys31–Lys35 (particularly the former) in the NTE, could positively be involved in Poly-P binding. To further understand the molecular interactions between the AtPRF3Δ22 NTE and Poly-P, we generated AtPRF3Δ22M3 (R24A/R25A/R27A+K33A/K34A/K35A). AtPRF3Δ22, AtPRF3Δ22M1, and AtPRF3Δ22M3 all showed a marginal difference in Poly-P binding using MST binding assay (Fig. 4D and Fig. S4E). We modeled the Poly-P–bound structure of AtPRF3Δ22 variants by applying the representative structure of AtPRF3Δ22M1 in the open conformation (from minimum 6) with “docked” Poly-P. The Gln23–Val30 was modeled with an extended and disordered conformation. These conformations of the representative clusters obtained from molecular dynamics simulations and the following geometric clustering analysis were extracted for binding energy calculations using the molecular mechanics–Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method (10Genheden S. Ryde U. The MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods to estimate ligand-binding affinities.Expert Opin. Drug Discov. 2015; 10 (25835573): 449-46110.1517/17460441.2015.1032936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). For comparison, simulations and binding energy analysis were also performed for the Poly-P–bound AtPRF3Δ37 in which the NTE is absent. AtPRF3Δ22, AtPRF3Δ22M1, and AtPRF3Δ22M3 all showed different contact sites toward Poly-P binding with different contact occupancies (Table 1). Moreover, by calculating the binding energy, the AtPRF3Δ22, AtPRF3Δ22M1, and AtPRF3Δ22M3 clusters showed comparable binding free energy but lower than AtPRF3Δ37 (Table 2). Interestingly, after the simulations were converged, we did not notice any obvious formation of helix structure in NTE, indicating its disordered nature. Considering intrinsically disordered region evolving fast by having low sequence conservation, which enables it to have weak and nonspecific interaction with binding partners, together with molecular dynamic simulations showed that AtPRF3Δ22M1 and AtPRF3Δ22M3 had evolving contact sites toward Poly-P binding, it is very likely that NTE adopts dynamic and nonspecific binding to Poly-P, which is also in agreement with the reported phenomena that peptides with flanked core region could dynamically evolve nonspecific interaction at the binding interface (11Frappier V.

Both the profilin affinity to Poly-P tracts and the distance between Poly-P tracts and FH2 domain could directly affect the actin transfer efficiency (13Courtemanche N. Pollard T.D.

Arabidopsis AtPRF3 demonstrated a high binding affinity toward formin Poly-P, suggesting adverse effects in formin-mediated actin elongation. The AtPRF3 NTE gives the tight binding to Poly-P in a length-dependent manner, whereas the removal of the N-terminal 37 residues entirely reverted its inhibitory effect on actin assembly in vitro (3Sun H.

Here, the in vitro competition assay validates the inhibitory effect of AtPRF3 on actin polymerization in the presence of AtFH1. Moreover, in vivo yeast reconstitution system fully recapitulated the adverse effects of AtPRF3 NTE in regulating intracellular actin assembly and the viability of the cells. A tight Poly-P binding demonstrated an adverse effect of AtPRF3 that might be derived from the mechanical gating mechanism, such as constraining the rotation or slippage of the FH2 dimer around the F-actin filament for releasing the torsion stress that accumulates during elongation (14Otomo T.

https://openalex.org/W2981567414,"This study analyzes the long-run effects of secondary school track assignment for students at the achievement margin. Theoretically, track assignment maximizes individual outcomes when thresholds between tracks are set at the level of the indifferent student, and any other thresholds would imply that students at or around the margin are better off by switching tracks. We exploit non-linearities in the probability of track assignment across achievement to empirically identify the effect of track assignment on educational attainment and wages of students in the Netherlands, who can be assigned to four different tracks. We find that attending higher tracks leads to increases in years of schooling by around 1.5 years for students at the lowest and the highest choice margin, and wage gains of around 15% and 5%, respectively. For the margin between the two middle tracks, attending the higher of the two tracks has no effect on educational attainment and decreases wages by around 12%. The negative returns for the medium margin and the relatively low returns for the higher margin (compared to the required educational investments) are partly mediated by motivation and study choice."
https://openalex.org/W2981613250,"Most, but not all cnidarian species in the class Hydrozoa have a life cycle in which a colonial, asexually reproducing hydroid phase alternates with a free-swimming, sexually reproducing medusa phase. They are not well known, in part because many of them are microscopic, at least in the medusa phase. Matching the two phases has previously required rearing of the organism from one phase to another, which has not often been possible. Here we show that DNA barcoding makes it possible to easily link life-cycle phases without the need for laboratory rearing. Hydrozoan medusae were collected by zooplankton tows in Newport Bay and the Pacific Ocean near Newport Beach, California, and hydroid colonies were collected from solid substrates in the same areas. Specimens were documented by videomicroscopy, preserved in ethanol, and sent to the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada for sequencing of the COI DNA barcode. In the order Anthoathecata (athecate hydroids), DNA barcoding allowed for the discrimination between the medusae of eight putative species of Bougainvillia, and the hydroid stages were documented for two of these. The medusae of three putative species of Amphinema were identified, and the hydroid stages were identified for two of them. DNA barcodes were obtained from medusae of one species of Cladonema, one adult of the by-the wind Sailor, Velella velella, five putative species of Corymorpha with the matching hydroid phase for one; and Coryne eximia, Turritopsis dohrnii and Turritopsis nutricula with the corresponding hydroid phases. The actinula larvae and hydroid for the pink-hearted hydroid Ectopleura crocea were identified and linked by DNA barcoding. In the order Leptothecata (thecate hydroids) medusae were identified for Clytia elsaeoswaldae, Clytia gracilis and Clytia sp. 701 AC and matched with the hydroid phases for the latter two species. Medusae were matched with the hydroid phases for two species of Obelia (including O. dichotoma) and Eucheilota bakeri. Obelia geniculata was collected as a single hydroid. DNA barcodes were obtained for hydroids of Orthopyxis everta and three other species of Orthopyxis. One member of the family Solmarisidae, representing the order Narcomedusae, and one member (Liriope tetraphylla) of the order Trachymedusae were recognized as medusae. The results show the utility of DNA barcoding for matching life-cycle stages as well as for documenting the diversity of this class of organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2981661889,"Percutaneous osseointegrated (OI) devices for amputees are metallic endoprostheses, that are surgically implanted into the residual stump bone and protrude through the skin, allowing attachment of an exoprosthetic limb. In contrast to standard socket suspension systems, these percutaneous OI devices provide superior attachment platforms for artificial limbs. However, bone adaptation, which includes atrophy and/or hypertrophy along the extent of the host bone-endoprosthetic interface, is seen clinically and depends upon where along the bone the device ultimately transfers loading forces to the skeletal system. The goal of this study was to determine if a percutaneous OI device, designed with a porous coated distal region and an end-loading collar, could promote and maintain stable bone attachment. A total of eight, 18 to 24-month old, mixed-breed sheep were surgically implanted with a percutaneous OI device. For 24-months, the animals were allowed to bear weight as tolerated and were monitored for signs of bone remodelling. At necropsy, the endoprosthesis and the surrounding tissues were harvested, radiographically imaged, and histomorphometrically analyzed to determine the periprosthetic bone adaptation in five animals. Bone growth into the porous coating was achieved in all five animals. Serial radiographic data showed stress-shielding related bone adaptation occurs based on the placement of the endoprosthetic stem. When collar placement and achieved end-bearing against the transected bone, distal bone conservation/hypertrophy was observed. The results supported the use of a distally loading and distally porous coated percutaneous OI device to achieve distal host bone maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2982358044,"During autumn in the temperate zone, insectivorous male bats face a profound energetic challenge, as in the same period they have to make energy choices related to hibernation, mating and migration. To investigate these energetic trade-offs, we compared the body mass of male and female pond bats (Myotis dasycneme) through the summer season, characterized the known hibernacula in terms of male or female bias, and subsequently compared their population trend during two study periods, between 1930-1980 and 1980-2015. Towards the end of summer, males began losing weight whilst females were simultaneously accumulating fat, suggesting that males were pre-occupied with mating. We also found evidence for a recent adaptation to this energetic trade-off, males have colonised winter roosts in formerly unoccupied areas, which has consequently led to a change in the migration patterns for the male population of this species. As male bats do not assist in raising offspring, males have ample time to restore their energy balance after hibernation. Our results suggest that choosing a hibernacula closer to the summer range not only decreases energy cost needed for migration, it also lengthens the mating season of the individual male. Our findings have important conservation implications, as male and female biased hibernation assemblages may differ critically in terms of microclimate preferences."

The magnitude and impact of the patient interval and primary care interval is well-known in oral cancer; however, the hospital interval and its influence on surviving this neoplasia are not well known.To quantify the interval between the first contact with the specialist and the start of treatment for patients with oral cancer and to evaluate whether there was a link between this interval and disease survival.We designed a hospital-based study that included 228 patients diagnosed with oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma between 1998 and 2008 at A Coruña University Hospital (Spain) who were followed up until 2016. The data were extracted retrospectively from hospital medical charts. The study interval was defined in the context of the ""pathways to treatment"" model as the interval from the first specialist visit (start point) to the start of treatment (end point). We calculated the total interval (from first symptom to treatment) to evaluate the relative length of the hospital interval, and we considered the variables age, sex, location, comorbidity and tumour classification stage. Survival time was defined as the interval from the first treatment to death or censoring.The median hospital interval was 20 days, with an interquartile range of 15-29.1 days. The most relevant prognostic variable was the tumour stage (III-IV: Exp. ß = 2.8, p = 0.001). The hospital interval was part of the multivariate model, and its association with mortality showed a V-shaped association, where patients with short hospital intervals (3-18 days) and those with long hospital intervals (26-55 days) had significantly higher mortality than those with medium hospital intervals (19-25 days).The hospital interval represents a relevant interval for the patient's path towards treatment, has prognostic implications and is subject to a severity bias (waiting time paradox) that should be avoided."

With the expanding industrial sectors, many international conventions were established in order to reduce the emission of dioxins in the past two decades. The Stockholm convention, a global monitoring treaty, entered into force in 2004 with the aim to promote development of strategies to reduce or eliminate dioxin emissions. According to the convention, parties are required to develop national inventory databases to report emission levels and develop a national implementation plan (NIP) to reduce further dioxin emissions. In order to understand the trend of dioxin emissions since 1990s this study provides a comparative assessment of dioxin emissions from different industrial sources by deriving emission data from the national inventory databases of Australia, Canada and the 28 European countries (EU-28). According to the data collected, iron and steel production and electricity generation were the highest emitters of dioxins in 2017 for Europe, Canada and Australia, when compared to other stationary industrial sources. The change in the trend of dioxin emissions from the iron and steel industry and the public electricity sector was also assessed. The emission of dioxins during 1990-2017 from both iron and steel production and electricity generation revealed a relative decreasing trend, except for Spain and Italy who showed higher level of emissions from iron and steel production in 2017. Furthermore, comparing emission data for metal production revealed that the blast furnace process was the prominent emitter of dioxins comparing to electric arc furnace process. Further investigation was performed to compare the amount of dioxin emitted from three different fuel types, black coal, brown coal and natural gas, used for electricity generation in Australia. The study showed that dioxin emissions from brown coal were higher than black coal for the last two years, while power production from natural gas emits the lowest amounts of dioxins to the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2981738168,"Exercise induced intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP) is a common cause of airway obstruction and poor performance in racehorses. The definite etiology is still unclear, but through an experimental model, a role in the development of this condition was identified in the dysfunction of the thyro-hyoid muscles. The present study aimed to elucidate the nature of this dysfunction by investigating the spontaneous response to exercise of the thyro-hyoid muscles in racehorses with naturally occurring DDSP. Intramuscular electrodes were implanted in the thyro-hyoid muscles of nine racehorses, and connected to a telemetric unit for electromyographic monitoring implanted subcutaneously. The horses were recruited based on upper airway function evaluated through wireless endoscopy during exercise. Five horses, with normal function, were used as control; four horses were diagnosed as DDSP-affected horses based on repeated episodes of intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate. The electromyographic activity of the thyro-hyoid muscles recorded during incremental exercise tests on a high-speed treadmill was analyzed to measure the mean electrical activity and the median frequency of the power spectrum, thereafter subjected to wavelet decomposition. The affected horses had palatal instability with displacement on repeated exams prior to surgical implantation. Although palatal instability persisted after surgery, only two of these horses displaced the palate after instrumentation. The electromyographic traces from this group of four horses showed, at highest exercise intensity, a decrease in mean electrical activity and median power frequency, with progressive decrease in the contribution of the high frequency wavelets, consistent with development of thyro-hyoid muscle fatigue. The results of this study identified fatigue as the main factor leading to exercise induced palatal instability and DDSP in a group of racehorses. Further studies are required to evaluate the fiber type composition and metabolic characteristics of the thyro-hyoid muscles that could predispose to fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2981748956,"Rigorous spatiotemporal regulation of cell division is required to maintain genome stability. The final stage in cell division, when the cells physically separate (abscission), is tightly regulated to ensure that it occurs after cytokinetic events such as chromosome segregation. A key regulator of abscission timing is Aurora B kinase activity, which inhibits abscission and forms the major activity of the abscission checkpoint. This checkpoint prevents abscission until chromosomes have been cleared from the cytokinetic machinery. Here we demonstrate that the mitosis-specific CDK11p58 kinase specifically forms a complex with cyclin L1β that, in late cytokinesis, localizes to the stem body, a structure in the middle of the intercellular bridge that forms between two dividing cells. Depletion of CDK11 inhibits abscission, and rescue of this phenotype requires CDK11p58 kinase activity or inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity. Furthermore, CDK11p58 kinase activity is required for formation of endosomal sorting complex required for transport III filaments at the site of abscission. Combined, these data suggest that CDK11p58 kinase activity opposes Aurora B activity to enable abscission to proceed and result in successful completion of cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2981800611,"Endoplasmic reticulum protein of 29 kDa (ERp29) is a thioredoxin-homologous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that regulates the biogenesis of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). ERp29 may promote ENaC cleavage and increased open probability by directing ENaC to the Golgi via coat complex II (COP II) during biogenesis. We hypothesized that ERp29’s C-terminal KEEL ER retention motif, a KDEL variant that is associated with less robust ER retention, strongly influences its regulation of ENaC biogenesis. As predicted by our previous work, depletion of Sec24D, the cargo recognition component of COP II that we previously demonstrated to interact with ENaC, decreases ENaC functional expression without altering β-ENaC expression at the apical surface. We then tested the influence of KDEL ERp29, which should be more readily retrieved from the proximal Golgi by the KDEL receptor (KDEL-R), and a KEEL-deleted mutant (ΔKEEL ERp29), which should not interact with the KDEL-R. ENaC functional expression was decreased by ΔKEEL ERp29 overexpression, whereas KDEL ERp29 overexpression did not significantly alter ENaC functional expression. Again, β-ENaC expression at the apical surface was unaltered by either of these manipulations. Finally, we tested whether the KDEL-R itself has a role in ENaC forward trafficking and found that KDEL-R depletion decreases ENaC functional expression, again without altering β-ENaC expression at the apical surface. These results support the hypothesis that the KDEL-R plays a role in the biogenesis of ENaC and in its exit from the ER through its association with COP II. The cleavage of the extracellular loops of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) α and γ subunits increases the channel’s open probability and function. During ENaC biogenesis, such cleavage is regulated by the novel 29-kDa chaperone of the ER, ERp29. Our data here are consistent with the hypothesis that ERp29 must interact with the KDEL receptor to exert its regulation of ENaC biogenesis. The classically described role of the KDEL receptor is to retrieve ER-retained species from the proximal Golgi and return them to the ER via coat complex I machinery.

https://openalex.org/W2981971283,"We show that a two-component proportional representation provides the necessary framework to account for the properties of a 2 × 2 contingency table. This corresponds to the factorization of the table as a product of proportion and diagonal row or column sum matrices. The row and column sum invariant measures for proportional variation are obtained. Geometrically, these correspond to displacements of two point vectors in the standard one-simplex, which are reduced to a center-of-mass coordinate representation, . Then, effect size measures, such as the odds ratio and relative risk, correspond to different perspective functions for the mapping of (δ, μ) to . Furthermore, variations in δ and μ will be associated with different cost-benefit trade-offs for a given application. Therefore, pure mathematics alone does not provide the specification of a general form for the perspective function. This implies that the question of the merits of the odds ratio versus relative risk cannot be resolved in a general way. Expressions are obtained for the marginal sum dependence and the relations between various effect size measures, including the simple matching coefficient, odds ratio, relative risk, Yule’s Q, ϕ, and Goodman and Kruskal’s τc|r. We also show that Gini information gain (IGG) is equivalent to ϕ2 in the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm. Then, IGG can yield misleading results due to the dependence on marginal sums. Monte Carlo methods facilitate the detailed specification of stochastic effects in the data acquisition process and provide a practical way to estimate the confidence interval for an effect size."
https://openalex.org/W2982266214,"Fatigue is a disabling problem in patients with visual impairment, but its etiology is still poorly understood. Our objective was to identify the determinants of fatigue in adults with visual impairment compared to adults with normal sight.Cross-sectional data on fatigue and sociodemographic, psychological and health-related factors was obtained with validated questionnaires. Structural equational modeling using hypothesized relationships and explorative analyses were used to identify (in)direct pathways contributing to fatigue in 247 adults with visual impairment. The model was then tested in a reference group of 151 adults with normal sight.The final model explained 64% of fatigue variance in participants with visual impairment and revealed the following factors to be directly associated with fatigue: depressive symptoms (β = 0.723, p<0.001), perceived health (β = -0.158, p = 0.004), accommodative coping (β = 0.116, p = 0.030) and somatic comorbidity (β = 0.311, p = 0.001). Self-efficacy demonstrated a beneficial indirect effect on fatigue (β = -0.228, p<0.001) mediated by depression, accommodative coping and perceived health. Sleep disorder had an indirect effect on fatigue (β = 0.656, p<0.001) mediated by depression and perceived health. After removal of sleep disorder, the model explained 58% of the fatigue variance in normally sighted adults but pathways involving accommodative coping and somatic comorbidity were not confirmed.These findings suggest that depression and perceived health are important mediating factors that contribute to fatigue in persons with visual impairment and normal sight. In contrast, somatic comorbidity, sleep disorders and accommodative coping seem to have a specific contribution to vision-related fatigue. These factors should be addressed in interventions to assist individuals with visual impairment in dealing with fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2982203850,"Dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) projections are often put forth to aid resource managers in climate change-related decision making. However, interpreting model results and understanding their uncertainty can be difficult. Sources of uncertainty include embedded assumptions about atmospheric CO2 levels, uncertain climate projections driving DGVMs, and DGVM algorithm selection. For western Oregon and Washington, we implemented an Environmental Evaluation Modeling System (EEMS) decision support model using MC2 DGVM results to characterize biomass loss risk. MC2 results were driven by climate projections from 20 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models (ESMs), under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, with and without assumed fire suppression, for three different time periods. We produced maps of mean, minimum, and maximum biomass loss risk and uncertainty for each RCP / +/- fire suppression / time period. We characterized the uncertainty due to RCP, fire suppression, and climate projection choice. Finally, we evaluated whether fire or climate maladaptation mortality was the dominant driver of risk for each model run. The risk of biomass loss generally increases in current high biomass areas within the study region through time. The pattern of increased risk is generally south to north and upslope into the Coast and Cascade mountain ranges and along the coast. Uncertainty from climate future choice is greater than that attributable to RCP or +/- fire suppression. Fire dominates as the driving factor for biomass loss risk in more model runs than mortality. This method of interpreting DGVM results and the associated uncertainty provides managers with data in a form directly applicable to their concerns and should prove helpful in adaptive management planning."
https://openalex.org/W2982352766,The dependence on model-fitting to evaluate particle trajectories makes it difficult for single particle tracking (SPT) to resolve the heterogeneous molecular motions typical of cells. We present here a global spatiotemporal sampler for SPT solutions using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The sampler does not find just the most likely solution but also assesses its likelihood and presents alternative solutions. This enables the estimation of the tracking error. Furthermore the algorithm samples the parameters that govern the tracking process and therefore does not require any tweaking by the user. We demonstrate the algorithm on synthetic and single molecule data sets. Metrics for the comparison of SPT are generalised to be applied to a SPT sampler. We illustrate using the example of the diffusion coefficient how the distribution of the tracking solutions can be propagated into a distribution of derived quantities. We also discuss the major challenges that are posed by the realisation of a SPT sampler.
https://openalex.org/W2981895858,"Introduction 
Compensatory behaviours may be one of the reasons for the limited success of sedentary time interventions in older adults, but this possibility remains unexplored. Activity compensation is the idea that if we change activity levels at one time we compensate for them at a later time to maintain a set point. We aimed to assess, among adults aged ≥60 years, whether sedentary time and time spent in prolonged sedentary bouts (≥30 mins) on one day were associated with sedentary time and time spent in prolonged sedentary bouts (≥30 mins) on the following day. We also sought to determine whether these associations varied by sociodemographic and comorbid factors.


Methods 
Sedentary time was assessed for seven days using hip-worn accelerometers (ActiGraph GT1M) for 3459 adults who participated in the EPIC-Norfolk Study between 2004 and 2011. We assessed day-to-day associations in total and prolonged bouts of sedentary time using multi-level regressions. We included interaction terms to determine whether associations varied by age, sex, smoking, body mass index, social class, retirement, education and comorbid factors (stroke, diabetes, myocardial infarction and cancer).


Results 
Participants (mean age = 70.3, SD = 6.8 years) accumulated 540 sedentary mins/day (SD = 80.1). On any given day, every 60 minutes spent in sedentary time was associated with 9.9 extra sedentary minutes on the following day (95% CI 9.0, 10.2). This association was greater in non-retired compared to retired participants (non-retired 2.57 extra minutes, p = 0.024) and in current compared to former and never-smokers (5.26 extra mins for current vs former; 5.52 extra mins for current vs never, p = 0.023 and 0.017, respectively). On any given day, every 60 minutes spent in prolonged bouts was associated with 7.8 extra minutes in these bouts the following day (95% CI 7.6, 8.4). This association was greater in older individuals (0.18 extra minutes/year of age, 95% CI 0.061, 0.29), and for retired versus non-retired (retired 2.74 extra minutes, 95% CI 0.21, 5.74).


Conclusion 
Older adults did not display day-to-day compensation. Instead, individuals demonstrate a large stable component of day-to-day time spent sedentary and in prolonged bouts with a small but important capacity for positive variation. Therefore older adults appear to be largely habitual in their sedentary behaviour. Strategies to augment these patterns may be possible, given they may differ by age, smoking, and working status."
