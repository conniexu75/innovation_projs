https://openalex.org/W2946137280,"Large-scale breeding environments often lead to oxidative stress. Macrophages play an important role in the immune system and are vulnerable to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which result in macrophage death. Curcumin is the main active component of turmeric and exerts antioxidant effects. Here, we measured the activity of some antioxidant enzymes and chose the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway to study the protective effects of curcumin on macrophages under oxidative stress in vitro. We used RAW264.7 cells as a research model, and oxidative damage was induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cell viability was measured by an MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to measure cellular ROS and apoptosis. The effect of curcumin on Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway-related genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the translocation of Nrf2 protein was also investigated by Western blot analysis of total and nuclear proteins. All curcumin-treated groups exhibited increased activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX). Low- and middle-dose curcumin decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS levels, but high-dose curcumin increased MDA and ROS production. We found that low-dose curcumin protected cells from apoptosis, while apoptosis in the middle- and high-dose curcumin-treated groups were stagnant in the early stage. Furthermore, middle-dose curcumin upregulated Nrf2 expression after H2O2 treatment for 4 h. Low- and middle-dose curcumin could activate Nrf2 and promote it to migrate into nuclei. The translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus to upregulate the expression of haemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) was promoted in the low- and middle-dose curcumin-treated groups. The middle-dose curcumin-treated group also exhibited enhanced expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase, a modifier subunit (GLCM), but inhibited transcription of glutamate-cysteine ligase, a catalytic subunit (GCLC). Curcumin resisted oxidants by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and activating the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway, which could potentially promote cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2946778292,"Wrist-worn activity trackers have experienced a tremendous growth lately and studies on the accuracy of mainstream trackers used by older adults are needed. This study explores the performance of six trackers (Fitbit Charge2, Garmin VivoSmart HR+, Philips Health Watch, Withings Pulse Ox, ActiGraph GT9X-BT, Omron HJ-72OITC) for estimating: steps, travelled distance, and heart-rate measurements for a cohort of older adults. Eighteen older adults completed a structured protocol involving walking tasks, simulated household activities, and sedentary activities. Less standardized activities were also included, such as: dusting, using a walking aid, or playing cards, in order to simulate real-life scenarios. Wrist-mounted and chest/waist-mounted devices were used. Gold-standards included treadmill, ECG-based chest strap, direct observation or video recording according to the activity and parameter. Every tracker showed a decreasing accuracy with slower walking speed, which resulted in a significant step under-counting. A large mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was found for every monitor at slower walking speeds with the lowest reported MAPE at 2 km/h being 7.78%, increasing to 20.88% at 1.5 km/h, and 44.53% at 1 km/h. During household activities, the MAPE climbing up/down-stairs ranged from 8.38–19.3% and 10.06–19.01% (dominant and non-dominant arm), respectively. Waist-worn devices showed a more uniform performance. However, unstructured activities (e.g. dusting, playing cards), and using a walking aid represent a challenge for all wrist-worn trackers as evidenced by large MAPE (> 57.66% for dusting, > 67.32% when using a walking aid). Poor performance in travelled distance estimation was also evident during walking at low speeds and climbing up/down-stairs (MAPE > 71.44% and > 48.3%, respectively). Regarding heart-rate measurement, there was no significant difference (p-values > 0.05) in accuracy between trackers placed on the dominant or non-dominant arm. Concordant with existing literature, while the mean error was limited (between -3.57 bpm and 4.21 bpm), a single heart-rate measurement could be underestimated up to 30 beats-per-minute. This study showed a number of limitations of consumer-level wrist-based activity trackers for older adults. Therefore caution is required when used, in healthcare or in research settings, to measure activity in older adults."

https://openalex.org/W2946416926,"This paper studies differences in the effect of temperature on cognitive performance by gender in a large controlled lab experiment (N = 543). We study performance in math, verbal and cognitive reflection tasks and find that the effects of temperature vary significantly across men and women. At higher temperatures, women perform better on a math and verbal task while the reverse effect is observed for men. The increase in female performance in response to higher temperature is significantly larger and more precisely estimated than the corresponding decrease in male performance. In contrast to math and verbal tasks, temperature has no impact on a measure of cognitive reflection for either gender. Our findings suggest that gender mixed workplaces may be able to increase productivity by setting the thermostat higher than current standards."
https://openalex.org/W2950533055,"This article describes Bacillus anthracis strains isolated during an outbreak of anthrax on the Yamal Peninsula in the summer of 2016 and independently in Yakutia in 2015. A common feature of these strains is their conservation in permafrost, from which they were extracted either due to the thawing of permafrost (Yamal strains) or as the result of paleontological excavations (Yakut strains). All strains isolated on the Yamal share an identical genotype belonging to lineage B.Br.001/002, pointing to a common source of infection in a territory over 250 km in length. In contrast, during the excavations in Yakutia, three genetically different strains were recovered from a single pit. One strain belongs to B.Br.001/002, and whole genome sequence analysis showed that it is most closely related to the Yamal strains in spite of the remoteness of Yamal from Yakutia. The two other strains contribute to two different branches of A.Br.008/011, one of the remarkable polytomies described so far in the B. anthracis species. The geographic distribution of the strains belonging to A.Br.008/011 is suggesting that the polytomy emerged in the thirteenth century, in combination with the constitution of a unified Mongol empire extending from China to Eastern Europe. We propose an evolutionary model for B. anthracis recent evolution in which the B lineage spread throughout Eurasia and was subsequently replaced by the A lineage except in some geographically isolated areas."

MCR contains a number of unique post-translational modifications in its α subunit, including thioglycine, 1-N-methylhistidine, S-methylcysteine, 5-C-(S)-methylarginine, and 2-C-(S)-methylglutamine. Recently, genes responsible for the thioglycine and methylarginine modifications have been identified in bioinformatics studies and in vivo complementation of select mutants; however, none of these reactions has been verified in vitro. Herein, we purified and biochemically characterized the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) protein MaMmp10, the product of the methanogenesis marker protein 10 gene in the methane-producing archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans. Using an array of approaches, including kinetic assays, LC-MS–based quantification, and MALDI TOF–TOF MS analyses, we found that MaMmp10 catalyzes the methylation of the equivalent of Arg285 in a peptide substrate surrogate, but only in the presence of cobalamin. We noted that the methyl group derives from SAM, with cobalamin acting as an intermediate carrier, and that MaMmp10 contains a C-terminal cobalamin-binding domain. Given that Mmp10 has not been annotated as a cobalamin-binding protein, these findings suggest that cobalamin-dependent radical SAM proteins are more prevalent than previously thought.

https://openalex.org/W2946532957,"Unihemispheric slow wave sleep (USWS) is a unique form of sleep in which one brain hemisphere maintains low voltage electrical activity indicative of waking while the opposite exhibits slow wave electrical activity indicative of sleep. USWS is present in several marine mammals and in some species of birds. One proposed biological function of USWS is to enable the animal to monitor the environment to detect predators or conspecifics. While asymmetrical eye state was often observed during behavioral sleep in birds and marine mammals, electrophysiological (electroencephalogram, EEG) correlates between the asymmetry of eye state and EEG of two cortical hemispheres have not been reliably established. This study examined the association between eye state and EEG activity during aquatic sleep in two subadult northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), taking advantage of the simultaneous visibility of both eyes when the seals were in the prone position. We found that during USWS the eye contralateral to the sleeping hemisphere was closed on average 99.4±0.1% of the recording time. The eye contralateral to the waking hemisphere opened briefly for on average 1.9±0.1 sec with a rate of 8.2±1.0 per min. This eye was open on average 24.8±2.5% of the USWS time and it was closed no longer than 3 sec, on average 39.4±5.6% of the time. These data indicate that fur seals sleep in seawater by having intermittent visual monitoring. Our findings document the extent of visual monitoring of both eyes during USWS and support the idea that USWS allows intermittent visual vigilance. Thus, USWS serves two functions in the fur seal, facilitating movement and visual vigilance, which may also be the case in cetaceans."
https://openalex.org/W2945352670,"It is well known that exogenous trehalose can improve resistances of plants to some abiotic and biotic stresses. Nonetheless, information respecting the molecular responses of tobacco leaves to Tre treatment is limited. Here we show that exogenous Tre can rapidly reduce stomatal aperture, up-regulate NADPH oxidase genes and increase O2•-andH2O2 on tobacco leaves at 2 h after treatment. We further demonstrated that imidazole and DPI, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, can promote recovery of stomatal aperture of tobacco leaves upon trehalose treatment. Exogenous trehalose increased tobacco leaf resistance to tobacco mosaic disease significantly in a concentration-dependent way. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms in response to exogenous trehalose, the transcriptomic responses of tobacco leaves with 10 (low concentration) or 50 (high concentration) mM of trehalose treatment at 2 or 24h were investigated through RNA-seq approach. In total, 1288 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found with different conditions of trehalose treatments relative to control. Among them, 1075 (83.5%) were triggered by low concentration of trehalose (10mM), indicating that low concentration of Tre is a better elicitor. Functional annotations with KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs are involved in metabolic pathway, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction, protein processing in ER, flavonoid synthesis and circadian rhythm and so on. The protein-protein interaction networks generated from the core DEGs regulated by all conditions strikingly revealed that eight proteins, including ClpB1, HSP70, DnaJB1-like protein, universal stress protein (USP) A-like protein, two FTSH6 proteins, GolS1-like protein and chloroplastics HSP, play a core role in responses to exogenous trehalose in tobacco leaves. Our data suggest that trehalose triggers a signal transduction pathway which involves calcium and ROS-mediated signalings. These core components could lead to partial resistance or tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Moreover, 19 DEGs were chosen for analysis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR for the 19 candidate genes coincided with the DEGs identified via the RNA-seq analysis, sustaining the reliability of our RNA-seq data."
https://openalex.org/W2945675231,"The development of industrial agriculture has enabled a sharp increase in food trade at the global scale. Worldwide trade underpins food security by distributing food surpluses to food deficient countries. The study of agricultural product flows can provide insights on the complex interactions between exporting and importing countries and the resulting network structures. Commercial partnerships between countries can be modelled using a complex network approach. Based on the detailed trade matrices from FAO covering the period from 1986 to 2013, we present an analysis of the world cereal trade in terms of weighted and directed networks. The network nodes are the countries and the links are the trades of agricultural products in mass. We reveal the changing topology and degree distribution of the world network during the studied period. We distinguish three entangled subnetwork structures when considering the temporal stability of the trades. The three subnetworks display distinct properties and a differential contribution in total trade. Trades of uninterrupted activity over the 28-year study period compose the backbone network which accounts for two thirds of all traded mass and is scale-free. Inversely, two thirds of the trades only have one or two consecutive years of activity and define the transient subnetwork which displays random growth and accounts for very little traded mass. The trades of intermediate duration display an exponential growth both in numbers and in traded mass and define the intermediate subnetwork. The topology of each subnetwork is a time invariant. The identification of invariant structures is a useful basis for developing prospective agri-food network modelling to assess their resilience to perturbations and shocks."

We hypothesized that the local chromatin environment, including differential enhancer activities, contributes to various p53-dependent transcriptional activities in different cell types during stress-induced signaling. In this work, using ChIP-sequencing, immunoblotting, quantitative PCR, and computational analyses across various mammalian cell lines, we demonstrate that the p53-induced transcriptome varies by cell type, reflects cell type–specific activities, and is considerably broader than previously anticipated. We found that these molecular events are strongly influenced by p53’s engagement with differentially active cell type–specific enhancers and promoters. We also observed that p53 activity depends on the p53 family member tumor protein p63 in epithelial cell types. Notably, we demonstrate that p63 is required for epithelial enhancer identity, including enhancers used by p53 during stress-dependent signaling. Loss of p63, but not p53, caused site-specific depletion of enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, suggesting that p63 functions as an enhancer maintenance factor in epithelial cells. Additionally, a subset of epithelial-specific enhancers depends on the activity of p63 providing a direct link between lineage determination and enhancer structure. These results suggest that a broad, cell-intrinsic mechanism controls p53-dependent cellular stress response through differential regulation of cis-regulatory elements.

These results suggest that a broad, cell-intrinsic mechanism controls p53-dependent cellular stress response through differential regulation of cis-regulatory elements. The p53 family of transcription factors regulates highly-diverse cellular functions, including tumor suppression and control of cell specification and identity (1.Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. The p53/p63/p73 family of transcription factors: overlapping and distinct functions.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113 (10769197): 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p53 is a master tumor suppressor that protects organismal fidelity after exposure to cellular stress-like DNA damage. This activity depends on p53's ability to activate transcription of a canonical network of genes involved in DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence (2.Kastenhuber E.R. Lowe S.W. Putting p53 in context.Cell. 2017; 170 (28886379): 1062-107810.1016/j.cell.2017.08.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Many of these canonical transcriptional pathways are individually dispensable for tumor suppression, suggesting p53 regulates a redundant and not yet fully characterized transcriptional network (3.Andrysik Z.

Fate choice after p53 activation, be it apoptosis, temporary/permanent cell cycle arrest, or continued proliferation, is variable across cell types suggesting that p53-dependent transcription is also cell type–dependent (2.Kastenhuber E.R. Lowe S.W. Putting p53 in context.Cell. 2017; 170 (28886379): 1062-107810.1016/j.cell.2017.08.028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). A bevy of sensitive methodological approaches has been used to identify p53-binding sites and gene targets across transformed and primary cell lines in an effort to explain these terminal cell fate choices and p53-dependent tumor suppression. A recent set of meta-analyses has suggested that p53 binding to the genome is invariant (25.Verfaillie A. Svetlichnyy D. Imrichova H. Davie K. Fiers M. Kalender Atak Z. Hulselmans G. Christiaens V. Aerts S. Multiplex enhancer-reporter assays uncover unsophisticated TP53 enhancer logic.Genome Res. 2016; 26 (27197205): 882-89510.1101/gr.204149.116Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), proposing that p53 acts independently to drive gene expression of a core tumor suppressor network across all cell types due to the low enrichment of other transcription factor motifs at p53-bound enhancers and the reported pioneer factor activity of p53 (3.Andrysik Z.

Conversely, a series of recent p53 ChIP-seq experiments observed cell type–specific p53 binding and gene targets (27.Nguyen T.T. Grimm S.A. Bushel P.R. Li J. Li Y. Bennett B.D. Lavender C.A. Ward J.M. Fargo D.C. Anderson C.W. Li L. Resnick M.A. Menendez D.

Stereotyped p53 binding tuned by chromatin accessibility.bioRxiv. 2017; (10.1101/177667)Google Scholar). Because of the high importance of these conflicting observations and the mutual exclusivity of the models, additional experimental evidence and models are required to unravel these disparate p53 regulatory mechanisms. We previously proposed that the local chromatin environment, including variable chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity, contributes to novel p53 activities across cell types (29.Sammons M.A. Zhu J. Drake A.M. Berger S.L. TP53 engagement with the genome occurs in distinct local chromatin environments via pioneer factor activity.Genome Res. 2015; 25 (25391375): 179-18810.1101/gr.181883.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To address this question, we performed genomewide transcriptome, epigenome, and p53 cistrome profiling in primary foreskin fibroblasts (SkFib) and mammary basal epithelial (MCF10A) cell lines, two cell types with varying enhancer activity at p53-binding sites (29.Sammons M.A. Zhu J. Drake A.M. Berger S.L. TP53 engagement with the genome occurs in distinct local chromatin environments via pioneer factor activity.Genome Res. 2015; 25 (25391375): 179-18810.1101/gr.181883.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our results directly implicate differential cis-regulatory element activity as a mediator of the p53 network, with both differential promoter and enhancer activity contributing to p53-dependent gene expression variability. Furthermore, we have identified the p53 family member p63 as one factor that drives the epithelial-specific p53 transcriptome through an enhancer maintenance activity. We further propose that p63 serves as a pioneer factor for a set of epithelial-specific enhancers. Thus, these data support a mechanism whereby cooperating transcription factors control cell type–dependent cis-regulatory networks that regulate p53 activity. Gene activation downstream of p53 stabilization has been extensively studied, but whether p53 transcriptionally activates the same genes across all cell types is still unresolved. Previous work suggested that p53-dependent transcriptional activity might vary between epithelial cells and fibroblasts due to differences in predicted enhancer activity between the two cell types (29.Sammons M.A. Zhu J. Drake A.M. Berger S.L. TP53 engagement with the genome occurs in distinct local chromatin environments via pioneer factor activity.Genome Res. 2015; 25 (25391375): 179-18810.1101/gr.181883.114Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We chose two widely used model cell lines (MCF10A mammary epithelial cells and dermal foreskin fibroblasts) to address this unresolved question. The two cell types differ in developmental origin, with dermal fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells arising from mesoderm and ectoderm, respectively. Importantly, both cell types are nontumorigenic in mouse models, suggesting they represent a nontransformed state. We performed three biological replicates of poly(A)-enriched, strand-specific RNA-seq in both cell lines after p53 activation in response to a 6-h treatment with 5 μm Nutlin-3A. Nutlin-3A is a highly-specific MDM2 antagonist that leads to p53 stabilization without activation of p53-independent DNA damage pathways that can confound analysis (30.Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E.A. In vivo activation of the p53 pathway by small-molecule antagonists of MDM2.Science. 2004; 303 (14704432): 844-84810.1126/science.1092472Crossref PubMed Scopus (3784) Google Scholar). Raw data were aligned using STAR, and differentially expressed genes were called using DESeq2. Use of a stringent cutoff (2-fold increase in expression after Nutlin-3A treatment, q value <0.05) revealed different patterns of gene expression for MCF10A versus SkFib (Fig. 1A). Genes up-regulated in both cell lines are significantly associated with the core p53 response and programmed cell death (Fig. 1B and Table S1), as expected. MCF10A displayed a larger group of Nutlin-3A–induced targets enriched in gene ontology groups related to establishment of the epithelial barrier and p53-dependent processes like programmed cell death and homeostasis (Fig. 1, A and B). SkFib showed a markedly smaller, albeit specific, p53-activated transcriptome (Fig. 1A). These genes are associated with other cell stress-related pathways, including those associated with the hypoxia response and catabolic processes. Allowing for any change in expression while maintaining a corrected p value of less than 0.05 yielded an increased number of commonly and differentially regulated genes, but the trend that p53-dependent gene targets are more abundant in MCF10A cells remained consistent across analytic methods (Fig. S1A). Orthogonal validation by qRT-PCR confirmed a stringent cell-type specificity for the tested set of genes identified by RNA-seq (Fig. 1, C–E). Up-regulation of canonical p53 targets like BTG2 and CDKN1A are indeed similar across cell types (Fig. 1C). Many of the cell type–specific targets were undetected or detected at extremely low levels in the opposing cell type (Fig. 1, D and E). The majority of the MCF10A-specific targets represent novel p53-dependent genes not previously identified in a large-scale meta-analysis of human p53 gene targets (32.Fischer M. Census and evaluation of p53 target genes.Oncogene. 2017; 36 (28288132): 3943-395610.1038/onc.2016.502Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Over 20% of newly identified SkFib-specific targets have not been observed previously (Fig. 1F and Tables S2 and S3). These initial analyses reveal that the p53-activated transcriptome varies between nontransformed cell types and may reflect tailored, cell type–dependent responses after cellular stress. To confirm the p53-dependent nature of these Nutlin-3A–induced genes, p53 mRNA and protein expression were depleted using shRNA in both MCF10A and SkFib (Fig. 1, G and H, and J and K). Knockdown of p53 in SkFib (Fig. 1, G and H) led to sharp reduction in both basal and Nutlin-3A–induced expression of the SkFib-specific genes, GDNF and TRIM55 (Fig. 1I). Depletion of p53 in MCF10A (Fig. 1, J and K) caused a loss of Nutlin-3A–induced RIC3 and IL1B expression relative to a nontargeting control shRNA (Fig. 1L). Taken together, our RNA-seq analysis and p53-depletion experiments indicate differential activation of p53-dependent targets across nontransformed cell lines. The most straightforward potential mechanism driving our observation of cell type–dependent transcriptional activation by p53 involves differential binding of p53 to regulatory regions controlling those genes. Recent analyses reached opposing conclusions with regard to the cell type–dependence of p53 engagement with the genome (3.Andrysik Z. Galbraith M.D. Guarnieri A.L. Zaccara S. Sullivan K.D. Pandey A. MacBeth M. Inga A. Espinosa J.M.

Stereotyped p53 binding tuned by chromatin accessibility.bioRxiv. 2017; (10.1101/177667)Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether differences in p53 engagement with the genome in our model cell lines might explain our observations of cell type–dependent transcriptomes. Two biological replicates of p53 ChIP-seq were performed in either DMSO or Nutlin-3A–treated MCF10A and SkFib. Regions of significant p53 enrichment relative to input (peaks) were called using MACS2 (33.Zhang Y. Liu T. Meyer C.A. Eeckhoute J. Johnson D.S. Bernstein B.E. Nusbaum C. Myers R.M. Brown M. Li W. Liu X.S. Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS).Genome Biol. 2008; 9 (18798982): R13710.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137Crossref PubMed Scopus (8536) Google Scholar). Only peaks identified in both replicates were considered for further analysis (see under “Experimental procedures”). Consistent with the cell type-dependence of our gene expression observations, our ChIP-seq approach revealed a highly-enriched set of MCF10A-specific p53-binding sites and a smaller number of SkFib-specific sites (Fig. 2A). A highly-similar set of differential p53-binding events was also observed using the DiffBind statistical framework (Fig. S1B), suggesting the differential binding is unlikely to be an artifact of any one peak calling or replication strategy. Taken together, our peak calling approaches indicate differential genome engagement of p53 in MCF10A versus SkFib. At commonly bound sites, basal and Nutlin-3A–induced p53 enrichment is higher in MCF10A relative to SkFib (Fig. 2B). Despite higher overall occupancy in MCF10A, SkFib show higher relative fold-change in p53 enrichment between DMSO and Nutlin-3A treatment (Fig. 2B). Relatedly, absolute p53 occupancy differences do not correlate with the ability to activate common gene targets as Nutlin-3A induced gene fold-changes are higher in SkFib compared with MCF10A (Fig. 2C). Cell type–specific binding events displayed lower absolute p53 occupancy than at common sites, suggesting that common sites might represent more stable or higher affinity p53-binding sites (Fig. 2, B, D and E). This observation is in line with previous observations in transformed cancer cell lines and suggests a core set of p53-binding events is well-conserved across cell types (3.Andrysik Z. Galbraith M.D. Guarnieri A.L. Zaccara S. Sullivan K.D. Pandey A. MacBeth M. Inga A. Espinosa J.M.

We then wanted to validate our observations of differential p53 binding using standard ChIP-qPCR methods. p53 binding at the CDKN1A promoter in both MCF10A and SkFib increased in response to Nutlin-3A treatment and was sensitive to depletion of p53 by shRNA (Fig. 2F). ChIP signal at the CDKN1A promoter was more highly enriched relative to a region ≈4 kb upstream of the binding event, confirming the specificity of p53 binding. Examination of p53 binding at two genomic locations in SkFib and MCF10A confirmed our ChIP-seq studies. p53 binding was enriched at the BDNF locus in SkFib and was sensitive to p53 depletion, whereas the signal observed in MCF10A was at a background level and not affected by either Nutlin-3A treatment or p53 knockdown (Fig. 2G). Similar cell-type specificity was observed for an MCF10A-specific p53-binding event (Fig. 2H). Taken together, these data provide evidence that the p53-dependent transcriptome is cell type–specific and that p53 engagement with the genome is variable across cell types. We next wanted to identify potential mechanisms driving cell-type specificity within the p53-dependent transcriptome and cistrome. Previous analyses of p53 genomic occupancy suggested that gene proximal binding of p53 correlates with changes in gene activation (3.Andrysik Z. Galbraith M.D. Guarnieri A.L. Zaccara S. Sullivan K.D. Pandey A. MacBeth M. Inga A. Espinosa J.M. Identification of a core TP53 transcriptional program with highly distributed tumor suppressive activity.Genome Res. 2017; 27 (28904012): 1645-165710.1101/gr.220533.117Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 32.Fischer M.

MCF10A-specific genes are more likely to have a p53-binding event near their TSS compared with p53 peaks in SkFib (Fig. S1C). Conversely, SkFib-specific genes are not associated with either a higher number of SkFib-specific p53-binding events or more proximal p53-binding events than in MCF10A (Fig. S1C). These observations suggest that although cell type–specific p53 binding correlates with an increase in p53 gene targets in MCF10A, differential p53 binding alone is insufficient to explain differential gene expression. We and others previously proposed that differential regulatory region activity may control p53-dependent gene expression (29.Sammons M.A. Zhu J. Drake A.M. Berger S.L.

https://openalex.org/W2945045500,"Proper control of cell migration is critically important in many biologic processes, such as wound healing, immune surveillance, and development. Much progress has been made in the initiation of cell migration; however, little is known about termination and sometimes directional reversal. During active cell migration, as in wound healing, development, and immune surveillance, the integrin expression profile undergoes drastic changes. Here, we uncovered the extensive regulatory and even opposing roles of integrins in directional cell migration in electric fields (EFs), a potentially important endogenous guidance mechanism. We established cell lines that stably express specific integrins and determined their responses to applied EFs with a high throughput screen. Expression of specific integrins drove cells to migrate to the cathode or to the anode or to lose migration direction. Cells expressing αMβ2, β1, α2, αIIbβ3, and α5 migrated to the cathode, whereas cells expressing β3, α6, and α9 migrated to the anode. Cells expressing α4, αV, and α6β4 lost directional electrotaxis. Manipulation of α9 molecules, one of the molecular directional switches, suggested that the intracellular domain is critical for the directional reversal. These data revealed an unreported role for integrins in controlling stop, go, and reversal activity of directional migration of mammalian cells in EFs, which might ensure that cells reach their final destination with well-controlled speed and direction.-Zhu, K., Takada, Y., Nakajima, K., Sun, Y., Jiang, J., Zhang, Y., Zeng, Q., Takada, Y., Zhao, M.

https://openalex.org/W2946393562,"Emission from ruminants has become one of the largest sources of anthropogenic methane emission in China. The structure of the rumen flora has a significant effect on methane production. To establish a more accurate prediction model for methane production, the rumen flora should be one of the most important parameters. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship among changes in rumen flora, nutrient levels, and methane production in sheep fed with the diets of different forage-to-concentration ratios, as well as to screen for significantly different dominant genera. Nine rumen-cannulated hybrid sheep were separated into three groups and fed three diets with forage-to-concentration ratios of 50:50, 70:30, and 90:10. Three proportions of the diets were fed according to a 3 × 3 incomplete Latin square, design during three periods of 15d each. The ruminal fluid was collected for real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR), high-throughput sequencing and in vitro rumen fermentation in a new real-time fermentation system wit. Twenty-two genera were screened, the abundance of which varied linearly with forage-to-concentration ratios and methane production. In addition, during the 12-hour in vitro fermentation, the appearance of peak concentration was delayed by 26-27min with the different structure of rumen bacteria. The fiber-degrading bacteria were positively correlated with this phenomenon, but starch-degrading and protein-degrading bacteria were negative correlated. These results would facilitate macro-control of rumen microorganisms and better management of diets for improved nutrition in ruminants. In addition, our findings would help in screening bacterial genera that are highly correlated with methane production."
https://openalex.org/W2953010727,"A dual in vitro regeneration system consisting of indirect organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis (SE), applicable to several varieties of tomato—Solanum lycopersicum (cv. Riogrande, cv. Roma, hybrid 17905 and model cv. M82) has been established. This system is both improved and highly reproducible compared to current methods. Callus initiation, plant regeneration and SE was developed for one-week-old cotyledon explants. Indirect organogenesis via callus induction (CI) was developed for all four varieties of tomato used in this study. One-week-old tomato seedlings were used as a source of cotyledon and hypocotyl segments as explants. The explants were subsequently cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different combination and concentrations of plant growth regulators (PGRs). Substantial trends in regeneration and propagation response were observed among the varieties and treatments. For commercial varieties cvs. Riogrande and Roma, maximum CI was observed at 2 weeks in CIMT9 (0.5 mg/L NAA, 1 mg/L BAP) and CIMT12 (2 mg/L IAA, 2 mg/L NAA, 2 mg/L BAP, 4 mg/L KIN). However, cv. M82 responded after 4 weeks to a combination of treatments CIMT9 (0.5 mg/L NAA + 1 mg/L BAP) and CIMT13 (2 mg/L IAA + 2 mg/L NAA + 2 mg/L BAP + 4 mg/L ZEA) for the production of calli. Subsequent shoot and root organogenesis were optimized for all four varieties. Cv. Riogrande, exhibited fastidious in vitro regeneration potential and selected for induction of somatic embryos via SE involving novel structure: rhizoid tubers (RTBs). Numerous fine hair like rhizoids (~23/explants) were first developed from cotyledon and hypocotyl explants cultured on MS medium supplemented with 0.5 or 2 mg/L NAA at pH 4.0 in dark conditions. Further incubation of each rhizoid under light conditions on MS media supplemented with 5 mg/L TDZ or BAP at pH 4.0 led to the formation of a novel structure—rhizoid Tubers (RTBs). Thus, as evident from histology, SE in Riogrande tomato species requires a medium with pH of (4.0) and higher concentration of cytokinins (BAP/TDZ) to form on average 40–45 RTBs from both explants. Histological and morphological studies revealed that RTBs develop through different stages of embryogenesis to multiple plantlets, on MS medium with 5 mg/L TDZ/BAP at normal pH (5.8). The results obtained indicated that the induced somatic embryos of tomato with lower pH are a more efficient mode of propagation than the organogenesis with or without callus formation. The RTBs led to a complete plantlets regeneration in 45 days compared to indirect organogenesis at 60 days."
https://openalex.org/W2945424778,"Hypoglycemic drugs such as metformin increase glucose uptake and utilization by peripheral tissues to maintain glucose homeostasis, and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway is an important component of this pharmacological activity. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) acts as a kinase upstream of AMPK and plays an important regulatory role in glucose metabolism. In recent years, as a tumor suppressor, LKB1's antitumor activity has been widely studied, yet its hypoglycemic activity is not clear. Here, using biochemical and cell viability assays, site-directed mutagenesis, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence staining, we found that a natural product, antroalbol H isolated from the basidiomycete mushroom Antrodiella albocinnamomea, increases cellular glucose uptake in murine L6 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Of note, our results indicated that this effect is related to LKB1-mediated Thr-172 phosphorylation of AMPKα. Furthermore, we observed that antroalbol H induces the phosphorylation of LKB1 specifically at Thr-189 and changes subcellular localization of LKB1. Finally, antroalbol H treatment strikingly promoted glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane. We conclude that antroalbol H promotes Thr-189 phosphorylation of LKB1, leading to AMPK activation, revealing this residue as a potential target for increasing glucose uptake, and that antroalbol H therefore has potential for managing hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2946157343,"Online communities are virtual spaces for users to share interests, support others, and to exchange knowledge and information. Understanding user behavior is valuable to organizations and has applications from marketing to security, for instance, identifying leaders within a community or predicting future behavior. In the present research, we seek to understand the various roles that users adopt in online communities–for instance, who leads the conversation? Who are the supporters? We examine user role changes over time and the pathways that users follow. This allows us to explore the differences between users who progress to leadership positions and users who fail to develop influence. We also reflect on how user role proportions impact the overall health of the community. Here, we examine two online ideological communities, RevLeft and Islamic Awakening (N = 1631; N = 849), and provide a novel approach to identify various types of users. Finally, we study user role trajectories over time and identify community “leaders” from meta-data alone. Study One examined both communities using K-MEANS cluster analysis of behavioral meta-data, which revealed seven user roles. We then mapped these roles against Preece and Schneiderman’s (2009) Reader-to-Leader Framework (RtLF). Both communities aligned with the RtLF, where most users were “contributors”, many were “collaborators”, and few were “leaders”. Study Two looked at one community over a two-year period and found that, despite a high churn rate of users, roles were stable over time. We built a model of user role transitions over the two years. This can be used to predict user role changes in the future, which will have implications for community managers and security focused contexts (e.g., analyzing behavioral meta-data from forums and websites known to be associated with illicit activity)."
https://openalex.org/W2946787425,"Integrated crop-livestock (ICL) system is beneficial in enhancing soil organic carbon and nutrient cycling. However, the benefits of the ICL system on mitigation of GHG emissions are poorly understood. Thus, the present study was initiated in 2011 to assess the effect of crop rotation diversity and grazing managed under the ICL system on GHG emissions. The cropping system investigated here included spring wheat grown continuously for five years and a 5-yr crop rotation (spring wheat-cover crops-corn-pea/barley-sunflower). Each phase was present each year. Yearling steers grazed only the pea/barley, corn and cover crops plots in 2016 and 2017. Exclusion areas avoided the grazing in these crops to compare the GHG fluxes under grazed vs. non-grazed areas. The GHG fluxes were measured weekly from all crop phases during the growing season for both years using a static chamber. Cumulative CO2 and CH4 fluxes were similar from all crop phases over the study period. However, continuous spring wheat recorded higher cumulative N2O fluxes (671 g N ha-1) than that under spring wheat in rotation (571 g N ha-1). Grazing decreased cumulative CO2 fluxes (359 kg C ha-1) compared to ungrazed (409 kg C ha-1), however, no effect from grazing on cumulative CH4 and N2O fluxes over the study period were found. The present study shows that grazing and crop rotational diversity affected carbon and nitrogen inputs, which in turn affected soil CO2 and N2O fluxes. Long-term monitoring is needed to evaluate the response of soil GHG emissions to grazing and crop rotation interactions under the ICL system."
https://openalex.org/W2945024947,"Introduction The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of pediatric HIV disclosure in rural Zimbabwe and track the process of disclosure over time. Methods We recruited a population-based sample of 372 caregivers of HIV-positive children ages 9 to 15 to participate in a survey about disclosure. Using data from this cross-sectional sample, we then identified a prospective cohort of 123 caregivers who said their HIV-positive child did not know his or her HIV status, and we followed this non-disclosed cohort of caregivers through two additional waves of data collection over the next 12 months. At each wave, we inquired about the timing and process of disclosure and psychosocial factors related to HIV disclosure. Results The overall prevalence of disclosure in the cross-sectional sample was 66.9% (95% CI 62.0 to 71.5%). Only 26.9% of children knew how they were infected and that they can transmit the virus to others (i.e. “full disclosure”). Older children were more likely to know their status. Among the non-disclosed caregivers at baseline, nearly 60% of these children learned their HIV status over the course of the 12-month study period, but only 17.1% learned how they were infected and that they can transmit the virus to others. Most caregivers were satisfied with their child’s disclosure experience. Caregivers who had not disclosed their child’s HIV status to the child worried that disclosure would lead to stigma in the community, provoke questions from their child they would not be able to answer, or cause the child to reject the caregiver in anger. Conclusions This study suggests that rates of pediatric HIV disclosure may be larger than typically reported, but also reinforces the idea that most children do not know key details about their illness, such as how they were infected and that they can infect others."
https://openalex.org/W2946479734,"Medical errors are of economic importance and can contribute to serious adverse events for patients. Medical errors refer to preventable events resulting from healthcare interactions, whether these events harm the patient or not. In Kuwait, there is a paucity literature detailing the causes, forms, and risks of medical errors in their state-funded healthcare facilities. This study aimed to explore medical errors, their causes and preventive strategies in a Kuwait tertiary hospital based on the perceptions and experience of a cross-section of healthcare professionals using a questionnaire with 27 open (n = 10) and closed (n = 17) questions. The recruited healthcare professionals in this study included pharmacists, nurses, physicians, dentists, radiographers, hospital administrators, surgeons, nutritionists, and physiotherapists. The collected data were analysed quantitatively using descriptive statistics. A total of 203 participants filled and completed the survey questionnaire. The frequency of medical errors in Kuwait was found to be high at 60.3% ranging from incidences of prolonged hospital stays (32.9%), adverse events and life-threatening complications (32.3%), and fatalities (20.9%). The common medical errors result from incomplete instructions, incorrect dosage, and incorrect route of administration, diagnosis errors, and labelling errors. The perceived causes of these medical errors include high workload, lack of support systems, stress, medical negligence, inadequate training, miscommunication, poor collaboration, and non-adherence to safety guidelines among the healthcare professionals."
https://openalex.org/W2946411527,"Fermented vegetables have emerged as prebiotics with various health benefits. However, the possible mechanisms behind their health benefits are unclear. To relate the metabolite profile changes in fermented mixed vegetables with associated health benefits of fermented vegetables, we analyzed the metabolite profiles of mixed vegetables, before and after fermentation by Lactobacillus plantarum, using gas chromatography/time-of-flight–mass spectrometry (GC/TOF–MS). To analyze health benefits of fermented vegetables, antioxidative and antiinflammatory activities were measured using RAW 264.7 cells. Among 78 metabolites identified by GC/TOF–MS in this study, those significantly increased after fermentation include antioxidative and/or antiinflammatory agents such as lactate, 3-phennyllactate, indole-3-lactate, β-hydroxybutyrate, γ-aminobutyrate, and glycerol. These metabolites may have been either newly synthesized or depolymerized from high molecular weight polymers from vegetables during fermentation. This is the first metabolomics study to relate metabolite profile changes with increased health benefits of fermented vegetables."

Immunophenotyping of whole peripheral blood (WPB) by flow cytometry is a rapid method to obtain large amounts of data relating to the outcomes of different transplant treatments with limited patient impact. Healthy individuals and patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) enrolled in islet transplantation were recruited and WPB was collected. 46 fluorochrome-conjugated mouse-anti-human antibodies were used (43 of 46 antibodies were titrated). BD cytometer setup and tracking beads were used to characterize and adjust for cytometer performance. Antibody cocktails were pre-mixed <60 minutes before staining. Multicolour panels were designed based on fluorochrome brightness, antigen density, co-expression, and fluorochrome spillover into non-primary detectors in each panel on a 5 laser flow cytometer. WPB sample staining used 50–300 μl WPB for each panel and was performed within 2 hours of blood sample collection. Samples were acquired on a BD-LSRFortessa. The operating procedures, including specimen collection, antibody cocktails, staining protocol, flow-cytometer setup and data analysis, were standardized. The staining index of 43 antibodies and the spillover spreading matrix for each panel was calculated. The final concentrations for the 46 antibodies used was determined for staining of WPB samples. Absolute cell-count and 7 leukocyte profiling panels consisting of subsets and/or status of granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic, B, NK, and T cells including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and NKT were designed and established on a 5 laser BD-LSR Fortessa. 13 T1D patients, including 4 islet transplant recipients and 8 healthy controls, were evaluated. The ability to reproducibly measure immune subsets and immune-profiles of islet transplant patients up to 18 months post transplantation has been established as a tool to measure immune cell reconstitution after transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2946262926,"Background Few studies have evaluated whether people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at an increased risk of stroke in an Asian population. We investigated the association between HIV infection and the risk of developing stroke by age, calendar year of HIV diagnosis, and follow-up duration in Taiwan. Methods Using the claims data of a universal health insurance program, we identified 5,961 patients with HIV and 23,844 matched non-HIV subjects without previous stroke from 1998 to 2005 and followed them up until the end of 2011 to measure the incidence of stroke. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for potential confounders were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with the non-HIV group as reference. Results During a median follow-up of 8 years, the incidence rates for total, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke per 1000 person-years were 2.12, 1.22, and 0.60, respectively, in patients with HIV infection, and 1.98, 1.14, and 0.54, respectively, in the comparison group. HIV infection was associated with an elevated risk of developing total stroke (adjusted HR [95% CI], 1.57 [1.15–2.14]) and ischemic stroke (1.91 [1.25–2.91]) in patients aged less than 45 years, but no association was observed in other age groups (P for interaction with age, p = 0.048 and 0.024, respectively). Patients diagnosed with HIV infection in 1998–1999 had a greater HR for total stroke and ischemic stroke than those diagnosed in 2000–2002 and 2003–2005 (P for interaction, for total stroke p = 0.034, for ischemic stroke p = 0.056). The HRs did not differ by follow-up duration. Conclusions HIV infection among a young age group is associated with increased risk of developing overall and ischemic stroke. The findings highlight the importance of screening and correcting risk factors for young stroke prevention immediately and aggressively."
https://openalex.org/W2946681554,"Inflammation and implant loosening are major concerns when using titanium implants for hard tissue engineering applications. Surface modification is one of the promising tools to enhance tissue-material integration in metallic implants. Here, we used anodization technique to modify the surface of commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) and titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) samples. Our results show that electrolyte composition, anodization time and voltage dictated the formation of well-organized nanotubes. Although electrolyte containing HF in water resulted in nanotube formation on Ti, the presence of NH4F and ethylene glycol was necessary for successful nanotube formation on Ti-6Al-4V. Upon examination of the interaction of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with the modified samples, we found that Ti-6Al-4V without nanotubes induced cell proliferation and cluster of differentiation 40 ligand (CD40L) expression which facilitates B-cell activation to promote early bone healing. However, the expression of glioma associated protein 2 (GLI2), which regulates CD40L, was reduced in Ti-6Al-4V and the presence of nanotubes further reduced its expression. The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression was reduced by nanotube presence on Ti. These results suggest that Ti-6Al-4V with nanotubes may be suitable implants because they have no effect on BMSC growth and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2945277748,"Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that regulates plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. To investigate the importance of ethylene in soybean resistance to Fusarium virguliforme (Fv), the causal agent of sudden death syndrome (SDS), soybean cultivars Williams 82 (SDS-susceptible) and MN1606 (SDS-resistant) were treated 24 h before and 24h after Fv inoculation with either ethephon (ethylene inducer), cobalt chloride (ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor), or 1-MCP (ethylene perception inhibitor). Inoculated plants were grown for 21 days at 24°C in the greenhouse and then evaluated for SDS severity and expression of soybean defense genes. In both cultivars, plants treated with ethephon showed lower SDS foliar severity compared to the other treatments, whereas those treated with cobalt chloride or 1-MCP showed the same or higher SDS foliar severity compared to the water-treated control. Ethephon application resulted in activation of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, such as ethylene synthase (ACS) and ethylene oxidase (ACO), and genes involved in soybean defense response, such as pathogenesis-related protein (PR), basic peroxidase (IPER), chalcone synthase (CHS), and defense-associated transcription factors. Cobalt chloride and 1-MCP treatments had little or no effect on the expression of these genes. In addition, ethephon had a direct inhibitory effect on in-vitro growth of Fv on PDA media. Our results suggest that ethephon application inhibits SDS development directly by slowing Fv growth and/or by inducing soybean ethylene signaling and the expression of defense related genes."

COI sequences >400 bp recovered from 1,782 specimens were analyzed using neighbor-joining trees, Bayesian inference, barcode gap, and Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). Specimens of 109 morphological species were assigned to 123 BINs with ten species showing BIN splits, while 93 interim species included representatives of 98 BINs. Maximum conspecific divergences ranged from 0–5.3% while congeneric distances varied from 2.8–23.2%. Excepting one species pair (Oxyopes azhari–Oxyopes oryzae), the maximum intraspecific distance was always less than the nearest-neighbor (NN) distance. Intraspecific divergence values were not significantly correlated with geographic distance. Most (75%) BINs detected in this study were new to science, while those shared with other nations mainly derived from India. The discovery of many new, potentially endemic species and the low level of BIN overlap with other nations highlight the importance of constructing regional DNA barcode reference libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2945605114,"Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) systemically or locally collaborates with tissue homeostasis, growth and development, which has been extensively studied for its pharmacological implications. This study was primarily aimed at finding and characterizing local RAS in rat parotid, sublingual and submandibular glands. It was also hypothesized that vasoactive drugs could affect the expression of RAS targets, as well as saliva flow and its composition. Therefore, another objective of this study was to compare the effects of losartan (angiotensin II receptor blocker) and isoproterenol (β-adrenergic receptor agonist). Forty-one Wistar rats were divided into three groups and administered a daily intraperitoneal dose of saline, losartan or isoproterenol solutions for one week. The following RAS targets were studied using qPCR: renin (REN), angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE-2, elastase-2 (ELA-2), AT1-a and MAS receptors, using RPL-13 as a reference gene. Morphology of glands was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using REN, ACE, ACE-2, AT1, AT2 and MAS antibodies. The volume and total protein content of saliva were measured. Our results revealed that ACE, ACE-2, AT1-a, AT2 and MAS receptors were expressed in all salivary gland samples, but REN and ELA-2 were absent. Losartan decreased mRNA expression of RAS targets in parotid (MAS) and submandibular glands (ACE and both AT receptors), without affecting morphological alterations, and significantly decreased saliva and total protein secretions. Isoproterenol treatment affected gene expression profiles in parotid (ACE, ACE-2, AT1-a, MAS, AGT), and submandibular (ACE, AT2, AGT) glands, thus promoting acinar hypertrophy in serous acini, without significant changes in salivary flow or total protein content. These drugs affected mainly acini, followed by duct systems and myoepithelial cells, whereas blood vessels were not affected. In conclusion, there is a local RAS in major rat salivary glands and losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, affected not only the RAS-target gene expression but also decreased salivary flow and total protein content."
https://openalex.org/W2946153520,"Recent research has highlighted the value of providing metacognitive guidance for learning English in a small group setting. This study investigated the effects that the presence or absence of metacognitive prompts for group or individual learning could have on reading comprehension and the incidental learning of vocabulary through reading. A total of 171 university students were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions: collaborative learning with metacognitive prompts, collaborative learning without metacognitive prompts, individual learning with metacognitive prompts, and individual learning without metacognitive prompts. Results indicated that after the treatment, learners in the collaborative learning with metacognitive prompts group outperformed the other groups on both reading comprehension and incidental vocabulary learning assessments. In addition, the vocabulary knowledge acquired by students in the collaborative learning with metacognitive prompts group was highest for meaning recognition, followed by form recognition, meaning recall, and finally form recall. These findings highlight the importance of training students’ self-regulated learning and suggest that the use of metacognitive prompts in a group setting is an effective means to boost EFL reading comprehension and the incidental vocabulary learning for Chinese university students. Pedagogical implications of these and other nuanced findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2945119053,"The regulation of transcription in trypanosomes is unusual. To modulate protein synthesis during their complex developmental stages, these unicellular microorganisms rely largely on post-transcriptional gene expression pathways. These pathways include a plethora of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that modulate all steps of the mRNA life cycle in trypanosomes and help organize transcriptomes into clusters of post-transcriptional regulons. The aim of this work was to characterize an RNA regulon comprising numerous transcripts of trypomastigote-associated cell-surface glycoproteins that are preferentially expressed in the infective stages of the human parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. In vitro and in vivo RNA-binding assays disclosed that these glycoprotein mRNAs are targeted by the small trypanosomatid-exclusive RBP in T. cruzi, U-rich RBP 1 (TcUBP1). Overexpression of a GFP-tagged TcUBP1 in replicative parasites resulted in >10 times up-regulated expression of transcripts encoding surface proteins and in changes in their subcellular localization from the posterior region to the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, as is typically observed in the infective parasite stages. Moreover, RT–quantitative PCR analysis of actively translated mRNAs by sucrose cushion fractionation revealed an increased abundance of these target transcripts in the polysome fraction of TcUBP1-induced samples. Because these surface proteins are involved in cell adherence or invasion during host infection, we also carried out in vitro infections with TcUBP1-transgenic trypomastigotes and observed that TcUBP1 overexpression significantly increases parasite infectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2946711989,"Hair is an emerging biological matrix in which to measure chronic HPA axis activity, offering a longer term view into an animal’s life. We explored effects of exogenous (e.g. lifestyle, medications, social environment) and endogenous (e.g. disease, behaviour) stressors on hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in a population of Border Collies (BCs). Owners of BCs were recruited and reported their dog’s lifestyle, clinical history, anxiety-related behaviour, and collected a white hair sample from their dog’s dorsal neck region. HCC was determined using established methods with a commercial cortisol assay kit. Samples from 135 BCs were analysed, with 91 healthy controls and 44 diagnosed with epilepsy as a model disease. Factors associated with higher HCC included psychosocial stressors (living with three or more other dogs) and lifestyle (engaging in competitive flyball); while factors associated with lower HCC included anxiety (stranger-directed and non-social), health (epilepsy diagnosis, with number of seizures to date negatively correlated with HCC) and medication (certain anti-epileptic drugs were associated with elevated or reduced HCC). These novel results highlight the potential of chronic stress with frequent or persisting HPA-axis hyperactivity leading to a state of hypocortisolism, and the need to consider stressor recency and recurrence when interpreting HCC data."

Aberrant activation of this receptor has been demonstrated in many human cancers, particularly in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). L858R point mutation is the most common oncogenic mutation in EGFR tyrosine kinase domain in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. A feedback inhibitor of EGFR is MIG6 molecule which binds peptide-substrate binding site of the receptor and leads to degradation of activated EGFR. In this in silico study, the peptide-substrate binding site of EGFRL858R mutant has been targeted to inhibit it using molecular docking, MD simulation and MM-PBSA method. Finally, physicochemical properties of the designed peptides have been evaluated. A peptide library was provided composed of 31 peptides which were designed based on the MIG6 structure. The results indicated that, two peptides were able to inhibit EGFRL858R mutant selectively. This computational study could be helpful in designing novel inhibitory peptides to inhibit oncogenic EGFR mutants which do not respond to available EGFR TKIs."

Despite such interest in these materials, a risk assessment based on the material characterization of final device extracts—as per regulatory guidance—has not yet been completed, even though the printing process may potentially impact the leachability of polymer components. To further our understanding of the chemical impact of 3D printed medical devices, this study investigated the extractable profiles of four different materials, including a PLA polymer advertised as “FDA-approved”. The fusion deposition modeling (FDM) printing process created distinct chemical and physical signatures in the extracts of certain materials. The application of an annealing procedure to printed devices led to a substantial decrease in extractable components by as much as a factor of 50. In addition, the use of a brass printing nozzle led to an increase in the amount of Pb detected in 3D printed device extracts. The data generated provides valuable information that can be used to help assess extractable risks of 3D printed medical devices, assist with future 3D printing designs, and may provide insight for agencies tasked with governing 3D printed medical device regulations."
https://openalex.org/W2946736283,"Background The performance of a new diagnostic test is typically evaluated against a comparator which is assumed to correspond closely to some true state of interest. Judgments about the new test’s performance are based on the differences between the outputs of the test and comparator. It is commonly assumed that a small amount of uncertainty in the comparator’s classifications will negligibly affect the measured performance of a diagnostic test. Methods Simulated datasets were generated to represent typical diagnostic scenarios. Comparator noise was introduced in the form of random misclassifications, and the effect on the apparent performance of the diagnostic test was determined. An actual dataset from a clinical trial on a new diagnostic test for sepsis was also analyzed. Results We demonstrate that as little as 5% misclassification of patients by the comparator can be enough to statistically invalidate performance estimates such as sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, if this uncertainty is not measured and taken into account. This distortion effect is found to increase non-linearly with comparator uncertainty, under some common diagnostic scenarios. For clinical populations exhibiting high degrees of classification uncertainty, failure to measure and account for this effect will introduce significant risks of drawing false conclusions. The effect of classification uncertainty is magnified further for high performing tests that would otherwise reach near-perfection in diagnostic evaluation trials. A requirement of very high diagnostic performance for clinical adoption, such as a 99% sensitivity, can be rendered nearly unachievable even for a perfect test, if the comparator diagnosis contains even small amounts of uncertainty. This paper and an accompanying online simulation tool demonstrate the effect of classification uncertainty on the apparent performance of tests across a range of typical diagnostic scenarios. Both simulated and real datasets are used to show the degradation of apparent test performance as comparator uncertainty increases. Conclusions Overall, a 5% or greater misclassification rate by the comparator can lead to significant underestimation of true test performance. An online simulation tool allows researchers to explore this effect using their own trial parameters (https://imperfect-gold-standard.shinyapps.io/classification-noise/) and the source code is freely available (https://github.com/ksny/Imperfect-Gold-Standard)."
https://openalex.org/W2945619054,"Adolescents with high educational attainment generally have better outcomes across the lifespan than adolescents with lower educational attainment. This study investigated how three measures of socioeconomic status (SES)–maternal education, paternal education, and neighbourhood SES–combined to predict adolescent educational attainment (track level at age 17). We proposed three mechanisms for this pathway: cognitive ability (at age 11), primary school teacher assessment (stating the secondary education level suitable for a child at age 11), and educational expectations (at age 14). Using the data of 2,814 Dutch adolescents from the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) study, logistic regressions tested associations between SES and educational attainment. Structural equation modelling (SEM) tested mediational pathways between SES and educational attainment. In models with three SES measures, having a medium-educated mother was associated with higher educational attainment relative to having a low-educated mother (OR; 95% CI: 1.83; 1.41–2.38), and having a high-educated mother was associated with higher educational attainment relative to having a low-educated mother (OR; 95% CI: 3.44; 2.59–4.55). The odds ratios for paternal education showed a similar pattern. We found no association between neighbourhood SES and adolescent educational attainment, so neighbourhood SES was removed from further analyses. Mediational analyses revealed that cognitive ability (30.0%), teacher assessment (28.5%), and educational expectations (1.2%) explained 59.8% of the total association between parental SES and educational attainment. The results showed that mother education and father education were both important for understanding the strong association between parental SES and adolescent educational attainment. In the Netherlands, the association between parental SES and educational attainment can be largely explained by cognitive ability and teacher assessments."

https://openalex.org/W2946063483,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a major human disease associated with degeneration of the central nervous system. Evidence suggests that several endogenously formed 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)–mimicking chemicals that are metabolic conversion products, especially β-carbolines and isoquinolines, act as neurotoxins that induce PD or enhance progression of the disease. We have demonstrated previously that mitochondrially targeted human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), supported by mitochondrial adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, can efficiently catalyze the conversion of MPTP to the toxic 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion. In this study, we show that the mitochondrially targeted CYP2D6 can efficiently catalyze MPTP-mimicking compounds, i.e. 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline, and 9-methyl-norharmon, suspected to induce PD in humans. Our results reveal that activity and respiration in mouse brain mitochondrial complex I are significantly affected by these toxins in WT mice but remain unchanged in Cyp2d6 locus knockout mice, indicating a possible role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of these compounds both in vivo and in vitro. These metabolic effects were minimized in the presence of two CYP2D6 inhibitors, quinidine and ajmalicine. Neuro-2a cells stably expressing predominantly mitochondrially targeted CYP2D6 were more sensitive to toxin-mediated respiratory dysfunction and complex I inhibition than cells expressing predominantly endoplasmic reticulum–targeted CYP2D6. Exposure to these toxins also induced the autophagic marker Parkin and the mitochondrial fission marker Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in differentiated neurons expressing mitochondrial CYP2D6.

For instance, they can use statistical information about a population to predict the sample drawn from that population and infer an agent’s preferences from systematic violations of random sampling. We investigated whether and how young children infer an agent’s sampling biases. Moreover, we examined whether pupil data of toddlers follow the predictions of a computational model based on the causal Bayesian network formalization of predictive processing. We formalized three hypotheses about how different explanatory variables (i.e., prior probabilities, current observations, and agent characteristics) are used to predict others’ actions. We measured pupillary responses as a behavioral marker of ‘prediction errors’ (i.e., the perceived mismatch between what one’s model of an agent predicts and what the agent actually does). Pupillary responses of 24-month-olds, but not 18-month-olds, showed that young children integrated information about current observations, priors and agents to make predictions about agents and their actions. These findings shed light on the mechanisms behind toddlers’ inferences about agent-caused events. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which young children's pupillary responses are used as markers of prediction errors, which were qualitatively compared to the predictions by a computational model based on the causal Bayesian network formalization of predictive processing."

Mycelia were incubated at various temperatures in darkness, and conidial discharge was measured over time. We used a novel modification of a statistical model (pavpop), that simultaneously estimates phase and amplitude effects, into a setting of generalized linear models. This model is used to test hypotheses of peak location and discharge of conidia. The statistical analysis showed that high temperature leads to an early and fast decreasing peak, whereas there were no significant differences in total number of discharged conidia. Using the proposed model we also quantified the biological variation in the timing of the peak location at a fixed temperature."

Genetic loss or pharmaceutical inhibition of RIP2 has been shown to be beneficial in multiple inflammatory disease models with the effects largely attributed to reducing proinflammatory signaling downstream of peptidoglycan recognition. However, given the widespread expression of this kinase and its reported interactions with numerous other proteins, it is possible that RIP2 may also function in roles outside of peptidoglycan sensing. In this work, we show that RIP2 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation and activation in response to engagement of the Fc γ receptor (FcγR). Using bone marrow–derived macrophages from WT and RIP2-KO mice, we show that loss of RIP2 leads to deficient FcγR signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production upon FcγR cross-linking without affecting cytokine secretion, phagocytosis, or nitrate/nitrite production. The FcγR-induced ROS response was still dependent on NOD2, as macrophages deficient in this receptor showed similar defects. Mechanistically, we found that different members of the Src family kinases (SFKs) can promote RIP2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. Altogether, our findings suggest that RIP2 is functionally important in pathways outside of bacterial peptidoglycan sensing and that involvement in such pathways may depend on the actions of SFKs.

Mechanistically, we found that different members of the Src family kinases (SFKs) can promote RIP2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. Altogether, our findings suggest that RIP2 is functionally important in pathways outside of bacterial peptidoglycan sensing and that involvement in such pathways may depend on the actions of SFKs. These findings will have important implications for future therapies designed to target this kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2945983516,"How and to what degree an animal deals with potential threats is a fascinating topic that has been well-researched, particularly in insects, though usually not with the impact of parasites in mind. A growing body of work is showing how even benign parasites can affect, positively or negatively, their hosts’ physiological or behavioral reaction to threats. With this in mind we conducted an experiment using horned passalus beetles, Odontotaenius disjunctus that were naturally parasitized with a nematode Chondronema passali; we subjected beetles to simulated attacks (resembling rival fighting or predator attacks) and from videos of the encounters we quantified a suite of behaviors (antennae movement, aggressive posturing, threat displays, etc.), plus rates of alarm calls (stridulations) which all correspond to the “fight or flight” reaction. We obtained behavioral and parasite data from 140 beetles from two field collections, of which half had been housed in our lab for three weeks in conditions that would be stressful (little cover for burrowing). We observed a wide range of behaviors during the simulated attack procedure, from beetles offering little resistance to those which were extremely aggressive, though most beetles showed a moderate reaction. Alarm calling rates also varied, but surprisingly, these were not correlated with the magnitude of behavioral reactions. Also surprising was that stressful housing did not heighten the physical resistance during attacks, but did elevate alarm calling rate. Importantly, parasitized beetles had significantly reduced physical reactions to attack than those without nematodes (meaning their resistance to the attack was muted). The results concerning parasitism, coupled with prior work in our lab, indicate that the C. passali nematode depresses the hosts’ acute stress, or fight or flight, reaction (likely from its energetic cost), which may make hosts more susceptible to the very dangers that they are coping with during the stress events."
https://openalex.org/W2946340960,"One measure of habitat quality is a species' demographic performance in a habitat and the gold standard metric of performance is reproduction. Such a measure, however, may be misleading if individual quality is a fitness determinant. We report on factors affecting lifetime reproduction (LR), the total number of lifetime fledglings produced by an individual, and long-term territory-specific reproduction in a multi-generational study of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis). LR increased with longer lifespans and more breeding attempts and was strongly correlated with the number of recruits in two filial generations indicating that LR was a good fitness predictor. Extensive differences in LR attested to heterogeneity in individual quality, a requisite for the ideal pre-emptive distribution model (IPD) of habitat settling wherein high quality individuals get the best habitats forcing lower quality individuals into poorer habitats with lower reproduction. In response to 7‒9-year prey abundance cycles, annual frequency of territory occupancy by breeders was highly variable and low overall with monotonic increases in vacancies through low prey years. Occupancy of territories by breeders differed from random; some appeared preferred while others were avoided, producing a right-skewed distribution of total territory-specific fledgling production. However, mean fledglings per nest attempt was only slightly lower in less versus more productive territories, and, contrary to IPD predictions of increases in annual territory-specific coefficients of variation (CV) in reproduction as breeder densities increase, the CV of production decreased as density increased. Rather than habitat quality per se, conspecific attraction elicited territory selection by prospecting goshawks as 70% of settlers comprised turnovers on territories, resulting in occupancy continuity and increased territory-specific reproduction. Top-producing territories had as few as 2 long-lived (high LR) and up to 6 short-lived (low LR) sequential breeders. While individual quality appeared to effect territory-specific heterogeneity in reproductive performance, our data suggests that differences in individual quality may be washed-out by a random settling of prospectors in response to conspecific attraction."

https://openalex.org/W2945018834,"Children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) struggle to perform a host of daily activities. Many of these involve forceful interaction with objects and thus implicate dynamic touch. Therefore, deficits in dynamic touch could underlie functional difficulties presented by ADHD children. We investigated whether performance on a dynamic touch task (length perception by wielding) differ between children with ADHD and age-matched controls. We further examined whether this difference could be explained by fractal temporal correlations (wielding dynamics). Forty-two children (ADHD: 21; typically developing: 21) wielded unseen wooden rods and reported their perceived length in the form of magnitude productions. The rods varied in the magnitude of the first principal moment of inertia (I1). Three-dimensional displacements of hand and rod positions were submitted to Detrended Fluctuation Analysis to estimate trial-by-trial temporal correlations. Children with ADHD reported shorter length for rods with higher I1 than their typically developing peers, indicative of reduced sensitivity to mechanical information supporting dynamic touch. Importantly, temporal correlations in wielding dynamics moderated children's usage of I1. This finding points to a role of exploratory movements in perceptual deficits presented by children with ADHD and, thus, should be considered a new potential target for interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2945947837,"Hematological and neurological expressed 1-like (HN1L) protein is an evolutionarily conserved protein that plays an important role in embryonic development. It has been reported that HN1L is involved in the process of cell growth and cancer formation and that cell cycle arrest occurs during suppression of HN1L expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression levels of the Bombyx mori HN1L protein were significantly downregulated in Bombyx mori Nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infected silkworm cells. Transient transfections were performed with plasmids for pIEX-1-HN1L expression in Bombyx mori ovarian cells (BmN) in order to explore the effect of the HN1L protein on the growth of silkworm cells and its regulatory role in the process of viral infection. Cellular localization analysis revealed that HN1L was localized in the cytoplasm and that its upregulation could significantly enhance cellular activity. Furthermore, HN1L could promote G1/S phase conversion, thereby contributing to cell proliferation. Upon infection of BmN cells with BmNPV, the induction of apoptosis increased, although HN1L overexpression could inhibit DNA fragmentation, suggesting that the HN1L protein could inhibit cell apoptosis induced by viral invasion. In addition, Western blotting indicated that the HN1L protein inhibited the activation of caspase-9 zymogen and the expression of Bax protein, although it promoted Bcl-2 expression. Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed that overexpression of HN1L significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by BmNPV infection. Consequently, we demonstrated that BmN HN1L is a protein with multiple functions, which enhanced cell activity, regulated the cell cycle and induced an anti-apoptotic response by BmNPV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2946451736,"Brevibacillus laterosporus (Bl), is an insecticidal bacterium recorded as toxic to a range of invertebrates after ingestion. Isolates of Bl, which were initially recovered from surface-sterilised cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) seeds, were able to colonise brassica plants in the laboratory and field. The bacterium was recovered from surface-sterilised leaf, stem and root sections of seedlings after inoculation with Bl vegetative cells under laboratory conditions, and from mature cabbage plants sprayed with Bl in a field trial. The identity of the recovered bacterial isolates was confirmed by PCR through amplification of 16S rDNA and two strain-specific regions. The effect on diamondback moth (DBM) insect herbivory was tested with cabbage seedlings treated with one isolate (Bl 1951) as the strains are toxic to DBM after direct ingestion. While no effect on DBM larval herbivory was observed, there was a significant reduction of DBM pupation on the Bl 1951 colonised plants. The presence of Bl 1951 wild type cells within cabbage root tissue was confirmed by confocal microscopy, establishing the endophytic nature of the bacterium. The bacterium was also endophytic in three other brassica species tested, Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra), oilseed rape (Brassica napus var. oleifera) and radish (Raphanus sativus)."
https://openalex.org/W2946585496,"Lactic acid bacteria are Gram-positive bacteria used throughout the world in many industrial applications for their acidification, flavor and texture formation attributes. One of the species, Lactococcus lactis, is employed for the production of fermented milk products like cheese, buttermilk and quark. It ferments lactose to lactic acid and, thus, helps improve the shelf life of the products. Many physiological and transcriptome studies have been performed in L. lactis in order to comprehend and improve its biotechnological assets. Using large amounts of transcriptome data to understand and predict the behavior of biological processes in bacterial or other cell types is a complex task. Gene networks enable predicting gene behavior and function in the context of transcriptionally linked processes. We reconstruct and present the gene co-expression network (GCN) for the most widely studied L. lactis strain, MG1363, using publicly available transcriptome data. Several methods exist to generate and judge the quality of GCNs. Different reconstruction methods lead to networks with varying structural properties, consequently altering gene clusters. We compared the structural properties of the MG1363 GCNs generated by five methods, namely Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, GeneNet, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and Sparse PArtial Correlation Estimation (SPACE). Using SPACE, we generated an L. lactis MG1363 GCN and assessed its quality using modularity and structural and biological criteria. The L. lactis MG1363 GCN has structural properties similar to those of the gold-standard networks of Escherichia coli K-12 and Bacillus subtilis 168. We showcase that the network can be used to mine for genes with similar expression profiles that are also generally linked to the same biological process."
https://openalex.org/W2946110847,"Quantifying the distribution of prey greatly improves models of habitat use by marine predators and can assist in determining threats to both predators and prey. Small epipelagic fishes are important prey for many predators yet their distribution is difficult to quantify due to extreme patchiness. This study explores the use of recreational grade echosounders (RGE) to quantify school characteristics of epipelagic fish and link their distribution to that of their predators at Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. The hydro-acoustic system was ground-truthed with 259 schools of epipelagic fish. During 2015 and 2016, 136 hydro-acoustic surveys were conducted with concurrent observations of Hector’s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) and little penguins (Eudyptula minor). The relative abundance of the two predator species during surveys was modelled according to the relative abundance of potential prey using generalised additive mixed models. Schools of epipelagic fish were readily detected by the RGE system and were more abundant in summer compared to winter. The models performed well, explaining 43% and 37% of the deviance in relative abundances of dolphins and penguins respectively. This is the first study to link the distribution of Hector’s dolphin to that of their epipelagic prey and confirms the utility of RGE in studies of habitat use in marine predators. Limitations associated with a lack of formal acoustic calibration and data formatting can be overcome and would make RGE valuable, inexpensive tools for investigating variability in populations of small pelagic fishes."
https://openalex.org/W2946531663,"African ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the largest and fastest extent bipedal animal. The ostrich mainly relies on the 3rd toe to support the entire body under high-speed motion. The short and severe impact concentrated on the limited area would produce tremendous momentary internal stress and strain, which may contribute to the phalanges disloaction, soft tissue damage and the like. The vibration and excessive negative acceleration caused by the ground reaction force also affect the stability of the touching process. Therefore, ostrich toe pads are required to have excellent cushion characteristics. However, current studies often explains the cushion properties by analyzing the macro-microscopic structure of the pad organism, and there is a paucity of research on its biomechanical behaviour. Consequently, from the perspective of multi-layer structure and biomaterial assembly, this study aims to explain the biomechanical characteristics of the ostrich toe pads by FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis. Based on results, we deem that the ostrich toe pad could absorb energy and reduce vibration effectively. Firstly, the multi-layer structure of the pads make the stress and strain decay from outside to inside. Secondly, the minimal response frequency of the pad is 164.22 Hz, making it effectively avoid resonance phenomenon. Finally, the composite material model has the best performance in decreasing the negative acceleration peak value, the impact force peak value and the maximal equivalent stress value at velocities of 0.669 m/s and 1.339 m/s. These results help to further understand the buffer mechanism of the ostrich toe pad, and also have important inter-species reference value for the pathogenesis of human foot soft tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W2782851925,"This paper analyzes seasonal effects and their potential drivers in charitable giving. We conduct two studies to analyze whether donations to the German Red Cross differ between the Christmas season and summer. In study 1 we find that in the pre-Christmas shopping season prosocial subjects almost donate 50% less compared to prosocials in summer. In study 2 we replicate the low donations in the Christmas season. In an extensive questionnaire we control for several causes of this effect. The data suggest that the higher prosocials’ self-reported stress level, the lower the donations. The higher their relative savings, the lower the giving. Our questionnaire rules out that “donation fatigue” matters. That is, donations do not depend on the number of charitable campaigns subjects are confronted with and their engagement in these activities during Christmas season outside the lab."
https://openalex.org/W2945201215,"Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a means of determining body composition and body fat distribution at different sites including whole body and trunk-locations where there tends to be high correlation at an individual level.We performed an analysis of DXA-derived metrics of adiposity (truncal fat %,subtotal fat % and total fat %) from the NHANES database and then correlated the findings with markers of insulin resistance. We analyzed the data from DXA scans in NHANES 1999-2004. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance and HOMA-β (beta-cell function) were estimated. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated (ρ) between HOMA-IR,HOMA-β and different measures of obesity (Waist circumference(in cm), Body Mass Index (kg/m2), truncal fat %, subtotal fat % as well as total fat %) to gauge the relationship between markers of glucose homeostasis and DXA derived metrics of obesity. We also performed logarithmic transformation of HOMA-IR as well as HOMA-β to ensure normality of distribution and to meet the criteria for regression analysis. A forward selection model (by outcome and gender) was performed to predict log transformed insulin resistance (log HOMA-IR) as well as log transformed HOMA-β (log HOMA-β,measure of beta cell function) from age, serum triglycerides, HDL, trunk fat % and the SBP (in both males and females separately), after reviewing the spearman correlation coefficients.There were a total of 6147 men and 6369 women who were part of the study cohort. There was a positive correlation between markers of adiposity and log HOMA-IR and log HOMA-β in both males and females.Truncal fat % had the highest nonparametric correlation coefficent with log HOMA-IR among the DXA derived fat% (0.54 in males and 048 in females). In the multivariate analysis, truncal fat % was an independent predictor of logHOMA-IR as well as logHOMA-β. In males, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat % and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.325 (±0.66), F(3,207) = 34.63, p < .01). In females, the significant predictors of log HOMA-IR were; age, truncal fat %, SBP, Serum triglyceride and HDL cholesterol (Adjusted R square of 0.307 (±0.65),F(5,198) = 18.9, p < .01). In both males and females, the significant predictors of log HOMA-β were; age, and truncal fat % (Males; adjusted R square of 0.25 (±0.63), F (2,208) = 36.4, p < .01, Females; adjusted R square of 0.27 (±0.62), F (2,201) = 38.4, p < .01).Body fat % on DXA is an imaging biomarker for insulin resistance. Incorporating this important information into DXA acquisitions and reporting frameworks may allow for this information to be available to providers who refer patients for these imaging studies."

Understanding what patients present to EDs with is important for resource allocation, training and staffing purposes. There is paucity of data pertaining to ED visit presentations in Lebanon. This study aims at describing the spectrum of diseases among adult patients who present to a tertiary care center in Lebanon, an upper-middle income country (UMIC).A retrospective chart review of adult patients (age ≥ 19) presenting to a tertiary care hospital ED during 2010-2011 was completed. Common diagnoses in three categories (all adult visits, treat and release, admitted visits) were assessed. Diagnoses were classified according to the Clinical Classifications Software. Descriptive statistics were presented in tables as frequencies and percentages.During the study period, 32787 adults presented to the ED with 18.7% resulting in hospital admission. The most common diagnoses in ED patients were injuries and conditions due to external causes, abdominal pain, non-specific chest pain and intestinal infections. In the treat and release group, intestinal infections emerged in the common list for ages 19-44. Coronary atherosclerosis was common in admitted patients aged ≥45 years. Summer was the busiest season, with abdominal pain and intestinal infection being prominent diagnoses during that season.This study is the first to assess adult ED visits in a Lebanese setting. Our study suggests that patients in our population suffer from the double burden of both communicable and non-communicable disease, with coronary atherosclerosis common in admitted patients (≥ 45 years) and intestinal infections common in treat and release adult patients (19-44years), the latter condition peaking in summer and driving seasonal surges in ED visits."
