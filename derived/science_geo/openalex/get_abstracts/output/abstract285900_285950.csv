https://openalex.org/W2043015466,"Analysis of instrumental temperature records beginning in 1659 shows that in much of the world the dominant frequency of the seasons is one cycle per anomalistic year (the time from perihelion to perihelion, 365.25964 days), not one cycle per tropical year (the time from equinox to equinox, 365.24220 days), and that the timing of the annual temperature cycle is controlled by perihelion. The assumption that the seasons were timed by the equinoxes has caused many statistical analyses of climate data to be badly biased. Coherence between changes in the amplitude of the annual cycle and those in the average temperature show that between 1854 and 1922 there were small temperature variations, probably of solar origin. Since 1922, the phase of the Northern Hemisphere coherence between these quantities switched from 0 degrees to 180 degrees and implies that solar variability cannot be the sole cause of the increasing temperature over the last century. About 1940, the phase patterns of the previous 300 years began to change and now appear to be changing at an unprecedented rate. The average change in phase is now coherent with the logarithm of atmospheric CO(2) concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2006352148,"The 410-kilometer seismic discontinuity is generally considered to be caused by a phase transformation of the main constituent of the upper mantle, olivine, alpha-(Mg,Fe)(2)SiO(4), to beta-(Mg,Fe)(2)SiO(4). Recent data show that H(2)O dissolves in olivine and other nominally anhydrous mantle minerals and that the partitioning of H(2)O between olivine and beta-(Mg,Fe)(2)SiO(4) is about 1:10. Such behavior strongly affects the region over which the alpha to beta phase transformation occurs and hence the seismic discontinuity that results. The observed width of the discontinuity constrains the maximum H(2)O content of upper mantle olivine to about 200 parts per million by weight."
https://openalex.org/W2014825515,"The M(w) = 8.3 deep (636 kilometers) Bolivian earthquake of 9 June 1994 was the largest deep-focus earthquake ever recorded. Seismic data from permanent stations plus portable instruments in South America show that rupture occurred on a horizontal plane and extended at least 30 by 50 kilometers. Rupture proceeded at 1 to 3 kilometers per second along the down-dip azimuth of the slab and penetrated through more than a third of the slab thickness. This extent is more than three times that expected for a metastable wedge of olivine at the core of the slab, and thus appears to be incompatible with an origin by transformational faulting. These large events may instead represent slip on preserved zones of weakness established in oceanic lithosphere at the Earth's surface."

Herbivory was also found in three other azooxanthellate soft corals. In tropical oligotrophic waters, phytoplankton biomass density may be an order of magnitude higher than that of zooplankton. Use of this resource allows these azooxanthellate cnidarians to be highly productive in flow-exposed oligotrophic reef waters."

https://openalex.org/W1973540249,"The sun has become a factor in the debate over global warming because the measured temperature rise isn`t as large as some climate models predict. However, this article discusses recent research which concludes that solar variability...is at most a minor factor in the increase in average temperature observed over the last century. Others feel that the conclusions still need close examination because of such factors as increasing concentrations of fine aerosols which may even out warming between summer and winter."

https://openalex.org/W1982614675,"Government laboratories have been targeted in the current round of cuts. US DOE`s three big weapons labs have been in the spotlight as they struggle to find a post-Cold War niche, but other labs are also in danger of major government funding cuts: Defense labs of the US DOD (Naval Research Lab particularly), medical research labs and others. The general effects of such cuts and who is likely to take the hardest hits are discussed."

Gloom and drizzle continued for the first 4 days of the gathering, but there were plenty of bright spots inside the hall."
