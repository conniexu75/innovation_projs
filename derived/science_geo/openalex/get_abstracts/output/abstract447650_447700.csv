https://openalex.org/W2140203142,"The fact that people think or behave differently from one another is rooted in individual differences in brain anatomy and connectivity. Here, we used repeated-measurement resting-state functional MRI to explore intersubject variability in connectivity. Individual differences in functional connectivity were heterogeneous across the cortex, with significantly higher variability in heteromodal association cortex and lower variability in unimodal cortices. Intersubject variability in connectivity was significantly correlated with the degree of evolutionary cortical expansion, suggesting a potential evolutionary root of functional variability. The connectivity variability was also related to variability in sulcal depth but not cortical thickness, positively correlated with the degree of long-range connectivity but negatively correlated with local connectivity. A meta-analysis further revealed that regions predicting individual differences in cognitive domains are predominantly located in regions of high connectivity variability. Our findings have potential implications for understanding brain evolution and development, guiding intervention, and interpreting statistical maps in neuroimaging."

To establish a potential autologous source of these cells, we developed a strategy by which to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into OPCs. From three hiPSC lines, as well as from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), we generated highly enriched OLIG2(+)/PDGFRα(+)/NKX2.2(+)/SOX10(+) human OPCs, which could be further purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. hiPSC OPCs efficiently differentiated into both myelinogenic oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, in vitro and in vivo. Neonatally engrafted hiPSC OPCs robustly myelinated the brains of myelin-deficient shiverer mice and substantially increased their survival. The speed and efficiency of myelination by hiPSC OPCs was higher than that previously observed using fetal-tissue-derived OPCs, and no tumors from these grafts were noted as long as 9 months after transplant. These results suggest the potential utility of hiPSC-derived OPCs in treating disorders of myelin loss."

Here we show that the consequences of variants at 2 such loci, PARK16 and LRRK2, are highly interrelated, both in terms of their broad impacts on human brain transcriptomes of unaffected carriers, and in terms of their associations with PD risk. Deficiency of the PARK16 locus gene RAB7L1 in primary rodent neurons, or of a RAB7L1 ortholog in Drosophila dopamine neurons, recapitulated degeneration observed with expression of a familial PD mutant form of LRRK2, whereas RAB7L1 overexpression rescued the LRRK2 mutant phenotypes. PD-associated defects in RAB7L1 or LRRK2 led to endolysosomal and Golgi apparatus sorting defects and deficiency of the VPS35 component of the retromer complex. Expression of wild-type VPS35, but not a familial PD-associated mutant form, rescued these defects. Taken together, these studies implicate retromer and lysosomal pathway alterations in PD risk.

Lozano A.M. Parkinson’s disease. First of two parts.N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Defining pathological features of the disease include neurodegeneration that is most prominent among midbrain dopamine neurons (DNs) in the substantia nigra (SN) and Lewy body protein aggregates that are composed in part of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) protein. As the course of PD is thought to last decades, and as at the time of autopsy the vast majority of DNs are long lost, the molecular pursuit of initial etiological events has proven difficult. In rare inherited familial forms of PD, specific causative mutations have been identified, and this has significantly advanced the field (Abeliovich and Flint Beal, 2006Abeliovich A. Flint Beal M.

For instance, autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in α-syn, including missense mutations and triplication of the locus, lead to a familial PD variant, implicating α-syn directly in the disease process. Another familial genetic cause of PD is the presence of autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) protein, which encodes a large multidomain protein with GTPase and kinase activities. Although the precise functions of α-syn and LRRK2 in neurons remain to be determined, both proteins have been broadly implicated in intraneuronal protein sorting. α-Syn mutations have been reported to modify synaptic vesicle kinetics (Abeliovich et al., 2000Abeliovich A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 665-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), suggests that defective protein sorting in vesicular compartments may play a role in PD. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have described common genetic variants (at single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) that modify PD risk in nonfamilial “sporadic” cases (Hamza et al., 2010Hamza T.H.

Strikingly, a subset of these common variants lie within genomic loci previously associated with familial disease, such as α-syn or LRRK2, supporting the notion that common pathogenic pathways underlie familial and sporadic forms of PD. However, mechanisms that underlie the impact of nonfamilial genetic loci on PD risk, or that relate the functions of such loci to familial PD genes, remain unclear. Here we describe a series of human brain transcriptome, human genetic, and cell biological studies, that together implicate a PD-associated genetic and cellular pathway. RAB7L1—one of five genes within the PARK16 nonfamilial PD risk-associated locus—functions together with LRRK2 to impact nonfamilial PD risk in the human population; this genetic interaction is apparent even in unaffected individuals who carry both risk alleles, as quantified in terms of a broad transcriptomic analysis of brain gene expression. Similarly, these genes together modify neuronal survival and neurite integrity in model systems. At a cellular level, defects in this PD-associated RAB7L1-LRRK2 pathway lead to abnormal lysosomal structures and defective retromer complex function, that normally links the endolysosomal protein degradation system with the Golgi apparatus (Bonifacino and Hurley, 2008Bonifacino J.S.

Consistent with a role for such cellular defects in disease pathology, mutations in a retromer complex component, VPS35, have recently been associated with rare forms of autosomal dominantly inherited familial PD (Vilariño-Güell et al., 2011Vilariño-Güell C. Wider C. Ross O.A. Dachsel J.C. Kachergus J.M. Lincoln S.J. Soto-Ortolaza A.I. Cobb S.A. Wilhoite G.J. Bacon J.A. et al.VPS35 mutations in Parkinson disease.Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 2011; 89: 168-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). We sought an unbiased and systematic approach to assess the phenotypic impacts of common genetic variants associated with PD risk, particularly in brain tissue from yet unaffected carriers (Figure 1A), in order to circumvent the limitations of the analysis of diseased patient autopsy tissue. To this end, we compared the transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles of brain tissue samples from cohorts of unaffected individuals who share either a risk or a protective allele at any given PD risk SNP (Figure 1B). Such a global phenotypic impact (GPI) quantifies the effect of disease risk variants onto the transcriptome-wide gene expression profile in brain. A key aspect of the GPI analysis herein is that we focus on tissue from unaffected individuals, in hope of avoiding secondary effects of disease pathology such as cell loss. We assessed the transcriptome-wide GPI at 7 PD-associated loci (SNCA, LRRK2, MAPT, HLA-DRA, PARK16, LAMP3, STK39; Table S1 available online) (Simón-Sánchez et al., 2009Simón-Sánchez J. Schulte C. Bras J.M. Sharma M. Gibbs J.R. Berg D. Paisan-Ruiz C. Lichtner P. Scholz S.W. Hernandez D.G. et al.Genome-wide association study reveals genetic risk underlying Parkinson’s disease.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 1308-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar) in a publically available gene expression data set from cerebral cortex autopsy brain tissue of 185 individuals not apparently affected by a neurodegenerative disease (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] data set GSE15222). The GPIs of the seven loci revealed a high degree of overlap in terms of the identity of transcripts altered in expression level and the valence of such alterations: genes were coordinately altered in their expression by each of the seven PD-associated loci (over 15-fold greater than expected by chance; p = 1.5E-5 by resampling statistics; Figures S1A and S1B; Table S2). This observation of an overlapping GPI for these seven PD-associated loci was moreover confirmed in an additional independent data set of cerebral frontal cortex autopsy brain tissue of 143 individuals (p = 1.6 E-3 by resampling statistics; derived from GEO data set GSE15745). Function annotation was performed on the gene expression changes that underlie the common GPIs among PD risk variants. Strikingly, among the annotated gene sets most significantly reduced in expression are “mitochondria” functions (Figures S1C and S1D), consistent with the well-described association of defects in mitochondria with PD pathology (Zheng et al., 2010Zheng B. Liao Z. Locascio J.J. Lesniak K.A. Roderick S.S. Watt M.L. Eklund A.C. Zhang-James Y. Kim P.D. Hauser M.A. et al.Global PD Gene Expression (GPEX) ConsortiumPGC-1α, a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in Parkinson’s disease.Sci. Transl. Med. 2010; 2: 52ra73Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the common overlapping transcriptomic signature of gene expression changes associated with these seven PD risk variants revealed a pattern most similar to the transcriptome changes observed in the context of PD patient brain tissue (relative to unaffected brain tissue; Figure S1C), rather than to other CNS disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or schizophrenia (Figure 1C). Among the seven analyzed PD risk locus GPIs, those at the PARK16 and LRRK2 loci were found to be the most similar. Furthermore, variants at these two loci impacted the transcriptome in a nonadditive manner, signifying a genetic interaction (as determined by analysis of carriers of both risk variants; Figure 1D). We thus investigated whether these loci similarly genetically interact in terms of their impact on PD risk: namely, whether harboring either a risk (or protective) allele at one of these loci would modify the association of the second locus with PD risk. In an initial study on an Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population, the effect of a risk-associated variant at the LRRK2 locus was in fact highly dependent on the presence of the risk variant at the PARK16 locus, and vice versa (Figure 1E). Such “epistasis” between the LRRK2 and PARK16 loci regarding PD risk was replicated by reanalysis of three other independent GWAS, strongly supporting a common mechanism of action (Figure 1E). Although to our knowledge, prior studies have not reported genetic interactions with the common sporadic PD risk-associated variants at the LRRK2 locus, a GWAS of patients who harbor rare familial LRRK2 mutations identified a broad 15 Mb region of Chromosome 1 as harboring a genetic modifier of age of PD onset (Latourelle et al., 2011Latourelle J.C. Hendricks A.E. Pankratz N. Wilk J.B. Halter C. Nichols W.C. Gusella J.F. Destefano A.L. Myers R.H. Foroud T. PSG-Progeni GenePD Investigators, Coordinators, and Molecular Genetic LaboratoriesGenomewide linkage study of modifiers of LRRK2-related Parkinson’s disease.Mov. Disord. 2011; 26: 2039-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We note that this region encompassed the PARK16 locus. Meta-analysis in four independent sporadic PD GWAS data sets (as above) of the 74 identified SNP variants within this Chromosome 1 region for epistasis with the common LRRK2 SNP variant regarding PD risk identified the PARK16-associated variant as by far the most significantly interacting variant (combined p value for epistasis: 4.6E-6; Figure 1F; Table S3). Taken together, these data strongly support a genetic interaction between LRRK2 and PARK16 that initially impacts human CNS tissue physiology, as reflected by the transcriptome signature in unaffected carriers, and ultimately favors PD pathology in a small subset of individuals at risk. As five candidate genes are present within the PARK16 locus (SLC45A3, NUCKS1, RAB7L1, SLC41A1, and PM20D1), we sought to experimentally screen each of these for a functional interaction with LRRK2 (Figure 2A). We took advantage of a previously-described primary rat neuron in vitro culture model, in which transient expression of familial PD-associated LRRK2 G2019S or R1441C mutant alleles leads to a marked reduction in neurite process length (MacLeod et al., 2006MacLeod D. Dowman J. Hammond R. Leete T. Inoue K. Abeliovich A. The familial Parkinsonism gene LRRK2 regulates neurite process morphology.Neuron. 2006; 52: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Overexpression of RAB7L1, but not other genes in the PARK16 locus, significantly suppressed the LRRK2 mutation-induced neurite length phenotype (Figure 2B). RAB7L1 did not modify neurite length in the context of overexpression of wild-type LRRK2 (Figure S2A). RAB7L1 is a small cytosolic GTPase, structurally distinct from RAB7 despite its name (also known as RAB29) (Shimizu et al., 1997Shimizu F. Katagiri T. Suzuki M. Watanabe T.K. Okuno S. Kuga Y. Nagata M. Fujiwara T. Nakamura Y. Takahashi E. Cloning and chromosome assignment to 1q32 of a human cDNA (RAB7L1) encoding a small GTP-binding protein, a member of the RAS superfamily.Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 77: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One of ∼60 small Rab family GTPases in the human genome, RAB7L1 has previously been shown to localize primarily to the Golgi apparatus and implicated in vesicular sorting in the context of Salmonella or Hepatitis C infection (Berger et al., 2009Berger K.L. Cooper J.D. Heaton N.S. Yoon R. Oakland T.E. Jordan T.X. Mateu G. Grakoui A. Randall G.

USA. 2011; 108: 18418-18423Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). But the function of RAB7L1 in CNS neurons remains unknown. Orthologs of RAB7L1 in other organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans Glo-1 and Drosophila melanogaster Lightoid, have been implicated in trafficking to lysosome-related organelles (Hermann et al., 2005Hermann G.J. Schroeder L.K. Hieb C.A. Kershner A.M. Rabbitts B.M. Fonarev P. Grant B.D. Priess J.R. Genetic analysis of lysosomal trafficking in Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3273-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and in the regulation of neurite process length (Grill et al., 2007Grill B. Bienvenut W.V. Brown H.M. Ackley B.D. Quadroni M. Jin Y. C. elegans RPM-1 regulates axon termination and synaptogenesis through the Rab GEF GLO-4 and the Rab GTPase GLO-1.Neuron. 2007; 55: 587-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), reminiscent of LRRK2 mutant phenotypes (MacLeod et al., 2006MacLeod D. Dowman J. Hammond R. Leete T. Inoue K. Abeliovich A. The familial Parkinsonism gene LRRK2 regulates neurite process morphology.Neuron. 2006; 52: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Thus this gene was of particular interest. Because GTPases such as RAB7L1 are typically only active in the GTP-bound state, we generated mutant forms that are constitutively active (CA; Q67L; this mutation is deficient in GTPase activity; data not shown) or inactive (IN; T21N; a mutation within the presumptive GTP binding site; data not shown). As expected, overexpression of the CA RAB7L1, but not IN RAB7L1, significantly suppressed the LRRK2 mutation-induced neurite length phenotype. Of other Rab family members, expression of RAB3A or RAB5A failed to rescue the phenotype, whereas RAB7 CA was effective in suppressing the process length shortening induced by LRRK2 mutation (Figure 2B). In contrast to RAB7L1 overexpression, knockdown of RAB7L1 alone led to a significant reduction in neurite process length, similar to the effect of the LRRK2 G2019S mutant expression (Figures 2B and S2B). We next sought more direct evidence of a physical interaction between LRRK2 and RAB7L1 and thus performed coimmunoprecipitation studies. Epitope-tagged forms of LRRK2 and RAB7L1 (3xFlag-LRRK2 and GFP-RAB7L1) were cotransfected into HEK293T cells, and after 48 hr, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody and then probed for RAB7L1. Flag-immunoprecipitation of LRRK2 effectively coprecipitated RAB7L1 (Figure 3A). The interaction did not appear to be altered by the presence of the G2019S mutation, or using a kinase-dead variant K1906M of LRRK2 (MacLeod et al., 2006MacLeod D. Dowman J. Hammond R. Leete T. Inoue K. Abeliovich A. The familial Parkinsonism gene LRRK2 regulates neurite process morphology.Neuron. 2006; 52: 587-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of RAB7L1 with an antibody to the GFP tag coprecipitated LRRK2 only in the presence of GFP-RAB7L1 (Figure 3B). To probe for an interaction between LRRK2 and RAB7L1 in a more physiological context, we examined RAB7L1 protein in brain lysates from transgenic mice that harbor human wild-type LRRK2 or a familial PD mutant form of LRRK2, R1441C, within a large bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) construct. Transgenic LRRK2 is broadly expressed throughout the CNS of these mice, although at relatively low levels (Figure S3A). Brain tissue lysates were immunoprecipitated for LRRK2 protein with a rabbit monoclonal antibody. Western blotting of the lysates for RAB7L1 demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation of RAB7L1 (Figure 3C). In vitro fluorescence microscopy studies were consistent with the presence of RAB7L1 and LRRK2 in common subcellular compartments. GFP-tagged RAB7L1, transfected into SH-SY5Y cells, localized primarily to the Golgi apparatus (as identified with the Golph4 marker), as well as along tubular structures emerging from Golgi apparatus, consistent with prior reports (Spanò et al., 2011Spanò S. Liu X. Galán J.E. Proteolytic targeting of Rab29 by an effector protein distinguishes the intracellular compartments of human-adapted and broad-host Salmonella.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 18418-18423Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). LRRK2 staining appeared more diffuse than RAB7L1, but there was significant overlap (Figure 3D). In contrast to the wild-type form, the RAB7L1 CA or IN mutant forms appeared more diffusely localized through the cytoplasm, as did a RAB7L1 alternative transcript (AT) deficient in the predicted GTP-binding region (Figure 3D; see below); accumulation of the IN and AT mutant proteins was significantly reduced (Figures 3D and S3B). To pursue potential mechanisms of LRRK2 pathology in vivo, we established a Drosophila model. Although transgenic mouse models expressing mutant LRRK2 have been widely described (Andres-Mateos et al., 2009Andres-Mateos E. Mejias R. Sasaki M. Li X. Lin B.M. Biskup S. Zhang L. Banerjee R.

Mok S.Z. Koh C. Ouyang X. Fivaz M.L. Tan E.K. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Yu F. Lim K.L. Parkin protects against LRRK2 G2019S mutant-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11257-11262Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic expression of wild-type human LRRK2 did not lead to a discernible phenotype. Furthermore, expression of the mutant G2019S LRRK2 transgene in several other cell types, including motor neurons, eye tissues, or muscles (using a variety of promoter-Gal4 driver constructs; data not shown), failed to lead to a discernible effect on survival or otherwise (data not shown). We subsequently performed a targeted screen for potential genetic modifiers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutant phenotype, based on the hypothesis that LRRK2 may modify a specific intracellular trafficking process, and focused on Rab family genes. A series of 16 Drosophila Rab genes, (see Table S4; out of 33 identified in Drosophila), or CA or IN forms of these (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang J. Schulze K.L. Hiesinger P.R. Suyama K. Wang S. Fish M. Acar M. Hoskins R.A. Bellen H.J. Scott M.P. Thirty-one flavors of Drosophila Rab proteins.Genetics. 2007; 176: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), were investigated. Briefly, LRRK2 G2019S mutants were mated with a panel of previously described transgenic Drosophila strains that allow for overexpression of wild-type (WT) or constitutively active (CA), forms of the Rab genes (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang J. Schulze K.L. Hiesinger P.R. Suyama K. Wang S. Fish M. Acar M. Hoskins R.A. Bellen H.J. Scott M.P. Thirty-one flavors of Drosophila Rab proteins.Genetics. 2007; 176: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), using a standard balancer chromosome-based mating scheme. Coexpression of a majority of these Rab transgenes with LRRK2 within dopamine neurons produced no effect on the survival of animals coexpressing LRRK2 G2019S (Figure 4A; Table S4). In contrast, overexpression of wild-type and CA forms of the Drosophila RAB7L1 ortholog (termed lightoid) afforded a dramatic rescue of the LRRK2 G2019S premature mortality phenotype (mean lifespan 24.0 days ± 1 for the CA; Figure 4A). Of note, among the other Rabs screened, only Rab7 led to a statistically significant—albeit much weaker—survival benefit (mean lifespan 14.3 days ± 0.6). Rab1, which was previously found to rescue a defect in vesicular trafficking to the Golgi apparatus in α-syn overexpression models of PD (Cooper et al., 2006Cooper A.A. Gitler A.D. Cashikar A.

https://openalex.org/W2149843002,"Genetic interaction (GI) maps, comprising pairwise measures of how strongly the function of one gene depends on the presence of a second, have enabled the systematic exploration of gene function in microorganisms. Here, we present a two-stage strategy to construct high-density GI maps in mammalian cells. First, we use ultracomplex pooled shRNA libraries (25 shRNAs/gene) to identify high-confidence hit genes for a given phenotype and effective shRNAs. We then construct double-shRNA libraries from these to systematically measure GIs between hits. A GI map focused on ricin susceptibility broadly recapitulates known pathways and provides many unexpected insights. These include a noncanonical role for COPI, a previously uncharacterized protein complex affecting toxin clearance, a specialized role for the ribosomal protein RPS25, and functionally distinct mammalian TRAPP complexes. The ability to rapidly generate mammalian GI maps provides a potentially transformative tool for defining gene function and designing combination therapies based on synergistic pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1997563565,"In neurons, the distinct molecular composition of axons and dendrites is established through polarized targeting mechanisms, but it is currently unclear how nonpolarized cargoes, such as mitochondria, become uniformly distributed over these specialized neuronal compartments. Here, we show that TRAK family adaptor proteins, TRAK1 and TRAK2, which link mitochondria to microtubule-based motors, are required for axonal and dendritic mitochondrial motility and utilize different transport machineries to steer mitochondria into axons and dendrites. TRAK1 binds to both kinesin-1 and dynein/dynactin, is prominently localized in axons, and is needed for normal axon outgrowth, whereas TRAK2 predominantly interacts with dynein/dynactin, is more abundantly present in dendrites, and is required for dendritic development. These functional differences follow from their distinct conformations: TRAK2 preferentially adopts a head-to-tail interaction, which interferes with kinesin-1 binding and axonal transport. Our study demonstrates how the molecular interplay between bidirectional adaptor proteins and distinct microtubule-based motors drives polarized mitochondrial transport."
https://openalex.org/W2080015061,"Survival in the wild requires organismal adaptations to the availability of nutrients. Endosomes and lysosomes are key intracellular organelles that couple nutrition and metabolic status to cellular responses, but how they detect cytosolic ATP levels is not well understood. Here, we identify an endolysosomal ATP-sensitive Na(+) channel (lysoNa(ATP)). The channel is a complex formed by two-pore channels (TPC1 and TPC2), ion channels previously thought to be gated by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The channel complex detects nutrient status, becomes constitutively open upon nutrient removal and mTOR translocation off the lysosomal membrane, and controls the lysosome's membrane potential, pH stability, and amino acid homeostasis. Mutant mice lacking lysoNa(ATP) have much reduced exercise endurance after fasting. Thus, TPCs make up an ion channel family that couples the cell's metabolic state to endolysosomal function and are crucial for physical endurance during food restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2015197347,"Memory impairment has been associated with age-related decline in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Although Notch, bone morphogenetic protein, and Wnt signaling pathways are known to regulate multiple aspects of adult neural stem cell function, the molecular basis of declining neurogenesis in the aging hippocampus remains unknown. Here, we show that expression of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) increases with age and that its loss enhances neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Neural progenitors with inducible loss of Dkk1 increase their Wnt activity, which leads to enhanced self-renewal and increased generation of immature neurons. This Wnt-expanded progeny subsequently matures into glutamatergic granule neurons with increased dendritic complexity. As a result, mice deficient in Dkk1 exhibit enhanced spatial working memory and memory consolidation and also show improvements in affective behavior. Taken together, our findings show that upregulating Wnt signaling by reducing Dkk1 expression can counteract age-related decrease in neurogenesis and its associated cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W2164222787,"Microglia are the immunocompetent cells of the central nervous system. In the physiological setting, their highly motile processes continually survey the local brain parenchyma and transiently contact synaptic elements. Although recent work has shown that the interaction of microglia with synapses contributes to synaptic remodeling during development, the role of microglia in synaptic physiology is just starting to get explored. To assess this question, we employed an electrophysiological approach using two methods to manipulate microglia in culture: organotypic hippocampal brain slices in which microglia were depleted using clodronate liposomes, and cultured hippocampal neurons to which microglia were added. We show here that the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic current increases in microglia-depleted brain slices, consistent with a higher synaptic density, and that this enhancement ensures from the loss of microglia since it is reversed when the microglia are replenished. Conversely, the addition of microglia to neuronal cultures decreases synaptic activity and reduces the density of synapses, spine numbers, surface expression of AMPA receptor (GluA1), and levels of synaptic adhesion molecules. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that non-activated microglia acutely modulate synaptic activity by regulating the number of functional synapses in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2077933134,"Adult neurogenesis, the process of generating mature neurons from adult neural stem cells, proceeds concurrently with ongoing neuronal circuit activity and is modulated by various physiological and pathological stimuli. The niche mechanism underlying the activity-dependent regulation of the sequential steps of adult neurogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we report that neuronal activity decreases the expression of secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3), a naturally secreted Wnt inhibitor highly expressed by adult dentate gyrus granule neurons. Sfrp3 deletion activates quiescent radial neural stem cells and promotes newborn neuron maturation, dendritic growth, and dendritic spine formation in the adult mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, sfrp3 reduction is essential for activity-induced adult neural progenitor proliferation and the acceleration of new neuron development. Our study identifies sFRP3 as an inhibitory niche factor from local mature dentate granule neurons that regulates multiple phases of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggests an interesting activity-dependent mechanism governing adult neurogenesis via the acute release of tonic inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2098666291,"Methanotrophs consume methane as their major carbon source and have an essential role in the global carbon cycle by limiting escape of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. These bacteria oxidize methane to methanol by soluble and particulate methane monooxygenases (MMOs). Soluble MMO contains three protein components, a 251-kilodalton hydroxylase (MMOH), a 38.6-kilodalton reductase (MMOR), and a 15.9-kilodalton regulatory protein (MMOB), required to couple electron consumption with substrate hydroxylation at the catalytic diiron centre of MMOH. Until now, the role of MMOB has remained ambiguous owing to a lack of atomic-level information about the MMOH-MMOB (hereafter termed H-B) complex. Here we remedy this deficiency by providing a crystal structure of H-B, which reveals the manner by which MMOB controls the conformation of residues in MMOH crucial for substrate access to the active site. MMOB docks at the α(2)β(2) interface of α(2)β(2)γ(2) MMOH, and triggers simultaneous conformational changes in the α-subunit that modulate oxygen and methane access as well as proton delivery to the diiron centre. Without such careful control by MMOB of these substrate routes to the diiron active site, the enzyme operates as an NADH oxidase rather than a monooxygenase. Biological catalysis involving small substrates is often accomplished in nature by large proteins and protein complexes. The structure presented in this work provides an elegant example of this principle."
https://openalex.org/W2040060261,"The insulin/insulin-like peptides (ILPs) regulate key events in physiology, including neural plasticity. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms whereby ILPs regulate learning remain largely unknown. Here, we characterize two ILPs that play antagonistic roles in aversive olfactory learning of C. elegans. We show that the ILP ins-6 acts from ASI sensory neurons to enable learning by repressing the transcription of another ILP, ins-7, specifically in URX neurons. A high level of INS-7 from URX disrupts learning by antagonizing the insulin receptor-like homolog DAF-2 in the postsynaptic neurons RIA, which play an essential role in the neural circuit underlying olfactory learning. We also show that increasing URX-generated INS-7 and loss of INS-6, both of which abolish learning, alter RIA neuronal property. Together, our results reveal an ""ILP-to-ILP"" pathway that links environment-sensing neurons, ASI and URX, to the key neuron, RIA, of a network that underlies olfactory plasticity and modulates its activity."
https://openalex.org/W1995222596,"Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells play a fundamental role in the development of the mammalian cerebral cortex. They control the formation of cortical layers by regulating the migration of pyramidal cells through the release of Reelin. The function of CR cells critically depends on their regular distribution throughout the surface of the cortex, but little is known about the events controlling this phenomenon. Using time-lapse video microscopy in vivo and in vitro, we found that movement of CR cells is regulated by repulsive interactions, which leads to their random dispersion throughout the cortical surface. Mathematical modeling reveals that contact repulsion is both necessary and sufficient for this process, which demonstrates that complex neuronal assemblies may emerge during development through stochastic events. At the molecular level, we found that contact repulsion is mediated by Eph/ephrin interactions. Our observations reveal a mechanism that controls the even distribution of neurons in the developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W1996583578,"Somatic progenitors suppress differentiation to maintain tissue self-renewal. The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex regulates nucleosome packaging to control differentiation in embryonic and adult stem cells. Catalytic Brg1 and Brm subunits are required for these processes; however, the roles of SWI/SNF regulatory subunits are not fully understood. Here, we show that ACTL6a/BAF53A modulates the SWI/SNF complex to suppress differentiation in epidermis. Conditional loss of ACTL6a resulted in terminal differentiation, cell-cycle exit, and hypoplasia, whereas ectopic expression of ACTL6a promoted the progenitor state. A significant portion of genes regulated by ACTL6a were found to also be targets of KLF4, a known activator of epidermal differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that ACTL6a prevents SWI/SNF complex binding to promoters of KLF4 and other differentiation genes and that SWI/SNF catalytic subunits are required for full induction of KLF4 targets. Thus, ACTL6a controls the epidermal progenitor state by sequestering SWI/SNF to prevent activation of differentiation programs."

Previous findings establish that transcriptional programs define cortical neuron identity and suggest that CTAs and thalamic axons may guide each other, but the mechanisms governing CTA versus CSA pathfinding remain elusive. Here, we show that thalamocortical axons are required to guide pioneer CTAs away from a default CSA-like trajectory. This process relies on a hold in the progression of cortical axons, or waiting period, during which thalamic projections navigate toward cortical axons. At the molecular level, Sema3E/PlexinD1 signaling in pioneer cortical neurons mediates a “waiting signal” required to orchestrate the mandatory meeting with reciprocal thalamic axons.

However, how they are established during development remains largely to be determined. Reciprocal connections between the thalamus and the neocortex are formed by thalamocortical axons (TCAs) and corticothalamic axons (CTAs) that convey sensory and motor information essential for cortical functioning. TCAs and CTAs contribute to the internal capsule, a large axonal highway navigating through the basal ganglia or subpallium, which also comprises output corticosubcerebral axons (CSAs) en route toward the cerebral peduncle and pyramidal tract (Auladell et al., 2000Auladell C.

The close vicinity of CTAs and TCAs together with analyses of mutant mice affecting one of the two axonal populations have suggested that these reciprocal projections might generally guide each other (Molnár and Blakemore, 1995Molnár Z.

Evidence that descending cortical axons are essential for thalamocortical axons to cross the pallial-subpallial boundary in the embryonic forebrain.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 (e,33105)Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis has remained controversial (Bagnard et al., 2001Bagnard D. Chounlamountri N. Püschel A.W. Bolz J.

Chounlamountri N. Püschel A.W. Bolz J. Axonal surface molecules act in combination with semaphorin 3a during the establishment of corticothalamic projections.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the mechanisms governing the pathfinding of somatosensory pCTAs. We found that pCTAs and CSAs follow distinct trajectories within the subpallium: pCTAs navigate together with TCAs in the permissive corridor, whereas CSAs grow in the GP before joining the cerebral peduncle. Using a combination of in vivo genetic ablation of the thalamus and ex vivo experiments, we demonstrated that TCAs are required to guide pCTAs into the corridor. In absence of TCAs, pCTAs follow a default CSA-like trajectory. This guidance function of TCAs relies on a pause, or waiting period, in the progression of corticofugal axons, given that pCTAs reached the lateral subpallium at least a day before TCAs. At the molecular level, PlexinD1/Semaphorin3E signaling is required to prevent premature subpallial progression of pCTAs before TCAs have reached the proper position, thereby ensuring that pCTAs follow their normal trajectory. Taken together, these results show that a waiting period controls the pathfinding of pCTAs, by allowing their interaction with incoming reciprocal TCAs. Our study reveals how temporal regulation of axonal progression regulates the pathfinding of pCTAs and opens perspectives on the role of timing in the formation of brain circuits. To investigate the mechanisms controlling pCTA pathfinding, we first examined the precise localization of pCTAs and CSAs in the subpallium using axonal tracing experiments with carbocyanine dyes (Figure 1 and see Figure S1 available online). Axonal paths were characterized at embryonic day (E) 17.5, when TCAs have reached the neocortical subplate, pCTAs the thalamus, and CSAs the cerebral peduncle (McConnell et al., 1989McConnell S.K.

Hence, DiI injections in the presumptive somatosensory cortex and DiA injections in the thalamus labeled axons exiting and entering each of these structures (Figures 1A and 1B). While TCAs and pCTAs costained by DiA and DiI formed a compact tract in the corridor (López-Bendito et al., 2006López-Bendito G. Cautinat A. Sánchez J.A. Bielle F. Flames N. Garratt A.N. Talmage D.A. Role L.W. Charnay P. Marín O. Garel S.

By performing additional tracing experiments from the thalamus and cerebral peduncle as well as from the internal capsule, we similarly found that pCTAs and CSAs have segregated trajectories in the corridor and GP, respectively (Figures 1C and S1). We furthermore examined globally the trajectory of cortical axons by taking advantage of the cortex-specific Emx1Cre mouse line (Gorski et al., 2002Gorski J.A. Talley T. Qiu M. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L.R. Jones K.R. Cortical excitatory neurons and glia, but not GABAergic neurons, are produced in the Emx,1-expressing lineage.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6309-6314PubMed Google Scholar) backcrossed to the reporter line TauGFP (Bielle et al., 2005Bielle F. Griveau A. Narboux-Nême N. Vigneau S. Sigrist M. Arber S. Wassef M. Pierani A. Multiple origins of Cajal-Retzius cells at the borders of the developing pallium.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Using a 45° plane of section that encompasses the entire projection, we consistently observed that: (1) subsets of cortical axons navigate in the corridor with TCAs, labeled by 2H3 neurofilament immunostaining, and (2) others form a less compact bundle in the Nkx2.1-expressing GP and extend into the cerebral peduncle (n = 5) (Figures 1D and 1D′). Taken together, our results show that somatosensory pCTAs and CSAs have distinct trajectories within the subpallium, with pCTAs navigating along the same route as TCAs in the corridor and CSAs growing in the deep GP (Figure 1F). pCTAs navigate within the corridor, raising the possibility that corridor neurons may directly guide pCTAs or that TCAs may orient pCTA pathfinding into the corridor. To discriminate between these possibilities, we first performed a genetic ablation of the thalamus to assess its long-distance impact on the pathfinding of pCTAs within the subpallium. To this aim, we backcrossed Wnt3aDTA mice (Yoshida et al., 2006Yoshida M. Assimacopoulos S. Jones K.R. Grove E.A. Massive loss of Cajal-Retzius cells does not disrupt neocortical layer order.Development. 2006; 133: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) that conditionally express the subunit A of the diphtheria toxin (DTA) in the cortical hem and thalamus (Yoshida et al., 2006Yoshida M.

Grove E.A. The derivatives of the Wnt3a lineage in the central nervous system.J. Comp.

Mishina Y. Hanks M.C. Behringer R.R. Crenshaw 3rd, E.B.

Brain Res. 2001; 128: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In Brn4Cre;Wnt3aDTA embryos, complete thalamus ablation was detected by tissue loss and lack of thalamic molecular markers (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2 and data not shown), with a subsequent absence of TCAs (Figures 2C and 2D). Using specific markers, we found that the patterning of the prethalamus and the subpallium (Ebf1, Islet1, Nkx2.1, Ctip2, and Foxp2), as well as cortical lamination (Calretinin, Tbr1, Ctip2, and ZFPM2), were not affected in thalamus-ablated embryos (n = 8) (Figures 2E–2J and S2 and data not shown). We next examined the subpallial trajectory of pCTAs in the absence of TCAs, using DiI labeling in the presumptive somatosensory neocortex and L1 immunostaining, which labels both cortical and thalamic axons (Figures 3A–3F and S3). We observed that corticofugal axons grew normally into the subpallium at E14.5 (n = 6) (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3), indicating that this event is independent of incoming TCAs. However, in E16.5 and E18.5 thalamus-ablated embryos, all the labeled corticofugal axons passed through the Nkx2.1-expressing GP and reached the cerebral peduncle (nE16.5 = 5 and nE18.5 = 4) (Figures 3D, 3D′, 3F, and S3). This is in sharp contrast with the control situation in which pCTAs and TCAs navigate in the corridor and CSAs in the GP (Figures 3C, 3C′, 3E, and S3). Our observations indicated that in thalamus-ablated embryos, pCTAs either do not grow into the subpallium or adopt an abnormal CSA-like trajectory. To discriminate between these possibilities, we backlabeled cortical neurons that had extended axons in the corridor or GP at E17.5 and E18.5 (Figures 3G and 3H and data not shown). In both controls and thalamus-ablated embryos, we labeled a large majority of neurons in the subplate and layer VI, as well as in layer V (nE17.5 = 4 and nE18.5 = 4) (Figures 3G and 3H and data not shown). Taken together, these observations showed that, in thalamus-ablated embryos, subplate and deep layer VI pCTAs are misguided along an alternative CSA-like trajectory (Figures 3I and 3J), in spite of their CTA-specific molecular identity (Figures 3H and S2). Our results thus reveal that corridor cells and subpallial structures are not sufficient to guide pCTAs and that the ablation of the thalamus has a distal impact on the trajectory of pCTAs in the subpallium.Figure 3Pathfinding Defects of pCTAs in the Subpallium of Thalamus-Ablated EmbryosShow full caption(A and B) DiI tracings from the presumptive somatosensory neocortex at E14.5 in control (A) and thalamus-ablated (B) embryos reveal a similar trajectory of corticofugal axons (arrowheads).(C–F) E16.5 serial coronal sections of a control (C and C′) and a thalamus-ablated (D and D′) embryo after DiI crystal insertions in the presumptive somatosensory neocortex showing corticofugal axon pathway in the subpallium.

Since our in vivo analysis strongly suggested that TCAs might guide pCTAs, we set up an ex vivo assay to directly test this hypothesis. We took advantage of the fact that TCAs grow along a 45° angle trajectory and are thus present in E13.5 caudal coronal slices but not yet present in E13.5 intermediate coronal slices (Figure 4A and data not shown).

In mice, the majority of cones coexpress both “blue” and “green” opsin. The coexpression ratio changes along the dorsoventral axis, resulting in a “green”-dominant dorsal and a “blue”-dominant ventral retina. Here, we asked how these specializations affect chromatic processing, especially with respect to the opsin transitional zone, the band where opsin coexpression shifts from “green” to “blue.” Using electrophysiology, modeling, and calcium imaging, we found that “alpha-like” retinal ganglion cells, which previously have not been implicated in chromatic processing, display color-opponent responses when located in the vicinity of the opsin transitional zone. Moreover, direction-selective ganglion cells within this zone respond differentially to color sequences. Our data suggest that the dorsoventral opsin distribution, in combination with conventional spatiotemporal processing, renders mouse ganglion cell responses color-opponent without requiring cone-type selective connectivity.

Retinal ganglion cells extract color information encoded in opsin gradients Color opponency arises from cone-type unselective retinal circuits A single opsin coexpressing cone type can suffice for generating color opponency Mouse direction-selective ganglion cells differentially encode color sequences Color vision starts already at the first synapse of the visual system: In the outer retina, signals from short (S, “blue”), middle (M, “green”), and long (L, “red”) wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors are compared and chromatic information is segregated into parallel pathways and along two dimensions: red-green and blue-yellow (for review, see Dacey, 2000Dacey D.M.

The genetics of normal and defective color vision.Vision Res. 2011; 51: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Among mammals, red-green (L versus M) opponency is restricted to trichromatic primates. It results from a gene duplication event that occurred “only” 30–35 million years ago (for review, see Nathans, 1999Nathans J.

In contrast, blue-green (S versus M) opponency is common to most mammals and represents the basis of dichromatic color vision. It is thought to rely on highly cone-type selective, evolutionary ancient retinal circuits (Chen and Li, 2012Chen S. Li W.

A non-canonical pathway for mammalian blue-green color vision.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 952-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The primate’s equivalent of the blue-green pathway implements blue-yellow (S versus L+M) opponency (Zrenner and Gouras, 1981Zrenner E. Gouras P. Characteristics of the blue sensitive cone mechanism in primate retinal ganglion cells.Vision Res. 1981; 21: 1605-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the underlying retinal circuits have been studied in great detail (for review, see Dacey, 2000Dacey D.M. Parallel pathways for spectral coding in primate retina.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 743-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For example, one of the primate ganglion cell types displaying S versus L+M opponency, the “small bistratified” cell (Crook et al., 2009Crook J.D. Davenport C.M. Peterson B.B. Packer O.S. Detwiler P.B. Dacey D.M. Parallel ON and OFF cone bipolar inputs establish spatially coextensive receptive field structure of blue-yellow ganglion cells in primate retina.J.

The ‘blue-on’ opponent pathway in primate retina originates from a distinct bistratified ganglion cell type.Nature. 1994; 367: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), receives input from ON-bipolar cells that exclusively contact S-cones (“blue-cone bipolar cells”) and OFF-bipolar cells that largely avoid S-cones (Calkins et al., 1998Calkins D.J.

Neurol. 1999; 413: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for an alternative blue-yellow opponent pathway that may not rely on these “classical” S versus L+M-cone circuits. First, psychophysical experiments revealed properties of human blue-yellow perception that cannot be explained by the properties of known S versus L+M opponent retinal ganglion cells (De Valois and De Valois, 1993De Valois R.L. De Valois K.K. A multi-stage color model.Vision Res. 1993; 33: 1053-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar; Drum, 1989Drum B. Hue signals from short- and middle-wavelength-sensitive cones.J.

Biol. 2008; 18: R700-R702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, human subjects lacking the glutamate receptors mediating photoreceptor transmission onto ON-bipolar cells, which include blue-cone bipolar cells, show no substantial deficits in blue-yellow color vision (Dryja et al., 2005Dryja T.P. McGee T.L. Berson E.L. Fishman G.A. Sandberg M.A. Alexander K.R. Derlacki D.J. Rajagopalan A.S. Night blindness and abnormal cone electroretinogram ON responses in patients with mutations in the GRM6 gene encoding mGluR6.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the search for cone-type selective retinal circuits with properties predicted by psychophysical experiments has not yet been successful (for discussion, see Neitz and Neitz, 2011Neitz J. Neitz M. The genetics of normal and defective color vision.Vision Res. 2011; 51: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). One possible way out of this dilemma may come from recent genetic studies: Behavioral experiments showed that dichromatic animals display trichromacy after introducing a transgene coding for a third type of cone opsin (mice: Jacobs et al., 2007Jacobs G.H. Williams G.A. Cahill H. Nathans J. Emergence of novel color vision in mice engineered to express a human cone photopigment.Science. 2007; 315: 1723-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar; squirrel monkey: Mancuso et al., 2009Mancuso K. Hauswirth W.W. Li Q. Connor T.B. Kuchenbecker J.A. Mauck M.C. Neitz J. Neitz M. Gene therapy for red-green colour blindness in adult primates.Nature. 2009; 461: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This rapid emergence of a new dimension in color space in former dichromats may be due to the formation of novel circuits; however, it is more likely that preexisting, cone-type unselective retinal microcircuits are able to extract (new) chromatic information (Makous, 2007Makous W. Comment on “Emergence of novel color vision in mice engineered to express a human cone photopigment”.Science. 2007; 318: 196Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar; Shapley, 2009Shapley R. Vision: Gene therapy in colour.Nature. 2009; 461: 737-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The latter possibility could also provide for the “missing” substrate needed for a comprehensive explanation of blue-yellow perception. Chromatic opponency can arise in retinal circuits that lack cone-type selective connections (“random wiring”), if (1) the circuit compares input from different regions of the cone array, e.g., in form of an antagonistically organized center-surround receptive field, and (2) an anisotropy in cone distribution and/or opsin expression is present (Neitz and Neitz, 2011Neitz J. Neitz M. The genetics of normal and defective color vision.Vision Res. 2011; 51: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar; Paulus and Kröger-Paulus, 1983Paulus W. Kröger-Paulus A. A new concept of retinal colour coding.Vision Res. 1983; 23: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this context, anisotropy refers to any difference in opsin expression ratio between two retinal positions. How chromatic opponency arises from (local) anisotropies in the cone mosaic in combination with random wiring has been studied for L versus M opponency in the primate midget pathway (e.g., Crook et al., 2011Crook J.D. Manookin M.B. Packer O.S. Dacey D.M. Horizontal cell feedback without cone type-selective inhibition mediates “red-green” color opponency in midget ganglion cells of the primate retina.J.

With respect to S versus M opponency, this question may be explored in dichromatic mammals that display systematic large-scale anisotropies in their cone mosaic (Röhlich et al., 1994Röhlich P. van Veen T.

In mice, such an anisotropy is laid out by a gradient of S-opsin coexpression in M-cones that increases along the dorsoventral axis toward the ventral edge of the retina (Applebury et al., 2000Applebury M.L. Antoch M.P. Baxter L.C. Chun L.L. Falk J.D. Farhangfar F. Kage K. Krzystolik M.G. Lyass L.A. Robbins J.T. The murine cone photoreceptor: a single cone type expresses both S and M opsins with retinal spatial patterning.Neuron. 2000; 27: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), resulting in distinct retinal regions dominated by different opsins. Electrical recordings from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) confirmed that this opsin gradient strongly affects chromatic response tuning across the mouse retina (Ekesten and Gouras, 2005Ekesten B. Gouras P. Cone and rod inputs to murine retinal ganglion cells: evidence of cone opsin specific channels.Vis. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2011Wang Y.V. Weick M. Demb J.B. Spectral and temporal sensitivity of cone-mediated responses in mouse retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 7670-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Despite this, mice possess RGCs that display color opponency analog to that found in primate (Ekesten and Gouras, 2005Ekesten B. Gouras P. Cone and rod inputs to murine retinal ganglion cells: evidence of cone opsin specific channels.Vis. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and behavioral experiments confirmed that mice can discriminate colors (Jacobs et al., 2004Jacobs G.H. Williams G.A. Fenwick J.A. Influence of cone pigment coexpression on spectral sensitivity and color vision in the mouse.Vision Res. 2004; 44: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Connectivity analysis of mouse blue-cone bipolar cells showed that the distribution of pure (“true”) S-cones is unaffected by the gradient: they account for ∼4% of all cones and are distributed homogenously across the retina (Haverkamp et al., 2005Haverkamp S. Wässle H. Duebel J. Kuner T. Augustine G.J. Feng G. Euler T. The primordial, blue-cone color system of the mouse retina.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5438-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Consequently, the mouse retina can roughly be divided into three functional regions: (1) a dorsal part that resembles the peripheral retina of most mammals in that it contains a majority of M-cones (with little S-opsin coexpression) interspersed with “true” S-cones, (2) an opsin transitional zone (OTZ), in which the ratio between S- and M-opsin expression in M-cones increases, and (3) a strongly S-opsin-dominated ventral part (Röhlich et al., 1994Röhlich P. van Veen T. Szél A. Two different visual pigments in one retinal cone cell.Neuron. 1994; 13: 1159-1166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The dorsal region is suitable for “classical” S versus M chromatic processing, whereas the ventral region may be largely restricted to achromatic processing (Yin et al., 2009Yin L. Smith R.G. Sterling P. Brainard D.H. Physiology and morphology of color-opponent ganglion cells in a retina expressing a dual gradient of S and M opsins.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2706-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The OTZ and its neighborhood are very interesting for exploring cone-type unselective chromatic processing, as here the S- versus M-opsin ratio changes dramatically over relatively short retinal distances. Hence, it is conceivable that RGCs in this region extract color information from the opsin gradient, e.g., if center and surround of a RGC’s antagonistic receptive field receive input from regions with different opsin expression ratios (Ekesten and Gouras, 2005Ekesten B. Gouras P. Cone and rod inputs to murine retinal ganglion cells: evidence of cone opsin specific channels.Vis. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar; Gouras and Ekesten, 2004Gouras P. Ekesten B. Why do mice have ultra-violet vision?.Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 79: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the present study, we recorded from RGCs located along the dorsoventral axis of the mouse retina—in particular in and close to the OTZ—to study the effects of opsin distribution on the response properties of two types of cells that are generally considered achromatic: “alpha-like” RGCs, which represent highly sensitive change-in-brightness detectors, and direction-selective RGCs, which signal direction of image motion. In both cases, we found the cells to encode chromatic information as a consequence of the interaction between opsin distribution anisotropy and cone-type unselective spatiotemporal processing. To evaluate the relative contribution of M- and S-opsin-mediated input as a function of cell location, we electrically recorded from RGCs at different positions in a range of approximately ±1.5 mm along the dorsoventral axis of the mouse retinal whole mount. Most cells were recorded in the temporal retina, approximately 0.9 mm from the optic disc. We used transgenic mice (GFP-O) (Feng et al., 2000Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M. Nerbonne J.M. Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Imaging neuronal subsets in transgenic mice expressing multiple spectral variants of GFP.Neuron. 2000; 28: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in subsets of RGCs. Using two-photon imaging (Denk et al., 1990Denk W. Strickler J.H. Webb W.W. Two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy.Science. 1990; 248: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8303) Google Scholar), we visualized the dendritic morphologies of fluorescently labeled RGCs and targeted ON-cells with “alpha-like” morphology (RGA1 or RGA2, see Sun et al., 2002Sun W. Li N. He S. Large-scale morphological survey of mouse retinal ganglion cells.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 451: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar; soma diameters of ∼20 μm; dendritic field sizes of ∼260 μm; IPL stratification at ∼75%) for cell-attached recordings. We presented M- and S-opsin-isolating spot stimuli (2 mm in diameter) sinusoidally modulated at 1 Hz and recorded RGC spike responses (Figure 1). In the following, we will refer to M- and S-opsin-isolating chromatic conditions (see Experimental Procedures for details) as “green” and “blue,” respectively. The fundamental response components (F1) of spike responses to green and blue were used to calculate chromatic contrast [CGB = (G-B)/(G+B)], which served as an estimate of opsin input ratio. As expected from the opsin expression gradient, dorsal RGCs received stronger M- (green) than S-opsin (blue) input (cell a, Figure 1A), whereas ventral cells received stronger S- than M-opsin input (cell b, Figure 1B) (see also Wang et al., 2011Wang Y.V.

Surprisingly, we also found cells that exhibited S versus M or M versus S opponency, that is blueON-greenOFF (cell c, Figure 1C) or greenON-blueOFF (cells with CGB > 1 in Figure 2E) type responses, respectively.Figure 2Chromatic Opponency Is Strongest in Ganglion Cells Close to the Opsin Transitional ZoneShow full caption(A) Stimulus conditions used for estimating the ratio of M- and S-opsin input to the ganglion cells: Contrast and phase of M- (green) and S-opsin-isolating stimuli (blue) varied systematically in 13 steps (= stimulus index).

To exclude that chromatic opponency resulted from a stimulus-related nonlinearity, such as a switch of response polarity for different contrasts (Odermatt et al., 2012Odermatt B. Nikolaev A. Lagnado L. Encoding of luminance and contrast by linear and nonlinear synapses in the retina.Neuron. 2012; 73: 758-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we presented a second type of stimulus that consisted of 13 different contrast-phase combinations (Figure 2A). Accordingly, RGCs with different ratios of opsin input should exhibit different response profiles to this stimulus, reaching maximum and minimum response amplitudes at different contrast-phase combinations (Figure 2B). The opsin input ratio (represented by CGB) was then estimated by fitting F1 amplitudes with a linear summation model (see Experimental Procedures for details). In contrast to the CGB estimate from the first stimulus (Figure 1), this estimate is expected to be resistant to static nonlinearities in the retinal circuitry (Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). The data obtained with the second stimulus confirmed our observation of color opponency (Figure 2C): for the set of “alpha-like” ON-stratifying RGCs tested with both stimuli (n = 34), the estimated CGB was nearly identical (Figure 2D). In total, 71% of the recorded RGCs displayed chromatic opponency (|CGB| > 1) for both stimuli. The strongest opponency occurred within a region spanning approximately ±600 μm from the retina’s horizontal midline (Figures 2E; Figure S1), which covers the OTZ and its vicinity (for quantification, see below). In the retina and the LGN of primates, two principle types of color opponent neurons can be distinguished (Wiesel and Hubel, 1966Wiesel T.N. Hubel D.H. Spatial and chromatic interactions in the lateral geniculate body of the rhesus monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 1966; 29: 1115-1156PubMed Google Scholar): type I cells possess a receptive field (RF) organization with antagonistic center and surround components that are each chromatically biased toward different cone types (e.g., midget RGCs, Buzás et al., 2006Buzás P. Blessing E.M. Szmajda B.A. Martin P.R. Specificity of M and L cone inputs to receptive fields in the parvocellular pathway: random wiring with functional bias.J.

Receptive field structure in the primate retina.Vision Res. 1996; 36: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Type II cells, on the other hand, possess RFs that are only weakly segregated into center and surround, and instead consist of coextensive, chromatically antagonistic RF components (e.g., “small bistratified” RGCs, Crook et al., 2009Crook J.D. Davenport C.M. Peterson B.B. Packer O.S. Detwiler P.B. Dacey D.M. Parallel ON and OFF cone bipolar inputs establish spatially coextensive receptive field structure of blue-yellow ganglion cells in primate retina.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8372-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar; Dacey and Lee, 1994Dacey D.M. Lee B.B. The ‘blue-on’ opponent pathway in primate retina originates from a distinct bistratified ganglion cell type.Nature. 1994; 367: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). To assess the RF properties of the mouse RGCs we presented the varying-contrast stimuli (Figures 2A–2C) but with smaller spot diameters, including one that was smaller than the dendritic field size of “alpha-like” RGCs (Figure 3). We found that RGCs displaying chromatic opponency (|CGB| > 1) for 2 mm stimuli became nonopponent (|CGB| ≤ 1) for 180 μm stimuli (Figures 3A1 and 3A2). This change was observed both for cells with blue- (CGB < −0.2) and green-biased RF centers (CGB > 0.2; Figure 3B). The dependency on stimulus diameter suggests that center and surround of the recorded RGCs received differential input from the two opsins, and therefore, in terms of chromatic opponency, these cells possessed type I RFs. The dependency of CGB on stimuli size and cell location along the dorsoventral axis implies that both center-surround RF organization and opsin gradient contribute to the observed chromatic opponency. A RGC located close to the OTZ (e.g., white cell in Figure 4A) is expected to exhibit a relatively pure RF center—either M- or S-dominated, depending on its retinal location—and due to its large size a mixed RF surround. To explore this idea quantitatively, we built a simple numerical model with two components, opsin gradient and antagonistic center-surround RF organization (Figure 4B). The latter was estimated by fitting a difference-of-Gaussians RF model to responses of “alpha-like” RGCs elicited by spots of varying diameters (Figure S2). The opsin gradient was assumed to be sigmoidal along the dorsoventral axis (see Experimental Procedures for model description; Figure S3 for parameter estimation). The results of the model are consistent with our experimental observations (Figure 4C): for small spots, CGB (as a function of retinal location) reflects the chromatic contrast prediction of the opsin gradient and remains within the nonopponent range (−1 ≤ CGB ≤ 1), whereas for large spots, CGB diverges from this prediction and becomes chromatically opponent (|CGB| > 1) for cells closer to the OTZ midline. Assuming a minimum criterion of |CGB| ≥ 1.1 (for 2 mm stimuli), our model predicts that the region with detectable chromatic opponency in “alpha-like” RGCs spans ±580 μm from the OTZ midline (±690 μm when projected to the dorsoventral axis, see shaded area in Figure 4C), which is consistent with our measurements (cf. Figure S1). For RGCs located in the “region of chromatic opponency” (see above), the model predicts that center and surround possess different chromatic tuning—as indicated by the fact that their chromatic contrast of |CGB| > 1 depends on the stimulus diameter. It also predicts that the RF surround should be chromatically inhomogeneous, because the surround of “alpha-like” RGCs is so large (≥1 mm in diameter, Figure S2A) such that the dorsal and ventral parts of the surround can receive input from areas with dramatically different S-/M-opsin ratio (illustrated by large white circle in Figure 4A). To test this hypothesis, we designed a white-noise stimulus consisting of nine “patches” with two independent color dimensions (blue and green). It consisted of one central patch to determine the chromatic tuning of the RF center and an annulus of eight 45° sector patches to probe the RF surround (Figure 5A). The relative chromatic tuning (G/[G+B]) of each patch position was quantified by computing spike-triggered aver"

In this study we demonstrated that the microRNA-130a/301a/454 family is up-regulated in colon cancer tissues compared to paired adjacent normal mucosa, which share the same 3′-untranslational region (3′-UTR) binding seed sequence and are predicated to target Smad4. In colorectal cancer HCT116 and SW480 cells, overexpression of miRNA-130a/301a/454 mimics enhances cell proliferation and migration, while inhibitors of these miRNAs affect cell survival. The biological function of miRNA-130a/301a/454 on colon cancer cells is likely mediated by suppression of Smad4, and the up-regulation of the miRNAs is correlated with Smad4 down-regulation in human colon cancers. Collectively, these results suggest that miRNA-130a/301a/454 are novel oncogenic miRNAs contributing to colon tumorigenesis by regulating TGF-β/Smad signaling, which may have potential application in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2060211185,"Mutant alleles of EXT1 or EXT2, two members of the EXT gene family, are causative agents in hereditary multiple exostoses, and their gene products function together as a polymerase in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate. EXTL2, one of three EXT-like genes in the human genome that are homologous to EXT1 and EXT2, encodes a transferase that adds not only GlcNAc but also N-acetylgalactosamine to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-protein linkage region via an α1,4-linkage. However, both the role of EXTL2 in the biosynthesis of GAGs and the biological significance of EXTL2 remain unclear. Here we show that EXTL2 transfers a GlcNAc residue to the tetrasaccharide linkage region that is phosphorylated by a xylose kinase 1 (FAM20B) and thereby terminates chain elongation. We isolated an oligosaccharide from the mouse liver, which was not detected in EXTL2 knock-out mice. Based on structural analysis by a combination of glycosidase digestion and 500-MHz (1)H NMR spectroscopy, the oligosaccharide was found to be GlcNAcα1-4GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl(2-O-phosphate), which was considered to be a biosynthetic intermediate of an immature GAG chain. Indeed, EXTL2 specifically transferred a GlcNAc residue to a phosphorylated linkage tetrasaccharide, GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl(2-O-phosphate). Remarkably, the phosphorylated linkage pentasaccharide generated by EXTL2 was not used as an acceptor for heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate polymerases. Moreover, production of GAGs was significantly higher in EXTL2 knock-out mice than in wild-type mice. These results indicate that EXTL2 functions to suppress GAG biosynthesis that is enhanced by a xylose kinase and that the EXTL2-dependent mechanism that regulates GAG biosynthesis might be a ""quality control system"" for proteoglycans."

Microglial cells become activated in response to injury, infection, environmental toxins, and other stimuli that threaten neuronal survival. Therefore, regulating microglial activation may have therapeutic benefits that lead to alleviating the progression of inflammatory-mediated neurodegeneration. In the present study, we investigated the effect of glaucocalyxin A (GLA) isolated from Rabdosia japonica on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary microglia and BV-2 cells. GLA significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of nitric oxide and reversed the morphological changes in primary microglia. Further, GLA suppressed expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 dose-dependently at the mRNA and protein levels. The production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β (IL)-1β, and IL-6 were inhibited by suppressing their transcriptional activity. Furthermore, GLA suppressed nuclear factor-κB activation by blocking degradation of IκB-α and inhibited the induction of lipocalin-2 expression in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. Mechanistic study revealed that the inhibitory effects of GLA were accompanied by blocking the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway in activated microglia. In conclusion, given that microglial activation contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, GLA could be developed as a potential therapeutic agent for treating microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1987737432,"Background We aimed to assess, for the first time, the nature of the indoor air contamination of hospitals. Methods and Findings More than 40 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including aliphatic, aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, ethers and terpenes were measured in a teaching hospital in France, from sampling in six sampling sites – reception hall, patient room, nursing care, post-anesthesia care unit, parasitology-mycology laboratory and flexible endoscope disinfection unit – in the morning and in the afternoon, during three consecutive days. Our results showed that the main compounds found in indoor air were alcohols (arithmetic means ± SD: 928±958 µg/m3 and 47.9±52.2 µg/m3 for ethanol and isopropanol, respectively), ethers (75.6±157 µg/m3 for ether) and ketones (22.6±20.6 µg/m3 for acetone). Concentrations levels of aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons, ketones, aldehydes and limonene were widely variable between sampling sites, due to building age and type of products used according to health activities conducted in each site. A high temporal variability was observed in concentrations of alcohols, probably due to the intensive use of alcohol-based hand rubs in all sites. Qualitative analysis of air samples led to the identification of other compounds, including siloxanes (hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane), anesthetic gases (sevoflurane, desflurane), aliphatic hydrocarbons (butane), esters (ethylacetate), terpenes (camphor, α-bisabolol), aldehydes (benzaldehyde) and organic acids (benzoic acid) depending on sites. Conclusion For all compounds, concentrations measured were lower than concentrations known to be harmful in humans. However, results showed that indoor air of sampling locations contains a complex mixture of VOCs. Further multicenter studies are required to compare these results. A full understanding of the exposure of healthcare workers and patients to complex mixtures of chemical compounds can then be related to potential health outcomes."

Here, we investigated the capacity of HIV-1 to modulate NKG2DL expression and escape NGK2D-mediated immunosurveillance. In CD4(+) T lymphocytes, both cell surface expression and release of MICA, MICB, and ULBP2 were up-regulated >2-fold by HIV-1 infection. In HIV-infected CD4(+) T lymphocytes or Jurkat T-cell lines, increased shedding of soluble NKG2DLs (sNKG2DLs) was impaired by a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPI). Moreover, naive HIV(+) patients displayed increased plasma sMICA and sULBP2 levels and reduced NKG2D expression on NK and CD8(+) T cells compared to patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or healthy donors. In individual patients, HAART uptake resulted in the drop of sNKG2DL and recovery of NKG2D expression. Finally, sNKG2DLs in patients' plasma down-regulated NKG2D on NK and CD8(+) T cells and impaired NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells. Thus, NKG2D detuning by sNKG2DLs may promote HIV-1 immune evasion and compromise host resistance to opportunistic infections, but HAART and MMPI have the potential to avoid such immune dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2146843907,"The expression of the transcription factor GATA3 in FOXP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells is crucial for their physiological function in limiting inflammatory responses. Although other studies have shown how T cell receptor (TcR) signals induce the up-regulation of GATA3 expression in Treg cells, the underlying mechanism that maintains GATA3 expression in Treg cells remains unclear. Here, we show how USP21 interacts with and stabilizes GATA3 by mediating its deubiquitination. In a T cell line model, we found that TcR stimulation promoted USP21 expression, which was further up-regulated in the presence of FOXP3. The USP21 mutant C221A reduced its capacity to stabilize GATA3 expression, and its knockdown led to the down-regulation of GATA3 protein expression in Treg cells. Furthermore, we found that FOXP3 could directly bind to the USP21 gene promoter and activated its transcription upon TcR stimulation. Finally, USP21, GATA3, and FOXP3 were found up-regulated in Treg cells that were isolated from asthmatic subjects. In summary, we have identified a USP21-mediated pathway that promotes GATA3 stabilization and expression at the post-translational level. We propose that this pathway forms an important signaling loop that stabilizes the expression of GATA3 in Treg cells."

Here, we show that manipulations to synaptic ribbons caused dramatic effects on mEPSC-like (mlEPSC) amplitude and frequency. Damage to rod-bipolar cell ribbons using fluorophore-assisted light inactivation resulted in the immediate reduction of mlEPSC amplitude and frequency, whereas the first evoked response after damage remained largely intact. The reduction in amplitude could not be recovered by increasing release frequency after ribbon damage. In parallel experiments, we looked at mlEPSCs from cones of hibernating ground squirrels, which exhibit dramatically smaller ribbons than awake animals. Fewer and smaller mlEPSCs were observed postsynaptic to cones from hibernating animals, although depolarized cones were able to generate larger mlEPSCs. Our results indicate that ribbon size may influence mlEPSC frequency and support a role for ribbons in coordinating multivesicular release."
https://openalex.org/W2171486097,"Electric fields of synaptic currents can influence diffusion of charged neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, in the synaptic cleft. However, this phenomenon has hitherto been detected only through sustained depolarization of large principal neurons, and its adaptive significance remains unknown. Here, we find that in cerebellar synapses formed on electrically compact granule cells, a single postsynaptic action potential can retard escape of glutamate released into the cleft. This retardation boosts activation of perisynaptic group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which in turn rapidly facilitates local NMDA receptor currents. The underlying mechanism relies on a Homer-containing protein scaffold, but not GPCR- or Ca(2+)-dependent signaling. Through the mGluR-NMDAR interaction, the coincidence between a postsynaptic spike and glutamate release triggers a lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission that alters the basic integrate-and-spike rule in the circuitry. Our results thus reveal an electrodiffusion-driven synaptic memory mechanism that requires high-precision coincidence detection suitable for high-fidelity circuitries."
https://openalex.org/W1973308237,"The retina consists of ordered arrays of individual types of neurons for processing vision. Here, we show that such order is necessary for intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) to function as irradiance detectors. We found that during development, ipRGCs undergo proximity-dependent Bax-mediated apoptosis. Bax mutant mice exhibit disrupted ipRGC spacing and dendritic stratification with an increase in abnormally localized synapses. ipRGCs are the sole conduit for light input to circadian photoentrainment, and either their melanopsin-based photosensitivity or ability to relay rod/cone input is sufficient for circadian photoentrainment. Remarkably, the disrupted ipRGC spacing does not affect melanopsin-based circadian photoentrainment but severely impairs rod/cone-driven photoentrainment. We demonstrate reduced rod/cone-driven cFos activation and electrophysiological responses in ipRGCs, suggesting that impaired synaptic input to ipRGCs underlies the photoentrainment deficits. Thus, for irradiance detection, developmental apoptosis is necessary for the spacing and connectivity of ipRGCs that underlie their functioning within a neural network."
https://openalex.org/W2091411579,"White matter lesions (WML) are clinically relevant since they are associated with strokes, cognitive decline, depression, or epilepsy, but the underlying etiology in young adults without classical risk factors still remains elusive. Our aim was to elucidate the possible clinical diagnosis and mechanisms leading to WML in patients carrying the D313Y mutation in the α-galactosidase A (GLA) gene, a mutation that was formerly described as nonpathogenic. Pathogenic GLA mutations cause Fabry disease, a vascular endothelial glycosphingolipid storage disease typically presenting with a symptom complex of renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular manifestations. We performed in-depths clinical, biochemical and genetic examinations as well as advanced magnetic resonance imaging analyses in a pedigree with the genetically determined GLA mutation D313Y. We detected exclusive neurologic manifestations of the central nervous system of the “pseudo”-deficient D313Y mutation leading to manifest WML in 7 affected adult family members. Furthermore, two family members that do not carry the mutation showed no WML. The D313Y mutation resulted in a normal GLA enzyme activity in leukocytes and severely decreased activities in plasma. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that GLA D313Y is potentially involved in neural damage with significant WML, demonstrating the necessity of evaluating patients carrying D313Y more thoroughly. D313Y might broaden the spectrum of hereditary small artery diseases of the brain, which preferably occur in young adults without classical risk factors. In view of the existing causal therapy regime, D313Y should be more specifically taken into account in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W1988915515,"Cucurbitacin B (CuB) is one of the potential agents for long term anticancer chemoprevention. Cumulative evidences has shown that cucurbitacin B provides potent cellular biological activities such as hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, but the precise mechanism of this agent is not clearly understood. We examine the biological effects on cancer cells of cucurbitacin B extracted from a Thai herb, Trichosanthes cucumerina L. The wild type (wt) BRCA1, mutant BRCA1, BRCA1 knocked-down and BRCA1 overexpressed breast cancer cells were treated with the cucurbitacin B and determined for the inhibitory effects on the cell proliferation, migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth. The gene expressions in the treated cells were analyzed for p21/Waf1, p27Kip1 and survivin. Our previous study revealed that loss of BRCA1 expression leads to an increase in survivin expression, which is responsible for a reduction in sensitivity to paclitaxel. In this work, we showed that cucurbitacin B obviously inhibited knocked-down and mutant BRCA1 breast cancer cells rather than the wild type BRCA1 breast cancer cells in regards to the cellular proliferation, migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, forcing the cells to overexpress wild type BRCA1 significantly reduced effectiveness of cucurbitacin B on growth inhibition of the endogenous mutant BRCA1 cells. Interestingly, cucurbitacin B promotes the expression of p21/Waf1 and p27Kip1 but inhibit the expression of survivin. We suggest that survivin could be an important target of cucurbitacin B in BRCA1 defective breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017508074,"Genetic association studies have revealed numerous polymorphisms conferring susceptibility to melanoma. We aimed to replicate previously discovered melanoma-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a Greek case-control population, and examine their predictive value.Based on a field synopsis of genetic variants of melanoma (MelGene), we genotyped 284 patients and 284 controls at 34 melanoma-associated SNPs of which 19 derived from GWAS. We tested each one of the 33 SNPs passing quality control for association with melanoma both with and without accounting for the presence of well-established phenotypic risk factors. We compared the risk allele frequencies between the Greek population and the HapMap CEU sample. Finally, we evaluated the predictive ability of the replicated SNPs.Risk allele frequencies were significantly lower compared to the HapMap CEU for eight SNPs (rs16891982--SLC45A2, rs12203592--IRF4, rs258322--CDK10, rs1805007--MC1R, rs1805008--MC1R, rs910873--PIGU, rs17305573--PIGU, and rs1885120--MTAP) and higher for one SNP (rs6001027--PLA2G6) indicating a different profile of genetic susceptibility in the studied population. Previously identified effect estimates modestly correlated with those found in our population (r = 0.72, P<0.0001). The strongest associations were observed for rs401681-T in CLPTM1L (odds ratio [OR] 1.60, 95% CI 1.22-2.10; P = 0.001), rs16891982-C in SCL45A2 (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.76; P = 0.001), and rs1805007-T in MC1R (OR 4.38, 95% CI 2.03-9.43; P = 2×10⁻⁵). Nominally statistically significant associations were seen also for another 5 variants (rs258322-T in CDK10, rs1805005-T in MC1R, rs1885120-C in MYH7B, rs2218220-T in MTAP and rs4911442-G in the ASIP region). The addition of all SNPs with nominal significance to a clinical non-genetic model did not substantially improve melanoma risk prediction (AUC for clinical model 83.3% versus 83.9%, p = 0.66).Overall, our study has validated genetic variants that are likely to contribute to melanoma susceptibility in the Greek population."
https://openalex.org/W2063963111,"Bladder urothelium senses and communicates information about bladder fullness. However, the mechanoreceptors that respond to tissue stretch are poorly defined. Integrins are mechanotransducers in other tissues. Therefore, we eliminated β1-integrin selectively in urothelium of mice using Cre-LoxP targeted gene deletion. β1-Integrin localized to basal/intermediate urothelial cells by confocal microscopy. β1-Integrin conditional-knockout (β1-cKO) mice lacking urothelial β1-integrin exhibited down-regulation and mislocalization of α3- and α5-integrins by immunohistochemistry but, surprisingly, had normal morphology, permeability, and transepithelial resistance when compared with Cre-negative littermate controls. β1-cKO mice were incontinent, as judged by random urine leakage on filter paper (4-fold higher spotting, P<0.01; 2.5-fold higher urine area percentage, P<0.05). Urodynamic function assessed by cystometry revealed bladder overfilling with 80% longer intercontractile intervals (P<0.05) and detrusor hyperactivity (3-fold more prevoid contractions, P<0.05), but smooth muscle contractility remained intact. ATP secretion into the lumen was elevated (49 vs. 22 nM, P<0.05), indicating abnormal filling-induced purinergic signaling, and short-circuit currents (measured in Ussing chambers) revealed 2-fold higher stretch-activated ion channel conductances in response to hydrostatic pressure of 1 cmH2O (P<0.05). We conclude that loss of integrin signaling from urothelium results in incontinence and overactive bladder due to abnormal mechanotransduction; more broadly, our findings indicate that urothelium itself directly modulates voiding."

Many of these traits show a low to moderate heritability and are difficult and expensive to measure. Their improvement by targeted breeding programs is challenging and requires knowledge of the genetic and molecular background. For this study we genotyped 192 artificial insemination boars of a commercial line derived from the Swiss Large White breed using the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip with 62,163 evenly spaced SNPs across the pig genome. We obtained 26 estimated breeding values (EBVs) for various traits including exterior, meat quality, reproduction, and production. The subsequent genome-wide association analysis allowed us to identify four QTL with suggestive significance for three of these traits (p-values ranging from 4.99×10⁻⁶ to 2.73×10⁻⁵). Single QTL for the EBVs pH one hour post mortem (pH1) and carcass length were on pig chromosome (SSC) 14 and SSC 2, respectively. Two QTL for the EBV rear view hind legs were on SSC 10 and SSC 16."
https://openalex.org/W2054273770,"Aims Obesity and type 2 diabetes are characterised by low-grade inflammation, metabolic endotoxaemia (i.e., increased plasma lipopolysaccharides [LPS] levels) and altered endocannabinoid (eCB)-system tone. The aim of this study was to decipher the specific role of eCB-system stimulation or metabolic endotoxaemia in the onset of glucose intolerance, metabolic inflammation and altered lipid metabolism. Methods Mice were treated with either a cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonist (HU210) or low-dose LPS using subcutaneous mini-pumps for 6 weeks. After 3 weeks of the treatment under control (CT) diet, one-half of each group of mice were challenged with a high fat (HF) diet for the following 3-week period. Results Under basal conditions (control diet), chronic CB receptor agonist treatment (i.e., 6 weeks) induced glucose intolerance, stimulated metabolic endotoxaemia, and increased macrophage infiltration (CD11c and F4/80 expression) in the muscles; this phenomenon was associated with an altered lipid metabolism (increased PGC-1α expression and decreased CPT-1b expression) in this tissue. Chronic LPS treatment tended to increase the body weight and fat mass, with minor effects on the other metabolic parameters. Challenging mice with an HF diet following pre-treatment with the CB agonist exacerbated the HF diet-induced glucose intolerance, the muscle macrophage infiltration and the muscle's lipid content without affecting the body weight or the fat mass. Conclusion Chronic CB receptor stimulation under basal conditions induces glucose intolerance, stimulates metabolic inflammation and alters lipid metabolism in the muscles. These effects worsen following the concomitant ingestion of an HF diet. Here, we highlight the central roles played by the eCB system and LPS in the pathophysiology of several hallmarks of obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2087143833,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are membrane channels belonging to the major intrinsic proteins family and are known for their ability to facilitate water movement. While in Populus trichocarpa, AQP proteins form a large family encompassing fifty-five genes, most of the experimental work focused on a few genes or subfamilies. The current work was undertaken to develop a comprehensive picture of the whole AQP gene family in Populus species by delineating gene expression domain and distinguishing responsiveness to developmental and environmental cues. Since duplication events amplified the poplar AQP family, we addressed the question of expression redundancy between gene duplicates. On these purposes, we carried a meta-analysis of all publicly available Affymetrix experiments. Our in-silico strategy controlled for previously identified biases in cross-species transcriptomics, a necessary step for any comparative transcriptomics based on multispecies design chips. Three poplar AQPs were not supported by any expression data, even in a large collection of situations (abiotic and biotic constraints, temporal oscillations and mutants). The expression of 11 AQPs was never or poorly regulated whatever the wideness of their expression domain and their expression level. Our work highlighted that PtTIP1;4 was the most responsive gene of the AQP family. A high functional divergence between gene duplicates was detected across species and in response to tested cues, except for the root-expressed PtTIP2;3/PtTIP2;4 pair exhibiting 80% convergent responses. Our meta-analysis assessed key features of aquaporin expression which had remained hidden in single experiments, such as expression wideness, response specificity and genotype and environment interactions. By consolidating expression profiles using independent experimental series, we showed that the large expansion of AQP family in poplar was accompanied with a strong divergence of gene expression, even if some cases of functional redundancy could be suspected."
https://openalex.org/W2046639188,"Multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7, ABCC10) is a recently discovered member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family which are capable of conferring resistance to a variety of anticancer drugs, including taxanes and nucleoside analogs, in vivo. MRP7 is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer cells, and Mrp7-KO mice are highly sensitive to paclitaxel, making MRP7 an attractive chemotherapeutic target of non-small cell lung cancer. However, only a few inhibitors of MRP7 are currently identified, with none of them having progressed to clinical trials. We used MRP7-expressing cells to investigate whether tariquidar, a third generation inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, could inhibit MRP7-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR). We found that tariquidar, at 0.1 and 0.3 µM, significantly potentiated the sensitivity of MRP7-transfected HEK293 cells to MRP7 substrates and increased the intracellular accumulation of paclitaxel. We further demonstrated that tariquidar directly impaired paclitaxel efflux and could downregulate MRP7 protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner after prolonged treatment. Our findings suggest that tariquidar, at pharmacologically achievable concentrations, reverses MRP7-mediated MDR through inhibition of MRP7 protein expression and function, and thus represents a promising therapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of chemoresistant cancer patients."

The APP-IP and TIMP-2 regions of the fusion protein are designed to interact with the active site and the hemopexin-like domain of MMP-2, respectively. The reactive site of the TIMP-2 region, which has broad specificity against MMPs, is blocked by the APP-IP adduct. The recombinant APP-IP-TIMP-2 showed strong inhibitory activity toward MMP-2 (Kiapp = 0.68 pm), whereas its inhibitory activity toward MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, or MT1-MMP was six orders of magnitude or more weaker (IC50 > 1 μm). The fusion protein inhibited the activation of pro-MMP-2 in the concanavalin A-stimulated HT1080 cells, degradation of type IV collagen by the cells, and the migration of stimulated cells. Compared with the decapeptide APP-IP (t½ = 30 min), APP-IP-TIMP-2 (t½ ≫ 96 h) showed a much longer half-life in cultured tumor cells.

https://openalex.org/W2133105045,"Loss of appetite is a hallmark of inflammatory diseases. The underlying mechanisms remain undefined, but it is known that myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), an adaptor protein critical for Toll-like and IL-1 receptor family signaling, is involved. Here we addressed the question of determining in which cells the MyD88 signaling that results in anorexia development occurs by using chimeric mice and animals with cell-specific deletions. We found that MyD88-knockout mice, which are resistant to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced anorexia, displayed anorexia when transplanted with wild-type bone marrow cells. Furthermore, mice with a targeted deletion of MyD88 in hematopoietic or myeloid cells were largely protected against LPS-induced anorexia and displayed attenuated weight loss, whereas mice with MyD88 deletion in hepatocytes or in neural cells or the cerebrovascular endothelium developed anorexia and weight loss of similar magnitude as wild-type mice. Furthermore, in a model for cancer-induced anorexia-cachexia, deletion of MyD88 in hematopoietic cells attenuated the anorexia and protected against body weight loss. These findings demonstrate that MyD88-dependent signaling within the brain is not required for eliciting inflammation-induced anorexia. Instead, we identify MyD88 signaling in hematopoietic/myeloid cells as a critical component for acute inflammatory-driven anorexia, as well as for chronic anorexia and weight loss associated with malignant disease.—Ruud, J., Wilhelms, D.

https://openalex.org/W2046914770,"Several studies revealed consistent overlap between synucleinopathies and tauopathies, demonstrating that α-synuclein (ASYN) and tau co-localize in neurofibrillary tangles and in Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients and corresponding animal models. Additionally, it has been shown that ASYN can act as an initiator of tau aggregation and phosphorylation and that these two proteins directly interact. Despite these evidences, the cellular pathway implicated in this synergistic interaction remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to create a yeast model where the concomitant expression of ASYN and tau can be used to perform genome wide screenings for the identification of genes that modulate this interaction, in order to shed light into the pathological mechanism of cell dysfunction and to provide new targets for future therapeutic intervention. We started by validating the synergistic toxicity of tau and ASYN co-expression in yeast, by developing episomal and integrative strains expressing WT and mutant forms of both proteins, alone or in combination. The episomal strains showed no differences in growth delay upon expression of ASYN isoforms (WT or A53T) alone or in combination with tau 2N/4R isoforms (WT or P301L). However, in these strains, the presence of ASYN led to increased tau insolubility and correlated with increased tau phosphorylation in S396/404, which is mainly mediated by RIM11, the human homolog of GSK3β in yeast. On the other hand, the integrative strains showed a strong synergistic toxic effect upon co-expression of ASYN WT and tau WT, which was related to high levels of intracellular ASYN inclusions and increased tau phosphorylation and aggregation. Taken together, the strains described in the present study are able to mimic relevant pathogenic features involved in neurodegeneration and are powerful tools to identify potential target genes able to modulate the synergistic pathway driven by ASYN and tau interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1995773457,"Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, a critical step for survival in cancer cells is often associated with decreased sensitivity to several chemotherapeutic drugs. PIK3CA gene amplification is observed in 16-24% of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients in conjunction with p53 mutations. A 900 bp long PIK3CA promoter is shown to be negatively regulated by p53 in ovarian surface epithelial cells but the consequence of chemotherapeutic drug treatments on this promoter in ovarian cancer cells is largely unknown. We aim to study the modulation of this promoter by cisplatin using an improved fusion reporter in ovarian cancer cells and tumor xenografts by non-invasive imaging approach. A PIK3CA sensor was developed using a bi-fusion reporter from a newly constructed library of bi- and tri-fusion vectors comprising of two mutant far red fluorescent proteins (mcherry/mch and tdTomato/tdt), a mutant firefly luciferase (fluc2), and a PET reporter protein (ttk). In vivo imaging of mice implanted with 293T cells transiently expressing these bi- and tri-fusion reporters along with respective controls revealed comparable activity of each reporter in the fusion background and fluc2-tdt as the most sensitive one. Repression of the PIK3CA sensor by drugs was inversely proportional to cellular p53 level in a germline (PA1) and in an EOC (A2780) cell line but not in a p53 deficient EOC (SKOV3) cell line. Bioluminescence imaging of tumor xenografts stably expressing the PIK3CA sensor in PA1 and A2780 cells exhibited attenuating activity without any change in SKOV3 tumors expressing the PIK3CA sensor after cisplatin treatment. Sequential mutation at p53 binding sites showed gradual increase in promoter activity and decreased effects of the drugs. These newly developed PIK3CA-fluc2-tdt and the mutant reporter sensors thus would be extremely useful for screening new drugs and for functional assessment of PIK3CA expression from intact cells to living subjects."

Our previous field study showed ecological evidence for host-symbiont specificity between serpentine and non-serpentine adapted ecotypes of Collinsia sparsiflora and arbuscular mycorrrhizal fungi (AMF). To test for adapted plant ecotype-AMF specificity between C. sparsiflora ecotypes and field AMF taxa, we conducted an AMF common garden greenhouse experiment. We grew C. sparsiflora ecotypes individually in a common pool of serpentine and non-serpentine AMF then identified the root AMF by amplifying rDNA, cloning, and sequencing and compared common garden AMF associates to serpentine and non-serpentine AMF controls. Mixing of serpentine and non-serpentine AMF soil inoculum resulted in an intermediate soil classified as non-serpentine soil type. Within this common garden both host ecotypes associated with AMF assemblages that resembled those seen in a non-serpentine soil. ANOSIM analysis and MDS ordination showed that common garden AMF assemblages differed significantly from those in the serpentine-only controls (R = 0.643, P<0.001), but were similar the non-serpentine-only control AMF assemblages (R = 0.081, P<0.31).

Such a model will have to leverage the basic research expertise in academia with the pharmaceutical industry’s knowledge in manufacturing and high throughput technology to be successful. Harnessing the unprecedented flexibility that iPSC technology and gene editing offer academic and industry-based researchers requires developing an interactive model of collaboration. Such a model will have to leverage the basic research expertise in academia with the pharmaceutical industry’s knowledge in manufacturing and high throughput technology to be successful. The recent discovery that any somatic cell can be turned into a pluripotent cell or directly reprogrammed into a different lineage using only a small number of well-defined inducing agents has heralded a new era of possibilities. The ability to use either method to define intermediate stages at which cells can be expanded and purified makes it possible to obtain sufficient numbers of differentiated cells for a variety of purposes, including screens (Figure 1) and autologous therapy. Using patient-derived cells, researchers can now coordinate stage-specific differentiation into rare, difficult to obtain, differentiated cell phenotypes, which allows them to examine the etiopathology of a particular human disease in vitro or in vivo without the confounding influences of immortalization, genotypic background, and allelic variability. The relative ease of this process and its high degree of fidelity allows this paradigm to be generalized so that studies can be performed not just on single cell lines from individual patients but on entire panels, including multiple lines per patient. It is therefore now possible to consider obtaining cells from a series of patients with an obscure disease, transforming those somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and growing them in sufficient numbers to make this rare phenotype widely available to individual investigators, thus allowing them to assess the phenotype in a multitude of differentiated cell types. Cell sample is no longer limiting, and sufficient cells are available that large-scale screens that use billions of cells are now possible. This ability to obtain useful information from patient-specific iPSC lines has been further enhanced by our ability to edit the human genome using gene engineering technologies whose efficiency has seen a dramatic improvement in the last decade. Improvements in homologous recombination technologies and in harnessing various DNA repair mechanisms using integrases, nucleases, meganucleases, recombinases, and transposases have allowed researchers to construct reporters in safe harbor sites, edit the genome to repair the altered site for isogenic controls, and to consider “personalized medicine” as a potential therapeutic strategy (Rao, 2011Rao M.S. Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Using these varied tools and expertise, however, will require skill sets that are not currently present solely in either industry or academia and will require the formation of new partnerships. Although the technological breakthroughs have been dramatic and have occurred in the academic domain, several hurdles still remain before academic scientists will be able to transform these technological advances into cell-based products for translational science for screening or therapy. Some of these issues may seem obvious, such as simply setting up a new process in a laboratory and performing activity on a reasonable scale for screening with primary cells. Other obstacles are not as obvious. For example, most consent forms written in the past did not take into account the potential use of donated cells for screening or therapy and the recent advances in whole-genome sequencing. As a result, many existing lines simply cannot be used for screening purposes. Other consent agreements allowed use of the tissue sample obtained for very narrow or specific research purposes and thus do not permit their usage for making iPSC lines. These issues are relatively straightforward to fix, and indeed many efforts along those lines have already been made (Lowenthal et al., 2012Lowenthal J. Lipnick S. Rao M. Hull S.C. Stem Cells Transl Med. 2012; 1 (Published online May 8, 2012): 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other obstacles, however, are more subtle, and creating meaningful solutions is not trivial. An example of one such issue is the fact that granting mechanisms historically developed budgets related to supplies based on a rule of thumb of how much was spent per person in a laboratory. Currently, grants are also given over shorter time periods than in the past with competitive renewal requirements over that short timeframe. These circumstances often mean that grants cover a period spanning 1 to 3 years with an annual renewal process based on progress made. However, these grant processes and timelines are extremely difficult for an average researcher to adhere to while demonstrating sufficient progress. For example, making a well-characterized iPSC line takes about 8 months if one includes the time required to thoroughly characterize the cells, store sufficient numbers of cells for use and distribution, and grow to sufficiently long passages to obtain the requisite epigenetic stability. Differentiating them into appropriate phenotypes requires additional time, and with human cells, this correlates with our own prolonged developmental stages such that the differentiation into mature cell phenotypes takes weeks and months (Ginis et al., 2004Ginis I. Luo Y. Miura T. Thies S. Brandenberger R. Gerecht-Nir S. Amit M. Hoke A. Carpenter M.K. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Rao M.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 360-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Two additional problems, which I call the “big science” issue, compound the problem. While small laboratories can easily make iPSCs, making a differentiated cell of an appropriate phenotype requires skills and expertise that are different from the molecular skills required to perform engineering, and these are in turn different from the skills required to perform next-generation sequencing and handle these databases. Most laboratories are not of the size and scale that allows one to maintain the necessary infrastructure to perform all of these experiments, and the few large centers that have recognized this problem (Ginis et al., 2004Ginis I. Luo Y. Miura T. Thies S. Brandenberger R. Gerecht-Nir S. Amit M. Hoke A. Carpenter M.K. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Rao M.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 360-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar; Lowenthal et al., 2012Lowenthal J. Lipnick S. Rao M. Hull S.C. Stem Cells Transl Med. 2012; 1 (Published online May 8, 2012): 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have used a core model that uses different core facilities, which often are not sufficiently coordinated to effectively work together throughout this multistep process. As a result, while big science is required, academic institutions and labs don’t have the means to do this, and even when they do, the appropriate funding or review processes to enable such cross-disciplinary activity is lacking. The NIH has recognized this inability as a problem and has made efforts to fund such cores, but within current budget climates such efforts are limited and still remain distributed over multiple institutions (Hazard et al., 2011Hazard M. Steele S. Wang D. Pearson T. Scheideler M. Dewhurst S. Clin. Transl. Sci. 2011; 4: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The only other organizations that can collate all of these efforts under one roof are foundation-funded efforts or pharmaceutical-company-lead efforts. One might imagine that if academics cannot perform big science because of time, process, and infrastructure issues, then perhaps such experiments are best left to industry, and indeed one could make a reasonable argument as to why this has worked in the past and should work for iPSCs and their derivatives. However, upon closer examination, several explanations arise as to why this has not happened and why it might actually be difficult for pharmaceutical companies to do this alone (see Figure 1). Many of these issues are common to other avenues of research, and I won’t belabor them here. Briefly, they include the inability to share information, the lack of incentive to publish, their own R&D budget cuts, and quarter to quarter productivity demands that are difficult for an R&D organization to meet (Pienta, 2010Pienta K.J. Clin. Transl. Sci. 2010; 3: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Instead, I would like to emphasize that there are specific obstacles presented by industry-based approaches that have more direct relevance to stem cell research that concern issues regarding licensing and access to tissue and replication of existing data from laboratory-scale processes and transfer of such to a large scale. The process of making iPSC lines includes tissue sourcing and consent issues that are difficult for pharmaceutical companies to overcome, material ownership interests in the cells, process patents, and issues with patent ownership regarding reagents used for iPSC generation, such as vectors that went into the cells and patented protocols for obtaining specific differentiated cell types (Bubela et al., 2012Bubela T. FitzGerald G.A. Gold E.R. Sci Transl. Med. 2012; 4: 122cm3https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3003490Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Obtaining such licenses is a time consuming, expensive, and difficult task, because each group has an exaggerated sense of their component’s importance in the overall process. This problem is further compounded by the fact that in general one would like to run panels of lines, each of which may be generated by a different group with different licensing demands. Even if licensing demands can be met, there are additional problems to working with human tissue related to testing samples, issues of privacy, and the consent restrictions that may accompany tissue donation (Lowenthal et al., 2012Lowenthal J. Lipnick S. Rao M. Hull S.C. Stem Cells Transl Med. 2012; 1 (Published online May 8, 2012): 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These restrictions are easily surmountable for academic hospital-based investigators, but are an additional hurdle for pharmaceutical-based investigators. Even in cases when pharmaceutical-based investigators may be willing to address these consent issues, financial concerns may dissuade them. Pharmaceutical companies have already developed a strong record in using primary cells for their screens, and so developing models based on iPSCs may not be considered advantageous from a business perspective. Furthermore, in light of the budgetary constraints and layoffs facing the industry, the substantial resources and determination needed to mount game-changing efforts that would not be realized for many years may be lacking. One can imagine several solutions to such an impasse, and indeed, several efforts are underway. One approach that is being undertaken by foundations, the NIH, and some of the state funding initiatives is the generation of large panels of lines and making them available to both academic and nonacademic entities for use. Examples of such initiatives include the STEMBANCC initiative (http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/12/e50-million-project-aims-to-produce-1500-stem-cell-lines-for-drug-discovery.html), the NYSCF initiative (http://www.NYSCF.org), and the CIRM initiative (http://www.cirm.ca.gov). In each case, the public entity has made an effort to resolve the tissue sourcing issue by ensuring that pharma will have access to the iPSC lines and that large panels of disease-specific lines will be available. In many of these initiatives, the public entity has also asked private tool and reagent providers to provide the scale required to manufacture and differentiate the cells. A slightly different example is that of a service provider, in collaboration with academic scientists, generating the data required for pharmaceutical companies to adopt a primary cell screen for toxicology assays. A smaller-scale example of this approach was taken by the Parkinsons Disease foundation, which contracted with Life Technologies to develop key tools required by researchers and pharma (https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/researchers.php?id=1110). In this case, the tools were developed to screen for factors involved in the LRRK2 pathway, which is commonly mutated in Parkinson’s disease patients, and further leveraged the industry expertise with Life Technologies performing the screen in patient-specific populations. Similarly, GE has made commitments with academic partners for the large-scale manufacture of human cardiomyocytes. More importantly, they compared the human cardiomyocytes side by side with cardiomyocytes from other species (Peng et al., 2010Peng S. Lacerda A.E. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. Bruening-Wright A. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2010; 61 (Published online February 11, 2010): 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and showed that this approach was worth the cost difference (http://www.nibib.nih.gov/nibib/file/NewsandEvents/SymposiumandWorkshops/AIMBE2012/S2_NThomas_StemCellTechForPreClinicalDrugDiscovery.pdf). In both examples cited above, neither GE nor Life Technologies alone could have developed the models or tested them, but rather, each needed to work with academic experts and even other service providers and foundations to garner the necessary infrastructure and expertise required to make a commercially viable resource. A third example is the model of investigators working directly with pharmaceutical companies in a collaboration that is somewhat different from past partnerships where academia looked to pharma as an outlet for licensing promising technologies. In a study reported in this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Nissim Benvenisty and colleagues have used this creative approach. Ben-David et al., 2013Ben-David U. Gan Q.-F. Golan-Lev T. Arora P. Yanuka O. Oren Y.S. Leikin-Frenkel A. Graf M. Garippa R. Boehringer M. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12 (this issue): 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar developed a high-throughput assay to screen for compounds that were toxic to stem cells, but not to differentiated progeny, in an effort to increase the purity of differentiation cultures (Ben-David et al., 2013Ben-David U. Gan Q.-F. Golan-Lev T. Arora P. Yanuka O. Oren Y.S. Leikin-Frenkel A. Graf M. Garippa R. Boehringer M. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12 (this issue): 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It is important to note that these results could not have been obtained without such a partnership, not from a lack of ingenuity or ideas but more simply because it would not be possible to identify the best targets for such a screen without access to the compounds and their associated databases. Indeed, our own earlier efforts for developing a “stem cell kill” assay (Han et al., 2009Han Y. Miller A. Mangada J. Liu Y. Swistowski A. Zhan M. Rao M.S. Zeng X. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in an academic setting, while showing proof of principle, could simply not perform the experiment as rigorously and elegantly as Dr. Benvenisty. In each of these examples one can see that no single entity could have completed the process independently of the other. However, working together, these separate actors could harness complementary expertise and access to unique resources to effectively leverage the potential of iPSCs. Public private partnerships may be a way to accelerate the field. Academic centers can generate panels of lines and develop protocols to differentiate the cells. In parallel, service providers can provide these differentiated cells in assay-ready formats to pharmaceutical companies, and these companies can focus on running screens with their annotated compound libraries and depth of expertise in medicinal chemistry to develop products. A key to any partnership is understanding the legal obligations and clarifying patent and ownership issues. I believe that this agreement is certainly possible and is necessary given the present constraints. This work was supported by the NIHCRM, a common fund initiative of the NIH."
https://openalex.org/W1970187035,"All cellular phenomena and developmental events, including inner ear development, are modulated through harmonized signaling networks. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a tumor suppressor, is a major signaling component involved in cross talk with key regulators of development; i.e., Wnt, Notch, and bone morphogenetic proteins. Although Pten function has been studied in various systems, its role in inner ear development is poorly understood. Here, we used inner ear-specific Pten conditional knockout mice and examined the characteristics of the inner ear. In a detailed analysis of the phenotype, reduced cochlear turning and widened epithelia were observed. Phalloidin staining of sensory epithelium revealed that hair cell patterns were disturbed; i.e., additional rows of hair cells were discovered. The neural abnormality revealed a reduction in and disorganization of nerve fibers, including apoptosis at the neural precursor stage. Pten deficiency induced increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. The elevation of inhibitory glycogen synthase kinase 3β Ser9 phosphorylation (pGSK3β) was sustained until the neuronal differentiation stage at embryonic day 14.5, instead of pGSK3β downregulation. This is the first report on the influence of Pten/Akt/GSK3β signaling on the development of spiral ganglia. These results suggest that Pten is required for the maintenance of neuroblast number, neural precursors, and differentiation in the inner ear."
https://openalex.org/W2010286594,"Island populations have been extensively used as model systems in ecology, biogeography, conservation and evolutionary biology, owing to the several simplifying assumptions that they allow. Nevertheless, recent findings from intra-island phylogeographic studies are casting doubts on the generality of some of these underlying assumptions. We investigated the phylogeography, historical demography, and population genetic structure of the Corsican endemic frog, Discoglossus montalentii. In contrast with expectations based on its insular, restricted and continuous distribution, we found evidence of 3 phylogroups, whose rather ancient divergence (Early-Middle Pleistocene) was likely primed by climatic changes that occurred during the ‘middle Pleistocene revolution’. Furthermore, their differentiation explained most (68%) of the overall genetic diversity that was observed. These results and the growing evidence from intra-island phylogeographies, suggest that island populations frequently may not conform to some long-standing assumptions, including long-term stability, range-wide panmixia and the correlation of effective population size to the island size. As a consequence, both for theoretical and for applied purposes, the extensive use of these assumptions in the study of island populations warrants a careful re-examination."
https://openalex.org/W2074132672,"Xanthine oxidase and its products, uric acid and ROS, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension. We have previously reported that allopurinol inhibition of XO does not alter the progression of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension in rats. However other researchers have observed a reduction in blood pressure after allopurinol treatment in the same model. To resolve this controversy, in this study we used the newer and more effective XO inhibitor febuxostat, and hypothesized that a more complete XO blockade might impair hypertension development and its end-organ consequences. We used DOCA-salt hypertensive rats and administered vehicle (salt water) or febuxostat (orally, 5 mg/kg/day in salt water) in a short-term ""reversal"" experiment (2 weeks of treatment 3 weeks after DOCA-salt beginning) and a long-term ""prevention"" experiment (treatment throughout 4 weeks of DOCA-salt). We confirmed XO inhibition by febuxostat by measuring circulating and tissue levels of XO metabolites. We found an overall increase in hypoxanthine (XO substrate) and decrease in uric acid (XO product) levels following febuxostat treatment. However, despite a trend for reduced blood pressure in the last week of long-term febuxostat treatment, no statistically significant difference in hemodynamic parameters was observed in either study. Additionally, no change was observed in relative heart and kidney weight. Aortic media/lumen ratio was minimally improved by long-term febuxostat treatment. Additionally, febuxostat incubation in vitro did not modify contraction of aorta or vena cava to norepinephrine, angiotensin II or endothelin-1. We conclude that XO inhibition is insufficient to attenuate hypertension in the rat DOCA-salt model, although beneficial vascular effects are possible."
https://openalex.org/W2124806274,"Predicting which plant taxa are more likely to become weeds in a region presents significant challenges to both researchers and government agencies. Often it is done in a qualitative or semi-quantitative way. In this study, we explored the potential of using the quantitative self-organising map (SOM) approach to analyse global weed assemblages and estimate likelihoods of plant taxa becoming weeds before and after they have been moved to a new region. The SOM approach examines plant taxa associations by analysing where a taxon is recorded as a weed and what other taxa are recorded as weeds in those regions. The dataset analysed was extracted from a pre-existing, extensive worldwide database of plant taxa recorded as weeds or other related status and, following reformatting, included 187 regions and 6690 plant taxa. To assess the value of the SOM approach we selected Australia as a case study. We found that the key and most important limitation in using such analytical approach lies with the dataset used. The classification of a taxon as a weed in the literature is not often based on actual data that document the economic, environmental and/or social impact of the taxon, but mostly based on human perceptions that the taxon is troublesome or simply not wanted in a particular situation. The adoption of consistent and objective criteria that incorporate a standardized approach for impact assessment of plant taxa will be necessary to develop a new global database suitable to make predictions regarding weediness using methods like SOM. It may however, be more realistic to opt for a classification system that focuses on the invasive characteristics of plant taxa without any inference to impacts, which to be defined would require some level of research to avoid bias from human perceptions and value systems."
https://openalex.org/W2074395061,Orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase) accelerates the decarboxylation of its substrate by 17 orders of magnitude. One argument brought forward against steric/electrostatic repulsion causing substrate distortion at the carboxylate substituent as part of the catalysis has been the weak binding affinity of the decarboxylated product (UMP). The crystal structure of the UMP complex of ODCase at atomic resolution (1.03 Å) shows steric competition between the product UMP and the side chain of a catalytic lysine residue. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicates that UMP binds 5 orders of magnitude more tightly to a mutant in which the interfering side chain has been removed than to wild-type ODCase. These results explain the low affinity of UMP and counter a seemingly very strong argument against a contribution of substrate distortion to the catalytic reaction mechanism of ODCase.
https://openalex.org/W2081955378,"N-terminal stable in frame fusion of ubiquitin (Ub) has been shown to target the fusion protein for proteasomal degradation. This pathway, called the Ub fusion degradation (UFD), might also elevate MHC class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation of specific antigens. The UFD, mainly studied on cytosolic proteins, has been described to be mediated by polyubiquitination of specific lysine residues within the fused Ub moiety. Using the well characterized melanoma-specific antigen MelanA as a model protein, we analyzed the requirements of the UFD for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of a transmembrane protein. Here we show that fusion of the non-cleavable UbG76V variant to the N-terminus of MelanA results in rapid proteasomal degradation via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and, consequently, leads to an increased MHC-I antigen presentation. While lysine residues within Ub are dispensable for these effects, the presence of one single lysine residue, irrespectively of its location along the fusion protein, is sufficient to induce degradation of MelanA. These results show that the ubiquitination, ER to cytosol relocation and proteasomal degradation of a transmembrane protein can be increased by N-terminal fusion of Ub at the presence of at least one, position independent lysine residue. These findings are in contrast to the conventional wisdom concerning the UFD and indicate a new concept to target a protein into the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and thus for enhanced MHC-I antigen presentation, and might open up new possibilities in the development of tumor vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W2021126950,"An important issue in motor learning/adaptation research is how the brain accepts the error information necessary for maintaining and improving task performance in a changing environment. The present study focuses on the effect of timing of error feedback. Previous research has demonstrated that adaptation to displacement of the visual field by prisms in a manual reaching task is significantly slowed by delayed visual feedback of the endpoint, suggesting that error feedback is most effective when given at the end of a movement. To further elucidate the brain mechanism by which error information is accepted in visuomotor adaptation, we tested whether error acceptance is linked to the end of a given task or to the end of an executed movement. We conducted a behavioral experiment using a virtual shooting task in which subjects controlled their wrist movements to meet a target with a cursor as accurately as possible. We manipulated the timing of visual feedback of the impact position so that it occurred either ahead of or behind the true time of impact. In another condition, the impact timing was explicitly indicated by an additional cue. The magnitude of the aftereffect significantly varied depending on the timing of feedback (p < 0.05, Friedman's Test). Interestingly, two distinct peaks of aftereffect were observed around movement-end and around task-end, irrespective of the existence of the timing cue. However, the peak around task-end was sharper when the timing cue was given. Our results demonstrate that the brain efficiently accepts error information at both movement-end and task-end, suggesting that two different learning mechanisms may underlie visuomotor transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2056353674,"Ribs are primarily made of cortical bone and are necessary for chest expansion and ventilation. Rib fractures represent the most common type of non-traumatic fractures in the elderly yet few studies have focused on the biology of rib fragility. Here, we show that deletion of βcatenin in Col1a2 expressing osteoblasts of adult mice leads to aggressive osteoclastogenesis with increased serum levels of the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL, extensive rib resorption, multiple spontaneous rib fractures and chest wall deformities. Within days of osteoblast specific βcatenin deletion, animals die from respiratory failure with a vanishing rib cage that is unable to sustain ventilation. Increased bone resorption is also observed in the vertebrae and femur. Treatment with the bisphosphonate pamidronate delayed but did not prevent death or associated rib fractures. In contrast, administration of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone decreased serum RANKL and slowed osteoclastogenesis. Dexamethasone preserved rib structure, prevented respiratory compromise and strikingly increased survival. Our findings provide a novel model of accelerated osteoclastogenesis, where deletion of osteoblast βcatenin in adults leads to rapid development of destructive rib fractures. We demonstrate the role of βcatenin dependent mechanisms in rib fractures and suggest that glucocorticoids, by suppressing RANKL, may have a role in treating bone loss due to aggressive osteoclastogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2093193063,"Approximately 10% of the mouse genome is constituted by endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and a number of mouse ERVs remain active. Many copies of endogenous murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) are detected in the genomes of inbred mouse strains. Some of these MuLVs are transcriptionally active or produce infectious virus particles. Previously, we identified partial env sequences of new xenotropic MuLVs (X-MuLVs) from a senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) strain. In the present study, we investigated and characterized the complete sequences of the X-MuLVs. The complete genomes and open reading frames (ORFs) of two X-MuLVs, designated xmlv15 and xmlv18 (accession nos. HQ154630 and HQ154631, respectively), were molecularly cloned from the genome of the SAM mice. We confirmed that the xmlv15 and xmlv18 sequences are distinct from all known MuLV genomes and are most similar to DG-75 MuLV. Moreover, we found that common strains of laboratory mice carry our newly identified xmlvs. Additionally, the expression levels of xmlv15-related sequences were much higher in C57BL and ICR mice than in the SAM strains without any stimulators. Our findings suggest that a specific group of endogenous MuLVs is constitutively expressed in the brain and that they may participate in normal functions and/or pathogenic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2058349341,"The prevalence of hypertension increases after menopause with 75% of postmenopausal women developing hypertension in the United States, along with hypertensive end organ diseases. While human and animal model studies have indicated a protective role for estrogen against cardiovascular disease and glomerulosclerosis, clinical studies of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women have shown polar results with some improvement in hypertension but worsening of hypertensive kidney disease, or no effect at all. These observations suggest that the pathogenesis of postmenopausal hypertension and its target organ complications is more complex than projected, and that loss of endogenous estrogens induces epigenetic changes that alter genetic susceptibility to end-organ complications per se resulting in pathogenetic mechanisms beyond correction by hormone replacement. We studied postmenopausal-induced changes in renal disease and performed a total genome scan for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting kidney disease in postmenopausal 16m-old F2[Dahl S x R]-intercross female rats. We used glomerular injury score (GIS) as quantitative trait. We compared QTLs amongst premenopausal, ovariectomized and postmenopausal F2[Dahl S x R]-intercross rats using identical phenotype characterization. Postmenopausal F2[Dahl S x R]-intercross rats exhibited increased hypertensive glomerulosclerosis (P<0.01) and equivalent levels of kidney disease when compared to premenopausal and ovariectomized F2[Dahl S x R]-intercross rats respectively. We detected three significant to highly significant GIS-QTLs (GIS-pm1 on chromosome 4, LOD 3.54; GIS-pm2 on chromosome 3, LOD 2.72; GIS-pm3 on chromosome 5, LOD 2.37) and two suggestive GIS-QTLs (GIS-pm4 on chromosome 2, LOD 1.70; GIS-pm5 on chromosome 7, LOD 1.28), all of which were unique to this postmenopausal population. Detection of increased renal disease phenotype in postmenopausal and ovariectomized subjects suggests a protective role of ovarian hormones. Furthermore, the detection of distinct GIS-QTLs in postmenopausal intercross female rats suggests that distinct genetic mechanisms underlie hypertensive glomerulosclerosis in premenopausal and postmenopausal states."
