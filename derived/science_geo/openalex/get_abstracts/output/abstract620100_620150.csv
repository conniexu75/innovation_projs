https://openalex.org/W2895832000,"Two distinct microtidal estuarine systems were assessed to advance the understanding of the coastal dynamics of sea level rise in salt marshes. A coupled hydrodynamic-marsh model (Hydro-MEM) was applied to both a marine-dominated (Grand Bay, Mississippi) and a mixed fluvial/marine (Weeks Bay, Alabama) system to compute marsh productivity, marsh migration, and potential tidal inundation from the year 2000 to 2100 under four sea level rise scenarios. Characteristics of the estuaries such as geometry, sediment availability, and topography, were compared to understand their role in the dynamic response to sea level rise. The results show that the low sea level rise scenario (20 cm) approximately doubled high-productivity marsh coverage in the marine-dominated estuary by the year 2100 due to an equilibrium between the rates of sea level rise and marsh platform accretion. Under intermediate-low sea level rise (50 cm), high-productivity marsh coverage in the year 2100 increased (doubled in the marine-dominated estuary and a seven-fold increase in the mixed estuary) by expanding into higher lands followed by the creation of interior ponds. The results also indicate that marine-dominated estuaries are vulnerable to collapse as a result of low, relatively uniform topography and lack of sediment sources, whereas mixed estuaries are able to expand due to higher elevations and sediment inputs. The results from the higher sea level rise scenarios (the intermediate-high (120 cm) and high (200 cm)) showed expansion of the bays along with marsh migration to higher land, producing a five-fold increase in wetland coverage for the mixed estuary and virtually no net change for the marine-dominated estuary. Additionally, hurricane storm surge simulations showed that under higher sea level rise scenarios, the marine-dominated estuary demonstrated weaker peak stage attenuation indicating that the marsh’s ability to dissipate storm surge is sensitive to productivity changes and bay expansion / marsh loss."
https://openalex.org/W2897848663,"The mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) serves as a plant disease virulence factor for the fungi Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum during the development of Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease on wheat. A wheat cytochrome P450 gene from the subfamily CYP72A, TaCYP72A, was cloned from wheat cultivar CM82036. TaCYP72A was located on chromosome 3A with homeologs present on 3B and 3D of the wheat genome. Using gene expression studies, we showed that TaCYP72A variants were activated in wheat spikelets as an early response to F. graminearum, and this activation was in response to the mycotoxic Fusarium virulence factor deoxynivalenol (DON). Virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) studies in wheat heads revealed that this gene family contributes to DON resistance. VIGS resulted in more DON-induced discoloration of spikelets, as compared to mock VIGS treatment. In addition to positively affecting DON resistance, TaCYP72A also had a positive effect on grain number. VIGS of TaCYP72A genes reduced grain number by more than 59%. Thus, we provide evidence that TaCYP72A contributes to host resistance to DON and conclude that this gene family warrants further assessment as positive contributors to both biotic stress resistance and grain development in wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2896566631,"Alzheimer's disease mouse models that overexpress amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) form β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, a hallmark Alzheimer's disease lesion. It has been assumed that the neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment observed in these mice are caused by cerebral Aβ accumulation. However, it is also possible that accumulation of the overexpressed transmembrane proteins APP and PS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers chronic ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The 5XFAD mouse, a widely used amyloid pathology model, overexpresses APP and PS1, displays aggressive amyloid pathology, and has been reported to exhibit ER stress. To systematically evaluate whether 5XFAD mice have increased ER stress, here we used biochemical approaches to assess a comprehensive panel of UPR markers. We report that APP and PS1 levels are 1.8- and 1.5-fold, respectively, of those in 5XFAD compared with nontransgenic brains, indicating that transgenes are not massively overexpressed in 5XFAD mice. Using immunoblotting, we quantified UPR protein levels in nontransgenic, 5XFAD, and 5XFAD;BACE1-/- mice at 4, 6, and 9 months of age. Importantly, we did not observe elevation of the ER stress markers p-eIF2α, ATF4, CHOP, p-IRE1α, or BiP at any age in 5XFAD or 5XFAD;BACE1-/- compared with nontransgenic mice. Despite lacking Aβ generation, 5XFAD;BACE1-/- mice still expressed APP and PS1 transgenes, indicating that their overexpression does not cause ER stress. These results reveal the absence of ER stress in 5XFAD mice, suggesting that artifactual phenotypes associated with overexpression-induced ER stress are not a concern in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2896693208,"Shear wave elastography is emerging as a clinically valuable diagnostic tool to differentiate between benign and malignant breast masses. Elastography techniques assume that soft tissue can be modelled as a purely elastic medium. However, this assumption is often violated as soft tissue exhibits viscoelastic properties. In order to explore the role of viscoelastic parameters in suspicious breast masses, a study was conducted on a group of patients using shear wave dispersion ultrasound vibrometry in the frequency range of 50-400 Hz. A total of 43 female patients with suspicious breast masses were recruited before their scheduled biopsy. Of those, 15 patients did not meet the data selection criteria. Voigt model based shear elasticity showed a significantly (p = 7.88x10(-6)) higher median value for the 13 malignant masses (16.76±13.10 kPa) compared to 15 benign masses (1.40±1.12 kPa). Voigt model based shear viscosity was significantly different (p = 4.13x10(-5)) between malignant (8.22±3.36 Pa-s) and benign masses (2.83±1.47 Pa-s). Moreover, the estimated time constant from the Voigt model, which is dependent on both shear elasticity and viscosity, differed significantly (p = 6.13x10(-5)) between malignant (0.68±0.33 ms) and benign masses (3.05±1.95 ms). Results suggest that besides elasticity, viscosity based parameters like shear viscosity and time constant can also be used to differentiate between malignant and benign breast masses."
https://openalex.org/W2896914467,"A proper inflammatory response is critical to the restoration of tissue homeostasis after injury or infection, but how such a response is modulated by the physical properties of the cellular and tissue microenvironments is not fully understood. Here, using H358, HeLa, and HEK293T cells, we report that cell density can modulate inflammatory responses through the Hippo signaling pathway. We found that NF-κΒ activation through the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is not affected by cell density. However, we also noted that specific NF-κΒ target genes, such as cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), are induced much less at low cell densities than at high cell densities. Mechanistically, we observed that the transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are localized to the nucleus, bind to TEA domain transcription factors (TEADs), recruit histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) to the promoter region of COX-2, and repress its transcription at low cell density and that high cell density abrogates this YAP/TAZ-mediated transcriptional repression. Of note, IL-1β stimulation promoted cell migration and invasion mainly through COX-2 induction, but YAP inhibited this induction and thus cell migration and invasion. These results suggest that YAP/TAZ–TEAD interactions can repress COX-2 transcription and thereby mediate cell density–dependent modulation of proinflammatory responses. Our findings highlight that the cellular microenvironment significantly influences inflammatory responses via the Hippo pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2897496062,"The c-MYC oncogene mediates multiple tumor cell survival pathways and is dysregulated or overexpressed in the majority of human cancers. The NHE III1 region of the c-MYC promoter forms a DNA quadruplex. Stabilization of this structure with small molecules has been shown to reduce expression of c-MYC, and targeting the c-MYC quadruplex has become an emerging strategy for development of antitumor compounds. Previous solution NMR studies of the c-MYC quadruplex have assigned the major conformer and topology of this important target, however, regions outside the G-quartet core were not as well-defined. Here, we report a high-resolution crystal structure (2.35 Å) of the major quadruplex formed in the NHE III1 region of the c-MYC promoter. The crystal structure is in general agreement with the solution NMR structure, however, key differences are observed in the position of nucleotides outside the G-quartet core. The crystal structure provides an alternative model that, along with comparisons to other reported quadruplex crystal structures, will be important to the rational design of selective compounds. This work will aid in development of ligands to target the c-MYC promoter quadruplex with the goal of creating novel anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2897827524,"In patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with improved survival. Lehmann et al. identified 4 molecular subtypes of TNBC [basal-like (BL) 1, BL2, mesenchymal (M), and luminal androgen receptor (LAR)], and an immunomodulatory (IM) gene expression signature indicates the presence of TILs and modifies these subtypes. The association between TNBC subtype and TILs is not known. Also, the association between inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and the presence of TILs is not known. Therefore, we studied the IM subtype distribution among different TNBC subtypes. We retrospectively analyzed patients with TNBC from the World IBC Consortium dataset. The molecular subtype and the IM signature [positive (IM+) or negative (IM-)] were analyzed. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze the distribution of positivity for the IM signature according to the TNBC molecular subtype and IBC status. There were 88 patients with TNBC in the dataset, and among them 39 patients (44%) had IBC and 49 (56%) had non-IBC. The frequency of IM+ cases differed by TNBC subtype (p = 0.001). The frequency of IM+ cases by subtype was as follows: BL1, 48% (14/29); BL2, 30% (3/10); LAR, 18% (3/17); and M, 0% (0/21) (in 11 patients, the subtype could not be determined). The frequency of IM+ cases did not differ between patients with IBC and non-IBC (23% and 33%, respectively; p = 0.35). In conclusion, the IM signature representing the underlying molecular correlate of TILs in the tumor may differ by TNBC subtype but not by IBC status."
https://openalex.org/W2952801859,"Non-genetic influences on phenotypic traits can affect our interpretation of genetic variance and the evolutionary potential of populations to respond to selection, with consequences for our ability to predict the outcomes of selection. Long-term population surveys and experiments have shown that quantitative genetic estimates are influenced by nongenetic effects, including shared environmental effects, epigenetic effects, and social interactions. Recent developments to the “animal model” of quantitative genetics can now allow us to calculate precise individual-based measures of non-genetic phenotypic variance. These models can be applied to a much broader range of contexts and data types than used previously, with the potential to greatly expand our understanding of nongenetic effects on evolutionary potential. Here, we provide the first practical guide for researchers interested in distinguishing between genetic and nongenetic causes of phenotypic variation in the animal model. The methods use matrices describing individual similarity in nongenetic effects, analogous to the additive genetic relatedness matrix. In a simulation of various phenotypic traits, accounting for environmental, epigenetic, or cultural resemblance between individuals reduced estimates of additive genetic variance, changing the interpretation of evolutionary potential. These variances were estimable for both direct and parental nongenetic variances. Our tutorial outlines an easy way to account for these effects in both wild and experimental populations. These models have the potential to add to our understanding of the effects of genetic and nongenetic effects on evolutionary potential. This should be of interest both to those studying heritability, and those who wish to understand nongenetic variance."
https://openalex.org/W2896541424,"The major causes of newborn deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are well-known and countries are gradually implementing evidence-based interventions and strategies to reduce these deaths. Facility-based care provides the best outcome for sick and or small babies; however, little is known about the cost and burden of hospital-based neonatal services on parents in West Africa, the sub-region with the highest global neonatal death burden. To estimate the actual costs borne by parents of newborns hospitalised with birth-associated brain injury (perinatal asphyxia) and preterm/low birth weight, this study examined economic costs using micro-costing bottom-up approach in two referral hospitals operating under the nationwide social health insurance scheme in an urban setting in Ghana. We prospectively assessed the process of care and parental economic costs for 25 out of 159 cases of perinatal asphyxia and 33 out of 337 cases of preterm/low birth weight admitted to hospital on the day of birth over a 3 month period. Results showed that medical-related costs accounted for 66.1% (IQR 49% - 81%) of out-of-pocket payments irrespective of health insurance status. On average, families spent 8.1% and 9.1% of their annual income on acute care for preterm/LBW and perinatal asphyxia respectively. The mean out-of-pocket expenditure for preterm/LBW was $147.6 (median $101.8) and for perinatal asphyxia was $132.3 (median $124). The study revealed important gaps in the financing and organization of health service delivery that may impact the quality of care for hospitalised newborns. It also provides information for reviewing complementary health financing options for newborn services and further economic evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W2897803154,"Background Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is reported to be present in 30–50% of penile cancer cases. The immunohistochemical test for p16INK4a is used as an indicator of the presence of HPV and as a prognostic marker for squamous cell carcinomas in various sites. However, the role of this marker in penile carcinoma has not yet been completely elucidated. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the expression of p16INK4a is associated with the presence of HPV, histological parameters, and survival in penile cancer. Methods A study was conducted from 2014 to 2016 that included 55 patients with penile carcinoma. HPV DNA was detected through PCR using fresh tumor tissue, and immunohistochemistry was performed for analysis of p16INK4a protein using paraffin-embedded tissue. Evaluation of histological parameters was performed following complete embedding of the tumor tissue in paraffin. Results HPV DNA (low-risk and high-risk genotypes) was found in 49 (89.1%) cases, and 46/49 (93.9%) showed high-oncogenic risk HPV (HR-HPV). Of the 22 cases positive for p16INK4a, HR-HPV DNA was present in 21 (95.5%) (p = 0.032). Regarding histological parameters, p16INK4a and HR-HPV were significantly associated only with tumor subtype (p = 0.036 and p = 0.032, respectively); all carcinomas with basaloid characteristics were positive for p16INK4a. Although HPV+ patients had a higher disease-free survival (p <0.001), p16INK4a expression was not associated with patient survival. Conclusions Our study, using fresh tissue samples, showed the highest incidence of HPV compared to that observed in the literature. Expression of the p16INK4a protein was significantly associated with the presence of HR-HPV and this expression may serve as a marker for the presence of the virus. The p16INK4a protein was not associated with the histological prognostic parameters, with the exception of tumor subtype, nor with patient survival. In the results, we showed that the objective of the present study was reached."
https://openalex.org/W2897004653,"Despite offering many advantages over traditional rigid actuators, soft pneumatic actuators suffer from a lack of comprehensive, computationally efficient models and precise embedded control schemes without bulky flow-control valves and extensive computer hardware. In this article, we consider an inexpensive and reliable soft linear actuator, called the reverse pneumatic artificial muscle (rPAM), which consists of silicone rubber that is radially constrained by symmetrical double-helix threading. We describe analytical and numerical static models of this actuator, and compare their performance against experimental results. To study the application of rPAMs to operate underlying kinematic linkage skeletons, we consider a single degree-of-freedom revolute joint that is driven antagonistically by two of these actuators. An analytical model is then derived, and its accuracy in predicting the static joint angle as a function of input pressures is presented. Using this analytical model, we perform dynamic characterization of this system. Finally, we propose a sliding-mode controller, and a sliding mode controller augmented by a feed-forward term to modulate miniature solenoid valves that control air flow to each actuator. Experiments show that both controllers function well, while the feed-forward term improves the performance of the controller following dynamic trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W2897483789,"Background The Central Appalachian region of the United States is in the midst of a hepatitis C virus epidemic driven by injection of opioids, particularly heroin, with contaminated syringes. In response to this epidemic, several needle exchange programs (NEP) have opened to provide clean needles and other supplies and services to people who inject drugs (PWID). However, no studies have investigated the barriers and facilitators to implementing, operating, and expanding NEPs in less populous areas of the United States. Methods This qualitative case study consisted of interviews with program directors, police chiefs, law enforcement members, and PWID affiliated with two NEPs in the rural state of West Virginia. Interview transcripts were coded inductively and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. Final common themes related to barriers and facilitators of past program openings, current program operations, and future program plans, were derived through a consensus of two data coders. Results Both NEPs struggled to find existing model programs, but benefited from broad community support that facilitated implementation. The largest operational barrier was the legal conundrum created by paraphernalia laws that criminalize syringe possession. However, both PWID and law enforcement appreciated the comprehensive services provided by these programs. Program location and transportation difficulties were additional noted barriers. Future program operations are threatened by funding shortages and bans, but necessitated by unexpected program demand. Conclusion Despite broad community support, program operations are threatened by growing participant volumes, funding shortages, and the federal government’s prohibition on the use of funds to purchase needles. Paraphernalia laws create a legal conundrum in the form of criminal sanctions for the possession of needles, which may inadvertently promote needle sharing and disease transmission. Future studies should examine additional barriers to using clean needles provided by rural NEPs that may blunt the effectiveness of NEPs in preventing disease transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2898065672,"Objective Currently, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is not covered by health insurance in the Netherlands. We examined time trends in use of PrEP, characteristics of PrEP users, PrEP eligibility and intention to use PrEP among HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) participating in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). Design Prospective cohort study. Methods We used data from four 6-monthly questionnaire waves, collected between 2015–2017. PrEP use over time was examined in logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations. Using descriptive statistics, we compared PrEP users before first-time initiation to non-PrEP-users. We used national guidelines to assess PrEP eligibility. Results We included 687 MSM. Median age was 40 (IQR 33–47) years in 2015. Recent PrEP use was reported by 57/687 (8%) MSM. PrEP use increased over calendar time (P<0.001) to 7% in 2017. PrEP users did not differ from non-PrEP users in socio-demographic characteristics, but reported a significantly higher median number of casual sex partners, more often reported condomless anal sex and chemsex with casual partners, and more often had an sexually transmitted infection in the preceding 6 months (all P<0.05). PrEP eligibility increased over time, but the effect was not statistically significant (P = 0.075). PrEP eligibility criteria were met by 149/460 (32%) at wave 4, of whom 31/149 (21%) reported use of PrEP. The proportion with a high intention to use PrEP was greater among eligible than non-eligible MSM (51% vs. 24%, P<0.001). Conclusion PrEP use increased over time but remained under 10%, even though 32% met the eligibility criteria, of whom 51% had a high intention to use PrEP. This suggests that a large proportion of Dutch MSM at risk could benefit from PrEP."
https://openalex.org/W2898034625,"Background Preterm birth and low birth weight are associated with reduced nephron numbers and increased risk of hypertension and kidney disease in later life. Aims We tested the hypothesis that extremely preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction is associated with decreased renal function in mid childhood. Methods At 11 years of age the following measures were obtained in a regional cohort of children born extremely premature (EP, i.e. < 28 weeks gestational age—GA) or with extremely low birth weight (ELBW, i.e. BW < 1000 grams) and in matched controls born at term with appropriate BW (AGA): Height, weight, abdominal circumference, triceps and subscapular skin fold thicknesses, blood pressure, plasma levels of creatinine, cystatin C and symmetric dimethyl arginine (SDMA). Small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as a BW < 10th percentile for GA. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated according to the equations by Schwartz, Zappitelli and Gao. Results Fifty-seven of 61 eligible EP/ELBW children, 20 (35%) born SGA, and 54 controls, were assessed. Estimated GFR decreased while plasma SDMA increased from the children born AGA at term through those born preterm AGA to preterm SGA. Systolic BP was correlated to fat mass indices (p<0.03), but not to renal function (p>0.2) and did not differ between the groups. Conclusions Children born EP/ELBW, particularly those born SGA, had impaired renal function at age 11 years as judged from estimated GFRs and plasma levels of SDMA. Since reduced renal function is associated with an increased risk of later disease, these children should be followed in order to minimize additional risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2896126530,"Purpose The purpose of the present study was to describe the incidence proportion of different types of running-related injuries (RRI) among recreational runners and to determine their time to recovery. Methods A sub-analysis of the injured runners included in the 839-person, 24-week randomized trial named Run Clever. During follow-up, the participants reported levels of pain in different anatomical areas on a weekly basis. In case injured, runners attended a clinical examination at a physiotherapist, who provided a diagnosis, e.g., medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), Achilles tendinopathy (AT), patellofemoral pain (PFP), iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) and plantar fasciopathy (PF). The diagnose-specific injury proportions (IP) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using descriptive statistics. The time to recovery was defined as the time from the first registration of pain until total pain relief in the same anatomical area. It was reported as medians and interquartile range (IQR) if possible. Results A total of 140 runners were injured at least once leading to a 24-week cumulative injury proportion of 32% [95% CI: 26%; 37%]. The diagnoses with the highest incidence proportion were MTSS (IP = 16% [95% CI: 9.3%; 22.9%], AT (IP = 8.9% [95% CI: 3.6%; 14.2%], PFP (IP = 8% [95% CI: 3.0%; 13.1%]. The median time to recovery for all types of injuries was 56 days (IQR = 70 days). Diagnose-specific time-to-recoveries included 70 days (IQR = 89 days) for MTSS, 56 days (IQR = 165 days) for AT, 49 days (IQR = 63 days) for PFP. Conclusion The most common running injuries among recreational runners were MTSS followed by AT, PFP, ITBS and PF. In total, 77 injured participants recovered their RRI and the median time to recovery for all types of injuries was 56 days and MTSS was the diagnosis with the longest median time to recovery, 70 days."
https://openalex.org/W2897775367,"As plants evolved to function on land, they developed stomata for effective gas exchange, for photosynthesis and for controlling water loss. We have recently shown that sugars, as the end product of photosynthesis, close the stomata of various angiosperm species, to coordinate sugar production with water loss. In the current study, we examined the sugar responses of the stomata of phylogenetically different plant species and species that employ different photosynthetic mechanisms (i.e., C3, C4 and CAM). To examine the effect of sucrose on stomata, we treated leaves with sucrose and then measured their stomatal apertures. Sucrose reduced stomatal aperture, as compared to an osmotic control, suggesting that regulation of stomata by sugars is a trait that evolved early in evolutionary history and has been conserved across different groups of plants."
https://openalex.org/W2896749731,"Objective To establish the validity of sensor-based measures of work processes for predicting perceived mental and physical exertion of critical care nurses. Materials and methods Repeated measures mixed-methods study in a surgical intensive care unit. Wearable and environmental sensors captured work process data. Nurses rated their mental (ME) and physical exertion (PE) for each four-hour block, and recorded patient and staffing-level workload factors. Shift was the grouping variable in multilevel modeling where sensor-based measures were used to predict nursing perceptions of exertion. Results There were 356 work hours from 89 four-hour shift segments across 35 bedside nursing shifts. In final models, sensor-based data accounted for 73% of between-shift, and 5% of within-shift variance in ME; and 55% of between-shift, and 55% of within-shift variance in PE. Significant predictors of ME were patient room noise (ß = 0.30, p < .01), the interaction between time spent and activity levels outside main work areas (ß = 2.24, p < .01), and the interaction between the number of patients on an insulin drip and the burstiness of speaking (ß = 0.19, p < .05). Significant predictors of PE were environmental service area noise (ß = 0.18, p < .05), and interactions between: entropy and burstiness of physical transitions (ß = 0.22, p < .01), time speaking outside main work areas and time at nursing stations (ß = 0.37, p < .001), service area noise and time walking in patient rooms (ß = -0.19, p < .05), and average patient load and nursing station speaking volume (ß = 0.30, p < .05). Discussion Analysis yielded highly predictive models of critical care nursing workload that generated insights into workflow and work design. Future work should focus on tighter connections to psychometric test development methods and expansion to a broader variety of settings and professional roles. Conclusions Sensor-based measures are predictive of perceived exertion, and are viable complements to traditional task demand measures of workload."
https://openalex.org/W2897084151,"Speckle reduction remains a critical issue for ultrasound image processing and analysis. The nonlocal means (NLM) filter has recently attached much attention due to its competitive despeckling performance. However, the existing NLM methods usually determine the similarity between two patches by directly utilizing the gray-level information of the noisy image, which renders it difficult to represent the structural similarity of ultrasound images effectively. To address this problem, the NLM method based on the simple deep learning baseline named PCANet is proposed by introducing the intrinsic features of image patches extracted by this network rather than the pixel intensities into the pixel similarity computation. In this approach, the improved two-stage PCANet is proposed by using Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) activation function instead of the binary hashing and block histograms in the original PCANet. This model is firstly trained on the ultrasound database to learn the convolution kernels. Then, the trained PCANet is utilized to extract the intrinsic features from the image patches in the pre-denoised version of the noisy image to be despeckled. These obtained features are concatenated together to determine the structural similarity between image patches in the NLM method, based on which the weighted mean of all pixels in a search window is computed to produce the final despeckled image. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a variety of images to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several well-known despeckling algorithm and the PCANet based NLM method using ReLU function and sigmoid function. Visual inspection indicates that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in reducing speckle noise and preserving image details. The quantitative comparisons show that among all the evaluated methods, our method produces the best structural similarity index metrics (SSIM) values for the synthetic image, as well as the highest equivalent number of looks (ENL) value for the simulated image and the clinical ultrasound images."
https://openalex.org/W2896588247,"This study investigates the impact of whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) in addition to CT of chest-abdomen-pelvis (CT-CAP) and 18F-FDG PET/CT (PET/CT) on systemic treatment decisions in standard clinical practice for patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). WB-MRI examinations in ABC patients were extracted from our WB-MRI registry (2009–2017). Patients under systemic treatment who underwent WB-MRI and a control examination (CT-CAP or PET/CT) were included. Data regarding progressive disease (PD) reported either on WB-MRI or on the control examinations were collected. Data regarding eventual change in treatment after the imaging evaluation were collected. It was finally evaluated whether the detection of PD by any of the two modalities had induced a change in treatment. Among 910 WB-MRI examinations in ABC patients, 58 had a paired control examination (16 CT-CAP and 42 PET/CT) and were analysed. In 23/58 paired examinations, additional sites of disease were reported only on WB-MRI and not on the control examination. In 17/28 paired examinations, PD was reported only on WB-MRI and not on the control examination. In 14 out of the 28 pairs of examinations that were followed by a change in treatment, PD had been reported only on WBMRI (14/28; 50%), while stable disease had been reported on the control examination. In conclusion, WB-MRI disclosed PD earlier than the control examination (CT-CAP or PET/CT), and it was responsible alone for 50% of all changes in treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2898067018,"Albinism includes a group of inherited conditions that result in reduced melanin production. It has been documented across the world, with a high frequency in sub-Saharan Africa. There is very little published research about the lives of people with albinism, but available evidence shows that myths abound regarding their condition. They are feared, viewed with suspicion and believed to have supernatural powers. In this study we explored the links between beliefs, myths, traditions and positive/negative attitudes that surround people with albinism in Uganda. The study was located philosophically within Ubuntu-an Afrocentric worldview-and theoretically within the Common-Sense Model of self-regulation of health and illness that originates from the work of Leventhal in 2003. This qualitative study took place in eight districts of Busoga sub-region, Uganda between 2015 and 2017. Data collection comprised eight group discussions and 17 individual interviews with a range of informants, capturing the viewpoints of 73 participants. Findings lend support to previous research, highlighting the life-time discrimination and disadvantage experienced by many people with albinism. It shows that there is still much to be done to address the pervasive and potentially harmful beliefs and misconceptions about people with albinism."
https://openalex.org/W2896470809,"Acute MI induces leptin expression in the heart, however the role of myocardial leptin in cardiac ischemia and reperfusion (IR) remains unknown. To shed light on the effects of elevated levels of leptin in the myocardium, we overexpressed cardiac leptin and assessed local remodeling and myocardial function in this context.Cardiac leptin overexpression was stimulated in mice undergoing IR by a single intraperitoneal injection of leptin antagonist (LepA). All mice exhibited a normal pattern of body weight gain. A rapid, long-term upregulation of leptin mRNA was demonstrated in the heart, adipose, and liver tissues in IR/LepA-treated mice. Overexpressed cardiac leptin mRNA extended beyond postoperative day (POD) 30. Plasma leptin peaked 7.5 hours postoperatively, especially in IR/LepA-treated mice, subsiding to normal levels by 24 hours. On POD-30 IR/LepA-treated mice demonstrated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and perivascular fibrosis compared to IR/saline controls. Echocardiography on POD-30 demonstrated eccentric hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction in IR/LepA. We recorded reductions in Ejection Fraction (p<0.001), Fraction Shortening (p<0.01), and Endocardial Fraction Area Change (p<0.01), and an increase in Endocardial Area Change (p<0.01). Myocardial remodeling in the context of IR and cardiac leptin overexpression was associated with increased cardiac TGFβ ligand expression, activated Smad2, and downregulation of STAT3 activity.Cardiac IR coinciding with increased myocardial leptin synthesis promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis and potentiates myocardial dysfunction. Plasma leptin levels do not reflect cardiac leptin synthesis, and may not predict leptin-related cardiovascular morbidity. Targeting cardiac leptin is a potential treatment for cardiac IR damage."
https://openalex.org/W2897155801,"Background Diagnostic delay is well-known in spondyloarthritis and studies have demonstrated a longer deferral in women. The aim of this study was to explore whether diagnostic delay of spondyloarthritis depends on clinical manifestations expressed by patients according to sex or whether it is related to a doctor’s misdiagnosis bias. Methods A cross-sectional study of 96 men and 54 women with spondyloarthritis was performed at Alicante University General Hospital in Spain using a semistructured interview and clinical records. Comparative sex analysis were done via Student’s T and Mann-Whitney U tests for parametric and nonparametric continuous variables, chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests for unpaired categorical variables, and McNemar’s test for paired ones. Findings The median diagnostic delay in women 7.5 (11.5) years is higher than men 4 (11) years, with a difference close to statistical significance (p = 0.053). A total of 30.2% of men received a first correct diagnosis of spondyloarthritis versus 11.1% of women (p = 0.016), indicating that men have higher probability of not having a misdiagnosis of spondyloarthritis (odds ratio = 3.5; 1.3–9). Eleven different health services referred male patients to the rheumatology clinic but only six in the case of female. No sex differences were detected in patients’ manifestations of back pain at onset. However, medical records registered differences (women 44.4%, men 82.1%; p < 0.001). There were differences between patients (women 57.7%, men 35.2%; p = 0.008) and medical records in peripheral signs/symptoms at onset (women 55.6%, men 17.9%; p < 0.001). Conclusion The few differences of self-reported manifestations between both sexes with spondyloarthritis as compared with their clinical records (more axial pain in men and more peripheral pain in women) suggests that the professionals’ annotations reflect what they expect according to Literature, which could explain the higher misdiagnosis and diagnostic delay in women with spondyloarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2897798036,"Potato blackleg and soft rot caused by Pectobacterium and Dickeya species are among the most significant bacterial diseases affecting potato production globally. In this study we estimate the impact of future temperatures on establishment of non-indigenous but confirmed Pectobacterium and Dickeya species in Great Britain (GB). The calculations are based on probabilistic climate change data and a model fitted to disease severity data from a controlled environment tuber assay with the dominant potato blackleg and soft rot-causing species in GB (P. atrosepticum), and three of the main causative agents in Europe (P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense, P. parmentieri, Dickeya solani). Our aim was to investigate if the European strains could become stronger competitors in the GB potato ecosystem as the climate warms, on the basis of their aggressiveness in tubers at different temperatures. Principally, we found that the tissue macerating capacity of all four pathogens will increase in GB under all emissions scenarios. The predominant Pectobacterium and Dickeya species in Europe are able to cause disease in tubers under field conditions currently seen in GB but are not expected to become widely established in the future, at least on the basis of their aggressiveness in tubers relative to P. atrosepticum under GB conditions. Our key take-home messages are that the GB potato industry is well positioned to continue to thrive via current best management practices and continued reinforcement of existing legislation."
https://openalex.org/W2897010536,"Background The rapid and repetitive badminton lunges would produce strenuous impact loading on the lower extremities of players and these loading are thought to be the contributing factors of chronic knee injuries. This study examined the impact loading characteristics in various groups of badminton athletes performing extreme lunges. Methods Fifty-two participants classified into male skilled, female skilled, male unskilled, and female unskilled groups performed badminton lunge with their maximum-effort. Shoe-ground kinematics, ground reaction forces, and knee moments were measured by using synchronised force platform and motion analysis system. A 2 (gender) x 2 (skill-level) factorial ANOVA was performed to determine the effects of different gender and different playing levels, as well as the interaction of two factors on all variables. Results Male athletes had faster approaching speed (male 3.87 and female 1.08 m/s), longer maximum lunge distance (male 1.47 and female 1.16 m), larger maximum (male 215.7 and female 121.65 BW/s) and mean loading rate (male 178.43 and female 81.77 BW/s) and larger peak knee flexion moment (male 0.75 and female 0.69) compared with female athletes (P < 0.001). Unskilled athletes exhibited smaller footstrike angle (skilled 45.78 and unskilled 32.35°), longer contact time (skilled 0.69 and unskilled 0.75 s), larger peak horizontal GRF (skilled 1.61 and unskilled 2.40 BW), smaller mean loading rate (skilled 150.15 and unskilled 110.05 BW/s) and larger peak knee flexion moment (P < .05; skilled 0.69 and unskilled 0.75 Nm/BW) than the skilled athletes. In addition, the interaction indicated greater peak GRF impact in female unskilled athletes compared with female skilled athletes (P < 0.001; female skilled 2.01 and female unskilled 2.95 BW), while there was no difference between male participants (P > 0.05; male skilled 2.19 and male unskilled 2.49 BW). Conclusions These data suggested that male athletes and/or unskilled athletes experience greater impact loading rates and peak knee flexion moment during lunge compared with female and skilled athletes, respectively. This may expose them to higher risk of overuse injuries. Furthermore, female unskilled athletes seemed to be more vulnerable to lower extremity injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2897214593,"As adolescents with perinatal HIV (PHIV) survive into adulthood, gaining insight into sexual behaviour and risk-taking is important. Between 2013-2015, 296 PHIV aged 13-21 years and 96 HIV negative affected adolescents (13-23 years) were recruited to the Adolescents and Adults Living with Perinatal HIV (AALPHI) cohort in England. Sexual health data were collected through computer-assisted self-interview questionnaires. Quality of life and household deprivation were also measured. T-tests compared means, and χ2 proportions; logistic regression examined predictors of ever having sex. 120(41%) PHIV and 31(32%) HIV- young people were male, 254(86%) and 70(73%) were black, median age 16 [IQR 15,18] and 16 [14,18] years respectively. 77(26%) PHIV had a previous AIDS diagnosis. 93(32%) PHIV and 38(40%) HIV- had ever had sex; median number of partners was 3 [1,6] and 4 [1,6] respectively. 54 (41%) of 131 young people who were sexually active reported not always using condoms, including 32% (30/93) of PHIV. In multivariable analysis, older age, male sex, worse deprivation score, worse quality of life, and alcohol and/or drugs were associated with ever having sex, but not HIV status. 12/30 PHIV reporting unprotected sex had at least one HIV viral load ≥200c/ml in the previous 12 months. Age at first sex and number of sexual partners were similar among PHIV and HIV-, and comparable to normative data. In conclusion, small numbers of PHIV reported condomless sex with a detectable viral load, which could result in HIV transmission, indicating the need for targeted sexual health and ART adherence interventions for young people with perinatal HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2898081901,"Ocular dryness is a characteristic feature of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). This may result in dry eye disease (DED), leading to damage of the ocular surface. Additional, non-invasive diagnostic techniques are needed when evaluating pSS patients. Hence, screening for disease-specific biomarkers in biological fluid could be promising. We have previously examined the proteome of tear fluid from pSS patients through Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and conducted a thorough ocular evaluation of patients with pSS. In this study we further explored the association between dry eye manifestations and protein expression in tear fluid of pSS patients. Medical history of 27 patients and 32 healthy controls was gathered. Subjective complaints were registered through questionnaires. Objective findings including tear osmolarity, tear film break up time (TFBUT), Schirmer's test, and ocular and corneal surface staining were also recorded. LC-MS was conducted formerly on tear fluid from all subjects in order to generate proteomic biomarker profiles. Scaffold was employed to analyse the LC-MS data for quantitative differences between patient and control groups, and the mean spectral counts were calculated for the five most upregulated proteins in relation to DED manifestations. Dysregulated cellular processes were identified in pSS patients using FunRichv3 enrichment analysis. The five most upregulated proteins previously identified in pSS patients were DNA (apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase (APEX1), thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase reductase (PRDX3), copine (CPNE1), aconitate hydratase (ACO2), and LIM domain only protein 7 (LMO7), in descending order. A significant increase in mean spectral counts for these proteins were observed in pSS patients with pathological DED manifestations compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001). Consequently, dysregulated cellular pathways involving innate and adaptive immunity were also detected. In conclusion, our observations suggest a relationship between presence of dry eye signs and upregulated proteins in tear fluid from patients with pSS. Further studies are needed in order to replicate the concepts explored and analyses performed in a greater cohort of pSS patients, where sensitivity and specificity of the methods conducted can also be verified further."
https://openalex.org/W2896298645,"Early life adversity (ELA) contributes to behavioral impulsivity along with risk for substance use disorders, both accompanied by blunted stress-axis reactivity. However, the biological contributors to blunted stress reactivity are not known. We took advantage of the fact that women have significant opioid inhibition of cortisol output by using the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, to unmask opioid interactions due to ELA. We administered 50 mg of naltrexone or placebo to 72 healthy women (23 years of age) in a double-blind crossover study and observed deviations in cortisol secretion from placebo over the next 180 minutes. ELA was assessed by reported exposure to physical and sexual abuse or neglect and low socioeconomic status and scored as Low, Medium, or High (0, 1–2, and 3+). The ELA groups all had identical placebo-day cortisol secretion, indicating normal basal regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Cortisol rises to naltrexone were largest in the Low-ELA group and strongly blunted in the High-ELA group (F = 3.51, p = 0.035), indicating a lack of opioid function in women with high degrees of ELA. The Low-ELA women reported dysphoric responses to naltrexone (F = 4.05, p = .022) indicating a mild opioid withdrawal, an effect that was absent in the High-ELA group. Women exposed to ELA have blunted cortisol responses to naltrexone, indicating reduced opioid regulation of the stress axis. Central opioid changes may be one pathway linking ELA to blunted stress reactivity in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2897193795,"Hormonal modulation plays a central role in triggering various resistant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. In cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defense pathway has been associated with resistance to Colletotrichum spp. and the other pathogens. To better understand the SA-mediated defense mechanisms in strawberry, we analyzed two strawberry cultivars treated with SA for their resistance to anthracnose and gene expression profiles at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr post-treatment. Strawberry genes related to SA biosynthesis, perception, and signaling were identified from SA-responsive transcriptomes of the two cultivars, and the induction of 17 candidate genes upon SA treatment was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Given the pivotal role of the non-expressor of pathogenesis-related (NPR) family in controlling the SA-mediated defense signaling pathway, we then analyzed NPR orthologous genes in strawberry. From the expression profile, FaNPRL-1 [ortholog of FvNPRL-1 (gene20070 in F. vesca)] was identified as an NPR-like gene significantly induced after SA treatment in both cultivars. With a conserved BTB/POZ domain, ankyrin repeat domain, and nuclear localization signal, FvNPRL-1 was found phylogenetically closer to NPR3/NPR4 than NPR1 in Arabidopsis. Ectopic expression of FvNPRL-1 in the Arabidopsis thaliana wild type suppressed the SA-mediated PR1 expression and the resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Transient expression of FvNPRL-1 fused with green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that SA affected nuclear translocation of FvNPRL-1. FvNPRL-1 likely functions similar to Arabidopsis NPR3/NPR4 as a negative regulator of the SA-mediated defense."
https://openalex.org/W2897870743,"About 20 members of the protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) family are present in the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells. They are thought to catalyze thiol–disulfide exchange reactions within secretory or membrane proteins to assist in their folding or to regulate their functions. PDIp is a PDI family member highly expressed in the pancreas and known to bind estrogen in vivo and in vitro. However, the physiological functions of PDIp remained unclear. In this study, we set out to identify its physiological substrates. By combining acid quenching and thiol alkylation, we stabilized and purified the complexes formed between endogenous PDIp and its target proteins from the mouse pancreas. MS analysis of these complexes helped identify the disulfide-linked PDIp targets in vivo, revealing that PDIp interacts directly with a number of pancreatic digestive enzymes. Interestingly, when pancreatic elastase, one of the identified proteins, was expressed alone in cultured cells, its proenzyme formed disulfide-linked aggregates within cells. However, when pancreatic elastase was co-expressed with PDIp, the latter prevented the formation of these aggregates and enhanced the production and secretion of proelastase in a form that could be converted to an active enzyme upon trypsin treatment. These findings indicate that the main targets of PDIp are digestive enzymes and that PDIp plays an important role in the biosynthesis of a digestive enzyme by assisting with the proper folding of the proenzyme within cells."
https://openalex.org/W2896470793,"There is increasing evidence supporting a role for antibodies in protection against tuberculosis (TB), with functional antibodies being described in the latent state of TB infection. Antibody avidity is an important determinant of antibody-mediated protection. This study characterised the avidity of antibodies against Ag85A, an immunodominant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) antigen and constituent of several anti-TB vaccine candidates, in individuals of varied M.tb infection status. Avidity of Ag85A specific antibodies was measured in 30 uninfected controls, 34 individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) and 75 active pulmonary TB (APTB) cases, employing the more commonly used chaotrope-based dissociation assays, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Chaotrope-based assays indicated that APTB was associated with a higher antibody avidity index compared to uninfected controls [adjusted geometric mean ratio (GMR): 1.641, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.153, 2.337, p = 0.006, q = 0.018] and to individuals with LTBI [adjusted GMR: 1.604, 95% CI: 1.282, 2.006, p < 0.001, q <0.001]. SPR assays showed that APTB was associated with slower dissociation rates, an indication of higher avidity, compared to uninfected controls (adjusted GMR: 0.796, 95% CI: 0.681, 0.932, p = 0.004, q = 0.012) and there was also weak evidence of more avid antibodies in the LTBI compared to the uninfected controls (adjusted GMR: 0.871, 95% CI: 0.763, 0.994, p = 0.041, q = 0.123). We found no statistically significant differences in anti-Ag85A antibody avidity between the APTB and LTBI groups. This study shows that antibodies of increased avidity are generated against a principle vaccine antigen in M.tb infected individuals. It would be important to determine whether TB vaccines are able to elicit a similar response. Additionally, more research is needed to determine whether antibody avidity is important in protection against infection and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2896594758,"The abstract of a scientific research article convinces readers that the article deserves to be read. Abstracts can also determine the success of publications and grant applications. In recent years, there has been a trend of cross-disciplinary collaborations in the science community. Scientists have been increasingly expected to engage not only experts of their own disciplines, but also other disciplines with the scope of interest extending to non-experts, such as policy-makers and the general public. Thus, the macro-structure, metadiscoursal and microdiscoursal features exhibited in scientific article abstracts merit attention. In our study, we examined 500 abstracts of scientific research articles published in 50 high-impact journals across five science disciplines (Earth, Formal, Life, Physical and Social Sciences), and performed quantitative analysis of the move structure as well as use of boosters and linguistic features. We found significant interdisciplinary variations in the move structure, boosters and linguistic features employed by these science disciplines. We confirmed that each science discipline possesses a distinct set of macro-structural, metadiscoursal and formalization features, which contribute to its own unique discipline-specific convention. Understanding and observing the disciplinary rhetorical choices and communication conventions will allow scientists to align the abstracts of their studies with the expectations of the targeted audience."
https://openalex.org/W2895845617,"ADHD is considered a disorder of self-regulation. Recent research has shown that awareness of bodily states, referred to as interoceptive awareness, crucially contributes to self-regulatory processes. Impaired self-regulation in ADHD has been explained in terms of arousal regulation deficits in ADHD (the state regulation deficit (SRD) account). There is now ample support for the SRD account, however the exact reason for arousal regulation difficulties is not yet known. The SRD account explicitly refers to the ability to monitor one’s momentary bodily state as a prerequisite for effective state regulation. However, surprisingly, no study to date has tested the ability to become aware of bodily signals, i.e. interoceptive awareness, in ADHD. In the current study, we therefore compared interoceptive awareness between 24 adults with ADHD and 23 controls by means of both an objective (heartbeat perception task) and subjective measure (questionnaire) of interoceptive awareness. Results revealed a strikingly similar performance for both groups on both measures, suggesting preserved interoceptive awareness in adult ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W2895949749,"Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is a key parameter to describe water quality in marine and freshwater environments. Nowadays, several products with Chl-a have derived from satellite imagery, but they are not available or reliable sometimes for coastal and/or small water bodies. Thus, in the last decade several methods have been described to estimate Chl-a with high-resolution (30 m) satellite imagery, such as Landsat, but a standardized method to estimate Chl-a from Landsat imagery has not been accepted yet. Therefore, this study evaluated the predictive performance of regression models (Simple Linear Regression [SLR], Multiple Linear Regression [MLR] and Generalized Additive Models [GAMs]) to estimate Chl-a based on Landsat imagery, using in situ Chl-a data collected (synchronized with the overpass of Landsat 8 satellite) and spectral reflectance in the visible light portion (bands 1–4) and near infrared (band 5). These bands were selected because of Chl-a absorbance/reflectance properties in these wavelengths. According to goodness of fit, GAM outperformed SLR and MLR. However, the model validation showed that MLR performed better in predicting log-transformed Chl-a. Thus, MLR, constructed by using four spectral bands (1, 2, 3, and 5), was considered the best method to predict Chl-a. The coefficients of this model suggested that log-transformed Chl-a concentration had a positive linear relationship with bands 1 (coastal/aerosol), 3 (green), and 5 (NIR). On the other hand, band 2 (blue) suggested a negative relationship, which implied high coherence with Chl-a absorbance/reflectance properties measured in the laboratory, indicating that Landsat 8 images could be applied effectively to estimate Chl-a concentrations in coastal environments."
https://openalex.org/W2896830254,"The Gotjawal areas of Jeju Island, Korea, are comprised of unmanaged forests growing on volcanic soils. They support unique assemblages of vascular plants from both northern and southern hemispheres, but are threatened by human disturbance. The health and ecosystem function of these assemblages likely depends in part on the diversity and community structure of soil microbial communities, about which little is known. To assess the diversity of Gotjawal soil microbial communities, twenty samples were collected in November 2010 from 4 representatives of Gotjawal forests. While soil properties and microbial communities measured by 16S rRNA gene sequence data were marginally distinct among sites by PERMANOVA (p = 0.017-0.191), GeoChip data showed significant differences among sites (p <0.006). Gene composition overall, and the composition of 3 functional gene categories had similar structures themselves and similar associations with environmental factors. Among these communities, phosphorous cycling genes exhibited the most distinct patterns. 16S rRNA gene sequence data resulted in a mean 777 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which included the following major phyla: Proteobacteria (27.9%), Actinobacteria (17.7%), Verrucomicrobia (14.3%), Acidobacteria (9.6%), Planctomycetes (9.8%), Bacteroidetes (8.9%), and Chloroflexi (2.2%). Indicator species analysis (ISA) was used to determine the taxa with high indicator value, which represented the following: uncultured Chlamydiaceae, Caulobacter, uncultured Sinobacteraceae, Paenibacillus, Arenimonas, Clostridium sensu.stricto, uncultured Burkholderiales incertae sedis, and Nocardioides in Aewol (AW), Aquicella, uncultured Planctomycetia, and Aciditerrimonas in Gujwa-Seongsan (GS), uncultured Acidobacteria Gp1, and Hamadaea in Hankyeong-Andeok (HA), and Bosea, Haliea, and Telmatocola in Jocheon-Hamdeok (JH) Gotjawal. Collectively, these results demonstrated the uniqueness of microbial communities within each Gotjawal region, likely reflecting different patterns of soil, plant assemblages and microclimates."

Using mystery patients as a tool for assessing and improving patients’ experience is praised for its comprehensiveness. However, such programs are costly, difficult to design and may cause unintended negative consequences if poorly implemented. Following an Action Research theoretical framework, the aim of this study is to utilize the Mystery Patient (MP) for engaging the patient in co-creating valuable non-clinical services and producing guidance about future managerial interventions. This was operationalized at the Outpatient Clinics at a large Academic Hospital in the Middle East region whereby 18 Mystery Patients conducted 66 visits to clinics and filled out 159 questionnaires. The results indicated higher scores on hard criteria or skills (technical), such as personal image and professionalism, and lower scores on soft criteria (interpersonal), including “compassion” and “courtesy”. The data also demonstrated how the MP tool could provide targeted information that can point to future interventions at any one of the patient experience core pillars, namely: process, setting, and employees. This paves the way for another cycle of spiral learning, and consequently, a continuous process of organizational learning and development around service provision. The MP tool can play the role of the catalyst that accelerates the value co-creation process of patient experience by directing management to necessary interventions at the three pillars of patient experience: employees, processes, and setting."
https://openalex.org/W2896871140,"Recently, new models for the integration of oral health into primary care have been proposed. However, these models may be adopted by a variety of health care systems, and will reach successful outcomes only if they can be adapted to suit the local context. To this end, the objective of this study was to explore the perceptions of Quebec primary health care teams on the integration of oral health into primary care. A qualitative approach and interpretive description methodology were used to conduct the study within a case-study design. Purposeful sampling with maximum variation and snowball technique were used for recruitment of study participants. Seventy-four in-depth, semi-structured interviews and five focus groups were conducted with primary health care teams including health care providers and managers working in a rural and an urban health care center. The interview guide and study conceptual framework were based on the Rainbow model. Data collection and data analyses were conducted concurrently and continued until saturation was achieved. To analyze the data, four phases of qualitative analysis were followed. The thematic analysis included interview debriefing, transcript coding, data display, and interpretation. Data analysis was conducted both manually and with the use of Atlas-ti software. A total of four themes emerged from the interviews and focus group discussions. These themes covered all domains of the study theoretical model and included: 1) drivers of integration; 2) importance of integration; 3) professionals’ role in integrated care; and 4) barriers and enablers of integration. In general, most of the barriers expressed by study participants were related to the organizational and system domains of integration. Primary health care teams who provide care in rural and urban areas in Quebec expressed their concerns on the absence of integrated oral health services. Implementation of governance policies, the prioritization of educational and management measures as well as inter-professional collaboration toward innovative care models could facilitate this integration."
https://openalex.org/W2897486016,"We have shown previously that a weak 50 Hz magnetic field (MF) invoked the actin-cytoskeleton, and provoked cell migration at the cell level, probably through activating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) related motility pathways. However, whether the MF also affects the microtubule (MT)-cytoskeleton is still unknown. In this article, we continuously investigate the effects of 0.4 mT, 50 Hz MF on the MT, and try to understand if the MT effects are also associated with the EGFR pathway as the actin-cytoskeleton effects were. Our results strongly suggest that the MF effects are similar to that of EGF stimulation on the MT cytoskeleton, showing that 1) the MF suppressed MT in multiple cell types including PC12 and FL; 2) the MF promoted the clustering of the EGFR at the protein and the cell levels, in a similar way of that EGF did but with higher sensitivity to PD153035 inhibition, and triggered EGFR phosphorylation on sites of Y1173 and S1046/1047; 3) these effects were strongly depending on the Ca2+ signaling through the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) phosphorylation and elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ level. Strong associations were observed between EGFR and the Ca2+ signaling to regulate the MF-induced-reorganization of the cytoskeleton network, via phosphorylating the signaling proteins in the two pathways, including a significant MT protein, tau. These results strongly suggest that the MF activates the overall cytoskeleton in the absence of EGF, through a mechanism related to both the EGFR and the LTCC/Ca2+ signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2897755243,"People are motivated to hold favorable attitudes about the systems on which they depend, so they justify (i.e., rationalize, defend and bolster) forms of social and economic inequality, even if the inequality is disadvantageous to them. This paper examines how this system-justifying motivation is reflected in behaviors involving interpersonal trust. In a series of three experiments using the trust game I manipulate income inequality by providing participants with higher (advantaged position) or lower (disadvantaged position) initial endowments and measure their trust toward individuals on the same or on different positions. Results show that higher income individuals trust other higher income individuals more than lower income individuals (ingroup favoritism), while lower income individuals trust higher income individuals more than lower income individuals (outgroup favoritism). It is also shown that the strength of these biases is dependent on the level of endorsement of system justifying ideology and the legitimacy of the system. More trust toward those in advantaged positions within a social system, expressed both by equally advantaged as well as by disadvantaged others, not only secures the advantaged in their positions but also reinforces the underlying inequality."
https://openalex.org/W2897088601,"Hybrid vigour, or heterosis, has been of tremendous importance in agriculture for the improvement of both crops and livestock. Notwithstanding large efforts to study the phenomenon of heterosis in the last decades, the identification of common molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid vigour remain rare. Here, we conducted a systematic survey of the degree of heterosis in Arabidopsis thaliana hybrids. For this purpose, two overlapping Arabidopsis hybrid populations were generated by crossing a large collection of naturally occurring accessions to two common reference lines. In these Arabidopsis hybrid populations the range of heterosis for several developmental and yield related traits was examined, and the relationship between them was studied. The traits under study were projected leaf area at 17 days after sowing, flowering time, height of the main inflorescence, number of side branches from the main stem or from the rosette base, total seed yield, seed weight, seed size and the estimated number of seeds per plant. Predominantly positive heterosis was observed for leaf area and height of the main inflorescence, whereas mainly negative heterosis was observed for rosette branching. For the other traits both positive and negative heterosis was observed in roughly equal amounts. For flowering time and seed size only low levels of heterosis were detected. In general the observed heterosis levels were highly trait specific. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between heterosis levels and the genetic distance between the parental lines. Since all selected lines were a part of the Arabidopsis genome wide association (GWA) mapping panel, a genetic mapping approach was applied to identify possible regions harbouring genetic factors causal for heterosis, with separate calculations for additive and dominance effects. Our study showed that the genetic mechanisms underlying heterosis were highly trait specific in our hybrid populations and greatly depended on the genetic background, confirming the elusive character of heterosis."
https://openalex.org/W2897498076,"We aimed to obtain high resolution vegetation data and climate information about the LGM in the inland of the northern SCS based on key pollen types. Dominant Quercus fossil pollen grains in the core from the continental shelf of the northern SCS have been identified at the infrageneric level by using scanning electron microscopy. Based on tectum ornamentation, we recognized five sculpture types of Quercus pollen, namely, rodlike, rodlike masked, rodlike vertical, verrucate and micro-verrucate. Such a high diversity of Quercus fossil pollen types indicated that broadleaved forests were widely distributed in the inland along the northern SCS and included species of the subgenera Cyclobalanopsis and Quercus, of which subgenus Cyclobalanopsis populations were highly dominant. Low abundance of deciduous Quercus pollen probably derived from temperate-subtropical forests, while abundant evergreen pollen types of subgenura Quercus and Cyclobalanopsis, as well as other pollen of broadleaved taxa in the pollen assemblages, strongly suggest that the inland has been covered by dense subtropical forests. Consequently, the warm and humid subtropical climate prevailed during the LGM in the inland along the northern SCS. Our results shed new light on regional climatic conditions during the LGM in eastern Asia based on high diversity of Quercus fossil pollen in marine deposits from northern SCS."
https://openalex.org/W2897464569,"We propose an attribute-based encryption scheme with multi-keyword search and supporting attribute revocation in cloud storage environment, in which binary attributes and AND-gate access policy are used. Our proposal enjoys several advantages. Firstly, multi-keyword search is available, and only when a data user's attribute set satisfies access policy in keyword index, and keyword token generated by data user matches index successfully, then data user can obtain ciphertext containing keywords. In this way, more accurate keyword search is achievable. Secondly, the search privacy of data user is protected owing to cloud servers cannot obtain any knowledge of keywords which data user is interested in. Meanwhile, the ciphertext is able to be decrypted when data user's attribute set satisfies access policy specified in the ciphertext, which can both improve security of encryption and achieve secure fine-grained access control. Thirdly, the proposed scheme supports attribute revocation, in our scheme when a data user's attribute is revoked, the version number of attribute, non-revoked data users' secret keys and related ciphertexts will be updated, such that data user whose attribute is revoked does not decrypt updated ciphertext anymore. In addition, based on the assumption of decisional linear (DL) and decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH), our scheme is proved to be secure against selectively chosen-keyword attacks and selectively chosen-plaintext attacks respectively, and it also ensures token privacy security."
https://openalex.org/W2897591461,"Purpose The main objective of this study is to compare the protein expression of human keratocytes treated with Plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) or autologous serum (AS) and previously induced to myofibroblast by TGF-β1 treatment. Methods Blood from healthy donor was collected and processed to obtain AS and PRGF eye drops. Blood derivates were aliquoted and stored at -80°C until use. Keratocyte cells were pretreated for 60 minutes with 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β1. After that, cells were treated with PRGF, AS or with TGF-β1 (control). To characterize the proteins deregulated after PRGF and AS treatment, a proteomic approach that combines 1D-SDS–PAGE approach followed by LC–MS/MS was carried out. Results Results show a catalogue of key proteins in close contact with a myofibroblastic differentiated phenotype in AS treated-cells, whereas PRGF-treated cells show attenuation on this phenotype. The number of proteins downregulated after PRGF treatment or upregulated in AS-treated cells suggest a close relationship between AS-treated cells and cytoskeletal functions. On the other hand, proteins upregulated after PRGF-treatment or downregulated in AS-treated cells reveal a greater association with processes such as protein synthesis, proliferation and cellular motility. Conclusion This proteomic analysis helps to understand the molecular events underlying AS and PRGF-driven tissue regeneration processes, providing new evidence that comes along with the modulation of TGF-β1 activity and the reversion of the myofibroblastic phenotype by PRGF."
https://openalex.org/W2896460805,"Hemodynamics may play an essential role in the initiation and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We aimed to study the mechanism of self-healing process by the changes of hemodynamics and pathology in an enlarging AAA in rabbits. Seventy-two rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. Rabbits underwent extrinsic coarctation and received a 10-minute elastase incubation in Group A and Group B. Absorbable suture used in Group A was terminated by balloon dilation at week 4. Diameter was measured after 1, 3, 5, and 15 weeks, computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed at week 3 and week 15. Rabbits were sacrificed after 1, 5, and 15 weeks for pathological and quantitative studies. The higher velocity magnitude, intensified bulk flow and obvious vortex formation were observed in Group A at week 3 instead of week 15. Both low wall shear stress and high relative residence time increased in Group B, however, high oscillatory shear index had relatively less increase compared with Group A. Aortic diameter reached a plateau at 5 weeks in Group A, which was significantly lower than in week 15 in Group B. Intimal hyperplasia, intima-media thickness increased significantly in Group A at week 5, significantly higher than in week 15 in Group B. Marked destruction of elastin fibers and smooth muscle cells occurred at week 1, and increased significantly at week 15 in Group A. Aneurysm exhibited strong expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and mouse anti-rabbit macrophage 11 at week 1, and showed a tendency to decrease. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 expression decreased significantly in Group B at week 15 compared with week 5 and Group A. In conclusion, the self-healing of rabbit AAA may attributed to the regeneration of smooth muscle cells. The turbulence flow caused by coarctation is associated with continuous growth of rabbit AAA and prevents the self-healing phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2896345156,"We propose a method to accelerate a response of structured overlay networks by reducing the number of hops required to answer multi-queries. In the proposed method, by copying data items to the redundant storage spaces in other storages, a good data placement reflecting co-occurrence structures in the structured overlay network is achieved. We formulate the optimization problem of the data placement in the limited redundant space of the storages as an integer programming. A greedy approach to solve the optimization problem is also proposed. Through several simulations, it is confirmed that the proposed method can reduce the average number of hops required to answer multi-queries by about 30% at the maximum in our simulation settings. The reduction rate of the average number of hops depends on the level of co-occurrence. Further, the reduction of the computation time to solve the optimization problem with the greedy approach is evaluated. We also confirm that the proposed method does not affect load balancing of structured overlay networks."
https://openalex.org/W2897599323,"Edible portions of bananas contain high levels of polyphenol oxidase, which catalyzes reactions in the melanin formation pathway. Tyrosine, a physiological substrate of polyphenol oxidase, has an analogous structure to acetaminophen. We investigated whether banana extract causes structural changes in acetaminophen and a decrease in its potency. Acetaminophen concentration in banana extract was measured under different conditions to characterize incompatibility. Reaction products in solution were identified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS). Acetaminophen potency decreased with time in the presence of banana extract. The reaction proceeded most efficiently in temperatures 30-37°C and neutral to weakly acidic conditions. Molecular ion peaks derived from the oxidized catechol moiety of acetaminophen were identified in LC/ESI/MS spectra. Our findings suggest that incorporation or simultaneous administration of acetaminophen medication and banana juice may result in decreased efficacy of the clinically important drug. This interaction is likely due to the oxidation of acetaminophen by polyphenol oxidase activity in banana pulp. Therefore, we investigated and characterized a novel interaction between bananas and acetaminophen. To establish a safe and effective antipyretic analgesic regimen using acetaminophen, future studies of this interaction are expected to be performed in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2898059221,"Methotrexate (MTX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, immune suppressant and antimalarial drug. It is a substrate of several human ABC proteins that confer multidrug resistance to cancer cells and determine compartmentalization of a wide range of physiological metabolites and endo or xenobiotics, by their primary active transport across biological membranes. The substrate specificity and tissue distribution of these promiscuous human ABC transporters show a high degree of redundancy, providing robustness to these key physiological and pharmacological processes, such as the elimination of toxins, e.g. methotrexate from the body. A similar network of proteins capable of transporting methotrexate has been recently suggested to exist in Drosophila melanogaster. One of the key players of this putative network is Drosophila Multidrug-resistance Associated Protein (DMRP). DMRP has been shown to be a highly active and promiscuous ABC transporter, capable of transporting various organic anions. Here we provide the first direct evidence that DMRP, expressed alone in a heterologous system lacking other, potentially functionally overlapping D. melanogaster organic anion transporters, is indeed able to transport methotrexate. Our in vitro results support the hypothesized but debated role of DMRP in in vivo methotrexate excretion."
https://openalex.org/W2896181113,"In plant breeding the use of molecular markers has resulted in tremendous improvement of the speed with which new crop varieties are introduced into the market. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping is routinely used for association studies, Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping studies, marker-assisted backcrosses and validation of large numbers of novel SNPs. Here we present the KeyGene SNPSelect technology, a scalable and flexible multiplexed, targeted sequence-based, genotyping solution. The multiplex composition of SNPSelect assays can be easily changed between experiments by adding or removing loci, demonstrating their content flexibility. To demonstrate this versatility, we first designed a 1,056-plex maize assay and genotyped a total of 374 samples originating from an F2 and a Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population and a maize germplasm collection. Next, subsets of the most informative SNP loci were assembled in 384-plex and 768-plex assays for further genotyping. Indeed, selection of the most informative SNPs allows cost-efficient yet highly informative genotyping in a custom-made fashion, with average call rates between 88.1% (1,056-plex assay) and 99.4% (384-plex assay), and average reproducibility rates between duplicate samples ranging from 98.2% (1056-plex assay) to 99.9% (384-plex assay). The SNPSelect workflow can be completed from a DNA sample to a genotype dataset in less than three days. We propose SNPSelect as an attractive and competitive genotyping solution to meet the targeted genotyping needs in fields such as plant breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2896658907,"The ryanodine receptor antagonist dantrolene inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and reduces cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in global warm ischaemia models however the cardioprotective potential of dantrolene under hypothermic conditions is unknown. This study addresses whether the addition of dantrolene during cardioplegia and hypothermic storage of the donor heart can improve functional recovery and reduce IRI. Using an ex vivo isolated working heart model, Wistar rat (3 month and 12 month) hearts were perfused to acquire baseline haemodynamic measurements of aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac output, pulse pressure and heart rate. Hearts were arrested and stored in Celsior preservation solution supplemented with 0.2–40 μM dantrolene for 6 hours at 4°C, then reperfused (15 min Langendorff, 30 min working mode). In 3-month hearts, supplementation with 1 μM dantrolene significantly improved aortic flow and cardiac output compared to unsupplemented controls however lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and contraction bands were comparable. In contrast, 40 μM dantrolene-supplementation yielded poor cardiac recovery, increased post-reperfusion LDH but reduced contraction bands. All 3-month hearts stored in dantrolene displayed significantly reduced cleaved-caspase 3 intensities compared to controls. Analysis of cardioprotective signalling pathways showed no changes in AMPKα however dantrolene increased STAT3 and ERK1/2 signaling in a manner unrelated to functional recovery and AKT activity was reduced in 1 μM dantrolene-stored hearts. In contrast to 3-month hearts, no significant improvements were observed in the functional recovery of 12-month hearts following prolonged storage in 1 μM dantrolene. Conclusions: Dantrolene supplementation at 1 μM during hypothermic heart preservation improved functional recovery of young, but not older (12 month) hearts. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for dantrolene-mediated cardioprotection are unclear, our studies show no correlation between improved functional recovery and SAFE and RISK pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W2896669612,"Twenty-eight clonal trials of radiata pine planted across Australia and New Zealand were used to investigate genetic variation and genotype by environment (G×E) interaction for diameter-at-breast-height (DBH), height and Dothistroma resistance (DO_R). The average narrow-sense heritabilities were 0.11, 0.21 and 0.30 while the average broad-sense heritabilities were 0.27, 0.34 and 0.40 for DBH, height and Dothistroma resistance, respectively. Dothistroma resistance was assessed as the percentage of needles that were not affected by Dothistroma needle blight. G×E interactions were analysed using an approximate reduced factor analytic model. Apparent G×E interactions were estimated for DBH, height and Dothistroma resistance. Estimates of G×E interactions and their standard errors were strongly influenced by the level of connectivity between trials, in terms of common clones and common parents. When there was sufficient connectivity between trials (more than 30% common clones between trials), a high level of G×E interaction was found for DBH and height but not for Dothistroma resistance. In two simulated clonal trials planted in two environments, low connectivity between environments resulted in a lower estimated genetic correlation between environments with an increased standard error. These results suggest that the number of clones in common between clonal trials is a key factor for inclusion in future experimental designs for estimating G×E interaction. When designing clonal trials for use in multiple environments for accurately estimating the level of G×E, if the resource for creating connectivity between environments is limited, at least 30% of the clones need to be in common between environments."
https://openalex.org/W2895796744,"Low coverage of Skilled Birth Attendance (SBA) is one of the major drivers of maternal mortality in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) including Ethiopia. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled community trial to assess the effect of deploying trained community based nurses to rural communities on the uptake levels of SBA in Ethiopia.A three-arm, parallel groups, cluster-randomized community trial was conducted to assess the effect of deploying trained community based reproductive health nurses (CORN) on the uptake of SBA services. A total of 282 villages were randomly selected and assigned to a control arm (n = 94) or 1 of 2 treatment arms (n = 94 each). The treatment groups differed by where these new service providers were deployed, a health post (HP) or health center (HC). Baseline and end line surveys were conducted to document and measure the effects of the intervention. Program impacts on SBA coverage were calculated using difference-in-difference (DID) analysis.After nine months of intervention, the coverage of SBA services increased significantly by 81.1% (from 24.61 to 44.59) in the HP based intervention arm, and by 122.9% (from 16.41 to 36.59) in the HC arm, respectively (p <0.01). Conversely, a small and non-significant (2%) decline in SBA coverage were observed in the control arm (P >0.05). The DID estimate indicated a net increase in SBA coverage of 21.32 and 20.52 percentage points (PP) across the HP and HC based intervention arms, respectively (p < 0.001).Deployment of trained reproductive health nurses to rural communities in Ethiopia significantly improved utilization of SBA services. Therefore; in similar low income settings where coverage of SBA services is very low, deployment of trained community based nurses to grassroots level could potentiate rapid service uptake. Additional cost-effectiveness and validation studies at various setups are required, before scale-up of the innovation, however.clinicaltrails.gov NCT02501252."
