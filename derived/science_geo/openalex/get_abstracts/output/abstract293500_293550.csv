https://openalex.org/W1963833761,A transient absorption spectrum has been measured in Rhodopseudomonas spheroides R26 reaction centers. Its salient features indicate that both the bacteriopheophytin and bacteriochlorophyll chromophores play a role in the excited state. Decay of this state yields a rise time for oxidation of the reaction center complex of about 150 picoseconds.
https://openalex.org/W2008599394,"In the field, both sexes of the western pine beetle, Dendroctonus brevicomis, are attracted by the female-produced bicyclic ketal exo-brevicomin; this response is enhanced by myrcene (a constituent of the beetle's host, ponderosapine), which is not an attractant by itself. This synergism may be part of the phenomenon of the mass attack on its host. Temnochila virescens chlorodia, one of the principal insectan predators of this beetle, is attracted by exo-brevicomin alone."
https://openalex.org/W2072914526,"Fluorescence of Cypridina oxyluciferin is greatly enhanced when it is bound to luciferase; the spectrum is thereby shifted, so that it corresponds precisely to the emission spectrum characteristic of the bioluminescent oxidation of luciferin. Thus the oxyluciferin-luciferase complex is the light-emitter. The binding is equimolar, with dissociation constant KD equal to 3 × 10-7 mole per liter. The molecular weight of the luciferase, according to three different methods, is between 52,000 and 57,000; molecular activities of luciferase for the bioluminescence reaction and for the hydrolysis of oxyluciferin are 1600 and 2 per minute, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2048886653,"Electron tunneling spectroscopy has been used to characterize the degradation of beta-D-fructose after electron bombardment in a scanning electron microscope. The decrease in intensity of various vibrational bands is correlated with structural changes in the molecule, thereby providing a detailed picture of the degradation process."
https://openalex.org/W2089673497,Low rates of acetylene reduction to ethylene in water samples from two dystrophic lakes indicate the presence of nitrogenase and in situ nitrogen fixation. Highest rates were found in anoxic water from the aphotic zone. Environmental conditions in these lakes suggest the agents of fixation were bacteria.
https://openalex.org/W1971638443,"We have flown a telescope cooled to liquid-helium temperatures and made far-infrared observations of the night sky. A gallium-doped germanium detector, sensitive from 5.2 to 130 micrometers, detected a minimum signal of 10(-9) watt per square centimeter per steradian referred to 100 micrometers. The origin of this signal can be instrumental, atmospheric, interplanetary, or interstellar. We can place a firm upper limit on the color temperature of a dilute cosmic background flux."
https://openalex.org/W1971312663,"A global lunar gravity field has been determined from data on the long-term motion of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 subsatellites and Lunar Orbiter 5. The nearside gravity map resolves major mascon basins and, in general, is in excellent agreemnent with the results of Muller and Sjogren. The farside gravity map is characterized by broad positive gravity in the highland regions with interspersed, localized, negative anomalies corresponding to major ringed basins. A comparison between global gravity and topography indicates that a thicker farside crust could be responsible for these gravitational differences between the two lunar hemispheres."
https://openalex.org/W2093917644,"It is difficult to estimate accurately the cost of constructing a large scientific instrument that involves many techniques. On the other hand, most of the component parts of the VLBA consist of antennas and electronic systems that already exist or are being fabricated. The kind of 25-m antennas being constructed for the VLA will cost about $900,000 each and will work at wavelengths as short as 1 cm. A multifrequency radiometer, hydrogen maser frequency standard, small control computer, control building, and wide-band instrumentation recorder bring the cost to about $1.5 million per element, or $15 million for a ten-element array using tape recorders. A multistation playback facility, with ten recorders and enough correlators to handle all interferometer pairs simultaneously, together with the necessary computers to control the processor and reduce the data, may add $5 million. The total cost is thus about $20 million at current prices, including an adequate supply of magnetic tape. This is comparable to the cost of existing large radio telescopes and arrays. An array that used a geostationary communication satellite to transmit the data to a real-time correlator would cost $30 million to $50 million more, but this is still within the price range of other space astronomy projects. It is thus feasible to construct at reasonable cost an intercontinental very long baseline array which has sub-milliarcsecond resolution. This would complement the Very Large Array now being constructed (4), which is much more sensitive to objects of low surface brightness. This next step would permit the study of the universe with unprecedented angular resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2002406208,Lunar gravity data and orbital photography indicate that there is a mascon basin approximately 1000 kilometers in diameter on the farside of the moon and that Mare Marginis is the flooded fraction of a mascon basin approximately 900 kilometers in diameter.
https://openalex.org/W2009124850,An archeological survey of the upper Tigris-Euphrates basin in Turkish Mesopotamia revealed a very early phase farming village and a nearby developed phase farming village. Late prehistoric developments in this region are critical to understanding of the beginnings of trade and metallurgy.
