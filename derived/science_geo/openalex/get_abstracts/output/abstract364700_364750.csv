https://openalex.org/W2072239613,"Designer Stem Cells Despite their promise for use as disease models and in regenerative medicine, the generation of human-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has been hindered by the integration of vector and transgenes in the host cell genome. Recent studies using the Cre/LoxP recombination strategy and the piggyBac transposon approach have approached this objective. However, Yu et al. (p. 797 , published online 26 March) now show the derivation of human iPS cells from postnatal foreskin fibroblasts using the nonintegrating oriP/EBNA1-based episomal vectors. The resultant iPS cells show characteristics of human embryonic stem cells and are free of vector and transgenes."
https://openalex.org/W2093522856,"Although the physics of materials at surfaces and edges has been extensively studied, the movement of individual atoms at an isolated edge has not been directly observed in real time. With a transmission electron aberration–corrected microscope capable of simultaneous atomic spatial resolution and 1-second temporal resolution, we produced movies of the dynamics of carbon atoms at the edge of a hole in a suspended, single atomic layer of graphene. The rearrangement of bonds and beam-induced ejection of carbon atoms are recorded as the hole grows. We investigated the mechanism of edge reconstruction and demonstrated the stability of the “zigzag” edge configuration. This study of an ideal low-dimensional interface, a hole in graphene, exhibits the complex behavior of atoms at a boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2110111386,"The sensitivity of both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging is very low because the detected signal strength depends on the small population difference between spin states even in high magnetic fields. Hyperpolarization methods can be used to increase this difference and thereby enhance signal strength. This has been achieved previously by incorporating the molecular spin singlet para-hydrogen into hydrogenation reaction products. We show here that a metal complex can facilitate the reversible interaction of para-hydrogen with a suitable organic substrate such that up to an 800-fold increase in proton, carbon, and nitrogen signal strengths are seen for the substrate without its hydrogenation. These polarized signals can be selectively detected when combined with methods that suppress background signals."
https://openalex.org/W2025833575,"Graphene nanoribbons can exhibit either quasi-metallic or semiconducting behavior, depending on the atomic structure of their edges. Thus, it is important to control the morphology and crystallinity of these edges for practical purposes. We demonstrated an efficient edge-reconstruction process, at the atomic scale, for graphitic nanoribbons by Joule heating. During Joule heating and electron beam irradiation, carbon atoms are vaporized, and subsequently sharp edges and step-edge arrays are stabilized, mostly with either zigzag- or armchair-edge configurations. Model calculations show that the dominant annealing mechanisms involve point defect annealing and edge reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W2133992568,"Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum is a complex process whose malfunction is implicated in disease and aging. By using the cell's endogenous sensor (the unfolded protein response), we identified several hundred yeast genes with roles in endoplasmic reticulum folding and systematically characterized their functional interdependencies by measuring unfolded protein response levels in double mutants. This strategy revealed multiple conserved factors critical for endoplasmic reticulum folding, including an intimate dependence on the later secretory pathway, a previously uncharacterized six-protein transmembrane complex, and a co-chaperone complex that delivers tail-anchored proteins to their membrane insertion machinery. The use of a quantitative reporter in a comprehensive screen followed by systematic analysis of genetic dependencies should be broadly applicable to functional dissection of complex cellular processes from yeast to human."
https://openalex.org/W1996073717,"The very low sliding friction at natural synovial joints, which have friction coefficients of mu < 0.002 at pressures up to 5 megapascals or more, has to date not been attained in any human-made joints or between model surfaces in aqueous environments. We found that surfaces in water bearing polyzwitterionic brushes that were polymerized directly from the surface can have mu values as low as 0.0004 at pressures as high as 7.5 megapascals. This extreme lubrication is attributed primarily to the strong hydration of the phosphorylcholine-like monomers that make up the robustly attached brushes, and may have relevance to a wide range of human-made aqueous lubrication situations."

https://openalex.org/W2108003717,"Homeostatic sensory systems detect small deviations in temperature, water balance, pH, and energy needs to regulate adaptive behavior and physiology. In C. elegans, a homeostatic preference for intermediate oxygen (O2) levels requires cGMP signaling through soluble guanylate cyclases (sGCs), proteins that bind gases through an associated heme group. Here we use behavioral analysis, functional imaging, and genetics to show that reciprocal changes in O2 levels are encoded by sensory neurons that express alternative sets of sGCs. URX sensory neurons are activated by increases in O2 levels, and require the sGCs gcy-35 and gcy-36. BAG sensory neurons are activated by decreases in O2 levels, and require the sGCs gcy-31 and gcy-33. The sGCs are instructive O2 sensors, as forced expression of URX sGC genes causes BAG neurons to detect O2 increases. Both sGC expression and cell-intrinsic dynamics contribute to the differential roles of URX and BAG in O2-dependent behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2024765629,"During chemotaxis, activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac is spatially regulated to organize the extension of membrane protrusions in the direction of migration. In neutrophils, Rac activation is primarily mediated by DOCK2, an atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Upon stimulation, we found that DOCK2 rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane in a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate–dependent manner. However, subsequent accumulation of DOCK2 at the leading edge required phospholipase D–mediated synthesis of phosphatidic acid, which stabilized DOCK2 there by means of interaction with a polybasic amino acid cluster, resulting in increased local actin polymerization. When this interaction was blocked, neutrophils failed to form leading edges properly and exhibited defects in chemotaxis. Thus, intracellular DOCK2 dynamics are sequentially regulated by distinct phospholipids to localize Rac activation during neutrophil chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W2030648800,"Transcriptional regulatory networks that control the morphologic and functional diversity of mammalian neurons are still largely undefined. Here we dissect the roles of the highly homologous POU-domain transcription factors Brn3a and Brn3b in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) development and function using conditional Brn3a and Brn3b alleles that permit the visualization of individual wild-type or mutant cells. We show that Brn3a- and Brn3b-expressing RGCs exhibit overlapping but distinct dendritic stratifications and central projections. Deletion of Brn3a alters dendritic stratification and the ratio of monostratified:bistratified RGCs, with little or no change in central projections. In contrast, deletion of Brn3b leads to RGC transdifferentiation and loss, axon defects in the eye and brain, and defects in central projections that differentially compromise a variety of visually driven behaviors. These findings reveal distinct roles for Brn3a and Brn3b in programming RGC diversity, and they illustrate the broad utility of germline methods for genetically manipulating and visualizing individual identified mammalian neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2005864274,"The neuron-astrocyte synaptic complex is a fundamental operational unit of the nervous system. Astroglia regulate synaptic glutamate, via neurotransmitter transport by GLT1/EAAT2. Astroglial mechanisms underlying this essential neuron-glial communication are not known. We now show that presynaptic terminals regulate astroglial synaptic functions, GLT1/EAAT2, via kappa B-motif binding phosphoprotein (KBBP), the mouse homolog of human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), which binds the GLT1/EAAT2 promoter. Neuron-stimulated KBBP is required for GLT1/EAAT2 transcriptional activation and is responsible for astroglial alterations in neural injury. Denervation of neuron-astrocyte signaling by corticospinal tract transection, ricin-induced motor neuron death, or neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis all result in reduced astroglial KBBP expression and transcriptional dysfunction of astroglial transporter expression. Presynaptic elements dynamically coordinate normal astroglial function and also provide a fundamental signaling mechanism by which altered neuronal function and injury leads to dysregulated astroglia in CNS disease."
https://openalex.org/W2019303386,"The transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ are downstream targets inhibited by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. The expression level of TAZ is recently shown to be elevated in invasive breast cancer cells and some primary breast cancers. TAZ is important for breast cancer cell migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis, but the underlying mechanism is not defined. In this study, we show that TAZ interacts with TEAD transcriptional factors. Knockdown of TEADs suppresses TAZ-mediated oncogenic transformation of MCF10A cells. Uncoupling TAZ from Hippo regulation by S89A mutation enhances its transforming ability. Several residues located in the N-terminal region of TAZ are identified to be important for interaction with TEADs, and these same residues are equally important for TAZ to transform MCF10A cells. Mechanistically, TAZ mutants defective in interaction with TEADs fail to accumulate in the nucleus. Live cell imaging of enhanced green fluorescent protein-TAZ and its mutant defective in TEAD interaction suggests that TEAD interaction mediates nuclear retention. These results reveal a novel mechanism for TEADs to regulate nuclear retention and thus the transforming ability of TAZ."
https://openalex.org/W2083516240,"Oxidative stress is a hallmark of metabolism-related diseases and a risk factor for atherosclerosis. FoxO factors have been shown to play a key role in vascular endothelial development and homeostasis. Foxo3a can protect quiescent cells from oxidative stress through the regulation of detoxification genes such as sod2 and catalase. Here we show that Foxo3a is a direct transcriptional regulator of a group of oxidative stress protection genes in vascular endothelial cells. Importantly, Foxo3a activity requires the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α, because it is severely curtailed in PGC-1α-deficient endothelial cells. Foxo3a and PGC-1α appear to interact directly, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays, and are recruited to the same promoter regions. The notion that Foxo3a and PGC-1α interact directly to regulate oxidative stress protection genes in the vascular endothelium is supported by the observation that PGC-1α transcriptional activity at the sod2 (manganese superoxide dismutase) promoter requires a functional FoxO site. We also demonstrate that Foxo3a is a direct transcriptional regulator of PGC-1α, suggesting that an auto-regulatory cycle regulates Foxo3a/PGC-1α control of the oxidative stress response.

https://openalex.org/W1982403652,"Dust in the Wind The temperature of North Atlantic surface waters has a major effect on climate in a variety of ways, not least because its heat content helps to control hurricane formation and strength. The North Atlantic surface has warmed considerably in recent decades, a trend generally associated with global or regional air temperature increases, or with changes in ocean circulation. Evan et al. (p. 778 , published online 26 March) use nearly 30 years of satellite data to examine another source of ocean temperature variability, the radiative effects of atmospheric aerosols. Low frequency changes in local tropical North Atlantic surface temperatures seem mostly to be caused by variability in mineral and stratospheric aerosol abundances. Thus, to provide more accurate projections of these temperatures, general circulation models will need to account for long-term changes in dust loadings."
https://openalex.org/W2063137814,"In natural viewing, a visual stimulus that is the target of attention is generally surrounded by many irrelevant distracters. Stimuli falling in the receptive field surround can influence the neuronal response evoked by a stimulus appearing within the classical receptive field. Such modulation by task-irrelevant distracters may degrade the target-related neuronal signal. We therefore examined whether directing attention to a target stimulus can reduce the influence of task-irrelevant distracters on neuronal response. We find that in area V4 attention to a stimulus within a neuron's receptive field filters out a large fraction of the suppression induced by distracters appearing in the surround. When attention is instead directed to the surround stimulus, suppression is increased, thereby filtering out part of the neuronal response to the irrelevant distracter positioned within the receptive field. These findings demonstrate that attention modulates the neural mechanisms that give rise to center-surround interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2065581744,"Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) are essential for detecting viral RNA and triggering antiviral responses, including production of type I interferon. We analyzed the phenotype of non-synonymous mutants of human RIG-I and MDA5 reported in databases by functional complementation in cell cultures. Of seven missense mutations of RIG-I, S183I, which occurs within the second caspase recruitment domain repeat, inactivated this domain and conferred a dominant inhibitory function. Of 10 mutants of MDA5, two exhibited loss of function. A nonsense mutation, E627*, resulted in deletion of the C-terminal region and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding activity. Another loss of function mutation, I923V, which occurs within the C-terminal domain, did not affect dsRNA binding activity, suggesting a novel and essential role for this residue in the signaling. Remarkably, these mutations are implicated in resistance to type I diabetes. However, the A946T mutation of MDA5, which has been implicated in type I diabetes by previous genetic analyses, affected neither dsRNA binding nor IFN gene activation. These results provide new insights into the structure-function relationship of RIG-I-like receptors as well as into human RIG-I-like receptor polymorphisms, antiviral innate immunity, and autoimmune diseases.

Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). The production of IFN is initiated when sensor molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RLRs detect virus-associated molecules. TLRs detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) at the cell surface or in the endosome in immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages (2Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8787) Google Scholar). RLRs sense viral RNA in the cytoplasm of most cell types and induce antiviral responses, including the activation of IFN genes (3Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). RLRs include RIG-I, MDA5, and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2). It is proposed that RLRs sense and activate antiviral signals through the coordination of their functional domains (4Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Immunity. 2008; 29: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of RIG-I and MDA5 is characterized by two repeats of CARD and functions as an activation domain (3Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). This domain is responsible for the transduction of signals downstream to IFN-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) (also known as MAVS, VISA, and Cardif). The primary sequence of the CTD, consisting of ∼140 amino acids, is conserved among RLRs. The CTD of RIG-I functions as a viral RNA-sensing domain as revealed by biochemical and structural analyses (5Cui S. Eisenacher K. Kirchhofer A. Brzozka K. Lammens A. Lammens K. Fujita T.

Both dsRNA and 5′-ppp-ssRNA, which are generated in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells, are recognized by a basic cleft structure of RIG-I CTD. In addition to its RNA recognition function, the CTD of RIG-I and LGP2 functions as a repression domain through interaction with the activation domain. The repression domain is responsible for keeping RIG-I inactive in non-stimulated cells (3Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref Scopus (3121) Google Scholar, 7Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The helicase domain, with DEXD/H box-containing RNA helicase motifs, is the largest domain found in RLRs. Once dsRNA or 5′-ppp-ssRNA is recognized by the CTD, the helicase domain causes structural changes to release the activation domain. ATP binding and/or its hydrolysis is essential for the conformational change because Walker's ATP-binding site within the helicase domain is essential for signaling by RIG-I and MDA5. Analyses of knock-out mice have revealed that RIG-I and MDA5 recognize distinct RNA viruses (8Gitlin L. Barchet W. Gilfillan S. Cella M. Beutler B. Flavell R.A. Diamond M.S. Colonna M. Proc. Natl.

Picornaviruses are detected by MDA5, but many other viruses such as influenza A, Sendai, vesicular stomatitis, and Japanese encephalitis are detected by RIG-I. The difference is based on the distinct non-self RNA patterns generated by viruses, as demonstrated by the finding that RIG-I is selectively activated by dsRNA or 5′-ppp ssRNA, whereas MDA5 is activated by long dsRNA (10Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzozka K. Jung A. Kato H. Poeck H. Akira S. Conzelmann K.K. Schlee M. Endres S. Hartmann G. Science. 2006; 314: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar, 11Kato H.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the human RIG-I and MDA5 genes including several non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), which potentially alter the function of the proteins encoded, are reported in databases. In this report, we investigated the functions of nsSNPs of RIG-I and MDA5 by functional complementation using respective knock-out cells. We identified loss of function mutations of RIG-I and MDA5. Notably, two MDA5 mutations, E627* and I923V, recently reported to have a strong association with resistance to T1D (13Nejentsev S. Walker N. Riches D. Egholm M. Todd J.A. Science. March 5, 2009; 10.1126/science.1167728PubMed Google Scholar), were severely inactive. The results suggest a novel molecular mechanism for the activation of RLRs and will contribute to our understanding of the functional effects of RLR polymorphisms and the critical relationship between RLR nsSNPs and diseases. Cells, DNA Transfection, and Preparation of Cell Extracts—L929 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium Eagle (Sigma) with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University). MEFs and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. L929 cells were transiently transfected with the DEAE-dextran method. MEFs and 293T cells were transiently transfected by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For the preparation of cell extracts, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and centrifuged at 245,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for SDS-PAGE and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides (800 bp) corresponding to the coding sequence of green fluorescent protein were amplified by PCR using T7-primer (5′-CGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGATATCAGCAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTT-3′) and T3-primer (5′-GCAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAGGCCTAGGGAGAAGACAGTGAGCTC-3′). Long dsRNA (ds800) was prepared by annealing complementary strands separately synthesized by in vitro transcription using the AmpliScribe T7 flash transcription kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies) and the AmpliScribe SP6 high yield transcription kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies). The annealed dsRNA was treated with S1 nuclease (Takara Bio) to generate a blunt end and alkaline phosphatase (Takara Bio) to remove 5′-phosphate. 32P-ds800 was prepared by labeling the 800-bp dsRNA using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP.

Data on SNPs for RIG-I and MDA5 were obtained from the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and HapMap databases. The expression plasmids for RIG-I mutants (pEF-FLAG-RIG-IR7C, pEF-FLAG-RIG-IS144F, pEF-FLAG-RIG-IS183I, pEF-FLAG-RIG-IT260P, pEF-FLAG-RIG-II406T, pEF-FLAG-RIG-ID580E, pEF-FLAG-RIG-IF789L, and pEF-FLAG-RIG-ICARDS183I) and MDA5 mutants (pEF-FLAG-MDA5T260S, pEF-FLAG-MDA5L274I, pEF-FLAG-MDA5K351E, pEF-FLAG-MDA5I442V, pEF-FLAG-MDA5H460R, pEF-FLAG-MDA5E627*, pEF-FLAG-MDA5H843R, pEF-FLAG-MDA5I923V, pEF-FLAG-MDA5A946T, and pEF-FLAG-MDA5D1014E) were generated using a GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Antibodies and Immunoblotting—The anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma) antibody is a commercial product.

Construction of RIG-I Mutants and Their Biological Activities in MEFs Derived from RIG-I Knock-out Mice—nsSNPs were selected from nucleotide sequence polymorphisms of human RIG-I reported in databases and introduced into the RIG-I expression vector by site-directed mutagenesis. Domain structure and locations of the mutations are indicated in Fig. 1A. In RIG-I–/– MEFs transiently transfected with these vectors, the wild type and seven human RIG-I mutants were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that none of the amino acid substitutions significantly affect the synthesis and/or stability of RIG-I. The signaling function of the mutants was analyzed by temporarily complementing the function of RIG-I in RIG-I–/– MEFs using a virus-responsive luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2A). Although the transfection of 5′-pppRNA did not activate the reporter gene significantly in RIG-I–/– MEFs (Fig. 2A, Vector), the ectopic expression of WT RIG-I restored the responsiveness to the ligand. All the mutant constructs exhibited functional complementation except the R7C, S144F, and S183I mutants, which exhibited a reduced response to 5′-pppRNA, particularly the S183I mutant, which exhibited a severe defect. Because the activity of S144F was not reproducible, we did not investigate this mutant further. It has been shown that RIG-I senses SeV and activates the IFN promoter. Therefore, the ability of the mutants to respond to this viral inducer was tested (Fig. 2B). SeV efficiently activated the reporter gene when WT RIG-I was expressed; however, S183I was virtually inactive and R7C exhibited partial activity. Other mutants sensed the virus as efficiently as the WT. We further confirmed the effect of the R7C and S183I mutations by monitoring the expression of endogenous mouse IFN-β mRNA (Fig. 2C). The results clearly demonstrate that S183I is barely active and that R7C is partially active. The above results strongly suggest that Ser-183 is critical for RIG-I to sense transfected 5′-pppRNA as well as SeV-derived PAMPs. Ser-183 resides within the second CARD, and this prompted us to explore the impact of the S183I substitution on the signaling function of the isolated RIG-I CARD. Unlike that of the full-length RIG-I, overexpression of the truncated RIG-I (1–229), which encompasses the two repeats of CARD, constitutively activated the reporter p-55C1B without a viral stimulus (Fig. 3A). However, RIG-I (1–229) with S183I failed to activate the reporter gene. In these cells, levels of RIG-I (1–229) with or without the S183I mutation were comparable, suggesting that Ser-183 is critical for the signaling function but does not affect protein levels of RIG-I CARD (Fig. 3B). It was reported that human RIG-I undergoes ubiquitination at Lys-172 in the second CARD, and this process is essential for RIG-I signaling (15Gack M.U. Shin Y.C. Joo C.H. Urano T. Liang C. Sun L. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Chen Z. Inoue S. Jung J.U. Nature. 2007; 446: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). To compare the mutation at Ser-183, we generated a K172R mutant and tested its activity (Fig. 3, C and D). Surprisingly, the mutant exhibited virus-induced signaling activity comparable with the WT, suggesting that the ubiquitination of Lys-172 plays a minor role in the regulation of RIG-I and that the phenotype of the S183I mutant is unlikely due to a failure of ubiquitination.FIGURE 2Functional analysis of RIG-I nsSNP mutants.

NDV, Newcastle disease virus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is known that human RIG-I with the amino acid substitution T55I acts as a dominant inhibitor (7Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). This mutation within the first CARD inactivates the signaling function of the isolated tandem CARDs. We next tested whether RIG-I S183I exhibits a dominant negative phenotype. L929 cells were transfected with control vector or RIG-I mutants and then activated by infection of Newcastle disease virus. Cells transfected with the vector exhibited IFN promoter activity due to endogenous RIG-I (Fig. 3E). Expression of T55I as well as S183I significantly reduced the promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that S183I causes a dominant negative phenotype similar to T55I. Construction of MDA5 Mutants and Their Biological Activities in MEFs Derived from MDA5 Knock-out Mouse—Next, the biological activity of human MDA5 mutants was analyzed similarly using MDA5-deficient MEFs. Ten nsSNPs including A946T identified in familial T1D (16Smyth D.J. Cooper J.D. Bailey R. Field S. Burren O. Smink L.J. Guja C. Ionescu-Tirgoviste C. Widmer B. Dunger D.B. Savage D.A. Walker N.M. Clayton D.G. Todd J.A. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) were introduced into the MDA5 expression vector (Fig. 4A). The wild type and mutants were expressed in MDA5–/– MEFs at comparable levels (Fig. 4B), showing that the mutations, including the E627* truncation, did not affect MDA5 protein levels. The biological activity of the mutants was assayed similarly to that of the RIG-I mutants. As a MDA5 agonist, a commercial poly(I-C) with an average length of 2 kbp was used, which selectively activates MDA5 (6Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H. Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F. Fujita T. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 428-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 11Kato H. Takeuchi O. Mikamo-Satoh E. Hirai R. Kawai T. Matsushita K. Hiiragi A. Dermody T.S. Fujita T. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Wild-type MDA5 clearly conferred responsiveness to the poly(I-C) (Fig. 5). Eight MDA5 mutants, including A946T, which was implicated in human T1D (16Smyth D.J. Cooper J.D. Bailey R. Field S. Burren O. Smink L.J. Guja C. Ionescu-Tirgoviste C. Widmer B. Dunger D.B. Savage D.A. Walker N.M. Clayton D.G. Todd J.A. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), exhibited complementing activity comparable with the wild type. However, E627* and I923V showed significantly low levels of activity. The phenotypes of these mutations were further tested by transient expression in MDA5–/– MEFs and monitoring endogenous IFN-β mRNA (Fig. 5B). Although MDA5 is absent, intracellular poly(I-C) induced IFN-β gene expression in the control cells (Vector). This is presumably due to the activation of RIG-I by a short poly(I-C) present in the preparation we used. Unlike the reporter assay, which monitors only transfected cells, this quantitative PCR assay detects IFN-β transcripts from both transfected and non-transfected cells, increasing the background signal. Irrespective of the background, overexpression of WT MDA5 resulted in an enhancement of IFN-β expression by poly(I-C), and this induction was not observed with E627* and I923V. Further, the effect was observed at different levels of MDA5 expression. The E627* mutant lacks a part of the helicase domain and the entire CTD in which Ile-923 resides.FIGURE 5Functional analysis of MDA5 nsSNP mutants. A, MDA5–/– MEFs were transfected with reporter genes together with the indicated constructs as in Fig. 2A. After stimulation with poly(I-C) (12 h), the cells were subjected to a Dual-Luciferase assay. Error bars show the S.D. values for triplicate transfections. mock, mock-treated. Vector, empty vector. B, MDA5–/– MEFs were transfected with expression vectors for WT MDA5 or E627* or Ile-923 mutants (the total amount of plasmid was kept at 6 μg by adding empty vector). To observe the dose response, cells were transfected with 3 or 5.7 μg of the expression plasmid. Cells were mock-treated or transfected with poly(I-C) for 12 h, and IFN-β mRNA was quantified by quantitative PCR as in Fig. 2C. C, 293T cells were transfected with empty vector, WT MDA5, E627*, I923V, or A946T, and the produced proteins were purified using anti-FLAG (“Experimental Procedures”).

E, dose response of RNA binding by WT MDA5 and the I923V mutant. EMSA was performed using 500, 300, and 100 ng of MDA5 and Ile-923 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because in the case of RIG-I, the CTD determines RNA recognition specificity, we investigated the RNA binding activity of these mutants by EMSA using 32P-labeled poly(I-C). Wild-type and recombinant MDA5 proteins were expressed in 293T cells and purified. The recombinant proteins were virtually free of other cellular proteins as analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 5C). Wild-type MDA5 clearly formed a complex with poly(I-C) (Fig. 5D), but E627* did not exhibit detectable binding activity. I923V and A946T exhibited activity to bind poly(I-C) as strongly as the wild type under these conditions. We further compared the RNA binding at different protein concentrations (Fig. 5E) and confirmed that MDA5 WT and the I923V mutant bind to dsRNA in a comparable fashion. These results suggest that the E627* mutant is biologically inactive due to its failure to recognize its agonist. Human RIG-I Polymorphism—We identified S183I as a loss of function mutation of RIG-I. This serine residue is conserved in human, monkey, cow, and pig RIG-I. The mutation apparently inactivates the tandem CARD, which relays signals downstream. Furthermore, S183I exhibits a dominant inhibitory phenotype, suggesting that individuals retaining this mutation as a heterozygote would exhibit hypersensitivity to viral infections. It has been shown that RIG-I mutants with a CARD deletion (RIG-IC), CARD point mutation (T55I), and ATP-binding site mutation (RIG-I K270A) all function as a dominant inhibitor (3Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref Scopus (3121) Google Scholar, 7Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D.

It has been reported that the repression domain present in the C-terminal region of RIG-I and LGP2 dominantly suppresses the activation of RIG-I in trans through interaction with CARD and the helicase loop region (7Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Because the repression domain encompasses the RNA-binding domain of RIG-I (6Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H. Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F. Fujita T. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 428-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), one mechanism is likely competition of RNA binding with WT RNA. However, the RNA binding-deficient RIG-I mutants, K888A/K907A and K858A/K861A (6Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H. Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F. Fujita T. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 428-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), functioned as a dominant negative inhibitor. 3J.-P. Zheng and T. Fujita, unpublished observation. Interestingly, LGP2 mutants, K643E and K651E, which correspond to Lys-888 and Lys-907 of RIG-I, lost RNA binding activity but retain repression function (17Li X. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Brooks M.T. Dharmaiah S. Herr A.B. Kao C. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. March 28, 2009; 10.1074/jbc.M900818200Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest an RNA-independent mechanism. One proposed function of the second CARD is to conjugate to ubiquitin (at Lys-172), which may be essential for signaling activity. However, human RIG-I with K172R, which is resistant to ubiquitination, did not affect phenotype (Fig. 3, C and D). Moreover, the corresponding amino acid in mouse RIG-I is glutamine, and the corresponding position of MDA5 is glutamic acid (human, monkey, mouse, cow, and pig), suggesting that the ubiquitination of Lys-172 has a minor impact on signaling activity. The precise function of the second CARD is not clear, but a comparative study of Ser-183 and WT RIG-I will elucidate the molecular function of this residue. Human MDA5 Polymorphism—We identified two loss of function mutations, E627* and I923V, in human MDA5. Each of these mutations is actually present in the human population (13Nejentsev S. Walker N. Riches D. Egholm M. Todd J.A. Science. March 5, 2009; 10.1126/science.1167728PubMed Google Scholar). It is worth investigating the phenotype of the homozygote because MDA5 knock-out mice clearly exhibit hypersusceptibility to the family Picornaviridae, genus Cardiovirus. E627*, which lacks CTD and a part of the helicase domain, lost its dsRNA binding activity; hence there was no signaling activity. Although the I923V mutation occurs in the CTD, this mutant exhibited intact dsRNA binding, suggesting a novel function of Ile-923 other than the recognition of RNA. It is worth noting that this isoleucine is conserved in human, monkey, mouse, cow, and pig MDA5. It is tempting to speculate that Ile-923 participates in an interaction with some other domain of MDA5 or other unknown regulatory protein(s). A new report by Nejentsev et al. (13Nejentsev S. Walker N. Riches D. Egholm M. Todd J.A. Science. March 5, 2009; 10.1126/science.1167728PubMed Google Scholar) describing the relationship between susceptibility to T1D and MDA5 polymorphism was published. The report describes that four rare mutations (two mutations in the exon and two mutations in the intron) in the human MDA5 gene are associated with protection against T1D. Our analysis included the two exon mutations (E627* and I923V), which exhibited a loss of function phenotype. The genetic analysis included another rare nsSNP, H460R, shown to be independent of T1D resistance. The phenotype of this mutant was normal in our analysis. On the other hand, A946T, which was suggested to associate with T1D in previous reports (13Nejentsev S. Walker N. Riches D. Egholm M. Todd J.A. Science. March 5, 2009; 10.1126/science.1167728PubMed Google Scholar, 16Smyth D.J. Cooper J.D. Bailey R. Field S. Burren O. Smink L.J. Guja C. Ionescu-Tirgoviste C. Widmer B. Dunger D.B. Savage D.A. Walker N.M. Clayton D.G. Todd J.A. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), did not exhibit a loss of function phenotype. However, because Nejentsev et al. (13Nejentsev S. Walker N. Riches D. Egholm M. Todd J.A. Science. March 5, 2009; 10.1126/science.1167728PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the association of A946R with T1D was due to the effect of another nsSNP, R843H, a combination of these mutations might confer loss of function on MDA5. In summary, our analysis strongly suggests that loss of function mutations of MDA5 have a causative role in resistance to T1D. Although T1D has a complex pathology, these findings may provide a new strategy for establishing an animal model for T1D. The human genome encodes multiple sensors, including TLRs and RLRs for viral PAMPs. Some of these may act redundantly to secure defense against viral infections. In the case of RLRs, RIG-I and MDA5 detect a distinct spectrum of viruses, as suggested from the phenotype of respective knock-out mice. There is variation within human populations in susceptibility to a particular viral infection. We argue for a possible contribution of the genetic diversity of RLRs, including those identified in the current investigation, to susceptibility. In addition to the impact of the infection itself, secondary effects such as autoimmunity, which is remotely triggered by certain viral infections, may be influenced at least in part through the functional diversity of RLRs. In summary, our results suggest a critical relationship between RLR polymorphisms and diseases including viral infections and autoimmunity. We greatly appreciate the gift of MEFs from Dr. S. Akira (Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka). We give our thanks to Dr. F. Matsuda (Center for Genomic Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto) for discussion."

Moreover, in social insects the maintenance of genetic diversity among workers may be important for colony growth and survival. We identified a previously unknown termite breeding system in which both parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction are conditionally used. Queens produce their replacements asexually but use normal sexual reproduction to produce other colony members. These findings show how eusociality can lead to extraordinary reproductive systems and provide important insights into the advantages and disadvantages of sex."
https://openalex.org/W2149949558,"Parkinson's disease and a number of other neurodegenerative diseases have been linked to either genetic mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene or show evidence of aggregates of the alpha-synuclein protein, sometimes in the form of Lewy bodies. There currently is no clear evidence of a distinct neurotoxic species of alpha-synuclein to explain the death of neurons in these diseases. We undertook to assess the toxicity of alpha-synuclein via exogenous application in cell culture. Initially, we showed that only aggregated alpha-synuclein is neurotoxic and requires the presence copper but not iron. Other members of the synuclein family showed no toxicity in any form and inherited point mutations did not alter the effective toxic concentration of alpha-synuclein. Through protein fractionation techniques, we were able to isolate an oligomeric species responsible for the toxicity of alpha-synuclein. This oligomeric species has a unique stellate appearance under EM and again, requires association with copper to induce cell death. The results allow us to suggest that the toxic species of alpha-synuclein in vivo could possibly be these stellate oligomers and not fibrils. Our data provide a link between the recently noted association of copper and alpha-synuclein and a potential role for the combination in causing neurodegeneration.— Wright, J. A., Wang, X., Brown, D.

How neurons of the central nervous system transform excitatory synaptic inputs to an action potential output signal is the single most important determinant of neuronal function. Most excitatory synapses in cortical principal neurons terminate on thin terminal dendrites that branch off the apical trunk and basal dendrites. In pyramidal neurons, these dendrites are capable of linear, as well as supralinear integration of synaptic input (Cash and Yuste, 1999Cash S. Yuste R.

If they are sufficiently large, dendritic spikes can trigger a temporally precise action potential output (Ariav et al., 2003Ariav G. Polsky A. Schiller J. Submillisecond precision of the input-output transformation function mediated by fast sodium dendritic spikes in basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7750-7758PubMed Google Scholar). Individual dendritic branches differ in their propensity to generate prominent dendritic spikes and therefore vary in their capability to trigger axonal action potential output (Losonczy et al., 2008Losonczy A. Makara J.K. Magee J.C. Compartmentalized dendritic plasticity and input feature storage in neurons.Nature. 2008; 452: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar).

The critical role of voltage-gated ion channels predicts a strong influence of prior activity on the initiation of dendritic spikes via voltage-dependent inactivation and recovery (Colbert et al., 1997Colbert C.M. Magee J.C. Hoffman D.A. Johnston D.

Prolonged sodium channel inactivation contributes to dendritic action potential attenuation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6639-6646PubMed Google Scholar). Such mechanisms might powerfully affect temporal integration at dendritic branches on time scales of milliseconds to seconds. We have first tested if prior occurrence of a dendritic spike alters the properties of dendritic spikes subsequently elicited on the same branch. We used multi-site two-photon uncaging to deliver temporally synchronous input to multiple spines located on individual basal dendritic branches of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 1A; see Experimental Procedures). Increasing the number of stimulated spines initially caused a linear increase in the uncaging-induced excitatory postsynaptic potential (uEPSP), with the sudden appearance of a prominent dendritic spike consisting of a large initial fast, followed by a slower component (Figure 1B). The fast component of the dendritic spike manifested as a large stepwise increase in the first derivation of the voltage trace (δV/δt; Figures 1B and 1C, arrows 1C) that manifested as a prominent supralinearity (Figure 1D, arrows). Branches differed with respect to the magnitude of the stepwise increase in δV/δt (Example of a “strong” and “weak” branch is depicted in Figures 1B–1D). Two clearly distinct “weak” and “strong” populations of branches could be separated on the basis of the peak δV/δt of the dendritic spike (Figure 1E; n = 119 dendritic branches in 119 cells, 94 “weak” and 25 “strong” branches, see Experimental Procedures for details of classification). CA1 pyramidal neurons receive synchronized inputs at theta frequencies ranging from 5 to 10 Hz during behavior (Buzsaki, 2002Buzsaki G.

We therefore tested if dendritic spikes are systematically altered at these frequencies. At 1 Hz, changes in peak δV/δt were small (reduction to 85% ± 6% during 5 stimulations; Figure 2A). At 5 and 10 Hz, however, a strong reduction of the fast component of the dendritic spike was observed during the 5 stimulus train (reduction of peak δV/δt to 61% ± 6% and 43% ± 6%, respectively, n = 8 branches in 8 cells; Figures 2A and 2B). “Strong” branches showed a significantly stronger attenuation during 5 Hz stimulation (Figure 2C), with a reduction of peak δV/δt to 29% ± 6% during 5 stimulations (n = 6 branches from 6 cells, compared to 57% ± 4% in weak branches, n = 18 branches from 18 cells, p < 0.01; Figure 2D). The attenuation induced by dendritic spikes lasted for several hundred milliseconds (Figure 2E, n = 9–11 branches from 8 neurons). Variation of input synchronization did not result in differences in dendritic spike attenuation ratio observed with a 200 ms interpulse interval (ratio at 1 ms uncaging dwell time: 0.74 ± 0.09, 0.5 ms: 0.69 ± 0.08, 0.2 ms dwell time: 0.75 ± 0.04, n = 6, n.s., repeated-measures ANOVA). During the inactivating train, we noted that the progressive attenuation of the fast initial component was not immediately associated with a reduction of the slow component of the dendritic spike (Figure 2F, black traces). However, upon failure of the fast dendritic spike component (fifth stimulation; Figure 2F, black traces, δV/δt shown in red traces) the slow spike component was invariably absent. As a consequence, in both “weak” and “strong” branches, the failure of the fast component of the dendritic spike was associated with a significant reduction of the area under the uncaging-induced voltage change (Figure 2G). This is consistent with the idea that a fast Na+ spike is required for the subsequent slow depolarization mediated by NMDARs and other voltage-gated currents (Ariav et al., 2003Ariav G. Polsky A. Schiller J. Submillisecond precision of the input-output transformation function mediated by fast sodium dendritic spikes in basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7750-7758PubMed Google Scholar, Losonczy and Magee, 2006Losonczy A. Magee J.C. Integrative properties of radial oblique dendrites in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2006; 50: 291-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The failure of dendritic spikes during a stimulus train suggests a conversion of these branches to a linear processing mode. We tested this idea by calculating the ratio of measured uEPSP to the expected EPSP obtained as the arithmetic sum of the uEPSPs at the individual contributing spines. This ratio changed from 1.49 ± 0.28 and 1.52 ± 0.16 at the beginning of a stimulus train to 0.99 ± 0.07 and 1.11 after failure of the dendritic spike (n = 6 “weak” branches, n = 2 “strong” branches, respectively), indicating conversion to a linear processing mode. Does subthreshold activity in the linear range also depress branch excitability by reducing subsequent dendritic spikes? To address this question, we induced dendritic spikes with and without a preceding uEPSP evoked on the same branch (Figure 3A, lower trace, numbers in parentheses indicate the number of stimulated spines). uEPSPs of different magnitudes were not effective in attenuating dendritic spikes as revealed by the lack of change in δV/δt (Figure 3A, lower panel, δV/δt shown in red, summarized in Figure 3B; n = 8 weak and n = 3 strong branches from different cells). Thus, supralinear integration by dendritic spikes on an individual branch, but not a uEPSP, promotes a temporary conversion of the same branch to a linear processing mode. We next tested if synaptically evoked dendritic spikes display a similar attenuation using focal electrical stimulation (see Experimental Procedures; Figure 4A). Increasing the stimulation intensity initially resulted in a monotonous increase in the size of the stimulation-evoked EPSP (sEPSP), with a sudden appearance of a dendritic spike in 12 of 19 experiments (Figure 4B, black traces, δV/δt shown in red traces). As described for uEPSPs, the dendritic spike manifested as a stepwise increase in the maximal δV/δt of the voltage trace (red in Figures 4B and 4C). We next elicited sEPSP-driven dendritic spikes repetitively at frequencies of 1, 5, and 10 Hz (Figure 4D). In these experiments, occurrence of a dendritic spike invariably caused reduction of a subsequent dendritic spike, or its failure (Figure 4E, example shown for 5 Hz stimulation frequency, red traces in the inset show δV/δt for the traces indicated). These experiments are potentially complicated by facilitation or depression of sEPSPs during repetitive stimulation. We tested this issue by applying synaptic stimulations that elicited sEPSPs but were subthreshold for dendritic spikes. These experiments revealed a transient facilitation of sEPSPs at 10 Hz (second stimulation: 126.8% ± 9.6% of first EPSP amplitude; third stimulation 123.5% ± 9.3% of first EPSP amplitude, both p < 0.05) but not at 5 or 1 Hz (Figure 4F). Thus, nonuniform size of sEPSPs during stimulation trains is unlikely to account for dendritic spike attenuation observed at 5 or 1 Hz. The spike attenuation is quantified for pairs of consecutive dendritic spikes occurring during stimulation trains for 10, 5, and 1 Hz (interstimulus intervals of 0.1, 0.2, and 1 s, Figure 4G, red data points). These recordings invariably revealed a strong attenuation of dendritic spikes. This also held true when spikes during stimulation trains were analyzed that occurred nonconsecutively (Figure 4G, black data points). Overall, these data indicate that spike attenuation is also observed when spikes are initiated via synaptic release of glutamate. Is the attenuation of subsequent spikes limited to the input branch, or does it also affect adjacent dendritic branches branching off the same parent dendrite? To address this issue, we elicited dendritic spikes on two daughter branches (Figure 5A, stimulated spines indicated by red and blue dots) and tested the interaction between them. At each individual branch, dendritic spikes caused prominent inactivation of following dendritic spikes (Figure 5B, stimulated branch indicated by red and blue dots, 200 ms interval, δV/δt change on average −34% ± 6%, n = 16, δV/δt shown in red). In contrast, a dendritic spike in one daughter branch did not significantly alter a subsequent spike in the other daughter branch from the same parent dendrite (Figure 5C; δV/δt change on average 0.5% ± 2.0%, n = 16 branches from 8 cells, mean distance 58 ± 8 μm). This indicates that dendritic spikes cause a branch-specific, local attenuation of subsequent spikes. Dendritic spikes are capable of triggering somatic action potentials (Ariav et al., 2003Ariav G. Polsky A. Schiller J. Submillisecond precision of the input-output transformation function mediated by fast sodium dendritic spikes in basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7750-7758PubMed Google Scholar, Golding and Spruston, 1998Golding N.L. Spruston N. Dendritic sodium spikes are variable triggers of axonal action potentials in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 1998; 21: 1189-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) which then invade the basal and apical dendritic arborizations. They could therefore cause a global reduction of dendritic excitability. Indeed, dendritic spikes were strongly attenuated both by action potential bursts (Figure 5D, uncaging locations indicated by blue dots, 200 ms interval between action potential and uncaging stimuli, δV/δt change on average −48% ± 8%, n = 16 branches from 13 cells) and by single action potentials elicited with somatic current injection (Figure 5E, δV/δt change on average −19% ± 5%, n = 9 branches from 9 cells). Importantly, this attenuation was observed in all dendrites, including pairs of daughter dendrites emanating from the same parent dendrites (n = 6 pairs, sister dendrite to Figures 5D and 5E shown in Figures 5F and 5G). Attenuation could also be observed when somatic action potentials were triggered by a dendritic spike (Figure 5G; n = 23). This indicates that attenuation of dendritic spikes by axonally generated action potentials back-propagating into dendrites is a global plasticity mechanism that affects most dendritic branches. This mechanism contrasts with the local, branch-specific attenuation induced by dendritic spikes. The attenuation induced by either an action potential, or an action potential burst lasted for several hundreds of milliseconds, similar to the attenuation caused by individual dendritic spike (Figure 5H, cf. Figure 2E). The results above predict that attenuation of dendritic spikes either by local or global inactivation will reduce the likelihood of the corresponding branches to elicit an action potential output. We tested this idea by eliciting a dendritic spike on a branch at sufficient strength to elicit a somatic action potential (Figure 6A, left panel). Preceding the uncaging stimulus with an action potential burst led to reduction of the dendritic spike and failure of action potential generation (“2” in Figure 6A; n = 12). A similar finding was obtained with single action potentials (n = 6, data not shown). We also examined the effects of repetitive stimulation on the capability of individual branches to trigger neuronal action potential output. Repetitive uncaging (5 Hz) caused an initially present action potential to fail during the stimulation train (Figures 6B and 6C; n = 15). In those neurons that generated two or more somatic action potentials to repetitive stimulation, we also observed a systematic variation of the timing of these action potentials. At the first stimulation in a train, a somatic action potential with a precise timing was elicited by the fast component of the dendritic spike (indicated by “2” in Figure 6B; see Ariav et al., 2003Ariav G. Polsky A. Schiller J. Submillisecond precision of the input-output transformation function mediated by fast sodium dendritic spikes in basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7750-7758PubMed Google Scholar). At subsequent stimulations in a train, the fast component was progressively reduced. In these cases, the slower component of the dendritic spike often initiated a somatic action potential (indicated by “2” in Figure 6B), resulting in a systematically longer delay to initiation of the action potential (Figure 6D). Thus, repetitive synchronous activation causes not only a gradual failure of action potential output, but also a systematic change in spike timing. These results indicate that synaptic input subthreshold for dendritic spikes does not change dendritic supralinear integration (Figure 6E, left panel), whereas dendritic spikes strongly inhibit supralinear integration in the stimulated branch only (Figure 6E, middle panel). Somatic action potentials cause a more global attenuation of dendritic spikes (Figure 6E, right panel). Back-propagating action potentials will cause Na+ channel inactivation in both the stimulated branch, as well as all lower-order parent dendrites. This raises the question whether back-propagating action potentials attenuate dendritic spikes via an action on the parent branches or on the stimulated branch. We therefore examined whether back-propagating action potentials induce spike attenuation at both proximal and distal locations on the same basal dendritic arbor (see Figure S2A available online). Of 20 experiments in which stimulation was performed on proximal and distal locations, dendritic spikes in both locations could be observed only in four cases. In these, dendritic spike attenuation by prior action potentials was observed in all cases at both proximal (δV/δt change on average −27% ± 11%) and distal (δV/δt change on average −26% ± 6%) locations (Figures S2C and S2E). The same held true for action potential bursts, which induced more potent attenuation at proximal and distal locations (−47% ± 14% burst of 3 APs at proximal and −40% ± 14% burst of 3 APs at distal locations, respectively; Figures S2B and S2D). We note that a quantitative interpretation is difficult, because proximal locations invariably yielded strong spikes, which attenuate strongly, whereas distal locations yielded weak spikes, which show weak attenuation (cf. Figure 2D). Thus, a direct comparison of proximal versus distal input locations is difficult. We next addressed potential mechanisms underlying dendritic spike attenuation. A prominent slow inactivation of Na+ channels has been described in CA1 apical dendrites (Colbert et al., 1997Colbert C.M. Magee J.C. Hoffman D.A. Johnston D. Slow recovery from inactivation of Na+ channels underlies the activity- dependent attenuation of dendritic action potentials in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6512-6521PubMed Google Scholar, Jung et al., 1997Jung H.Y. Mickus T. Spruston N. Prolonged sodium channel inactivation contributes to dendritic action potential attenuation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6639-6646PubMed Google Scholar), but it is unclear whether smaller caliber dendrites such as radial oblique or basal dendrites display a similar phenomenon. We have directly recorded Na+ currents from basal dendrites in the cell-attached configuration (see Experimental Procedures). When repetitively elicited with brief depolarizing pulses (Figure 7A, inset), Na+ currents displayed prominent inactivation at 5 Hz (Figure 7B, upper panel shows superimposed current traces, lower panel shows continuous current recording during the stimulation train). Na+ current amplitude was gradually reduced to 69% ± 3% during a train of 10 stimulations at 5 Hz (n = 8; see Figure 7B). No significant rundown of Na+ currents was observed during these recordings. In addition to Na+ currents, dendritic A-type K+ currents have also been shown to modulate the size of dendritic spikes (Losonczy et al., 2008Losonczy A. Makara J.K. Magee J.C. Compartmentalized dendritic plasticity and input feature storage in neurons.Nature. 2008; 452: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Blocking A-type K+ currents with 4-aminopyridine (2 mM) resulted in a transition of the intrinsic firing mode of CA1 neurons from regular- to burst-firing, as previously described (Magee and Carruth, 1999Magee J.C. Carruth M. Dendritic voltage-gated ion channels regulate the action potential firing mode of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1895-1901PubMed Google Scholar; n = 9; see inset, Figure 7C), confirming the efficacy of the 4-aminopyridine application. At the same time, an increase in the δV/δt of dendritic spikes was observed (Figure 7C, red traces; quantification in Figure 7D; increase by 20.5% ± 8.7%, n = 7, p < 0.05). These changes were not, however, accompanied by altered dendritic spike attenuation (see insets of Figure 7C for superposition of magnified δV/δt traces; quantification in Figure 7E). These data suggest that A-type K+ currents modulate the size of dendritic spikes, as previously described (Losonczy et al., 2008Losonczy A. Makara J.K. Magee J.C. Compartmentalized dendritic plasticity and input feature storage in neurons.Nature. 2008; 452: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), but not their dynamics during repetitive activity patterns. They also imply a role for slow inactivation of dendritic Na+ channels in spike attenuation, although they do not exclude an additional role of other ion channels. Modest variation of the holding potential did not affect spike attenuation (see Figure S3 and legend). We next began to evaluate the relevance of spike attenuation for the in-vivo situation. CA1 neurons receive synchronous input likely to trigger dendritic spikes in particular during sharp waves/ripple (SWR) patterns. Dendritic spikes have indeed been observed under SWRs (Kamondi et al., 1998Kamondi A. Acsády L. Wang X.J. Buzsáki G. Theta oscillations in somata and dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells in vivo: activity-dependent phase-precession of action potentials.Hippocampus. 1998; 8: 244-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The occurrence of dendritic spikes during SWRs is also facilitated by the strong 5- to 7-fold increase of network synchronization of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells leading to 15% CA3 and 30% of CA1 pyramidal cells to fire action potentials in an SWR event (Csicsvari et al., 2000Csicsvari J.

Magee J.C. State-dependent dendritic computation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2088-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although most SWRs tend to occur during immobility and slow wave sleep, they also occur in active waking periods when hippocampal pyramidal cells also fire in relation to space. These exploration-associated SWRs (eSWRs) have been suggested to have role in neuronal plasticity related to storage of new place maps and to the reactivation of such place maps in sleep (Cheng and Frank, 2008Cheng S. Frank L.M. New experiences enhance coordinated neural activity in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2008; 57: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, O'Neill et al., 2006O'Neill J.

Place-selective firing of CA1 pyramidal cells during sharp wave/ripple network patterns in exploratory behavior.Neuron. 2006; 49: 143-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We therefore recorded single-unit activity from n = 151 CA1 pyramidal cells that exhibited place-related firing while the animal has been actively exploring either familiar or novel environments (Figure 8A). We selected activity periods that contained an eSWR when the animal was within and outside of their place fields (Figure 8B). We then analyzed the patterns of single unit activity in a 1 s time period before onset of the eSWRs. These patterns proved to be variable. First we examined the time interval between eSWR onset and the last spike that occurred before that to test how often the last spike is expected to be able to block dendritic spikes during eSWRs. As expected, because of the increased firing probability of cells, the incidence of short (<100 ms) time intervals was higher (Figure 8C). Moreover, the number of spikes in the 1 s interval preceding eSWRs was lower outside place fields (Figure 8D). We chose representative in vivo recordings containing either 2, 4, or 6–8 spikes in the 1 s period before onset of the eSWR (n = 36 examples of trains). We then induced the same temporal sequence of action potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons in-vitro by applying somatic current injections (3 ms, 1–1.5 nA; Figure 8D, see examples of spike trains in leftmost panel; n = 11 cells, n = 5–8 examples for each condition, n = 196 spike trains applied, n = 2–5 repetitions per single spike train example). We induced dendritic spikes after the action potential trains and compared them to a dendritic control spike elicited before the action potential train (Figure 8E, right panel). This allowed us to quantify the amount of spike attenuation produced by action potential trains similar to in-vivo activity patterns (Figure 8F; δV/δt of the posttrain dendritic spike divided by the δV/δt of the control spike). These experiments revealed that even in those cases in which only two somatic action potentials occurred during the 1 s time window preceding eSWRs, dendritic spikes were strongly attenuated. This did not appear different for spike trains recorded inside or outside the place field of the respective CA1 neuron (Figure 8F). Thus, spike trains with a similar number of action potentials from inside and outside the place field did not produce differential effects, but the probability that cells fire >2 spikes before an SWR was higher inside the place field. Thus, dendritic spike attenuati"

Dev. 2003; 13: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Accordingly, there is great impetus to understand the molecular mechanisms that mediate this broadly important route of protein degradation. ERAD proceeds by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, by which an ER-localized substrate is covalently modified by the addition of multiple copies of 7.6-kDa ubiquitin to form a multiubiquitin chain that is recognized by the cytosolic 26S proteasome (10Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 11Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is added to the substrate by the successive action of three enzymes. The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme uses ATP to covalently add ubiquitin to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) enzyme. Ubiquitin is then transferred from the charged E2 to the substrate or the growing ubiquitin chain by the action of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in a substrate-attached multiubiquitin chain that is recognized by the proteasome, leading to degradation of the ubiquitinated substrate. This is a skeletal picture; in most cases, ancillary factors participate in substrate recognition and transfer of the ubiquitinated substrate to the proteasome (12Bays N.W. Wilhovsky S.K. Goradia A.

Thus, a critical step in the ERAD pathway involves transfer of the ERAD substrate to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation by a process referred to as retrotranslocation or dislocation (15Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Retrotranslocation requires the hexameric AAA-ATPase called Cdc48p in yeast and p97 in mammals, and it is thought that a protein channel mediates the movement of substrates across the ER membrane.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 345-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The integral membrane ER ligase Hrd1p, in conjunction with Hrd3p, is responsible for ubiquitination of Hmg2p. Efficient delivery of ubiquitinated Hmg2p to the proteasome requires the Cdc48p-Ufd1p-Npl4p complex presumably by promoting retrotranslocation of ER-embedded Hmg2p. Due to the requirement for retrotranslocation in all ERAD pathways we have adapted our in vitro assay of Hrd1p-mediated ubiquitination of the normally degraded fusion Hmg2p-GFP to study this ER removal step in ERAD. We have reconstituted Hrd1p-mediated ubiquitination and retrotranslocation of Hmg2p-GFP in vitro (21Flury I. Garza R. Shearer A. Rosen J. Cronin S. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3917-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Bazirgan O.A. Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38989-39001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have now directly demonstrated that the entire 8-spanning Hmg2p-GFP protein is removed from the membrane by this process, remaining intact yet soluble after retrotranslocation. The dislocation of intact Hmg2p-GFP required both Cdc48p and hydrolysis of the β–γ bond of ATP. The Ubx2p adaptor protein functioned in a manner consistent with its proposed role in Cdc48p anchoring to the ER. Surprisingly, the Dsk2p/Rad23p proteasomal coupling factors were also required for retrotranslocation. Neither derlins nor Sec61p were implicated in Hmg2p-GFP retrotranslocation by our assay. Furthermore, an engineered substrate based on HMG-CoA reductase underwent ERAD in the complete absence of Hrd1p or Doa10p and in vitro, full-length retrotranslocation, both indicating that the large transmembrane domains of either of these ERAD E3 ligases were not required for membrane extraction. Taken together, these studies define a core set of proteins that can mediate recognition and retrotranslocation of the HRD substrate Hmg2p-GFP and will allow mechanistic analysis along all points of the ERAD pathway. Strains and Media—All strains were derived from the S288C derivative genetic background and grown at 30 °C with aeration, as described previously (23Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Yeast strains are listed in Table S1. Cultures used for assessing degradation by cycloheximide chase and microsome donor strains were logarithmically grown in minimum medium with 2% glucose and appropriate amino acid supplements (A600 < 0.35). Cytosol donor strains were grown in YPD medium to an A600 between 0.8 and 1.2. Standard yeast techniques used to integrate plasmids, prepare gene deletions, and incorporate mutant alleles are detailed in the supplemental material. In Vitro Ubiquitination—In vitro reactions were prepared and analyzed as described previously (21Flury I. Garza R. Shearer A. Rosen J. Cronin S. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3917-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Bazirgan O.A. Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38989-39001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and are delineated in detail in the supplemental material. Briefly, cytosols from strains overexpressing Ubc7p or an otherwise identical ubc7Δ null strain were prepared similarly to those from the Schekman laboratory (24Spang A. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cytosol strains were lysed by grinding under liquid nitrogen and ultracentrifuged for membrane removal. Typically, 1 mm ATP was added to cytosol; however, ATP was not added in AMP-PNP (Sigma) experiments, to allow choice of nucleotide during the two reaction phases. Protein concentration was measured using Bradford reagent. Cytosol concentrations were adjusted to 20–25 mg/ml for ubiquitination and retrotranslocation assays. Microsomes were prepared from ubc7Δ null yeast strain expressing 3HA-Hrd1p and Hmg2p-GFP from the TDH3 promoter by bead lysis followed by membrane fractionation. The microsomal pellets were resuspended in the same buffer used to prepare cytosol. MG-132 (Sigma) was added to microsome and cytosol preparations except where indicated. One in vitro ubiquitination reaction typically consisted of 10 μl of microsome suspension and 12 μl of cytosol. ATP (500 mm stock) was added to each reaction to a final concentration of 30 mm to initiate reaction, and the reaction was then incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The assay was stopped by solubilization in 200 μl of SUME (1% SDS, 8 m urea, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 10 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Detergent immunoprecipitation buffer was added prior to incubation of rabbit polyclonal antiserum (anti-GFP, anti-loop and anti-Hrd1p antisera, prepared in collaboration with Scantibodies, Inc. (Santee, CA)) for immunoprecipitation (IP) of Hmg2p-GFP, Hrd1p, or Hmg1-Hrd1p. Overnight incubation with antiserum was followed with Protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A beads were washed twice, aspirated to dryness, resuspended in 2× urea sample buffer (2× USB: 8 m urea, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8), and incubated at 50 °C for 10 min. IPs were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 8% Tris-glycine gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies anti-ubiquitin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), anti-GFP (BD Biosciences), or anti-HA (Covance, Princeton, NJ). Goat anti-mouse conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) recognized primary antibodies. Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for immunodetection. In Vitro Retrotranslocation—Each in vitro retrotranslocation set of total, supernatant, and pellet fractions was typically derived from one 3× in vitro ubiquitination reaction. The reaction was run at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of 1.5 μl of 50× N-ethylmaleimide to a final concentration of 5 mm. One reaction equivalent (typically 24 μl) was transferred to one tube designated as total (T in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), and another reaction equivalent was transferred to a tube for centrifugation for 1 h at 25,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (S) was carefully removed, and the resulting pellet (P) was resuspended in the same volume as the supernatant and total fractions. Each fraction was solubilized with SUME and immunoprecipitated and detected as described. The use of identical volumes allowed direct visual comparison of the immunoblotted proteins present in each fraction.FIGURE 2Retrotranslocation of full-length Hmg2p-GFP in vitro. A, Hmg2p-GFP retrotranslocation assays were carried out using either antiserum recognizing the cytosolic GFP (anti-GFP) or the first lumenal loop (anti-loop) for the immunoprecipitation (IP) step. B, cytosolic and transmembrane epitopes of retrotranslocated Hmg2p-GFP could not be separately precipitated. Six supernatant fractions from six in vitro retrotranslocation reactions were subjected to serial immunoprecipitations. Pairs of supernatant fractions were first individually immunoprecipitated with preimmune, anti-GFP, or anti-loop antiserum, and the retrotranslocated Hmg2p-GFP was detected by anti-ubiquitin blotting (anti-UB1; top). The supernatant from each first immunoprecipitation was then subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with either anti-GFP (G) or anti-loop (L) antiserum as indicated and immunoblotted for ubiquitin (anti-UB2; bottom). C, nondetergent immunoprecipitation of in vitro retrotranslocated Hmg2p-GFP. Preimmune serum, anti-GFP, or anti-loop antiserum were used to immunoprecipitate retrotranslocated Hmg2p-GFP from two identical retrotranslocation assay supernatant fractions using a detergent-free IP buffer as described. D, ubiquitin protease treatment revealed that full-length Hmg2p-GFP was retrotranslocated in vitro. Identical supernatant fractions from retrotranslocation reactions were treated either with buffer or with the ubiquitin protease Usp2-cc for 1 h on ice or 37 °C, as described.

A, in vivo Hmg2p-GFP degradation was blocked by the cdc48-2 mutant. WT (CDC48) and cdc48-2 strains expressing Hmg2p-GFP were subjected to a cycloheximide chase and flow cytometry at the indicated times to evaluate Hmg2p-GFP levels. The experiment was done at 30 °C, a permissive temperature for this allele. Histograms of 10,000 cells are shown, with the number of cells versus GFP fluorescence. B, in vitro retrotranslocation of Hmg2p-GFP required Cdc48p. In vitro reactions were carried out in which both components were derived from either WT (CDC48) or cdc48-2 strains (these panels were extracted from the more elaborate panel D). C, same experiment using reaction mixtures from WT or cdc48-3 strains. D, strong requirement for cytosolic Cdc48p in retrotranslocation. The indicated combinations of WT or cdc48-2 reaction components (microsomes (MIC) and cytosol (CYT)) were mixed, as indicated, to evaluate relative contribution to Hmg2p-GFP retrotranslocation. E, in vitro Hmg2p-GFP ubiquitination with GST-ubiquitin does not support Hmg2p-GFP retrotranslocation. Exogenous ubiquitin or GST-ubiquitin was added to the in vitro retrotranslocation assay, and anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting was used for detection of modified Hmg2-GFP.

A, in vitro Hmg2p-GFP ubiquitination was compromised in the presence of AMP-PNP. Buffer, ATP (30 mm), or AMP-PNP (30 mm) was added to in vitro ubiquitination reactions, as indicated. Hmg2p-GFP was immunoprecipitated, and ubiquitinated Hmg2p-GFP was detected (Hmg2p-GFP in vitro ubiquitination). These concentrations of the nucleotide supported similar levels of total in vitro ubiquitination, evaluated by direct ubiquitin immunoblotting of a 1-μl sample of whole reaction mixtures (Total in vitro ubiquitination). B, direct ATP requirement for in vitro Hmg2p-GFP retrotranslocation. Five in vitro ubiquitination reactions were carried out with cdc48-2 microsomes and cdc48-2 UBC7 cytosol to minimize retrotranslocation. Following the 1-h incubation, the reaction mixes were pooled and fractionated into pellet and supernatant by centrifugation. The supernatant was discarded, and the prereacted microsomes were resuspended and then incubated with CDC48 ubc7Δ cytosol in the presence of buffer, ATP (30 mm), or AMP-PNP (30 mm), for an additional 1 h to assay retrotranslocation. The supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were separated by centrifugation, and Hmg2p-GFP was immunoprecipitated from each fraction with anti-GFP antiserum.

A, depiction of fusion protein Hmg1-Hrd1p. The transmembrane Hmg1p domain has a lumenal Myc epitope, and the cytosolic domain of Hrd1p has three HA epitopes. B, Hmg1-Hrd1p fusion protein was correctly inserted into ER membrane. Microsomes prepared from strain expressing Hmg1-Hrd1p were digested with trypsin for the indicated times and immunoblotted with anti-Myc. C and D, degradation behavior of Hmg1-Hrd1p was assayed by cycloheximide chase. C, degradation of Hmg1-Hrd1p was dependent on Ubc7p. D, degradation of Hmg1-Hrd1p was dependent on cdc48-2 and hrd2-1. The ubc7Δ and hrd2-1 lanes include lower intensity exposures to facilitate comparison with the wild-type lanes. E, in vitro retrotranslocation of Hmg1-Hrd1p fusion was dependent on Cdc48p. Reactions with Ubc7p from WT (CDC48 UBC7) or cdc48-2 (cdc48-2 UBC7) and without Ubc7p (Δ) were carried out with hrd1Δ microsomal strains CDC48 (WT) or cdc48-2 expressing Hmg1-Hrd1p from the TDH3 promoter. Fusion protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-Hrd1p antiserum and immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and anti-HA antibodies. Anti-ubiquitin (anti-UB) panels were derived from the same gel, as were anti-HA panels. Extraneous lanes were removed. M, mutant cdc48-2.

Either preimmune, anti-GFP, or anti-loop antiserum was added and incubated in IPs. After the addition and incubation of Protein A-Sepharose, protein-bound beads were washed extensively with nondetergent IP buffer. Immunoprecipitated Hmg2p-GFP was removed from beads by the addition of sample buffer, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE gels, and immunoblotted as described. Ubiquitin Stripping—Recombinant Usp2-cc, the catalytic core of the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp2p, was a generous gift from the Kopito laboratory (Stanford University) and prepared from a plasmid derived from Rohan Baker (Australian National University). In vitro ubiquitination and retrotranslocation was carried out as described except that leupeptin was not added to any of the buffers used in the preparation of cytosol and microsomes. Seven in vitro ubiquitination reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and then centrifuged at 25,000 × g. The supernatant fractions were pooled. Two reaction equivalents (50 μl) of supernatant received 5 μl of Usp2-cc (0.8–1.6 mg/ml) or buffer. The Usp2-cc reactions were incubated for 1 h in a 37 °C incubator. The reactions were stopped with SUME containing PIs and N-ethylmaleimide, and retrotranslocated substrate was immunoprecipitated in the same way as described. Half of each IP was used for detection of anti-ubiquitin, and the other half was used to detect Hmg2p-GFP with anti-GFP or Hmg1-Hrd1p with anti-HA antibodies. Use of GST-Ubiquitin—In vitro reactions were modified by the addition of either GST-ubiquitin (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA) or ubiquitin (Sigma) to a final concentration of 20 μm in the reaction mix. Retrotranslocation and detection were carried out as in other reactions, using anti-ubiquitin or anti-GFP immunoblotting. Cycloheximide Chase of Hmg1-Hrd1p—Preparation of whole cell lysates was previously described (25Gardner R. Cronin S. Leader B. Rine J. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2611-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Logarithmically growing cells were incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) for the indicated times and broken by bead lysis. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the degradation substrate was detected with anti-HA antibodies. Protease Protection Assay—Microsomes were prepared from the strain expressing the Hmg1-Hrd1p fusion used in the in vitro retrotranslocation assay for trypsin digestion, as previously described (26Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 188-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The microsomes were resuspended in reaction buffer and incubated with 150 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 0, 2, 8, and 32 min. An equal volume of 2× USB buffer was added to stop the reactions. The samples were then separated by 14% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were detected with anti-Myc 9E-10 antibody (hybridoma from ATCC (Manassas, VA)). Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry was carried out as previously described (27Cronin S.R. Khoury A. Ferry D.K. Hampton R.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).

Notch signaling initiates the diversification of immature V2-interneurons into excitatory V2a-interneurons and inhibitory V2b-interneurons. Here, we provide a transcriptional regulatory mechanism underlying their balanced production. LIM-only protein LMO4 controls this binary cell fate choice by regulating the activity of V2a- and V2b-specific LIM complexes inversely. In the spinal cord, LMO4 induces GABAergic V2b-interneurons in collaboration with SCL and inhibits Lhx3 from generating glutamatergic V2a-interneuons. In LMO4;SCL compound mutant embryos, V2a-interneurons increase markedly at the expense of V2b-interneurons. We further demonstrate that LMO4 nucleates the assembly of a novel LIM-complex containing SCL, Gata2, and NLI. This complex activates specific enhancers in V2b-genes consisting of binding sites for SCL and Gata2, thereby promoting V2b-interneuron fate. Thus, LMO4 plays essential roles in directing a balanced generation of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the ventral spinal cord."

https://openalex.org/W2037355108,"Stop-Go Axon Crossing Developing axons may or may not cross the body's midline according to a balance between repulsive and attractive guidance factors. As an axon first approaches the midline, a repressive receptor encoded by the comm gene is inactivated by relocation within the cell. After the axon crosses the midline, the repressive receptor is reactivated, keeping the axon from crossing back. Yang et al. (p. 944 , published online 26 March; see the Perspective by Kidd ) now show that in Drosophila the comm gene is regulated by the attractive receptor known as Frazzled. The Frazzled protein thus functions in two ways: It initiates attraction in response to a ligand and it activates transcription of the comm gene, keeping the repressive signal out of the action."

Sensory input can generate compartmentalized electrical and biochemical activity in the dendrites of a receiving neuron. Here, we show that in the developing retinotectal projection of young Xenopus tadpoles, visually driven Ca2+ signals are topographically organized at the subcellular, dendritic scale. Functional in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging revealed that the sensitivity of dendritic Ca2+ signals to stimulus location in visual space is correlated with their anatomical position within the dendritic tree of individual neurons. This topographic distribution was dependent on NMDAR activation, whereas global Ca2+ signals were mediated by Ca2+ influx through dendritic, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. These findings suggest a framework for plasticity models that invoke local dendritic Ca2+ signaling in the elaboration of neural connectivity and dendrite-specific information storage."

A large population of hippocampal neurons (50%) signaled trial outcome by differentiating between correct and error trials during the period after the behavioral response. About half these cells increased their activity following correct trials (correct up cells) while the remaining half fired more following error trials (error up cells).

Findings from a convergence of human and animal studies show that the hippocampus is important for the successful acquisition of new declarative memories for facts, events, and relationships (Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2001Eichenbaum H.

Consistent with this idea, numerous previous studies have shown that hippocampal neurons signal the acquisition of new associations with striking changes in their firing rate (Berger et al., 1976Berger T.W.

While these studies focused on changes in neural activity during the stimulus or delay periods of the tasks, a key requirement during the acquisition of new associations is the ability to use information about behavioral outcome, typically signaled by the delivery or withholding of reward, to strengthen correct performance or modify errors on subsequent trials. Consistent with this idea, previous studies have described medial temporal lobe neurons that signal reward-related as well as outcome-related information. Some of the earliest descriptions of rat hippocampal activity described cells that responded to either reward delivery or lack of reward (O'Keefe, 1976O'Keefe J.

Studies in monkeys reported that sensory responses in the perirhinal cortex can come to signal the reward value of the stimulus (Liu and Richmond, 2000Liu Z. Richmond B.J.

Other studies suggest that hippocampal neurons signal information about trial outcome. For example, Watanabe and Niki described a small number of cells in the monkey hippocampus that differentiated between correct and error trials during and after the response period of a spatial delayed response task. Some cells responded to the delivery of juice following a correct response, but not to a random drop of reward. Other cells showed differential firing following an error response or when the juice reward was omitted. Similar responses have been reported in the prefrontal cortex (Niki and Watanabe, 1979Niki H.

These outcome-selective cells have generally been interpreted as signaling the consequence of the animal's response, though their contribution to learning has not been examined. To further explore both reward-related and outcome-related responses in the monkey hippocampus, we recorded neural activity during an associative learning task where information about trial outcome plays a key role in the learning process. We used a variant of an object-place associative learning task known to be highly sensitive to medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage in both humans (Cave and Squire, 1991Cave C.B. Squire L.R.

One-trial memory for object-place associations after separate lesions of hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal region in the monkey.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1956-1965PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report that 50% of the isolated hippocampal cells differentiated between correct and error responses during the time period following the behavioral response (outcome-selective cells). To further evaluate the information carried by these hippocampal outcome-selective cells, we characterized their sensitivity to various reward manipulations. We also asked how this sensitivity to trial outcome might contribute to the learning process. Two macaque monkeys (one rhesus and one bonnet macaque) performed an object-place associative learning task (Figure 1A) in which they learned to associate different object-place combinations with either an early or late bar release response. Animals initiated each trial by holding a bar and fixating a central fixation point for 500 ms. They were then shown one of four possible object-place combinations for 500 ms. Each combination was composed of one of two possible visual objects in one of two possible spatial locations (Figure 1C). Both the objects and the spatial locations changed daily. Following a 700 ms delay interval when nothing but the fixation point was shown on the screen, the animals could make a bar release response either during the presentation of an orange circle presented for 500 ms (early response) or during the 500 ms presentation of a green circle shown immediately after the orange circle (late response). If the response was correct, a “positive” auditory feedback tone was played 15 ms (±1ms) after the bar release. Except for “omit reward” trials (see below) the auditory tone served as a reliable signal of the future delivery of reward. For the vast majority of trials, correct responses were rewarded with between two to four juice drops starting 30 ms (±1ms) after bar release and ending 933 ms (±1ms) after bar release if four drops were given. With trial and error, animals learned to associate each object-place combination with either the early or a late bar release response. For correct trials, juice reward was followed by a 2000 ms intertrial (ITI) interval before the initiation of the next trial. For error trials, a 2000 ms ITI interval started immediately after an incorrect bar release response. Fixation was required from the time the animal initiated the trial until the time of the bar release response. To characterize behavioral learning of individual object-place combinations, we used a Bayesian state-space model for analyzing learning of multiple problems simultaneously (Smith et al., 2007Smith A.C. Wirth S. Suzuki W.A. Brown E.N. Bayesian analysis of interleaved learning and response bias in behavioral experiments.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 2516-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar; Supplemental Experimental Procedures 1 and Figures S1 and S2, available online). Of the 156 sessions, there were 55 sessions during which animals did not learn any association to criterion. For the remaining sessions, animals learned 1 of 4 (17 sessions), 2 of 4 (20 sessions), 3 of 4 (17 sessions), or 4 of 4 (17 sessions) associations to criterion. Learning criterion was defined as the trial number when the estimated probability correct performance was significantly above chance (Smith et al., 2007Smith A.C. Wirth S. Suzuki W.A. Brown E.N. Bayesian analysis of interleaved learning and response bias in behavioral experiments.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 2516-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar; Supplemental Experimental Procedures 1). Monkey M required an average of 68.60 ± 4.34 total (i.e., consecutive) interleaved trials to learn an individual association. This corresponds to an average of 14 ± 0.75 trials for each individual association. Monkey E required an average of 82.4 ± 5.08 total interleaved trials to learn an individual association, and an average of 17 ± 4.02 trials for each individual association. In order to administer several key control experiments, animals also performed a “fixation only” task given in blocks of trials at the end of the recording sessions (Figure 1B). The fixation only task was identical to the object-place task except that animals were only required to maintain fixation on the central fixation cross through the object-place presentation and delay periods of the trial to receive a reward (i.e., there was no associative learning required). Animals successfully completed an average of 73.57% (±1.52%) of the fixation only trials (i.e., completed trial without break of fixation). In a subset of 30% of the fixation only trials, we examined the effect of omitting reward following successful fixation (omit reward trials; the auditory tone was played on these omit reward trials). On other fixation only trials, we tested the effect of giving random, unexpected reward at variable time points throughout the fixation only trials (random reward control trials). We recorded the activity of 165 hippocampal neurons from two monkeys (109 from monkey M and 56 from monkey E) during learning of novel object-place-response associations. Recordings were made throughout the full anterior-posterior extent of the hippocampus, and based on MRI reconstructions, they appeared to include neurons from all hippocampal subdivisions (Figure 1D). We did not attempt to select cells based on their firing properties and instead recorded from the first well-isolated hippocampal cells encountered. To examine how cells signaled information about trial outcome, we focused on neural activity during the 2000 ms following the bar release response. We chose this time period because it was the longest common postresponse time period available for analysis for both correct and error trials. For correct trials, this period included both the time period when reward is being given (from 30 ms following bar release to 933 ms following bar release if four drops of reward were given) and the initial part of the ITI interval. For error trials, this 2000 ms period included the entire ITI interval period. Our initial analysis revealed a heterogeneous mix of both sustained and more transient responses during this 2000 ms period. In order to characterize these responses with higher temporal resolution, we split the postrelease period into two consecutive 1000 ms time periods. Compared with the baseline firing rate period, defined as activity during the 500 ms fixation period at the start of each trial, we found that 77% (127 of 165) of the hippocampal neurons responded with significant activity in either one or both of the two consecutive 1000 ms periods analyzed (t test, p < 0.05). Moreover, 83 of the 127 responsive neurons (65% of the responsive cells or 50% of the total population) were outcome selective in that they differentiated between correct and error trials (t test comparing responses on correct versus error trials, p < 0.05). Further analysis revealed two distinct subpopulations of outcome-selective neurons. The first population (30 of 83 responsive neurons), termed “correct up” cells, increased their activity on correct trials as compared with error trials in the first (n = 11), the second (n = 7), or both (n = 12) 1000 ms periods following bar release (Figures 2A, S4A, and S4C). A sliding window calculation (See Experimental Procedures) revealed that the correct up cells started differentiating correct from error trials 342 ± 75 ms after bar release (p < 0.05, t test). A second subpopulation termed “error up” cells (38 of 83 responsive neurons) increased their firing rate on error trials relative to correct trials during the first (n = 3), the second (n = 15), or both (n = 20) 1000 ms periods after bar release. Among error up cells, 14 cells exhibited a significant decrease in response following a correct trial, though the response following errors was significantly above baseline. Error up cells were also characterized by clear motor-related activity that peaked at the time of bar release (Figures 2B, S4B, and S4D; see Supplemental Information 2 and Figure S5 for a further discussion of the motor-related activity of the error up cells). Error up cells differentiated between correct and error trials starting 489 ± 63 ms after the animal's bar release response (p < 0.05, t test). Smaller populations of cells decreased their activity on correct trials (“correct down” cells; n = 5) or on error trials (“error down” cells; n = 7) relative to baseline, or responded significantly to both correct and error trials relative to baseline activity (“mixed outcome” cells; n = 3). Because of the relatively small number of cells in these latter three categories, they were not examined further. An analysis of the ratio of spike height versus spike width showed that the majority of our isolated neurons were putative pyramidal cells and that correct up and error up cell categories included both putative principle cells and putative fast spiking neurons (Supplemental Information 1 and Figure S3). Given that the correct up signal is not expressed until well after the first drop of juice is delivered 30 ms after the bar release (Figure 2A), one possibility is that these cells may simply provide a delayed signal of reward delivery (Ranck, 1973Ranck Jr., J.B. Studies on single neurons in dorsal hippocampal formation and septum in unrestrained rats. I. Behavioral correlates and firing repertoires.Exp. Neurol. 1973; 41: 461-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, Smith and Mizumori, 2006Smith D.M. Mizumori S.J. Learning-related development of context-specific neuronal responses to places and events: the hippocampal role in context processing.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3154-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To test the dependence of the correct up signal on aspects of reward delivery, we examined the effect of several different reward manipulations. To test whether correct up cells respond to delivery of reward per se, we examined responses on a subset of both standard and fixation only trials in which random rewards were given. Specifically, we compared neural activity during the 500 ms following the first reward drop in correct trials with the activity during the 500 ms following a random reward drop using a t test (p < 0.05). None of the correct up cells tested in these conditions (n = 8) showed a reliable response to random reward delivery (Figure 3A). While the correct up cells did not respond to random drops of juice, we next tested the possibility that they might be sensitive to the timing of reward delivery. To address this possibility, we examined neural activity on standard trials in which the delivery of reward was delayed from 30 ms to 518 ms after the bar release response, but the auditory feedback signal continued to be given immediately (i.e., 15 ± 1 ms) following a correct response as in standard conditions (see Experimental Procedures). Following several days of habituation to the delayed reward delivery, neural activity was recorded. We found that correct up cells continued to respond with the same latency to the auditory feedback sound even if the reward itself was delayed by 488 ms (Figure 3B). Next, we eliminated the feedback sound for these delayed reward trials and we saw a significant increase in the latency of the differential correct/error signal relative to the standard condition (Figure 3B). These findings suggest that the response latency of the correct up cells' signals is not controlled by the timing of reward delivery. Instead, correct up cells appear to be sensitive to information about trial outcome whether it's signaled by an auditory feedback signal or the delivery of reward. To determine if correct up cells differentiate between correct and error trials for other tasks, we examined the responses of these cells on the fixation only task. Unlike the differentiation observed during the object-place trials, the correct up cells tested in fixation trials (n = 12) did not discriminate between correctly executed fixation only trials and unrewarded break fixation trials (two-sample t test, p > 0.05). This suggests that the correct up cells signal correct/rewarded outcome more specifically during a learning context and do not convey general information about successful trial completion. Because our previous studies showed that a subset of hippocampal neurons could change their firing rate correlated with new associative learning (Wirth et al., 2003Wirth S. Yanike M. Frank L.M.

Single neurons in the monkey hippocampus and learning of new associations.Science. 2003; 300: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, Yanike et al., 2008Yanike M. Wirth S. Smith A.C. Brown E.N. Suzuki W.A. Comparison of associative learning-related signals in the macaque perirhinal cortex and hippocampus.Cereb. Cortex. 2008; (in press. Published online October 20, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhn156Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we next asked if the magnitude of the correct up signal might change over the course of the learning session. To address this question, we used a one-way ANOVA with time period (i.e., early middle and late periods of the session) as a main factor to examine the amplitude of the correct up signal over time. We analyzed the first 1000 ms following bar release and the second 1000 ms following bar release separately and found no difference in the amplitude of the correct up responses during either time bin over the course of the learning session. For the first 1000 ms, the average rate for each consecutive third of the session was 14.41 ± 3.26, 14.18 ± 3.06, and 14.90 ± 3.06 [F(2,87) = 0.01, p = 0.98]. For the second 1000 ms time bin following bar release, the average rate for each consecutive third of the session was 14.70 ± 2.87, 15.09 ± 2.79, and 15.85 ± 2.85 [F(2,87) = 0.04, p = 0.95]. Thus, the response of the correct up cells during the reward and ITI interval periods of correct trials remained stable over the course of learning. Error up cells (38/83 outcome-selective cells) increased their activity on error trials relative to correct trials in the 2000 ms following bar release for the object-place association task. To test the hypothesis that the error up cells signal the absence of a possible reward, we examined neural activity during correctly executed fixation only trials where reward was occasionally omitted (n = 13, omit reward trials). We hypothesized that if the error up cells provided a general signal of the absence of a possible reward, we should see an increase in activity following the omit trials similar to the increase we saw on the error trials. Consistent with this prediction, we found that the error up cells increased their activity on omit reward trials relative to rewarded fixation only trials (n = 13, t test, p < 0.05, Figure 4A). If the error up cells signal the absence of a possible reward, then we predicted that they might also be sensitive to manipulations of the timing of the reward delivery. To address this question, we examined the response of error up cells on trials in which we delayed the delivery of reward from 30 ms to 518 ms following bar release (no auditory feedback signal given; n = 19 error up cells; no trials were available with the auditory feedback together with delayed reward). Following habituation to the delayed reward signal, we recorded the activity of error up cells and found that delaying the reward resulted in a significant increase in the latency of the differential correct/error signal from the standard object-place trials with no delay in reward delivery (mean latency with no delay = 489 ± 63 ms, n = 19; mean latency with delay = 800 ± 66 ms, n = 19; two-sample t test, p < 0.05). Thus, errors up cells are sensitive to the latency of reward delivery and may use this information as a cue to signal the absence of a possible reward. To determine if error up cells differentiate between correct and error trials on other tasks, we compared activity during the object-place associative task to activity during the fixation only task. Unlike the correct up cells, the error up cells exhibited a similar response in both tasks, increasing their response following erroneous break fixation trials relative to correctly executed responses (t test, p < 0.05). The cells discriminated between break fixation trials and correctly completed trials 426 ± 86 ms after the end of the trial when reward was not delayed (n = 9, shown in Figure 4B) and 783 ± 81 ms (n = 13) after the end of the trial when reward was delayed (n = 13, data not shown). These findings support the idea that error up cells provide a general signal of the absence of a possible reward in multiple task situations. We also asked if the magnitude of the neural responses of the error up cells changed in a way that was similar to that of the correct up cells over the course of the session. To address this question, we used a one-way ANOVA with the time period as a main factor to compare the amplitude of the error up signal averaged over two or three time periods of the session (i.e., early, middle, and late for 29 sessions, and early and middle for 7 sessions in which there were no more error trials during the last third of the session) for the population data. We analyzed the first"
https://openalex.org/W1980139245,"Zinc is an essential nutritional factor involved in many key biological processes. However, the physiological function of zinc transporters at the organismal level is not well characterized. Early embryonic lethality of Znt1 knockout mice precludes functional analysis of the role of ZnT1 in dietary zinc absorption. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the Drosophila ZnT1 orthologue, dZnT1, for its role in Drosophila dietary zinc absorption. In cell culture, dZnT1 promoted zinc transport to reduce cytoplasmic zinc levels. Ubiquitous RNA interference of dZnT1 in Drosophila resulted in developmental arrest under restriction of dietary zinc, while dZnT1-overexpressing flies exhibited hypersensitivity to zinc. dZnT1 was prominently expressed in restricted regions of the midgut and exhibited a distribution on the basolateral membrane of the enterocytes. Gut-specific silencing of dZnT1 was sufficient to evoke lethality under zinc scarcity. Human ZnT1, but not ZnT7 or ZnT4, could rescue the zinc-acquiring defects caused by dZnT1 silencing. Taken together, our results proved that dZnT1 is a key zinc transporter in dietary zinc absorption, functioning by pumping zinc out of the enterocytes across the basolateral membrane. This study will be helpful in understanding the fundamental process of acquiring dietary zinc in higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2052987076,"GABAb receptor (GABAbR)-mediated suppression of glutamate release is critical for limiting glutamatergic transmission across the central nervous system (CNS). Here we show that, upon tetanic stimulation of afferents to lateral amygdala, presynaptic GABAbR-mediated inhibition only occurs in glutamatergic inputs to principle neurons (PNs), not to interneurons (INs), despite the presence of GABAbR in terminals to both types of neurons. The selectivity is caused by differential local GABA accumulation; it requires GABA reuptake and parallels distinct spatial distributions of presynaptic GABAbR in terminals to PNs and INs. Moreover, GABAbR-mediated suppression of theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) occurs only in the inputs to PNs, not to INs. Thus, target-cell-specific control of glutamate release by presynaptic GABAbR orchestrates the inhibitory dominance inside amygdala and might contribute to prevention of nonadaptive defensive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2047705948,"Gαs signalling, a pathway previously not recognized as having a role in stem-cell biology, has been found to be critical in haematopoiesis in the developing fetus (without it cells do not transition from the fetal liver to the bone marrow) and in adult mice (without it cells do not engraft the bone marrow). Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that lack Gαs (the guanine-nucleotide-binding protein stimulatory α subunit) differentiate and undergo chemotaxis, but are unable to home in on their usual sites of action. Cholera toxin, a compound known to constitutively activate Gαs, enhanced stem-cell homing and engraftment in mice, suggesting that similar strategies could be used to improve the efficiency in transplants of human blood-forming stem cells. Currently massive numbers of blood-forming stem cells are used in clinical transplantation, in part due to inefficient homing and engraftment. The guanine-nucleotide-binding protein stimulatory α subunit (Gαs) is necessary for the homing and engraftment of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to bone marrow, as demonstrated by its disruption in adult mice deficient in Gαs. Conversely, pharmacological activators of Gαs enhance homing and engraftment in vivo, suggesting a potential pharmacological target to improve transplantation efficiency. Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) change location during development1 and circulate in mammals throughout life2, moving into and out of the bloodstream to engage bone marrow niches in sequential steps of homing, engraftment and retention3,4,5. Here we show that HSPC engraftment of bone marrow in fetal development is dependent on the guanine-nucleotide-binding protein stimulatory α subunit (Gαs). HSPCs from adult mice deficient in Gαs (Gαs-/-) differentiate and undergo chemotaxis, but also do not home to or engraft in the bone marrow in adult mice and demonstrate a marked inability to engage the marrow microvasculature. If deleted after engraftment, Gαs deficiency did not lead to lack of retention in the marrow, rather cytokine-induced mobilization into the blood was impaired. Testing whether activation of Gαs affects HSPCs, pharmacological activators enhanced homing and engraftment in vivo. Gαs governs specific aspects of HSPC localization under physiological conditions in vivo and may be pharmacologically targeted to improve transplantation efficiency."

Enzymatically formed oxygenation products of C-20 and C-22 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), 4The abbreviations used are: LC-PUFA, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid; ARA, Na-MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt; ARA, cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid/arachidonic acid; EPA, cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA, cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid; 10,17-HDHA, 10,17-dihydroxy-4,7,11,13,15,19-docosahexaenoic acid; (17S)-HDHA, (17S)-hydroxy-4,7,10,13,15,19-docosahexaenoic acid; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; 17-HDPAn-6, 17-hydroxy-4,7,10,13,15-docosapentaenoic acid; 10,17-HDPAn-6, 10,17-dihydroxy-4,7,11,13,15-docosapentaenoic acid; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; VCD, vibrational circular dichroism; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ANOVA, analysis of variance. have important biological roles in inflammation, allergies, and blood clotting and are thus believed to have therapeutic potential in several chronic immune diseases (1Serhan C.N.

Proinflammatory oxylipins, such as leukotrienes and some prostaglandins, are derived from ARA, an ω-6 fatty acid. Interestingly, the same fatty acid also serves as a precursor to anti-inflammatory or proresolution molecules like lipoxins (13Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar, 14Serhan C.N. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68: 433-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Stable analogues of lipoxins are being developed as drugs for asthma and other inflammatory airway diseases (15Guilford W.J. Parkinson J.F. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent.

Oxylipins derived from ω-3 fatty acids, such as DHA and EPA, known as resolvins, are primarily anti-inflammatory in nature (17Serhan C.N. Anesthesiol. Clin. 2006; 24: 341-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). EPA acts as a precursor to the E-series resolvins that have shown potential in the treatment of colitis, arthritis, and periodontitis (18Arita M. Yoshida M. Hong S. Tjonahen E. Glickman J.N.

The resolvins of the D-series derived from DHA are useful as neuroprotective agents. 10,17-Dihydroxy-4,7,11,13,15,19-docosahexaenoic acid (10,17-HDHA) or neuroprotectin D1 is a resolvin that is formed endogenously in the human brain and eye and is believed to exert its protective effect against cell injury-induced oxidative stress (21Hong S.

A. 2004; 101: 8491-8496Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The main enzymes responsible for the production of these oxygenated LC-PUFA products are primarily lipoxygenases and, in addition, cyclo-oxygenases and cytochromes P450. These enzymes produce oxylipins via transcellular activity, often involving multiple cell types (24Phillis J.W. Horrocks L.A. Farooqui A.A. Brain Res. Rev. 2006; 52: 201-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This activity mainly results in mono-, di-, and tri-hydroxylation products of fatty acids that have varying potencies, depending on the exact structure of the compound. Lipoxygenases are non-heme, iron-containing dioxygenases that catalyze the regioselective and enantioselective oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids containing one or more cis,cis-1,4-pentadienoic moieties to give the corresponding hydroperoxy derivatives (25Gardner H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 26Piazza G.J. Lipoxygenase & Lipoxygenase Pathway Enzymes.AOCS Press, Champaign, IL. 1996; : 1-2Google Scholar). We thus considered that, in addition to DHA and EPA, other C-22 PUFAs containing such methylene interrupted double bonds may also be substrates for lipoxygenases and that resulting products may have anti-inflammatory activity similar to DHA-derived resolvins. DPAn-6 (cis-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acid) is present in algal oils, and recent studies have demonstrated that this fatty acid has anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and, in conjunction with DHA, also has anti-inflammatory activity in vivo. 5J. M. Nauroth, Y. C. Liu, M. Van Elswyk, R. Bell, E. Bailey-Hall, G. Chung, and L. M., Arterburn, manuscript in preparation. Preliminary work pertaining to this publication has been presented at the 94th Annual Meeting of the American Association of Immunologists, 2007 (abstract available in Journal of Immunology, 2007, 178, 101.5). Also, it has been suggested that a combination of DHA and DPAn-6 could be a beneficial natural therapy in neuroinflammatory conditions like Alzheimer disease. Specifically, in a 3×Tg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer disease, DPAn-6 was shown to reduce levels of early stage phospho-Tau epitopes, which in turn correlated with a reduction in phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase, a putative Tau kinase (27Green K.N. Martinez-Coria H. Khashwji H. Hall E.B. Yurko-Mauro K.A. Ellis L. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4385-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of action of DPAn-6 in these inflammatory milieus is not known, it suggests a possible role for oxylipin products of DPAn-6 in resolution of inflammation. Also, another LC-PUFA, DPAn-3 (cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid) usually present along with DHA and EPA in marine oils is known to be a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation (28Akiba S. Murata T. Kitatani K. Sato T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2000; 23: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Murphy M.G. Wright V. Scott J. Timmins A. Ackman R.G. Lipids. 1999; 34: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Murphy M.G. Wright V. Ackman R.G. Horackova M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 177: 257-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, this LC-PUFA has a potent inhibitory effect on angiogenesis through the suppression of VEGFR-2 (vascular endothelial-cell growth factor receptor 2) expression. Angiogenesis is known to contribute to tumor growth, inflammation, and microangiopathy, again pointing to the possibility that anti-inflammatory activity of DPAn-3 might be mediated through resolvin-like products as in the case of DHA and EPA (31Tsuji M. Murota S.I. Morita I. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2003; 68: 337-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The purpose of this research was to determine whether oxylipins are formed from the C-22 LC-PUFAs, DPAn-6 and DPAn-3, by lipoxygenase activity; to compare them to products formed from DHA; to chemically characterize products; to purify key oxylipin products from the DPAn-6/15-lipoxygenase reaction; and to test whether these compounds have resolvin-like anti-inflammatory activity. This research also sets the stage for preparation and isolation of a wide range of other C-22 oxylipins that could be evaluated as potential anti-inflammatory compounds. Materials—5-lipoxygenase from potato, 12-lipoxygenase from porcine leukocytes, and (17S)-hydroxy-4,7,10,13,15,19-docosahexaenoic acid ((17S)-HDHA) were from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) was from Peprotech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). All fatty acids were from Nu-Chek Prep (Elysian, MN). Filtration units were from Nalgene (Rochester, NY). Acrodisc syringe filters were from Pall Life Sciences (Ann Arbor, MI). All Luna high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) columns were from Phenomenex (Torrance CA), Chiralpak-IA was from Chiral Technologies (West Chester, PA), Chirobiotic-T was from Astec (Whippany, NJ), and all HPLC solvents were from Fisher. All other reagents and materials were from Sigma, whereas animals were from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Reaction of DHA, DPAn-3, and DPAn-6 with 15-Lipoxygenase for Comparison of Efficiency of Conversion—Soybean 15-lipoxygenase (Type 1-B) at a final concentration of 524 units/ml was mixed into 100 μm solutions of DHA, DPAn-6, or DPAn-3 fatty acids in 0.05 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 0 °C. The appearance of the monohydroxy-conjugated diene derivatives of the fatty acids was monitored through absorbance at 237 nm. Conjugated diene products were quantified by UV spectrophotometry using an extinction coefficient of 28,000/m·cm (32Shimizu T. Honda Z. Miki I. Seyama Y. Izumi T. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Enzyme Kinetics Measurements of 15-Lipoxygenase with DHA, DPAn-3, and DPAn-6—Type 1-B soybean lipoxygenase (39.8 units/ml) was used to dioxygenate substrates (DPAn-6, DPAn-3, and DHA at 5–100 μm) at 22 °C in oxygen-saturated 0.05 m sodium borate buffer (pH 9.0) with 4.52 × 10–3% (v/v) Tween 20. Final oxygen concentrations exceeded 750 mm, measured using a Clark type oxygen electrode. The probe was calibrated by bubbling air and directly measuring the concentration with immobilized fluorescent ruthenium (OxySense 200T; OxySense, Dallas, TX). Approximately 38 s after the enzyme addition, the hydroperoxide product formation was monitored via UV absorbance at 236 nm (as described above) at 15-s intervals for 600 s (DU800 spectrophotometer; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The read average time was 0.2 s. All experiments were repeated in triplicate. Product formation curves were smoothed with a negative exponential transform sampling all of the data with a power of 10 calculating intervals every second. Product formation curves showed an initial lag period followed by a maximum in rate (rmax). Although this is not the classical V0max, previous authors have shown that it satisfies the steady-state assumption for application of the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model (33Schilstra M.J. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F. Lipids. 1994; 29: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Berry H. Debat H. Larreta-Garde V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This model, r = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]), was used to elucidate the kinetic parameters. SigmaPlot 11.0 with the Enzyme Kinetic Module 1.3 (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA) was used to perform the least squares fit of the aforementioned model. Reaction of DHA, DPAn-3, and DPAn-6 with 5-, 12-, and 15-Lipoxygenase for Identification of Reaction Products—For the 5-lipoxygenase reaction, 200 μl of 10 units/μl potato 5-lipoxygenase was added to a 10-ml reaction mixture containing 100 μm fatty acid in 0.05 m Na-MES buffer, pH 6.3, 100 μm SDS, and 0.02% decaethylene glycol monododecyl ether. For the 12-lipoxygenase reaction, 100 μl of 0.75 units/μl porcine leukocyte-derived 12-lipoxygenase was added to a 10-ml solution containing 100 μm fatty acid in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.03% Tween 20. For the 15-lipoxygenase reaction, 100 μl of 131 kilounits/ml soybean 15-lipoxygenase (Type 1-B) was added to a 10-ml reaction mixture containing 100 μm fatty acids in 0.05 m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0. Control reactions were run for all three enzymes under identical conditions without adding any enzyme. All reaction mixtures were stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. Reaction products were reduced with sodium borohydride and acidified with glacial acetic before extraction on solid phase DSC-18 cartridges. Final elutions were done using anhydrous ethanol and reaction products analyzed by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry). The reaction of 15-lipoxygenase with DPAn-6 described above was scaled-up for the production of 17-hydroxy-4,7,10,13,15-docosapentaenoic acid (17-HDPAn-6) and 10,17-dihydroxy-4,7,11,13,15-docosapentaenoic acid (10,17-HDPAn-6) from 1 g of DPAn-6. Purification of 17-HDPAn-6 and 10,17-HDPAn-6—All purifications were carried out at a flow rate of 47 ml/min at room temperature on a Luna C18 (2Serhan C.N. Clish C.B. Brannon J. Colgan S.P. Chiang N. Gronert K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), 10 μm, 100 Å, 50 × 250-mm column, set up on an Agilent 1200 preparatory HPLC unit, equipped with a diode array detector. The purification method involved elution with a mixture of solvents A and B. Solvent A consisted of 70% water, 30% methanol, and 0.2% ammonium acetate, and solvent B consisted of 100% acetonitrile. The method used for elution of compounds was 48% B at 0 min, 48% B at 25 min, 90% B at 35 min, 90% B at 50 min, 48% B at 52 min, and 48% B at 65 min. Chromatograms were monitored simultaneously at 236 and 270 nm, and fractions corresponding to peaks of interest were collected and pooled from several runs. Purity of fractions was monitored by UV spectrophotometery as well as by LC-MS. Fractions were concentrated using a rotary evaporator, and compounds were extracted with ether. Ether extracts were concentrated and treated with anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove any traces of water. This solution was then filtered using Acrodisc syringe filters (Bulk Acrodisc CR 13 mm with 0.2 μm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, HPLC-certified). Purity was ascertained by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS. UV Spectrophotometry—UV spectrophotometry was carried out on either an Agilent 8453 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) or a Cary 4000 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) or a DU800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). Extinction coefficients of 17-HDPAn-6 and 10,17-diHDPAn-6 were determined in ethanol. LC-MS and LC-MS/MS—All routine reaction and purity analysis was done on a Hewlett Packard model 1100 liquid chromatography instrument interfaced with an electrospray ionization mass elective detector. Tandem MS/MS analysis of the products of the reactions of fatty acids and different lipoxygenases was performed on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC instrument (San Paulo, CA) interfaced with an Esquire 3000 ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) or on an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC instrument interfaced with an Agilent LC/MSD Trap XCT Plus (San Paulo, CA). Mass spectrometers were operated in negative ion detection mode. Nitrogen was used as nebulizing and drying gas with nebulizer pressure at 20 p.s.i. and drying gas flow rate of 7 liters/min. The interface temperature was maintained at 330 °C. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a LUNA C18(2) column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, 100 Å) using the same mobile phase described for purification of the compounds under similar conditions at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. NMR Experiments—All NMR experiments were conducted by NMRServices (Rochester, NY). 25–50 mg of 17-HDPAn-6 or 10,17-HDPAn-6 was dissolved in CDCl3 and used for NMR data acquisition. All NMR data were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker model Avance spectrometer operating at a 500-MHz proton NMR frequency. One-dimensional 1H, one-dimensional 13C(1H-decoupled), two-dimensional 1H-1H (correlation spectroscopy), two-dimensional 1H-1H DQFCOSY (double-quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy), two-dimensional 1H-13C-HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence), and two-dimensional 1H-13C-HMBC (heterononuclear multiple bond-correlation) NMR data were acquired for 17 HDPAn-6. One-dimensional 1H, one-dimensional 13C (1H-decoupled), and two-dimensional 1H-1H COSY were acquired for 10,17-HDPAn-6. All data were processed using Bruker software, and NMR spectra predictions were done using ChemDraw Ultra 10.0 and ACDlabs software. Chirality—17-HDHA was prepared the same way as 17-HDPAn-6 except that DHA was used as a substrate. Either 17-HDHA or 17-HDPAn-6 was converted to 17-oxo-derivatives by dissolving 15 mg of each compound in anhydrous dichloromethane and then oxidizing the compounds at 0 °C with 15 mg of Dess-Martin's reagent. The 17-oxo-derivatives were then reduced using sodium borohydride to give the corresponding racemic mixtures. The racemic mixtures were then separated on a Chiralpak-IA column using methanol/water (80:20) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min at 25 °C. The peaks were assigned as R or S by using (17S)-HDHA as a reference standard. The same protocol was followed for 17-HDPAn-6, and the order of elution of the two isomers was assumed to be the same as for 17-HDHA isomers. The Chirobiotic-T column was tested with supplier-recommended mobile phases. Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) studies were carried out by Biotools Inc. (Syracuse, NY) for 17-HDPAn-6. Log DpH 7.4 and Solubility—Log DpH 7.4 and solubility studies were conducted by Cerep (Seattle, WA). All predictions of various physicochemical parameters were made using ACDLabs software. Log P was calculated based on the formula, log P = log D + (pH – pKa) (35Sangster J. Octanol-Water Partition Coefficients: Fundamentals and Physical Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) Aqueous solubility (μm) was determined by comparing the peak area of the principal peak in a calibration standard (200 μm) containing organic solvent (methanol/water, 60/40, v/v) with the peak area of the corresponding peak in a buffer sample. Reference compounds used for comparing solubility were diethylstilbestrol, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoprolol tartrate, phenytoin, rifampicin, simvastatin, and tamoxifen. Log DpH 7.4 was determined by the shake flask method using octanol and PBS, pH 7.4 (35Sangster J. Octanol-Water Partition Coefficients: Fundamentals and Physical Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). The total amount of compound was determined as the peak area of the principal peak in a calibration standard (100 μm) containing organic solvent (methanol/water, 60/40, v/v). The amount of compound in the buffer was determined as the combined, volume-corrected, and weighted areas of the corresponding peaks in the aqueous phases of three organic aqueous samples of different composition. An automated weighting system was used to ensure the preferred use of raw data from those samples with well quantifiable peak signals. The amount of the compound in the organic phase was calculated by subtraction. Subsequently, log D was calculated as log10 of the amount of compound in the organic phase divided by the amount of compound in the aqueous phase. Chemical Stability Studies—17-HDPAn-6 and 10,17-HDPAn-6 were incubated at a concentration of 10 μm in both PBS and ethanol at 4 °C for 14 days and at 22 °C for 24 h and at 37 °C for 2 h, and peak heights were monitored by LC-MS/MS. For the 14-day stability studies, samples were analyzed at 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 days. Samples were analyzed at 0 and 24 h for the 22 °C study and at 0 and 2 h for the 37 °C study. Animal Studies—All animal studies were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the National Institutes of Health and/or the Final Rules of the Animal Welfare Act Regulation (9CFR). Mouse Air Pouch Study—To generate the dorsal air pouches, 6–8-week-old female C57Bl/6N mice were anesthetized, and 6 ml of sterile air was injected subcutaneously in the back (36Edwards J.C. Sedgwick A.D. Willoughby D.A. J. Pathol. 1981; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Pouches were reinflated with 3 ml of sterile air 3 days later. Six days after initial pouch formation, 100 ng of the DPAn-6 oxylipin test compounds or (17S)-HDHA were administered to 10 animals per group in 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.4 (∼0.005 mg/kg) by intrapouch injection. Within 5 min of compound administration, 100 ng of TNFα in 0.1 ml of PBS was injected into the pouches to initiate an inflammatory response. Indomethacin was administered intraperitoneally at 2 mg/kg 30 min prior to the TNFα challenge as a positive control. Four h after the TNFα challenge, pouch exudates were harvested, and leukocytes in the exudates were counted. A sampling of exudate cells from each animal was centrifuged onto microscope slides, and the cells were airdried and Geimsa-stained to quantify granulocyte and mononuclear leukocytes. Rat Hind Paw Edema Studies—Hind paw edema studies were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (170–200 g, 6–8 animals/group) using cross-linked λ carrageenan as the inflammatory stimulus (37Winter C.A. Risley E.A. Nuss G.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 111: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (6260) Google Scholar). Researchers were masked to the treatment groups in all hind paw studies. The first experiment involved administering DPAn-6-derived resolvins either intravenously (5 μg/animal, ∼0.025 mg/kg) in the tail vein in 0.1 ml of PBS 2 min prior to carrageenan challenge or per os (by oral gavage) in up to 4 ml of PBS (25 μg/animal, ∼0.125 mg/kg) 30 min prior to carrageenan challenge. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to challenge) and biogenically synthesized (17S)-HDHA (5 μg/animal administered intravenously 2 min prior to challenge) served as positive and DHA resolvin controls, respectively, in this experiment. Rats were injected with 0.1 ml of 10 mg/ml carrageenan solution (prepared in water at least 2 weeks in advance of the experiment) in the subplantar region of the right hind paw. Paw volumes were measured by water volume displacement at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h post-carrageenan challenge. The second experiment involved evaluating oral dose-response behavior of the two DPAn-6 resolvins. All compounds, including the controls, were administered by oral gavage (4 ml/animal) 30 min prior to the carrageenan challenge. The two DPAn-6 oxylipins were diluted in PBS, pH 7.4, and dosed at 2.5, 25, and 250 μg/animal (∼0.0125, 0.125, and 1.25 mg/kg body weight), and the biogenically synthesized resolvin control 17-HDHA was given at a single dose of 25 μg/animal (0.125 mg/kg). Indomethacin was administered at 6 mg/animal (30 mg/kg). Carrageenan was administered as in the first rat hind paw experiment. Paw edema volume was measured 2, 4, and 6 h after the carrageenan challenge. Paw edema volume was calculated by subtracting right paw volume just prior to carrageenan injection from the post-carrageenan-treated volume of the same paw. Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses for animal studies were conducted in GraphPad Prism version 4 (San Diego, CA) using Student's t tests or ANOVA with Dunnett's post test to compare treatment groups with control. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Substrate Comparison with 15-Lipoxygenase—Fig. 1 shows percentage conversion of DHA, DPAn-3, and DPAn-6 upon treatment with soybean lipoxygenase at 0 °C. As can be seen, under these conditions, 100% of DPAn-6 was efficiently converted to its conjugated diene derivative, whereas about 85% of DPAn-3 and 50% of DHA were converted to their respective conjugated diene derivatives by 15-lipoxygenase. These results were also corroborated by LC/MS peak analysis, which showed that under these conditions, a single product with a conjugated diene was formed, and this corresponded to the 17-hydroperoxy derivative in all three cases. In addition, we also assessed enzyme kinetics parameters of the three substrates with 15-lipoxygenase at 22 °C. Fig. 2 shows the enzyme kinetics data with curve fits, and Table 1 shows the kinetic parameters. Over the substrate concentrations analyzed, the kinetic behavior was Michaeli"
https://openalex.org/W1967814283,"Tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and promotes intraperitoneal metastasis. How TG2 facilitates the spread of EOC is unknown. Here, we show that TG2 regulates the expression and function of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), a critical mediator of tissue invasiveness. TG2 knockdown down-regulates MMP-2 protein and mRNA expression in SKOV3, IGROV-1, MDA-MB-436, and PC-3 cancer cells. TG2 knockdown or inhibition of TG2 activity using KCC009 decreases MMP-2 gelatinase activity in cancer cells. MMP-2 expression and function are regulated by TG2 at transcriptional level, as demonstrated by quantitative PCR and reporter assays. We used bioinformatics and chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify a CREB binding site in the MMP-2 promoter. Binding of CREB to the MMP-2 promoter was diminished in cells that expressed decreased TG2 levels. TG2 knockdown decreased CREB phosphorylation, and CREB knockdown decreased MMP-2 expression. The effect of TG2 on CREB activity and MMP-2 transcription is mediated by TG2-dependent degradation of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A-alpha). We show that PP2A-alpha complexes with and is targeted for degradation by TG2. In addition to their related in vitro expression levels, TG2 and MMP-2 expression were significantly correlated in vivo, as shown by concordant immunostaining in peritoneal xenografts and in human ovarian tumors. The capacity of TG2 to regulate MMP-2 expression in vitro and in vivo identifies a mechanism that may facilitate tissue invasion and the spread of EOC. The demonstration that TG2 induced degradation of PP2A-alpha activates CREB, and thereby increases MMP-2 transcription, provides novel mechanistic insight into the pro- metastatic function of TG2."
https://openalex.org/W1978021679,"p38 MAPKs are typically activated by upstream MAPK kinases that phosphorylate a Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop. An exception is the T cell antigen receptor signaling pathway, which bypasses the MAPK cascade and activates p38α and p38β by phosphorylation of Tyr-323 and subsequent autophosphorylation of the activation loop. Here we show that, unlike the classic MAPK cascade, the alternative pathway results primarily in mono-phosphorylation of the activation loop residue Thr-180. Recombinant mono-phosphorylated and dual phosphorylated p38α differed widely with regard to activity and substrate preference. Altered substrate specificity was reproduced in T cells in which p38 was activated by the alternative or classical MAPK pathways. These findings suggest that T cells have evolved a mechanism to utilize p38 in a specialized manner independent of and distinct from the classical p38 MAPK signaling cascade. p38 MAPKs are typically activated by upstream MAPK kinases that phosphorylate a Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop.

Of the three major MAPK families, the ERKs play a part in mitogenic signal propagation, whereas the JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) and p38 isoforms participate in responses to pro-inflammatory cytokines and stress. MAPK activity is closely coupled to changes in gene expression, consistent with the fact that their targets include numerous transcription factors and kinases that themselves regulate transcription factors. Aberrant p38 activity has been implicated in inflammation and cancer, for which p38 inhibitors are being explored as therapeutic agents (3.Engelberg D. Semin.

MAPK are activated by a three-tiered kinase signaling cascade. At the most membrane-proximal level are the MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKK), serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate and activate the second level, the MAPK kinases (MAPKK). MAPKK are dual specificity kinases that phosphorylate a MAPK Thr-X-Tyr motif (X being glycine for p38 family members) located on the flexible activation loop that borders the catalytic site and regulates access to substrate. The p38 MAPK family has four members as follows: α, β, γ, and δ. p38γ expression is limited primarily to skeletal muscle (5.Li Z. Jiang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), whereas the others are more widely distributed. p38α is the major isoform in T cells, which also express lesser amounts of p38 β and δ (6.Hale K.K. Trollinger D. Rihanek M. Manthey C.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4246-4252PubMed Google Scholar). p38α and -β are the most closely related by amino acid sequence (74% homology), are subject to inhibition by the widely used inhibitor SB203580, and share a tripeptide motif, Pro-Tyr-Asp, involved in the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-initiated alternative activation pathway (7.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). TCRs recognize peptide antigen presented by major histocompatibility molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Although it had generally been assumed that TCR-induced p38 activation utilized the canonical MAPK cascade (8.Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we found that this is not the case (7.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Rather, stimulation via the TCR results in Lck-dependent activation of ZAP70, which in turn phosphorylates p38α and -β on Tyr-323. Phosphorylation of Tyr-323 leads to p38α and p38β autophosphorylation on the activation loop and increased activity toward third party substrates. Recent evidence suggests that the scaffold protein Dlgh1 bridges Lck/ZAP70 and p38, and in its absence Tyr-323 is not phosphorylated, and p38 is not activated in response to TCR signaling (9.Round J.L. Humphries L.A. Tomassian T. Mittelstadt P. Zhang M. Miceli M.C. Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the fact that B cells express the ZAP70 relative Syk, the alternative pathway does not appear to exist in antigen receptor-stimulated B cells (7.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 10.Jirmanova L. Sarma D.N. Jankovic D. Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Blood. 2008; PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the alternative pathway has been demonstrated in mice lacking Gadd45α, in which the alternative pathway is constitutively active, resulting in spontaneous T cell p38 activity and autoimmunity (11.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Belova G.I. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). More recently, we have found that p38α cannot be activated by TCR signaling in primary T cells from gene-targeted mice in which Tyr-323 has been replaced with Phe (10.Jirmanova L. Sarma D.N. Jankovic D. Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Blood. 2008; PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing question is why T cells acquired a seemingly unique mechanism for p38 activation rather than utilizing the common signaling cascade. Here we find that the two activation pathways are qualitatively different, because unlike MAPKKs, p38α predominantly autophosphorylates a single residue in the activation loop, Thr-180, resulting in altered substrate selectivity. Primary T cells were purified from lymph nodes and spleens of 6–8-week-old C57/BL6 mice using negatively selecting T cell purification columns (CL101) from CedarLane. T cells and the Jurkat T lymphoma (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μm gentamicin. Antibodies against p38 (9217), phospho-p38 (9211), and phospho-Thr-71-ATF-2 (9221) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-CD3 (clone 2C11) was from Pharmingen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Tyr-182-p38 were generated as described (7.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Jurkat TCR clonotype-specific antibodies were obtained from the supernatants of the hybridoma C305 (from ATCC) grown to high density (<106 cells/ml) in complete medium. PMA was purchased from Sigma and SB203508 from Calbiochem. p38α and other proteins were expressed in the bacterial strain BL21(DE3) using the vectors pGEX-4T-2 or pET15b. Point mutations for p38α (K53M, Y323F, T180A, and Y182F) and ATF2 (aa 1–109; T69A and T71A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene).

After cultures reached an A600 of 0.5–1.0, protein expression was induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. His-p38α, His-MKK6 (S207E/T211E), and GST-ATF2 were incubated for a further 3 h at 25 °C and GST-MAPKAP kinase 2, GST-MEF2A, GST-STAT4, GST-Bcl-2, and GST-Bcl-XL for 12 h at 15 °C. Cells were resuspended in PBS (including 0.5 m NaCl if His-tagged), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sonicated, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. His-tagged proteins were purified with cobalt-charged chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 0.3 m imidazole (in PBS with 0.5 m NaCl). GST-tagged proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 20 mm glutathione. Proteins were concentrated and washed into PBS using Microcon YM-30 spin columns (Millipore). Substrate proteins (3–10 μg) were prewarmed at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4) with 1–5 μCi [32P]ATP and the indicated amounts of ATP. Reactions were initiated by addition of 100 ng of semisynthesized p38α or MKK6-activated p38, as indicated. At the indicated times aliquots were removed and mixed with sample buffer. Phosphorylated products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized with a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). To permit native chemical ligation, the natural histidine of the N-terminal residue of the synthetic peptide (aa 310–360) was mutated to cysteine. This mutation had no effect on the spontaneous activity of bacterially expressed full-length p38 (data not shown). Residues 1–309 of mouse p38α were cloned into the vector pTYB1 (New England Biolabs) using the NdeI and SapI restriction sites. To overcome insolubility, the resulting fusion protein of p38α (aa 1–309) with the VMA1 intein and the chitin-binding domain was grown in BL21(DE3) cells harboring the plasmid pREP4-GROEL/S, which encodes the chaperone complex GROEL/S. Cultures grown in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin to an A600 of 0.6 were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 15 h at 12 °C, and proteins were extracted by sonication in binding buffer (PBS, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). Fusion proteins were immobilized on chitin beads, and p38α (aa 1–309) having a C-terminal thioester was released by overnight treatment at room temperature with 0.2 m mercaptoethanesulfonate. After elution with mercaptoethanesulfonate/binding buffer and concentrating to ∼10 mg/ml with YM-30 columns, p38α (aa 1–309) was ligated to a 5-fold excess of the N-terminal cysteine of the C-terminal (aa 310–360) peptides with Tyr-323 either unphosphorylated or fully phosphorylated. The ligation reaction mixtures were washed with YM-30 columns into PBS before use in in vitro kinase reactions. Following incubation overnight in complete medium supplemented with HL-1 (Lonza), T cells were stimulated through the TCR by transferring to wells coated with 5 μg/ml anti-CD3 in PBS. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were normalized to protein concentration, denatured in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) or with fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies and the Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor). Upstream MAPKKs activate p38α by phosphorylating the activation loop residues Thr-180 and Tyr-182 (16.Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers G.T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed p38α becomes activated when phosphorylated in vitro on Tyr-323 (7.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, p38α acquires a variable degree of activation loop phosphorylation during growth in bacteria (7.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) 3P. R. Mittelstadt and J. D. Ashwell, unpublished results. due to autophosphorylation, because a kinase-inactive (K53M substitution) mutant of p38α lacks any detectable activation loop phosphorylation or kinase activity (data not shown). To determine whether Tyr-323 phosphorylation in the absence of prior Thr-180/Tyr-182 phosphorylation is sufficient to up-regulate kinase activity, we prepared synthetic p38α phosphorylated on only one site, Tyr-323 (Tyr(P)-323), using protein semisynthesis (17.Muir T.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 249-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Recombinant p38α residues 1–309 were ligated to synthesized C-terminal (310–360) fragments, creating full-length p38α with Tyr-323 either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated. The effect of Tyr-323 phosphorylation on p38α activity was assessed with an in vitro kinase assay using the physiological substrate ATF2. Whereas semisynthesized unphosphorylated p38α Tyr-323 was inactive, the introduction of a phosphorylated Tyr-323 resulted in an active kinase that phosphorylated ATF2 (Fig. 1, left). Importantly, both semisynthesized molecules were successfully refolded and capable of kinase activity, because after incubation with MKK6, which phosphorylates Thr-180/Tyr-182 in the activation loop, they phosphorylated ATF2 equally well (Fig. 1, right). Thus, Tyr-323 phosphorylation in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation is sufficient to activate p38. The site of p38α autophosphorylation by the TCR-mediated alternative pathway was previously mapped to the activation loop using an antiserum thought to recognize dual phosphorylated p38 (7.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, the report that a similar antibody against the phosphorylated activation loop could also recognize mono-phosphorylated Thr-180 (18.Diskin R. Lebendiker M. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) prompted us to revisit the question of what residues were involved in p38α autophosphorylation. We developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a peptide containing the mouse p38α activation loop in which only Tyr-182 was phosphorylated (anti-Tyr(P)-182). A dot blot of peptides comprising p38α residues 176–186 with Thr-180 and Tyr-182 unphosphorylated, phosphorylated singly (Thr(P) or Tyr(P)), or phosphorylated together (Thr(P)/Tyr(P)) was immunoblotted with the putative dual phosphorylation-specific antibody previously used to evaluate p38 phosphorylation in T cells (9211) (7.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) or anti-P-Tyr-182. 9211 recognized Thr(P)-180 with or without concomitant Tyr(P)-182 (Fig. 2A) but had little activity toward Tyr(P)-182. Anti-Tyr(P)-182 recognized Tyr(P)-182 but not Thr(P)-180. The specificity of these antibodies for the phosphorylated native protein was determined by immunoblotting kinase-inactive p38α that contained mutations of one or both phosphoacceptor sites and that had been phosphorylated by MKK6. Once again, 9211 recognized primarily p38α mono-phosphorylated on Thr-180 (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the 9211 antibody is hereafter referred to as anti-Thr(P)-180. TCR-induced p38α autophosphorylation follows phosphorylation of the nonactivation loop residue Tyr-323 (7.Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Ashwell J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We observed that p38α expressed in Escherichia coli grown at 37 °C is phosphorylated on both Tyr-323 and the activation loop because of autophosphorylation, because these residues are not phosphorylated on the kinase-inactive p38α mutant (data not shown). Mutation of Tyr-323 to Phe also abolished activation loop autophosphorylation and activation of p38α in bacteria (data not shown), indicating that autophosphorylation requires phosphorylation of Tyr-323. This suggested that E. coli-expressed p38α can serve as a model for p38α activated by the alternative pathway. We asked if active p38α can phosphorylate kinase-inactive p38α and if so on which site(s). GST-tagged kinase-inactive p38α was offered as a substrate for active p38α in an in vitro kinase (IVK) assay. After incubation with active p38α, GST-p38α was recognized by anti-Thr(P)-180 but not anti-Tyr(P)-18 (Fig. 3). Thus, p38α can phosphorylate itself in trans, which is perhaps the mechanism of its autophosphorylation in TCR-activated T cells, on the activation loop residue Thr-180 but not Tyr-182. To determine whether the recombinant p38α reflects the behavior of the endogenous protein when activated in cells, we examined the phosphorylation status of p38 in TCR-stimulated T cells. Anti-Thr(P)-180 detected Thr-180 phosphorylation in cells stimulated through the TCR (the alternative pathway) or with PMA (which initiates the MAPK cascade) (Fig. 4). In contrast, anti-Tyr(P)-182 gave a strong signal with p38α from T cells stimulated with PMA but only a faint signal with TCR-stimulated cells. Therefore, unlike the MAPK cascade, TCR-triggered alternative p38 activation causes primarily mono-phosphorylation of Thr-180. Dual phosphorylated p38 is the only form of the activated enzyme that has thus far been implicated in cellular events. That TCR signaling causes p38α mono-phosphorylation raises the possibility that the enzyme functions differently in cells stimulated via the TCR compared with stimuli that set off the MAPK cascade. As a first approach, we asked if dual and mono-phosphorylated p38α differ in their ability to phosphorylate known p38α substrates. Dual and mono-phosphorylated p38α were generated by phosphorylating recombinant wild type and Y182F p38α with MKK6. To exclude potential confounding effects of Tyr-323 phosphorylation, Tyr-323 in both proteins was replaced with Phe. MKK6 phosphorylated both proteins on Thr-180 to yield mono- and dual phosphorylated p38α (Fig. 5A) that were then tested in an IVK assay with the substrate GST-ATF2-(1–109) (19.Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). ATF2 contains two p38 target residues, Thr-69 and Thr-71 (20.Fuchs S.Y. Tappin I. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12560-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thr-69 and Thr-71 are equivalent targets for p38α, but initial phosphorylation of Thr-71 favors the subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-69 to yield the doubly phosphorylated substrate (21.Waas W.F. Lo H.H. Dalby K.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5676-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the mono-phosphorylated p38α was somewhat less efficient that the dual phosphorylated form, both generated phospho-ATF2 that resolved as two bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5B, top row). Interestingly, whereas dual phosphorylated p38α generated predominantly the slower migrating ATF2 band over time, mono-phosphorylated p38α reproducibly yielded similar amounts of the slower and faster migrating species. Quantitation of incorporated 32P in the experiment shown, for example, revealed that the upper to lower band ratio was ∼1:1 at all time points using mono-phosphorylated p38α but increased from 1:1 at 3 min to 5:1 at 30 min using dual phosphorylated p38α. To identify the different ATF2 species, we mutated the known sites of phosphorylation and determined how these proteins migrated when phosphorylated by dual phosphorylated p38α (Fig. 5C). The upper band was not found in any of the mutants, demonstrating that it represents dual phosphorylation of Thr-69 and Thr-71. Phosphorylation of Thr-69 alone (Fig. 5C, lane 3) yielded the faster migrating species, and phosphorylation of Thr-71 alone (Fig. 5C, lane 2) resulted in a band with intermediate migration. Thus, three phosphorylated ATF2 species can be resolved; the lower band is phospho-Thr-69, and the upper is doubly phosphorylated ATF2, and the intermediate band (a transient species that cannot be distinguished in phosphorylated wild type ATF2, Fig. 5C, lane 1) is phospho-Thr-71. We therefore conclude that whereas both forms of p38α can phosphorylate ATF2, the mono- and dual phosphorylated p38α differ in their fine specificity, the latter being better able to convert mono-phosphorylated ATF2 to the doubly phosphorylated and slower migrating species. We compared the activity of mono- and dual phosphorylated p38α on other p38α substrates (Fig. 5B). MAPKAP kinase 2 (2.Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

An even greater dichotomy was observed with the substrate STAT4 (Fig. 5B) (25.Morinobu A. Gadina M. Strober W. Visconti R. Fornace A. Montagna C. Feldman G.M. Nishikomori R. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl.

Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were also examined, because it has been suggested that their phosphorylation by p38 can disable their anti-apoptotic function (14.Farley N. Pedraza-Alva G. Serrano-Gomez D.

Bcl-XL was a very poor substrate for mono-phosphorylated p38α, and Bcl-2 was not phosphorylated at all. Thus, the activity of mono-phosphorylated compared with dual phosphorylated p38α was very substrate-dependent, being almost equivalent for ATF2 (although with a difference in fine specificity) and being virtually nil for STAT4 and Bcl-2. The question of whether the altered substrate specificity of recombinant mono-phosphorylated p38 is reflected in vivo was addressed by examining the phosphorylation of several substrates in TCR-activated cells. Lysates of primary mouse T cells activated with either anti-CD3 (the alternative pathway) or with PMA (the MAPK cascade) were immunoblotted with the antibodies that recognize the p38 phosphorylation sites on ATF2 and STAT4. Phosphorylation of p38α Thr-180 in response to both stimuli was similar (Fig. 6, 3rd row), but only PMA caused Tyr-182 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, 4th row). Consistent with the in vitro results, TCR and PMA stimulation induced similar phosphorylation of ATF2. Note that the antibody used to detect phospho-ATF2 recognizes Thr-71, and therefore one cannot detect Thr-69 (mono-phosphorylated) ATF2. STAT4, one of the substrates least favored by mono-phosphorylated p38 in vitro, was phosphorylated well after PMA but not TCR-mediated activation. Therefore, as for recombinant p38α, the substrate specificity of endogenous TCR-activated (mono-phosphorylated) p38 differs from MAPK cascade-activated (dual phosphorylated) p38. MAPKs are unusual among kinases in having two phosphoacceptor sites on their activation loops, and the role of the second (tyrosine) site is not well understood. The existence of phosphatases specific for one or the other of the sites has prompted the hypothesis that mono-phosphorylated species exist, but biological examples have not been described, and Thr-180 mono-phosphorylated p38α has been observed only in nonphysiological contexts (28.Zhou B.

Constitutively active point mutants of the p38α homolog Hog1 were isolated in a genetic screen in yeast (30.Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When introduced into p38α, some of these mutations induced kinase activity and autophosphorylation in trans on Thr-180 (18.Diskin R. Lebendiker M. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Notably, these constitutively active mutants bearing an additional Y182F substitution retained activity, albeit at a reduced level (31.Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32.Maayan I. Engelberg D. Stress-activated Protein Kinases.in: Posas F. Nebreda A.R. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2008: 171-186Google Scholar). The majority of the Hog1-activating mutations were located along the C-terminal extension known as L16, a flexible loop that wraps around the N-terminal domain of all MAPK and which contains Tyr-323 (30.Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The many similar features between the Hog1-activating mutations (18.Diskin R. Lebendiker M. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Mol.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin2008: 171-186Google Scholar) and Tyr(P)-323-activated p38α reported here strongly suggest that they activate kinase activity by a common mechanism. Such a mechanism could involve disruption of a hydrophobic core made up of the aromatic side chains of Tyr-69, Phe-327, and Trp-337 (31.Diskin R. Askari N. Capone R. Engelberg D. Livnah O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47040-47049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The side chain of unphosphorylated Tyr-323 is oriented inward toward this core, and addition of a negative charge could perturb the pocket, twist L16, and, via an interaction between L16 and the activation loop analogous to that seen in dual phosphorylated ERK2, induce a rotation between the C- and N-terminal domains that remodels the catalytic site of p38 (18.Diskin R.

Des. 1999; 7: 1057-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The individual contributions of Thr-180 and Tyr-182 phosphorylation to p38 function have recently been addressed (29.Zhang Y.Y. Mei Z.Q. Wu J.W. Wang Z.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26591-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35.Askari N. Beenstock J. Livnah O. Engelberg D. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2497-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using ATF2 as a substrate, it was found that Thr-180 mono-phosphorylated p38α was an order of magnitude less active than dual phosphorylated p38α in vitro. We found that the difference between mono- and dual phosphorylated p38α became smaller as the concentration of ATP was increased. 3 mm ATP was used in this study because it approximates physiological intracellular levels (36.Gronostajski R.M. Pardee A.B. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3344-3349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and under these conditions ATF2 was phosphorylated almost as well by mono-phosphorylated p38α as by the dual phosphorylated species. Deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy revealed that dual phosphorylation induces significant alterations in solvent accessibility to the activation loop, active site, and substrate docking domains, whereas Tyr-182 mono-phosphorylation has little effect (37.Sours K.M. Kwok S.C. Rachidi T. Lee T. Ring A. Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, and consistent with our data, it seems likely that Thr-180 phosphorylation has the major role in formation of the active site, and Tyr-182 phosphorylation enhances the activity and plays a role in determining specificity. An important question is why have T cells acquired an alternative p38α and -β activation pathway that is not shared even by closely related B cells. The finding in this report that activation of p38α by TCR stimulation is qualitatively different raises several possibilities. T cells are equipped to participate in inflammatory responses and receive stimulation through receptors such as interleukin-12 and -18, which activate p38 by the classical MAPK cascade and thus increase the production of downstream pro-inflammatory molecules such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (13.Visconti R.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The responses a T cell makes to antigen via the TCR, such as clonal expansion and providing help to B cells, can occur independently of inflammatory conditions, and induction of pro-inflammatory downstream events might be deleterious. Therefore, the alternative pathway may be a means of allowing p38 activation and some limited gene up-regulation without inflammatory sequelae. Another possibility is that MAPK cascade-activated p38α is itself harmful to T cell development and/or cell function. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by p38 has been shown to induce its release from mitochondria, thereby disrupting its ability to inhibit apoptosis (27.De Chiara G. Marcocci M.E. Torcia M. Lucibello M. Rosini P. Bonini P. Higashimoto Y. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Amodei S. Palamara A.T. Russo T. Garaci E. Cozzolino F. J. Biol.

Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2001; 15: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mice expressing a constitutively active form of MKK6 in T cells, and therefore having constitutively active dual phosphorylated p38, have a reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells because of their apoptosis, and the cells that survive proliferate less well in response to mitogen (43.Merritt C. Enslen H. Diehl N. Conze D. Davis R.J. Rincon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the spontaneous apoptosis of CD8+ cells was because of p38-mediated phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, a mechanism that has also been implicated in Fas-induced CD8+ T cell death (14.Farley N. Pedraza-Alva G. Serrano-Gomez D. Nagaleekar V. Aronshtam A. Krahl T. Thornton T. Rincon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2118-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our finding that Bcl-2 is a very poor substrate for mono-phosphorylated, in contrast to dual phosphorylated, p38α is consistent with the notion that activation of p38 by the alternative pathway helps to maintain cell viability in TCR-signaled cells. IFN-γ is a target for TCR and cytokine signaling pathways, either separately or in combination, in T cells. ATF2, which we found to be a reasonably good substrate for mono-phosphorylated p38α, is implicated in TCR-mediated induction of IFN-γ (44.Penix L.A. Sweetser M.T. Weaver W.M. Hoeffler J.P. Kerppola T.K. Wilson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31964-31972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas STAT4, which is not a target of monophosphorylated p38α, is important for interleukin-12-induced (25.Morinobu A.

Thus, the evolutionarily conserved loss of TCR-coupled MAPK cascade initiation and the acquisition of the alternative p38 activation pathway may be driven by the need of T cells to tightly control p38 activation and limit its substrates to those useful in immune responses.

We have developed a multimodality imaging approach to monitor the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling pathway in bone metastases, sequentially over time in the same animal. As model systems, two MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells lines with different metastatic tropisms, SCP2 and SCP3, were transduced with constitutive and TGFbeta-inducible reporter genes and were tested in vitro and in living animals. The sites and expansion of metastases were visualized by bioluminescence imaging using a constitutive firefly luciferase reporter, while TGFbeta signaling in metastases was monitored by microPET imaging of HSV1-TK/GFP expression with [(18)F]FEAU and by a more sensitive and cost-effective bioluminescence reporter, based on nonsecreted Gaussia luciferase. Concurrent and sequential imaging of metastases in the same animals provided insight into the location and progression of metastases, and the timing and course of TGFbeta signaling. The anticipated and newly observed differences in the imaging of tumors from two related cell lines have demonstrated that TGFbeta signal transduction pathway activity can be noninvasively imaged with high sensitivity and reproducibility, thereby providing the opportunity for an assessment of novel treatments that target TGFbeta signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2074149880,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an opportunistic pathogen characterized for its intrinsic low susceptibility to several antibiotics. Part of this low susceptibility relies on the expression of chromosomally encoded multidrug efflux pumps, with SmeDEF being the most relevant antibiotic resistance efflux pump so far studied in this bacterial species. Expression of smeDEF is down-regulated by the SmeT repressor, encoded upstream smeDEF, in its complementary DNA strand. In the present article we present the crystal structure of SmeT and analyze its interactions with its cognate operator. Like other members of the TetR family of transcriptional repressors, SmeT behaves as a dimer and presents some common structural features with other TetR proteins like TtgR, QacR, and TetR. Differing from other TetR proteins for which the structure is available, SmeT turned out to have two extensions at the N and C termini that might be relevant for its function. Besides, SmeT presents the smallest binding pocket so far described in the TetR family of transcriptional repressors, which may correlate with a specific type and range of effectors. In vitro studies revealed that SmeT binds to a 28-bp pseudopalindromic region, forming two complexes. This operator region was found to overlap the promoters of smeT and smeDEF. This finding is consistent with a role for SmeT simultaneously down-regulating smeT and smeDEF transcription, likely by steric hindrance on RNA polymerase binding to DNA."

Here, we showed that ERRγ is expressed in osteoblast progenitors and primary osteoblasts, and its expression is increased temporarily by BMP2. Overexpression of ERRγ reduced BMP2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin production as well as calcified nodule formation, whereas inhibition of ERRγ expression significantly enhanced BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization, suggesting that endogenous ERRγ plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation. In addition, ERRγ significantly repressed Runx2 transactivity on osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein promoters. We also observed that ERRγ physically interacts with Runx2 in vitro and in vivo and competes with p300 to repress Runx2 transactivity. Notably, intramuscular injection of ERRγ strongly inhibited BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation in a dose-dependent manner.

Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts, which play key roles in bone formation, are derived from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells that have the capacity to differentiate into myocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes (2Pittenger M.F.

Osteoblasts possess the necessary components to form bone matrix, which allows subsequent mineralization. Several hormones, growth factors, cytokines, and nuclear receptor proteins regulate these sequential events to trigger a complex network of signaling pathways. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 5The abbreviations used are: BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; OC, osteocalcin; BSP, bone sialoprotein; ERR, estrogen receptor-related receptors; Ad, adenovirus; AR-S, alizarin red stain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PN, particle number; μCT, microCT; sh-, short hairpin-; RT, reverse transcription; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; HA, hemagglutinin. are members of the transforming growth factor β family and were originally identified by their capacity to induce ectopic bone formation (3Wozney J.M.

Therefore, it is important to identify the possible partners of Runx2 to understand the mechanism of Runx2-dependent osteoblast differentiation. Estrogen receptor-related receptors (ERRs) are closely related to estrogen receptor (ER) without binding to the classical ER ligand but share high homology in their DNA binding domain (16Giguere V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 220-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To date, three subtypes of ERR have been identified as ERRα,-β, and -γ, based on their sequence similarity to ERα, and have been shown to regulate a broad spectrum of genes in their target cells. Recently, it has been reported that ERRα is involved functionally in bone differentiation. It is strongly expressed throughout the osteoblast differentiation process and plays a physiological role in differentiation and bone formation (17Bonnelye E. Merdad L. Kung V. Aubin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It also regulates osteopontin expression through a non-canonical ERRα response element (18Zirngibl R.A. Chan J.S. Aubin J.E.

It differs from the other family members in that it is a constitutively active nuclear receptor with high basal transcriptional activity (19Sanyal S. Kim J.Y. Kim H.J. Takeda J. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D.

Adenovirus short hairpin ERRγ (Ad-shERRγ) was generated with pAd-easy system as described (23Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P.

Cell Cultures and Viral Infection—Murine myoblast (C2C12) and human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). The pre-osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) and the same antibiotics. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For the in vitro adenovirus infection, the cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2. After virus infection, the culture medium was changed to a mineralizing medium (50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate), which was replaced every other day unless otherwise indicated. Preparation of Primary Osteoblasts—Calvariae were isolated from 10-day-old neonatal mice and digested with 0.1% collagenase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 30 min. The collagenase digest was then discarded and replaced with other fresh collagenase solution. After 30 min the cells were collected by a sedimentation step and centrifuged twice at 400 × g for 10 min. Finally, cells in the pellet fraction were used for primary culture. RNA Preparation and Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The complementary DNA was synthesized from the total RNA using a random primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Each reaction consisted of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min followed by three-step cycling: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at a temperature optimized for each primer pair for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. After the requisite number of cycles (27–30 cycles), the reactions underwent a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The following primer sequences, designed based on published cDNA sequences, were used for PCR: ERRα, forward 5′-CAGGAAAGTGAATGCCCAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTTTGCAGCAAATATACATT-3′; ERRβ, forward 5′-TGGACTCGCCGCCTATGTTCG and reverse 5′-ACTTGCGCTCCGTTTGGTGA-3′; ERRγ, forward 5′-ACCATGAATGGCCATCAGAA-3′ and reverse 5′-ACCAGCTGAGGGTTCAGGTAT-3′; OC, forward 5′-CTCCTGAGAGTCTGACAAAGCCTT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTGTGACATCCATTACTTGC-3′; ALP, forward 5′-GATCATTCCCACGTTTTCAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TGCGGGCTTGTGGGCCTGC-3′. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Approximately 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and assayed using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Determination of Osteogenic Differentiation—MC3T3-E1 and C2C12 cells were infected with Ad-ERRγ or Ad-shERRγ. After 24 h the medium was changed to an osteogenic medium containing ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) and β-glycerophosphate (5 mm) with or without BMP2 (200 ng/ml). At the designated time point, the cell homogenates were reacted with the ALP assay mixture containing 0.1 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (Sigma), 1 mm MgCl2, and 8 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was quenched by adding 0.1 n NaOH, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The quantitative double-stranded DNA in solution, which was used to normalize the ALP activity, was measured using a Picogreen® double-stranded DNA quantification kit (Molecular Probes). The amount of OC was detected in cell supernatants by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). For alizarin red staining, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and treated with a 40 mm alizarin red stain (AR-S) solution (pH 4.2) for 10 min to stain the calcium deposits. The stained cultures were photographed, and the AR-S was extracted using 10% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) for quantification. The AR-S concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm on a multiplate reader using an AR-S standard curve in the same solution. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown Assay—The Runx2 and p300 cDNA in pcDNA3 were transcribed and translated in vitro using a coupled rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. The indicated GST fusion proteins or GST alone were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLys using 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The GST fusion proteins were pre-bound to a 30-μl aliquot of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated with the in vitro translated proteins for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with a washing buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized using a phosphorimaging analyzer (BAS-1500, Fuji). Western Blot Analysis—Total cell extracts were lysed, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with specific antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antigen-antibody interactions were visualized by incubation with ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis—HEK-293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3/Runx2 and pcDNA3/HA-ERRγ. Whole cell extracts were lysed with a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were precleared with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 2 h, which were removed by centrifugation. A total of 2 μgof antibody (polyclonal) against Runx2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the precleared lysates. After centrifugation, the immunoprecipitated complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. Ectopic Bone Formation in Vivo—C57BL/6J mice (male, 8-week-old) were purchased from Daehan Biolink (Chungbuk, Korea) and assigned randomly to each experimental group. The studies were carried out under the guidelines of the Chonnam National University Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were injected with a designated dose of particle number (PN) of the adenovirus in the thigh muscles; 5 × 1010 PN of Ad-LacZ (MOCK, n = 4), 5 × 1010 PN of Ad-BMP2 (n = 4), 5 × 1010 PN (n = 4), or 15 × 1010 PN (n = 4) of Ad-ERRγ diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. The amount of ectopic bone formation in the two-dimensional image was monitored using a microradiographic apparatus (Hi-Tex, Japan; exposure at 35 kV for 45 s) and x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). MicroCT (μCT) (Skyscan 1172, Skyscan, Belgium) was used for three-dimensional observations of bone formation. The scanned images and samples were collected at 50 kV and 200 μA and reconstructed using NRecon software and three-dimensional CT analyzer software (Skyscan). For histological analysis, the mice were sacrificed at 5 weeks after virus injection. The injected thigh muscles were removed and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. The samples were decalcified in 10% EDTA, embedded in paraffin, and cut into sections (4 μm). The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least twice, and a Student's t test was used to examine the differences between the two groups of data. Differences with a p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Expression Profiles of ERRγ during Osteogenic Differentiation—To evaluate the potential role of ERRγ in BMP2-mediated osteogenic differentiation, we examined the expression levels of ERRγ in various murine progenitor cells after BMP2 treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A, ERRγ gene expression was significantly regulated by BMP2 in the tested cells. During osteoblast differentiation, which was determined by ALP and OC expression, ERRγ mRNA and proteins were significantly but temporarily increased at day 2 or 3 and then were restored to the basal level thereafter in C2C12 and primary osteoblasts, respectively (Fig. 1, B–D). To investigate whether the expression of ERRγ is dependent on BMP2, we examined the effect of BMP2 on ERRγ gene promoter. As shown in Fig. 1, E and F, the promoter activity of ERRγ was significantly increased by BMP2 in a dose-dependent manner in both C2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells, suggesting that BMP2 is a potential regulator of ERRγ gene expression. These results suggest that ERRγ, which is partially induced by BMP2, has a functional role in osteoblast differentiation. ERRγ Negatively Regulates BMP2-induced Osteogenic Differentiation—To clarify the potential role of ERRγ in osteogenic differentiation, we generated adenoviral vector expressing ERRγ to obtain a high level of expression of this factor (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ERRγ in C2C12 cells significantly repressed BMP2-induced osteoblast-specific marker genes, ALP and OC. As a functional analysis, we further confirmed the changes in ALP activity and OC production by Ad-ERRγ in C2C12 (Fig. 2, C and D) and MC3T3-E1 (Fig. 2, E and F) cells, respectively. BMP2-induced ALP activity and OC production were significantly suppressed by Ad-ERRγ. To further confirm the role of endogenous ERRγ in BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation, we used adenoviral short hairpin RNA (Ad-shRNA) for ERRγ to inhibit the expression of ERRγ. As shown in Fig. 3A, Ad-shERRγ significantly inhibited the gene expression of ERRγ in MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, inhibition of ERRγ gene expression significantly increased BMP2-induced ALP activity and OC production in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that ERRγ plays a crucial role in BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation. ERRγ Inhibits BMP2-induced Mineralized Nodule Formation—Extracellular matrix mineralization is the most important phenomenon in bone formation (24Puleo D.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To verify the functional influence of ERRγ on BMP2-induced mineralization, we either induced or inhibited the expression of ERRγ using Ad-ERRγ or Ad-shERRγ, respectively, in the presence or absence of BMP2 and assessed the amount of mineralization by alizarin red staining. As shown in Fig. 4A, overexpression of ERRγ significantly decreased BMP2-induced mineralized nodule formation in C2C12 cells. In MC3T3-E1 cells, Ad-ERRγ also significantly decreased the BMP2-induced calcified nodule formation, whereas Ad-shERRγ strongly increased the nodule formation (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that ERRγ prevents mineralization during osteoblast maturation. ERRγ Suppresses Runx2 Transactivity for Osteoblast-specific Genes—To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of ERRγ in osteoblast differentiation, we hypothesized that Runx2 might be involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation by ERRγ as BMP2-Runx2 cascade is important for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblast lineage (10Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Moreover, many osteoblast-specific marker genes such as OC and BSP are reported to be regulated by Runx2 (22Roca H. Phimphilai M. Gopalakrishnan R. Xiao G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30845-30855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Makita N. Suzuki M. Asami S. Takahata R. Kohzaki D. Kobayashi S. Hakamazuka T. Hozumi N. Gene (Amst.). 2008; 413: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of ERRγ on the transcriptional activity of Runx2 on osteoblast-specific genes. As shown in Fig. 5, A–D, Runx2-dependent promoter activities of osteocalcin (OG2-Luc) and bone sialoprotein (BSP-Luc) were significantly repressed by ERRγ overexpression in C2C12 and MC3T3-E1, respectively. To further confirm the specificity for Runx2, we used a 6×OSE-Luc reporter gene, which harbors six copies of the Runx2 binding region. As shown in Fig. 5, E and F, ERRγ strongly repressed the reporter activity in both cell lines. These results further support our hypothesis that the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation by ERRγ occurs through the repression of Runx2 transactivity. ERRγ Physically Interacts with Runx2 and Competes with p300 to Suppress Runx2 Transactivity—To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which ERRγ represses Runx2 transactivity, we investigated the possibility of physical interaction between ERRγ and Runx2. To evaluate this possibility, we carried out in vitro and in vivo interaction assays. As shown in Fig. 6A, GST-ERRγ, but not GST alone, interacts with the in vitro translated Runx2 in a dose-dependent manner. To further examine whether ERRγ binds to Runx2 in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 6B, ERRγ indeed interacted with Runx2 in the cells. These results suggest that ERRγ physically interacts with Runx2 in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies have reported that various cofactors interact with Runx2 to regulate its transactivity (11Yagi R. Chen L.F. Shigesada K. Murakami Y. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 12McLarren K.W. Lo R. Grbavec D. Thirunavukkarasu K. Karsenty G. Stifani S. J. Biol.

Van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Montecino M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3339-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Among the regulators, p300 is a potential coactivator which interacts with Runx2, and the interaction is critical for the cooperative action of Runx2-dependent osteogenesis (13Sierra J. Villagra A. Paredes R. Cruzat F. Gutierrez S. Javed A. Arriagada G. Olate J. Imschenetzky M. Van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Montecino M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3339-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To further characterize the mechanism whereby ERRγ inhibits Runx2 transactivity, we examined whether ERRγ competes with p300, which results in repression of Runx2 transactivity. As shown in Fig. 6C, ERRγ competes with p300 for Runx2 transactivity. However, increasing amounts of p300 marginally recovers Runx2 transactivity, indicating that the repressive effect of ERRγ on Runx2 transactivity is predominant as compared with the co-activation of p300. To further examine whether ERRγ interferes with a direct interaction of p300 and Runx2, we performed a GST pulldown assay as shown in Fig. 6D. 35S-Labeled p300 bound to GST-Runx2 as previously reported, and ERRγ specifically disrupted this interaction in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that ERRγ represses the transcriptional activity of Runx2 via competition with p300. ERRγ Inhibits BMP2-induced Ectopic Bone Formation in Vivo—The preceding results revealed that ERRγ may play a substantial role in BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation. A previous study reported that subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of BMP2 induces ectopic endochondral bone formation (3Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the effect of ERRγ on BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation in vivo. To analyze the effects of ERRγ on intramuscular bone formation, mice were injected with Ad-ERRγ and/or Ad-BMP2 into the thigh muscle. At 5 weeks after injection, animals were sacrificed and subjected to x-ray (two-dimensional) and μCT (three-dimensional) imaging. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, high resolution μCT scans showed that Ad-ERRγ alone had no effect on intramuscular bone formation. However, BMP2 profoundly induced ectopic bone formation in the thigh muscle, whereas ERRγ significantly decreased the ectopic bone formation by BMP2 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, histology analysis showed that BMP2 induces newly formed mineralized matrix, which has plentiful amounts of osteocytes and bone marrow, whereas overexpression of ERRγ with BMP2 showed only immature mineralized areas and retained cartilage stage (Fig. 7C). These results are in agreement with the μCT results and indicate that ERRγ decreases BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation. Taken together, our findings suggest that ERRγ down-regulates the expression of BMP-induced osteogenic genes and mineralization of potent osteoblastic cells, which results in repressed bone formation. Osteoblast differentiation and bone formation are regulated by various transcription factors. To date, several orphan nuclear receptors such as ERRα and Nurr1 were known to participate in osteoblast differentiation by regulating the expression of osteoblast specific genes (26Lammi J. Huppunen J. Aarnisalo P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Lee M.K. Choi H. Gil M. Nikodem V.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Bonnelye E. Aubin J.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1392-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of ERRγ in bone formation has not yet been demonstrated. Based on this fact, we examined the role of ERRγ, the newest member of the orphan nuclear receptor ERR family, in osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. In this study we observed the expression of ERRs in potent osteoblastic cells such as mouse primary calvarial cells and MC3T3 and C2C12 cells. ERRγ mRNA expression is strongly induced by BMP2 (Fig. 1A), whereas the expression of ERRα and ERRβ was not significantly increased by BMP2 (data not shown). A previous study demonstrated that ERRα is expressed throughout the osteoblast differentiation process and plays a physiological role in differentiation and bone formation (17Bonnelye E. Merdad L. Kung V. Aubin J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, in this report the expression of ERRα was BMP2-independent. Rather, ERRα was expressed subsequently during osteoblast differentiation. Therefore, it is possible that ERRα has a functional role in osteoblast differentiation through a BMP2-independent signal pathway. BMPs regulate osteoblast differentiation and bone formation with the balance between the positive and negative factors. For example, BMPs stimulate the expression of several positive regulators of osteoblast differentiation, such as Runx2 and Dlx5 (21Phimphilai M. Zhao Z. Boules H. Roca H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 29Miyama K. Yamada G. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Miyado K. Sakai M. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It has been well demonstrated that the BMP2-Runx2 cascade is important for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into the osteoblast lineage (10Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Runx2 positively and negatively regulates the osteoblast-specific genes by binding to its target promoters (15Westendorf J.J. Zaidi S.K. Cascino J.E. Kahler R. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Yoshida M. Stein G.S. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7982-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 30Thomas D.M. Carty S.A. Piscopo D.M. Lee J.S. Wang W.F. Forrester W.C. Hinds P.W. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 41998-42007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For example, bone-specific expression of OC is regulated principally by Runx2 (25Makita N. Suzuki M. Asami S. Takahata R. Kohzaki D. Kobayashi S. Hakamazuka T. Hozumi N. Gene (Amst.). 2008; 413: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). BMP also induces the expression of the negative regulator such as Tob (33Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T. Yamamoto T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Thus, the tentative expression of ERRγ by BMP2 (Fig. 1, B–D) indicated that ERRγ may be a novel negative regulator which is involved in a finely tuned regulation of osteoblast differentiation. Meanwhile, we observed that BMP2 promoter activity was significantly decreased by ERRγ expression (data not shown). This result implies that ERRγ may regulate BMP2 expression negatively. As a further study, it is important to identify a key signal transduction pathway to regulate BMP2-dependent ERRγ expression. Like other nuclear receptors, ERRγ consists of a DNA binding domain and a ligand binding domain (34Huppunen J. Wohlfahrt G. Aarnisalo P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 219: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain of ERRγ recognizes ERRγ response elements in the promoter region of its target genes (e.g. DAX-1, SHP) (19Sanyal S. Kim J.Y. Kim H.J. Takeda J. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Choi H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Park Y.Y. Ahn S.W. Kim H.J. Kim J.M. Lee I.K. Kang H. Choi H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6756-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and its binding activates the transcriptional machinery (20Park Y.Y. Ahn S.W. Kim H.J. Kim J.M. Lee I.K. Kang H. Choi H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6756-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We could not identify the putative ERRγ response elements on OC or BSP proximal promoter sequences. Our results revealed that ERRγ reduces osteoblast marker gene expression as well as osteoblast differentiation. These results suggest that ERRγ works with a regulator for BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation, and we identified Runx2 as a partner for ERRγ. Moreover, our results revealed that ERRγ significantly repressed Runx2-dependent promoter activities of OC and BSP, and ERRγ physically interacts with Runx2, suggesting that the functional outcome of ERRγ activity depends on specific protein-protein interactions. Meanwhile, Runx2 by itself is not sufficient to induce its target gene expression (10Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). To date, various coregulators of Runx2 have been identified. Among those regulators, p300, a member of histone acetyltransferase, is a well known co-regulator of Runx2 (13Sierra J. Villagra A. Paredes R. Cruzat F. Gutierrez S. Javed A. Arriagada G. Olate J. Imschenetzky M. Van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Montecino M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3339-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), suggesting that chromatin remodeling is essential for regulating the osteoblast-specific genes. Interestingly, in this study, ERRγ competitively inhibited the association of p300 with Runx2 (Fig. 6, C and D). These results indicate that ERRγ exploits a cofactor competition mechanism to down-regulate Runx2 transactivity, which results in repression of osteoblast differentiation. However, the presence of additional and more complex mechanisms of cross-talk between ERRγ and other co-regulators of Runx2 cannot be ruled out. In this study we examined the effect of ERRγ on BMP2-induced ectopic bone formation, and the in vivo results revealed that ERRγ attenuates BMP2-dependent de novo bone formation (Fig. 7). Interestingly, Ad-ERRγ-treated groups showed larger cartilage regions and smaller bone marrow cavity even in the presence of BMP2, which results in substantial loss of mature bone. Hence, it is interpreted that ERRγ may hold the transition from cartilage stage to mineralized bone formation stage. In conclusion, the present study clearly suggests that the orphan nuclear receptor ERRγ, which is temporally induced by BMP2, inhibited not only BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation, in part by interfering with a coregulator of Runx2 in vitro, but also ectopic bone formation in vivo. Pathological bone diseases such as myositis ossificans traumatica, osteogenic sarcoma, and vascular calcification result from an excessive BMP expression in inappropriate places (35Shafritz A.B. Kaplan F.S. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1998; 346: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Hruska K.A. Mathew S. Saab G. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore, in vivo regulation of ERRγ expression or activity by its synthetic or natural ligand can be a novel therapeutic approach to treat such bone-related disorders. Further studies using ERRγ-deficient mice would improve our understanding of the importance of ERRγ in bone homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2114694146,"hSMUG1 (human single-stranded selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glyscosylase) is one of three glycosylases encoded within a small region of human chromosome 12. Those three glycosylases, UNG (uracil-DNA glycosylase), TDG (thymine-DNA glyscosylase), and hSMUG1, have in common the capacity to remove uracil from DNA. However, these glycosylases also repair other lesions and have distinct substrate preferences, indicating that they have potentially redundant but not overlapping physiological roles. The mechanisms by which these glycosylases locate and selectively remove target lesions are not well understood. In addition to uracil, hSMUG1 has been shown to remove some oxidized pyrimidines, suggesting a role in the repair of DNA oxidation damage. In this paper, we describe experiments in which a series of oligonucleotides containing purine and pyrimidine analogs have been used to probe mechanisms by which hSMUG1 distinguishes potential substrates. Our results indicate that the preference of hSMUG1 for mispaired uracil over uracil paired with adenine is best explained by the reduced stability of a duplex containing a mispair, consistent with previous reports with Escherichia coli mispaired uracil-DNA glycosylase. We have also extended the substrate range of hSMUG1 to include 5-carboxyuracil, the last in the series of damage products from thymine methyl group oxidation. The properties used by hSMUG1 to select damaged pyrimidines include the size and free energy of solvation of the 5-substituent but not electronic inductive properties. The observed distinct mechanisms of base selection demonstrated for members of the uracil glycosylase family help explain how considerable diversity in chemical lesion repair can be achieved."

To elucidate how this dynamic process is implemented in the primate brain, single-unit activity was recorded from the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of two monkeys performing analogs of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, which is most commonly used to test cognitive flexibility in humans. We successfully trained the monkeys to promptly perform set shifting, mostly within a single trial, and found shift-related activity: PPC neurons were transiently activated when the monkeys shifted from one cognitive set to another, but not when they shifted in the opposite direction. This shift-related activity emerged about 4 s before the actual behavioral responses, and it well predicted whether the cognitive set would be successfully shifted. These results provide insights into single-unit level mechanisms of cognitive flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2028924923,"Trypanosome lytic factor (TLF) is a subclass of human high density lipoprotein (HDL) that mediates an innate immune killing of certain mammalian trypanosomes, most notably Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the causative agent of a wasting disease in cattle. Mechanistically, killing is initiated in the lysosome of the target trypanosome where the acidic pH facilitates a membrane-disrupting activity by TLF. Here we utilize a model liposome system to characterize the membrane binding and permeabilizing activity of TLF and its protein constituents, haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr), apolipoprotein L-1 (apoL-1), and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1). We show that TLF efficiently binds and permeabilizes unilamellar liposomes at lysosomal pH, whereas non-lytic human HDL exhibits inefficient permeabilizing activity. Purified, delipidated Hpr and apoL-1 both efficiently permeabilize lipid bilayers at low pH. Trypanosome lytic factor, apoL-1, and apoA-1 exhibit specificity for anionic membranes, whereas Hpr permeabilizes both anionic and zwitterionic membranes. Analysis of the relative particle sizes of susceptible liposomes reveals distinctly different membrane-active behavior for native TLF and the delipidated protein components. We propose that lysosomal membrane damage in TLF-susceptible trypanosomes is initiated by the stable association of the TLF particle with the lysosomal membrane and that this is a property unique to this subclass of human HDL.

When these proteins are incorporated into the same lipoprotein particle, a several hundredfold increase in killing activity is exhibited (5Shiflett A.M. Bishop J.R. Pahwa A. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32578-32585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, Molina-Portela et al. (14Molina-Portela M.P. Samanovic M. Raper J. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1721-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) show that maximal protection against T. b. brucei in a transgenic mouse model requires the expression of human Hpr, apoL-1, and apoA-1, supporting a synergistic mode of action. Haptoglobin-related protein evolved during primate evolution and is restricted to apes, old world monkeys, and humans (15McEvoy S.M. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15740-15747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Haptoglobin-related protein is highly similar (92%) to the acute phase serum protein haptoglobin (Hp) (16Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6698-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mammals use Hp as a scavenger of hemoglobin (Hb) released during hemolysis associated with infection or trauma. Haptoglobin binds cell-free Hb with high affinity and facilitates its removal from the circulation through a receptor-mediated process in the liver (17Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Like Hp, Hpr binds free Hb, yet this Hpr·Hb complex is not recognized by the requisite receptors in mammals and is thus not removed from the circulation (18Nielsen M.J. Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Rees D. Moller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 2846-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TLF uptake by susceptible trypanosomes requires specific binding to an Hpr·Hb complex that facilitates trafficking of the TLF particle to the lysosome (10Widener J. Nielsen M.J. Shiflett A. Moestrup S.K. Hajduk S. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1250-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that once inside the lysosomal compartment, Hpr·Hb contributes directly to membrane disruption through the generation of oxygen radicals with the bound Hb providing the iron necessary for Fenton chemistry (7Smith A.B.

Apolipoprotein L-1 is a unique member of the apolipoprotein L protein family in that, unlike the remaining apoL proteins, it possesses an N-terminal signal sequence and is thus secreted from cells. As is the case for Hpr, apoL-1 appeared during primate evolution (20Page N.M. Butlin D.J. Lomthaisong K. Lowry P.J.

Genomics. 2002; 79: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Within the circulation of primates, apoL-1 is exclusively associated with HDL, and the majority of the protein is in the TLF subclass (5Shiflett A.M. Bishop J.R. Pahwa A. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32578-32585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The apoL family members are all predicted to adopt amphipathic α-helical conformations, suggesting that their physiological role involves membrane interaction (20Page N.M. Butlin D.J. Lomthaisong K. Lowry P.J. Genomics. 2001; 74: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein L-1 shares limited homology with channel-forming colicins and, consistent with this observation, has been shown to function as an ion channel when incorporated into lipid bilayers (23Perez-Morga D.

Science. 2005; 309: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The ultimate fate of TLF-targeted lysosomal membranes is not firmly established. Several studies employing both in vivo cellular analysis and artificial membrane systems address this point with conflicting results. Electron microscopy studies with gold-conjugated TLF revealed accumulation of TLF in intracellular vesicles and subsequent vesicle membrane breakdown and appearance of gold particles in the cytoplasm (9Hager K.M. Pierce M.A. Moore D.R. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Widener et al. (10Widener J. Nielsen M.J. Shiflett A.

PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1250-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) observed efflux of lysosomally localized large molecular mass dextrans (500 kDa) in TLF-treated T. b. brucei. These data suggest that the lysosomal membrane experiences large scale disruption. In contrast, Perez-Morga et al. (23Perez-Morga D. Vanhollebeke B. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Nolan D.P. Lins L. Homble F.

Swelling is attributed to apoL-1-mediated influx of Cl– ions and concomitant osmotic flow of water into the lysosome. However, Molina-Portela et al. (25Molina-Portela M.P. Lugli E.B. Recio-Pinto E. Raper J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 144: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) observed the formation of cation-selective pores in TLF-treated planar lipid bilayers composed of trypanosome lipids. The diversity of activities reported for TLF and normal human serum may reflect the packaging of multiple toxins within the same complex that can act synergistically to provide optimal killing activity (5Shiflett A.M.

Med. 2008; 205: 1721-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here we utilize model liposomes to monitor the membrane activity of TLF and its protein constituents. We describe the effects of TLF, delipidated Hpr, apoL-1, and apoA-1 on the permeability of unilamellar liposomes. Additionally, we show that TLF, apoL-1, and apoA-1 exhibit lipid specificity and that Hpr, apoL-1, and apoA-1 induce large scale changes in the geometry of liposomes. These results provide a molecular basis for the recognition of lysosomal membranes by this toxic HDL and support a multicomponent mechanism for trypanosome killing. Lipids and Reagents—All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). These include soy azolectin (catalog number 541601G), phosphatidylcholine (PC) from egg (catalog number 840051), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from egg (catalog number 841118), and phosphatidylserine (PS) from brain (catalog number 840032), phosphatidic acid (PA) from egg (catalog number 840101), cardiolipin from heart (catalog number 840012). Calcein (catalog number C481) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Purification of TLF and Its Constituent Proteins—Isolation of TLF was performed as described previously in detail (5Shiflett A.M. Bishop J.R. Pahwa A. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32578-32585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Widener J. Nielsen M.J. Shiflett A. Moestrup S.K. Hajduk S. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1250-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, total human HDLs were purified by density gradient centrifugation. Intact TLF was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography utilizing antibodies against Hpr. The lipid-free protein constituents of TLF, Hpr, apoL-1, and apoA-1 were purified in a similar fashion from HDL particles solubilized in 10 mm CHAPS with the corresponding antibody. Eluted TLF and proteins were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline and stored at –80 °C. The integrity and purity of TLF, Hpr, apoL-1, and apoA-1 preparations were assessed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE visualized with silver staining and Western blotting with the appropriate antibody. Additionally, the trypanolytic activity was confirmed for each preparation as described previously (2Hajduk S.L. Moore D.R. Vasudevacharya J. Siqueira H. Torri A.F. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5210-5217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A non-trypanolytic fraction of human HDL was prepared from the unbound material passaged over the anti-Hpr immunoaffinity chromatography (>99% of the total human HDL). This HDL fraction was depleted in Hpr and lacked trypanosome-killing activity. Other Proteins—Human Hp, phenotype 1-1, was purchased from Sigma (catalog number H0138). Liposome Permeabilization Assays—The integrity of unilamellar liposomes was monitored in a time-resolved fashion by fluorescently observing the leakage of entrapped calcein from liposomal interiors. Dry lipid films were hydrated in 10 mm Hepes, 30 mm calcein to a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml. Unilamellar liposomes were prepared by extrusion through a 0.1-μm polycarbonate filter. Untrapped calcein was separated from liposomes by gel filtration (Sephacryl S-300 HR, GE Healthcare). Assays were performed by diluting liposomes 1:1000 into the appropriate buffer and monitoring fluorescence with an LS-55 spectrofluorometer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 484 and 513 nm, respectively, with 10 nm excitation and 5 nm emission slit widths. Data are presented as representative points obtained with a single TLF and liposome preparation. To achieve increasing ionic strengths, NaCl was added to a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-maleate, pH 5.0. The ionic strength thus contains contributions from both the NaCl and the buffer, and was calculated according to the formula I = ½ ∑ cnzn2, where I is the ionic strength, c is the molar concentration of ion n, and z is the charge of that ion. Liposome Binding Assays—Liposomes were constructed by hydration of dry lipid films in 10 mm Hepes. Liposomes were left multilamellar to facilitate pelleting by moderate centrifugation. Assays were performed by incubating 100 μg of lipid with 2.5 μg of TLF in a final volume of 50 μl at 37 °C for 30 min in the indicated buffer. Liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. In some instances, lipid pellets were washed with buffer containing 1 m KCl. Supernatant, wash, and pellet fractions were analyzed by non-reducing gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel stained with silver nitrate. 90° Light Scattering—Assay conditions were the same as those described for the permeabilization assays. Liposomes were constructed from soy bean azolectin and extruded with a 0.1-μm polycarbonate filter. The 90° light-scattering intensity was monitored over time with the PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55. Excitation and emission wavelengths were both set to 405 nm with 10-nm slit widths. Electron Microscopy—Unilamellar liposomes were constructed from soy bean azolectin and prepared by extrusion (0.1 μm). 100 μg/ml lipid was incubated with 200 nm TLF or the indicated delipidated protein for ∼15 min. Samples were adsorbed to glow-discharged Formvar-coated copper grids, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and imaged with a FEI Tecnai 20 transmission electron microscope. TLF Permeabilizes Lipid Bilayers in a pH-dependent Fashion—To study the interaction of TLF with lipid bilayers, we utilized a model system in which we monitor leakage of a liposomally entrapped fluorescent dye. Nanomolar concentrations of purified TLF effectively permeabilized unilamellar soy bean azolectin liposomes (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the necessity for localization of TLF in an acidic intracellular vesicle in vivo, permeabilizing activity in these in vitro assays is highly dependent on acidic pH (Fig. 1B). Permeabilizing activity was greatest at pH 5.0, the lowest pH tested, and unobservable at pH 6.5. Non-trypanolytic HDL, i.e. HDL depleted of TLF by passage over an α-Hpr affinity resin, did not exhibit permeabilizing activity against these particular liposomes at any pH (Fig. 1A and data not shown). TLF Membrane Binding Is Facilitated by Low pH and Mediated by Ionic Interactions—The targeting of TLF to lipid bilayers was investigated with liposome binding assays. SDS-PAGE analysis of supernatant and pellet fractions reveals that TLF binds soy bean azolectin bilayers at pH 5.0 but not pH 6.8 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the entire protein component of TLF appears in the liposomal pellet, whereas contaminating albumin remains in the supernatant. Non-trypanolytic HDLs do not exhibit binding in these assays (supplemental Fig. 1). To determine whether TLF was peripherally bound to the interface of the liposomal bilayers or stably incorporated into the acyl chain region, liposomes were washed with a high ionic strength buffer (1 m KCl, 50 mm Tris-maleate). When TLF is allowed to interact with bilayers in a low ionic strength buffer, a subsequent high ionic strength wash does not remove membrane-associated TLF proteins. We further investigated the role of ionic interactions by analyzing TLF binding to liposomes possessing a net neutral or a net negative surface charge. TLF readily binds bilayers containing anionic lipids, i.e. PC:PS, PC:PA, PC:cardiolipin but not zwitterionic PC or PC:PE (all 3:1 by mass) (Fig. 3A). Consistent with an electrostatic mode of membrane targeting, the presence of 1 m NaCl inhibits binding of TLF to target bilayers (Fig. 3B). In all cases, membrane binding is consistent with permeabilization, i.e. TLF readily permeabilizes anionic but not zwitterionic liposomes (Fig. 3C) and is inhibited by high salt (Fig. 3D). The pH dependence for interaction with anionic liposomes is identical to that for soy bean azolectin, i.e. no permeabilization is seen at neutral pH (supplemental Fig. 2). Minor permeabilizing activity was detected from non-trypanolytic HDL against anionic liposomes (supplemental Fig. 3); in all cases, TLF exhibits significantly higher membrane-permeabilizing activity, 12–65 times that of non-trypanolytic HDL at equimolar concentrations (40 nm). The Protein Components of TLF Permeabilize Lipid Bilayers—In an effort to identify the TLF components responsible for the membrane-permeabilizing activity, we assayed apoA-1, Hpr, and apoL-1, purified from detergent-solubilized TLF particles, for the ability to induce calcein leakage. Each purified, lipid-free protein elicits calcein leakage at acidic pH and nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 4). Similar to native TLF, the membrane-permeabilizing activity of the individual proteins is attenuated at increasing pH (supplemental Fig. 4). The TLF-specific proteins, Hpr and apoL-1, exhibit more robust membrane-permeabilizing activity on a molar basis than apoA-1. Indeed, at molar concentrations double those of apoL-1 or Hpr, i.e. 40 nm apoA-1 and 20 nm apoL-1/Hpr, calcein release is only observable for liposomes composed of PC:PS. The lipid specificity for apoL-1 is identical to the native TLF molecule (Fig. 3C), i.e. apoL-1 permeabilizes liposomes containing anionic lipids but not liposomes composed entirely of zwitterionic lipids. Hpr does not exhibit a requirement for anionic lipids, permeabilizing both zwitterionic and negatively charged liposomes. We found no liposome-permeabilizing activity from human haptoglobin under any conditions (data not shown). The activities of the individual proteins are indeed less than that of native TLF on an equimolar basis; however, the synergy observed for TLF colocalized apoA-1, apoL-1, and Hpr in vitro (5Shiflett A.M. Bishop J.R. Pahwa A. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32578-32585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and in vivo (14Molina-Portela M.P. Samanovic M. Raper J. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1721-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), i.e. a several hundredfold increase in trypanosome killing activity, is not reflected in this model system. Hpr, ApoL-1, and ApoA-1 Remodel Liposomes—To discern the mode of membrane permeabilization by TLF and its protein components, we analyzed the morphology of target liposomes. The 90° light-scattering intensity of liposomal suspensions was monitored as an indicator of relative particle size (Fig. 5A). Under conditions that facilitate membrane permeabilization, TLF induced a minor increase in the hydrodynamic diameter of susceptible liposomes. However, when the individual proteins were assayed, marked changes in the light-scattering intensity were observed. The addition of apoL-1 to suspensions of unilamellar liposomes containing anionic lipids resulted in a decrease in the light-scattering intensity, indicating a reduction in the relative size of the liposome particles (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the known membrane microsolubilizing activity of apoA-1 (26Fukuda M. Nakano M. Sriwongsitanont S. Ueno M. Kuroda Y. Handa T. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 882-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Massey J.B. Pownall H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a decrease in the light-scattering intensity was also observed for susceptible liposomes (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the addition of nanomolar concentrations of Hpr resulted in a large increase in the light-scattering intensity of liposomal suspensions (factor 5A). To determine the nature of the particle size changes revealed by light scattering, we performed transmission electron microscopy on negatively stained preparations of liposomes treated with TLF, Hpr, apoL-1, or apoA-1 (Fig. 5, B–G). Target unilamellar liposomes treated with TLF at pH 5.0 appear similar in size to untreated control liposomes (Fig. 5, A and D, respectively). TLF particles are readily visible, both in solution and decorating the surface of liposomes (TLF particles, Fig. 5C; TLF with liposomes, Fig. 5D). The addition of Hpr results in clumping and a dramatic redistribution of particle sizes (Fig. 5F). Agglutinated intact liposomes, tightly packed together (Fig. 5F, asterisk), and large vesicles (200–250 nm), most likely fusion products, are readily apparent (Fig. 5F, arrows). Additionally, small diameter vesicles and micellar-like structures are also present. Presumably, the large liposome aggregates and fusion products dominate the light-scattering signal. Liposomes treated with apoL-1 appear as smaller 40–70-nm vesicles, distorted in shape (Fig. 5E). Apolipoprotein A-1 induces 50-nm spherical lipid structures, again consistent with the formation of nascent discoidal HDL (Fig. 5G) (27Massey J.B. Pownall H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In each case, the appearance of treated liposomes is consistent with the light-scattering data, i.e. TLF does not induce large scale morphological changes, Hpr induces an enlargement of particle size, and apoL-1 and apoA-1 induce a decrease in particle size. The ultimate step in trypanosome killing by TLF is permeabilization of the lysosomal membrane. We have addressed this particular step with the use of simplified model liposomes, a technique utilized to study myriad membrane-interacting proteins and peptides, including human HDL (see for example Refs. 28Andra J.

Our in vitro system recapitulates data from extensive in vivo analysis of TLF killing and elucidates the role of pH and membrane surface charge in TLF bilayer targeting (9Hager K.M.

Med. Hyg. 1994; 88: 487-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Permeabilization of liposomes is highly dependent on acidic pH. We have shown here that a high proton concentration facilitates binding of TLF to lipid bilayers that possess a net negative surface charge but not to bilayers that are electrically neutral. These data suggest that protonation of acidic groups, most likely of the TLF molecule, facilitates the interaction of TLF with target membranes. It may be the case that protonation effectively dissipates electrostatic repulsion between aspartic and glutamic acid residues and the target bilayer, allowing basic residues of the TLF proteins to mediate an interaction with anionic phospholipids. The lysosome presents an attractive membrane for such a targeting mechanism as, relative to other cellular organelles, it is highly enriched in anionic phospholipids (34Kolter T. Sandhoff K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 81-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 35Rodriguez-Paris J.M. Nolta K.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol.

Interestingly, preferential binding to anionic bilayers is a strategy employed by myriad antimicrobial peptides to differentiate between more negatively charged prokaryotic membranes, which may represent potential pathogens, and zwitterionic membranes, characteristic of the plasma membrane of metazoans (36Matsuzaki K.

A growing body of evidence suggests that TLF, and indeed HDL in general, function as innate immune factors active against a broad spectrum of microbes (4Samanovic M. Molina-Portela M.P. Chessler A.D.

Here we identify a polymorphism that results in an amino acid change from a Leu to Ser at codon 1016 in the phosphatase domain of PHLPP2, which reduces phosphatase activity toward Akt both in vitro and in cells, in turn resulting in reduced apoptosis. Depletion of endogenous PHLPP2 variants in breast cancer cells revealed the Ser-1016 variant is less functional toward both Akt and PKC. In pair-matched high grade breast cancer samples we observed retention of only the Ser allele from heterozygous patients (identical results were observed in a pair-matched normal and tumor cell line). Thus, we have identified a functional polymorphism that impairs the activity of PHLPP2 and correlates with elevated Akt phosphorylation and increased PKC levels.

A prevalent underlying mechanism driving tumorigenesis is aberrant signal transduction pathways that result in constitutive activation of cell growth, proliferation, and survival pathways (2Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar). A well characterized signal transduction pathway in breast cancer that promotes cellular survival, growth, and proliferation is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (3Liu W. Bagaitkar J. Watabe K. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).

Thus, Akt is a major regulator of breast tumorigenesis.There are three isoforms of Akt present in humans. All three isoforms contain activating phosphorylation sites in the activation loop (Thr-308 in Akt1) and in the C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Ser-473 in Akt1) (10Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

This 3′-phosphorylated lipid recruits Akt to the plasma membrane by binding to its PH domain, resulting in conformational changes that allow access to the activation loop phosphorylation site (11Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4598) Google Scholar). Constitutively bound phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1 then phosphorylates Akt at Thr-308, accompanied by phosphorylation at Ser-473 resulting in a catalytically active kinase (12Calleja V.

Signaling through this pathway is terminated by removal of the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate catalyzed by the phosphatase PTEN and by direct dephosphorylation of Akt by the recently-identified PHLPP family of phosphatases and protein phosphatase 2A-type phosphatases (17Maehama T.

Newton A.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 19: 223-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 specifically dephosphorylate the hydrophobic motif of specific Akt isozymes, thus decreasing Akt activity and promoting apoptosis (18Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 19Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). PHLPP2 binds and dephosphorylates Akt1 and Akt3, whereas PHLPP1 binds and dephosphorylates Akt2 and Akt3 (18Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 22Mendoza M.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 798-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Their role in inactivating Akt suggests that both PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 could be potential tumor suppressors. Consistent with such a role, these phosphatases also dephosphorylate the hydrophobic motif of PKC, resulting in degradation of PKC. For this kinase, phosphorylation stabilizes the enzyme, so that the effect of depletion of the PHLPP phosphatases is to increase PKC protein levels (23Gao T. Brognard J. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 283: 6300-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PKC is a well characterized oncogene, and loss of function of the PHLPP phosphatases could increase PKC protein levels and promote tumorigenesis (24Mackay H.J. Twelves C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Providing further rationale that PHLPP2 could be a potential tumor suppressor, the phosphatase is located on chromosome 16q22.3, a region that encounters frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in many primary and malignant breast tumors (25Rakha E.A. Green A.R. Powe D.G. Roylance R. Ellis I.O. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006; 45: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Here we identify a non-synonymous polymorphism that results in an amino acid change from a Leu to a Ser at codon 1016 in the PP2C phosphatase domain of PHLPP2. Overexpression studies reveal the Ser-1016 variant has impaired phosphatase activity and is less effective at inducing apoptosis than the Leu-1016 variant. When comparing a pair-matched normal and breast cancer cell line or pair-matched normal and high grade tumor patient samples that are heterozygous, we observe preferential loss of the Leu allele in the tumor tissue or breast cancer cell line. This observation provides evidence that PHLPP2 could be one of the elusive tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 16q, and for heterozygous patients, loss of the more catalytically active Leu-1016 may promote breast tumorigenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—SMARTpool siRNAs against PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 were purchased from Dharmacon. The following antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling: phospho-specific to Thr-308 and Ser-473 of Akt, Akt, PTEN, and ERK1/2. PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 isoform-specific antibodies were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories. PKCα, Annexin I, and Lamin A antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. EGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies. His-tagged human Akt1 was purified from baculoviral-infected Sf21 cells as described previously (19Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Breast cancer cell lines or DNA from the cell lines listed in Fig. 1B were purchased from the ATCC. Breast tumor tissue DNA was purchased from Asterand or provided by Dr. Linda Wasserman. Asterand provided histology for tumor tissue samples. 100 DNA samples extracted from tissues of healthy individuals were purchased from the Coriell Institute.Cell Culture, Transfections, and Immunoblotting—ZR-75-1, T47D, MDA-MB-468, and SKBR3 cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro), and all other cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro); both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Full-length HA-PHLPP2 variants were expressed in the pcDNA3HA vector as described previously (18Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The nucleotide at position 3047 was changed fromaTtoaC using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Transient transfections and siRNA experiments were performed as previously described (18Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA and incubated 48 h prior to lysis. Transfection efficiencies for 293T and H157 cell lines ranged from 70 to 90%. siRNA transfections were performed using 50 nm SMARTpool siRNA, and cells were incubated for 48 h and either lysed or their media was changed to low serum conditions for 12 h and then EGF (10 ng/ml) was added for the indicated times prior to lysis. For immunoblotting, transfected cells were lysed in Buffer 1 (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm benzamidine, 40 μgml-1 leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated for 5 s. Lysates containing equal protein (determined by Bradford assay) were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels, and individual blots were probed using the antibodies indicated in figure legends. Densitometric analysis was performed with the NIH Image analysis software (version 1.63).Phosphatase Assays—The activity of full-length PHLPP2 variants was assessed by expressing the HA-PHLPP2 variants and then immunoprecipitating the PHLPP2 variants from H157 cells (18Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm benzamidine, 40 μg ml-1 leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Detergent-soluble lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with HA antibody and ultra-link protein A/G beads (Pierce). Beads were then washed three times with Buffer 1, three times with phosphatase buffer (containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MnCl2), and incubated in phosphatase buffer with 1 μg of purified phosphorylated Akt at 30 °C for indicated times as previously described (19Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar).Apoptosis Assays—Apoptotic assays were performed as previously described (26Brognard J. Clark A.S. Ni Y. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3986-3997PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cotransfected with green fluorescent protein and HA-Leu-1016 or HA-Ser-1016 and incubated in low Serum (0.1% fetal bovine serum) media for 48 h; cells were gated based on green fluorescent protein expression as described previously and sub2n DNA was quantified (26Brognard J. Clark A.S. Ni Y. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3986-3997PubMed Google Scholar).DNA and RNA Isolation—Genomic DNA was isolated from human tissues using QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Tissue samples were incubated in ATL buffer (from kit) supplemented with proteinase K for 3 h at 56 °C prior to DNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol.PCR and RT-PCR—One-step RT-PCR (Qiagen) was used to generate PCR products spanning the entire open reading frame of PHLPP2 in the following cell lines: H157, 293T, MDA-MB-231, Hs578t, SKBR-3, MDA-MB-468, Bt474, T47D, MCF-7, and ZR-75-1. RT-PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Following the identification of a polymorphism at Leu-1016, additional RT-PCR for all cell lines was performed by directly amplifying the region flanking the polymorphism using the following primers: 5′-gaggctcaaagggtgaagg-3′ and 5′-ggcccccagcattatgct-3′. The RT-PCR products were gel purified and sequenced directly. For sequencing genomic DNA (from Asterand, Dr. Linda Wasserman, or Coriell Institute), primers were generated to intronic and exonic sequences that flanked the polymorphism or the intronic sequences that flanked the entire exon 17. The following primers were used: 5′-gtgaatggggtaacctgctg-3′ and 5′-ctaccttgctgccattggtt-3′ (flanking polymorphism) and 5′-agtggggcagtcatagtgct-3′ and 5′-agttggctctcatcgttgct-3′ (flanking exon 17). The DNA-PCR and RT-PCR products were sequenced directly using nested primers: 5′-ctgggctgtacatacctctacc-3′ and 5′-ttcactgctcacctctgagg-3′. DNA was amplified using the following protocol: 1 ng of DNA was added to PCR sequencing buffer (5 μl of reaction mix (Stratagene), 200 nm of each primer, 1 μl of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and purified water (5 μl of total reaction amount). The following PCR scheme was used for each reaction: 2 min at 95 °C (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 68 °C) × 35, 10 min at 68 °C, and then 4 °C thereafter. All PCR and RT-PCR reactions were performed twice, and products were sequenced directly using nested primers.Fractionation—Cells were transfected with non-targeting siRNA control or SMARTpool siRNA targeting PHLPP2 and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of hypotonic buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm benzamidine, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), passed through a 25-gauge needle 12 times, and lysates were centrifuged at 300 × g for 1 min. The supernatant (containing the cytosolic and membrane fractions) was removed for further fractionation (below). The pellet (containing the nuclear fraction) was resuspended in 200 μl of membrane buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm benzamidine, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant is defined as the nuclear fraction. The supernatant containing cytosolic and membrane fractions was centrifuged at 108,920 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant is defined as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of membrane buffer and centrifuged at 108,920 × g for 20 min at 4 °C; the resulting supernatant was the membrane fraction.RESULTSIdentification of a Polymorphism in PHLPP2—To determine if the PHLPP2 phosphatase is mutated in breast cancer, we sequenced RNA from breast cancer cell lines. We discovered a T->C nucleotide change at position 3047 in the open reading frame, which results in an amino acid change from Leu to a Ser at codon 1016 in the PP2C phosphatase domain. We observed that 4 of 18 (22%) breast cancer cell lines possessed only the Ser allele, one breast cancer cell line possessed both the Ser and Leu alleles, and the majority of breast cancer cell lines possessed only the Leu allele (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine if this nucleotide change was a polymorphism or a somatic mutation, we genotyped 100 DNA samples from a control population from the Coriell Institute (NA17201-17300). We observed the Leu/Leu genotype in 70 individuals and the Leu/Ser genotype in 30 individuals (Fig. 1C). We never observed the Ser/Ser genotype in the control population. Additionally, we genotyped 33 breast tumor tissue samples and observed the Leu/Leu genotype in 25 patients and the Leu/Ser genotype in 8 patients; again we did not observe the Ser/Ser genotype (Fig. 1C). These results revealed that the T->C nucleotide change at position 3047 is a polymorphism present in 30% of the population.The absence of the Ser/Ser genotype in the control population, but its presence in breast cancer cell lines, led us to ask whether this polymorphism could play a role in breast tumorigenesis. One of the most common genetic lesions in breast cancer is LOH on chromosome 16q in the chromosomal location harboring PHLPP2 (25Rakha E.A. Green A.R. Powe D.G. Roylance R. Ellis I.O. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006; 45: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine if the presence of only the Ser allele in breast cancer cell lines results from LOH, we genotyped the normal breast cell line (Hs578Bst) that is from the same patient as the breast cancer cell line Hs578t. The genotype of the normal cell line was heterozygous (Leu/Ser); therefore, LOH explains the presence of only the Ser allele in the Hs578t breast cancer cell line (Fig. 1D). We cannot determine if LOH is the mechanism underlying the presence of only the Ser allele in the remaining breast cancer cell lines because no normal breast cell lines from the same patient are available for these cell lines. However, the Ser/Ser genotype is rare and LOH at 16q (in the region including PHLPP2) has been reported for these cell lines suggesting that the patients from whom these cell lines were derived were heterozygous (27Callen D.F.

Cytogenet. 2002; 133: 76-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).We next asked whether Akt phosphorylation was altered in a tumor cell line expressing only the Ser allele compared with its normal cell counterpart with both alleles. Because the T47D, Hs578t, and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines, which possess only the Ser allele, have hyperphosphorylated Akt despite expressing wild-type PTEN and having inactivated ErbB2 receptors (28Nicholson K.M.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the Ser polymorphism could impair the function of PHLPP2, thus providing a genetic mechanism driving constitutive phosphorylation of Akt in these cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, comparison of the Hs578t tumor cell line with its normal counterpart (Hs578Bst) revealed that the tumor cell line had dramatically higher levels (>45-fold) of Ser-473 phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 1D).Characterization of the L1016S Substitution—To determine if Ser at codon 1016 alters phosphatase activity, we substituted a Ser for a Leu in the full-length HA-PHLPP2 and expressed the Leu or Ser variants in H157 cells (possess only Leu Allele). We immunoprecipitated both variants and measured the in vitro dephosphorylation of fully phosphorylated Akt. The Ser variant of PHLPP2 dephosphorylated Ser-473 on Akt at an ∼5-fold slower rate than the Leu variant (Fig. 2A). Note that the phosphorylation of Thr-308 was relatively resistant to dephosphorylation by PHLPP2, as previously described (18Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). These data reveal that the amino acid change from a leucine to a serine in the PP2C domain of the phosphatase decreases the activity of PHLPP2 toward Akt.FIGURE 2Characterization of nucleotide change in the PHLPP2 phosphatase. A, H157 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were transfected with vector (lanes 1 and 7), HA-Leu-1016 (lanes 2-6), or HA-Ser-1016 (lanes 8-12) under high serum conditions (10% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 48 h; thereafter HA-PHLPP2 variants were immunoprecipitated and incubated with pure phosphorylated Akt for the indicated times. Western blots are accompanied by graphical analysis of relative Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation normalized to total Akt protein levels. Akt protein and phosphorylation were detected using Akt and phospho-specific antibodies, respectively. Western blots are representative of three independent experiments. B, H157 cells were transfected with vector (lane 1), HA-Leu-1016 (lane 2), or HA-Ser-1016 (lane 3) for 48 h under high serum conditions prior to lysis. The phosphorylation state of Akt in lysates was detected by Western blot analysis. Data from three independent experiments are summarized in the bar graph (relative phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 (P473) or Thr-308 (P308) was normalized to total Akt). Error bars indicate standard deviation. C, H157 cells were transfected with vector, HA-Leu-1016, or HA-Ser-1016, under low serum conditions (0.1% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 48 h and apoptosis (sub-2N DNA content) was assessed using propidium iodide incorporation assays and flow cytometry. All assays were performed in triplicate, with error bars indicating standard deviation, and are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next compared the effect of overexpressing the Ser-1016 versus the Leu-1016 variants on the basal phosphorylation of Akt in cells. Expression of the Leu-1016 construct in H157 cells resulted in a 5-fold reduction in basal phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 compared with control cells, with no significant effect on Thr-308 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2), consistent with previous results (18Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 19Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) (levels of overexpression were comparable to those observed previously (18Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar)). In contrast, expression of the Ser-1016 construct at a comparable level resulted in only a modest decrease in phosphorylation on Ser-473 compared with control cells (Fig. 2B, lane 3). To determine if the differential sensitivity of Akt to the two PHLPP2 variants would affect cellular processes that PHLPP2 has been demonstrated to regulate, we expressed both variants in the H157 cells and monitored apoptosis. Fig. 2C shows that expression of the Leu-1016 variant increased apoptosis 5-fold; when expressed at comparable levels (see Fig. 2B), the Ser-1016 only increased apoptosis 2-fold. These results demonstrate that the Ser-1016 variant has decreased activity toward Akt resulting in less effective induction of apoptosis.Functional Differences of Endogenous PHLPP2 Variants—To determine if endogenous PHLPP2 variants have altered activity, we compared the effect of knocking down PHLPP2 on Akt phosphorylation in the normal cell line Hs578Bst (expressing both alleles) to the pair-matched tumor cell line Hs578t (expressing only the Ser allele). siRNA validation was previously performed using various siRNAs targeting PHLPP2 to confirm observed increase in Akt phosphorylation was due to specific depletion of PHLPP2 (18Brognard J. Sierecki E. Gao T. Newton A.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 917-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Depletion of PHLPP2 (both variants) from the Hs578Bst cell line resulted in a robust increase in phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) compared with control treated cells (Fig. 3A, lane 1). In striking contrast, depletion of PHLPP2 (Ser-1016 variant) from the tumor cell line, Hs578t, did not alter Akt phosphorylation. These data suggest that the Ser-1016 variant is less functional compared with the Leu-1016 variant and that only one functional allele is required for Akt regulation (note that Ser-473 phosphorylation was not maximal in the Hs578t cells, because addition of EGF caused an even greater increase in Ser-473 phosphorylation (data not shown; see also Fig. 4A)). Similarly, PHLPP2 depletion in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (possessing both alleles) increased Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, knockdown of PHLPP1 from the Hs578t breast cancer cell line did not alter Akt phosphorylation, despite the lack of a mutation in PHLPP1 open reading frame. To confirm that the endogenous Ser-1016 variant was less functional than the Leu-1016 variant, we depleted PHLPP2 from two other breast cancer cell lines, MB-231 and ZR-75-1, which only express the Ser allele and monitored Akt phosphorylation. Depletion of the Ser-1016 variant in these breast cancer cell lines did not alter Akt phosphorylation, confirming the impaired activity of this variant compared with the Leu variant (Fig. 3B).

However, the precise location of troponin relative to actin and tropomyosin remains uncertain. We have developed a method of reconstructing thin filaments using single particle analysis that does not impose the helical symmetry of actin and is independent of a starting model. We present a single particle three-dimensional reconstruction of the thin filament. Atomic models of the F-actin filament were fitted into the electron density maps and troponin and tropomyosin located. The structure provides evidence that the globular head region of troponin labels the two strands of actin with a 27.5-Å axial stagger. The density attributed to troponin appears tapered with the widest point toward the barbed end. This leads us to interpret the polarity of the troponin complex in the thin filament as reversed with respect to the widely accepted model.

The density attributed to troponin appears tapered with the widest point toward the barbed end. This leads us to interpret the polarity of the troponin complex in the thin filament as reversed with respect to the widely accepted model. Regulation of actin filament function is a fundamental biological process with implications ranging from cell migration to muscle contraction. Skeletal and cardiac muscle thin filaments consist of actin and the regulatory proteins troponin and tropomyosin. Contraction is initiated by release of Ca2+ into the sarcomere and the consequent binding of Ca2+ to regulatory sites on troponin. Troponin is believed to undergo a conformational change leading to an azimuthal movement of tropomyosin, which allows myosin heads to interact with actin, hydrolyze ATP, and generate force. The molecular basis by which troponin acts to regulate muscle contraction is only partly understood. It is essential that the structure of troponin in the thin filament at high and low Ca2+ is determined to properly understand the mechanism of regulation. The basic structure of the thin filament was described by Ebashi in 1972 (1Ebashi S. Nature. 1972; 240: 217-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this structure each tropomyosin molecule covers seven actin monomers, and there is a 27.5-Å stagger between troponin molecules. The 7-Å tropomyosin structure (2Whitby F.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proteins. 2000; 38: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the atomic model of F-actin (3Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), and the troponin “core domain” (4Vinogradova M.V. Stone D.B. Malanina G.G. Karatzaferi C. Cooke R. Mendelson R.A. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5038-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) have recently been used to generate atomic models of the thin filament in low and high Ca2+ states (5Pirani A. Vinogradova M.V. Curmi P.M. King W.A. Fletterick R.J. Craig R. Tobacman L.S. Xu C. Hatch V. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). While the position of troponin in these models was constrained by known distance measurements between filament components, the exact arrangement of the complex on the filament has not been determined a priori. Although recently published crystal structures of partial troponin complexes (4Vinogradova M.V. Stone D.B. Malanina G.G. Karatzaferi C. Cooke R. Mendelson R.A. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5038-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 6Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) have provided valuable insights into the arrangement of the globular head or core domain, the complex in its entirety has not been crystallized. Troponin is believed to consist of a globular core domain with an extended tail (7Flicker P.F. Phillips Jr., G.N. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The globular core contains the Ca2+-binding subunit (TnC), 2The abbreviations used are: EM, electron microscopy; TnC, Ca2+-binding subunit of troponin; TnI, inhibitory subunit of troponin; TnT, tropomyosin-binding subunit of troponin; PDB, Protein Data Bank. the inhibitory subunit (TnI), and the C-terminal part (residues 156–262) of the tropomyosin-binding subunit (TnT). The extended tail consists of the N-terminal part of TnT (residues 1–155). A structural rearrangement associated with Ca2+ dissociation from the troponin core has been observed (4Vinogradova M.V. Stone D.B. Malanina G.G. Karatzaferi C. Cooke R. Mendelson R.A. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5038-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) such that the helix connecting the two domains of TnC collapses, releasing the TnI inhibitory segment. It is postulated that the TnI inhibitory segment then becomes able to bind actin, in so doing biasing tropomyosin (8Brown J.H. Cohen C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 121-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To understand properly how Ca2+ binding to TnC leads to movement of tropomyosin, it is necessary to determine a high resolution structure of troponin attached to the thin filament, allowing unambiguous docking of the available crystal structures and direct observation of any changes at a molecular level caused by Ca2+ binding. Direct visualization of the thin filament is possible using electron microscopy. Tropomyosin strands have been resolved in the low and high Ca2+ states confirming the movement of tropomyosin and the steric blocking model (9Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 10Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Until recently the actin helical repeat has been imposed in the majority of reconstructions of the thin filament causing artifacts. Helical averaging using the actin repeat spreads troponin density over every actin monomer, which prevents the detailed position and shape of the troponin complex from being found (11Squire J.M. Morris E.P. Faseb. J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is possible to avoid this effect by applying a single particle approach. Individual filament images are divided into segments and each segment treated as a particle. Three-dimensional reconstruction may then be carried out by single particle techniques of alignment, classification (12van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1984; 13: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 13van Heel M. Optik. 1989; 82: 114-126Google Scholar), Euler angle assignment (14van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 15Goncharov A.B. Gefland M.S. Ultramicroscopy. 1988; 25: 317-328Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Radermacher M.

Two forms of single particle analysis have emerged: helical single particle analysis (19Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), where the determined helical symmetry is applied to the final reconstruction, and non-helical single particle analysis, which treats the complex as a truly asymmetric particle. Helical single particle analysis has been used to successfully reconstruct a myosin containing invertebrate thick filament to a resolution of 25 Å (20Woodhead J.L. Zhao F.Q. Craig R. Egelman E.H. Alamo L. Padron R. Nature. 2005; 436: 1195-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and non-helical single particle analysis has been applied to the vertebrate skeletal muscle thick filament allowing azimuthal perturbations of the myosin heads to be observed (21Al-Khayat H.A. Morris E.P. Kensler R.W. Squire J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 155: 202-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Model-based single particle image processing methods have recently been applied to the structural analysis of the vertebrate (5Pirani A. Vinogradova M.V. Curmi P.M. King W.A. Fletterick R.J. Craig R.

Trinick J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have deliberately avoided starting with a model and any potential model bias by using a reference-free alignment procedure. The adaptation of conventional procedures and their application to the structural study of the muscle thin filament has been documented (25Paul D. Patwardhan A. Squire J.M. Morris E.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Filament Isolation and Electron Microscopy—Thin filaments were isolated from goldfish (Carassius auratus) in relaxing solution as described in Kensler and Stewart (1989) (26Kensler R.W. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 391-401PubMed Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were recorded of negatively stained filaments applied to a thin carbon film support over the holes of holey carbon grids. The images were collected on a JEOL 1200EX at a nominal magnification of ×20,000. The images were digitized on a Nikon Coolscan 8000ED with a step size of 6.35 μm. The focal level of the micrographs was such that the 1st minimum in the Thon rings was at substantially higher resolution than the final resolution of our analysis (∼35 Å, see below). From an initial dataset of 29 micrographs a selection of filaments from each micrograph were assessed. The Fourier transforms were computed and the strong 59 Å actin reflection used to calibrate the magnification and adjust the sampling of each filament to 3.28 Å/pixel. Image Processing—Image processing software packages were used as follows: Imagic (28van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), the MRC suite of programs (60Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), Spider (34Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), and ImageJ (27Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Steer C.J. Bisher M.E. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The straightening of filament images, was achieved using the straighten plugin for ImageJ (27Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Steer C.J. Bisher M.E. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Helical reconstruction was carried out using adapted programs from the MRC Image package. Single Particle Analysis—The image processing package Imagic provided the framework for the single particle analysis (28van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Adaptations to the standard procedures, specific to filamentous particles, were implemented including the modified back-projection algorithm (25Paul D. Patwardhan A. Squire J.M. Morris E.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Particle Selection, Alignment, and Classification—Individual filaments were interactively selected into a large box (∼3000–4000 Å2). The filaments were straightened and subsequently segmented into smaller boxes ∼850 Å2 (128 × 128 pixels). These filament segments made up our 2638 selected particles. Particles were translationally aligned through the straightening procedure. Refinement was carried out using Spider alignment routines. Particles originating from the same filament should clearly be assigned the same polarity. The occurrence of erroneously oriented filaments was checked by monitoring the alignment procedure allowing particles that were assigned polarity inconsistent to their originating filament to be identified and subsequently removed from the data. The consistency of alignment in the final data set was found to be 87%: those segments, which were inconsistently aligned were eliminated prior to calculating the final three-dimensional map. The relatively high level of consistency is characteristic of a strongly polar structure and effective alignment. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed on the data. The hierarchical ascendant classification algorithm was then used to generate 225 classes. The images in each of these classes were summed together to create class averages with an increased signal to noise ratio. Angle Assignment and Three-dimensional Reconstruction—A helical reconstruction was calculated using the MRC helical processing routines from twelve straightened filaments. The helical reconstruction was then used to produce an “anchor set” of reference images which were evenly spaced over the Euler sphere. The “anchor set” of reference images were used to create sinograms, sets of one-dimensional line projections of each image as a function of projection angle, for use in angular reconstitution. The alternate angle assignment methods of projection matching using reference images generated from the helical reconstruction rotated about the filament axis and analysis of the central section overlap (29Patwardhan A. Paul D. Al-Khayat H.A. Morris E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 707-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were tested using the first set of class averages (generated before any multi-reference alignment was performed). Consistency between the three angle assignment methods was a criterion in angle selection to generate the first three-dimensional reconstruction. In subsequent rounds of angle assignment the angular reconstitution method was employed with an anchor set of 288 references again evenly distributed over the Euler sphere. The class averages were assigned angles with good coverage around the equator of the Euler sphere (Fig. 1). The modified exact filter back projection algorithm (25Paul D. Patwardhan A. Squire J.M. Morris E.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was applied to create a three-dimensional electron density map from two-dimensional class averages. Imposing Screw Symmetry—A novel method has been implemented to computationally sum the two strands of the thin filament. Once converted to a set of cylindrical sections (cylindrical surfaces flattened out at a fixed radius) Imagic was used to align, add, cut, and translate the images. After processing, the sections were used to create the desired averaged structure. The three-dimensional map consisting of cylindrical sections was then converted back into Cartesian coordinates. Rendering in PyMol—The three-dimensional model, electron density maps, and Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures were rendered using PyMol (61DeLano W.L. The PyMol Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). A hybrid method (using Imagic and PyMol) has been established that allows EM density maps to be displayed in PyMol at a theoretical volume corresponding to a specific molecular weight. Docking Atomic Models and Difference Analysis—Situs version 2.2 (30Wriggers W. Milligan R.A. McCammon J.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and URO (31Navaza J. Lepault J. Rey F.A. Alvarez-Rua C. Borge J. Acta Crystallogr D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were used to dock the atomic model of actin into our electron density maps. To evaluate the fit, docked PDB files were viewed in stereo in PyMol using the Nvidia Quadro Stereo System and NuVision stereoscopic glasses. Electron density models were created from the aligned PDB files within the URO software package. The PDB models and the experimental data were converted into the Imagic format and low pass filtered to 35 Å. The density models of docked F-actin and docked F-actin with docked tropomyosin were used to create the difference datasets. Two-dimensional Class Averages of the Thin Filament—A dataset of 2638 individual particles was selected from straightened thin filament images (see “Experimental Procedures”). The samples were prepared in the absence of Ca2+ and were negatively stained for electron microscopy. A typical filament is shown in Fig. 1A: periodic regions of extra density at a spacing of ∼385 Å are clearly visible, allowing particle selection centered on troponin. After a reference-free alignment procedure, which centered the particles, multivariate statistical analysis, and hierarchical ascendant classification were used to create classes of filament segments (13van Heel M. Optik. 1989; 82: 114-126Google Scholar). The members of each class were averaged to form a class average with increased signal to noise ratio. Two strands of actin subunits twisting around each other, with a crossover repeat of ∼360 Å were clearly visible in the two-dimensional class averages (Fig. 1C). These features appeared clear and well-defined from the early stages of the analysis. Each class average is representative of a particular viewing angle of the filament. 225 classes were generated in the final cycle of image processing. Euler angles were assigned to the class averages using angular reconstitution initially with a reference set of images from the helical reconstruction calculated from the same data (see below) and subsequently using the three-dimensional map generated in the previous cycle of processing. As part of the refinement procedure a careful selection of class averages was made at the stage of three-dimensional reconstruction so as only to include those with a good level of detail which agreed well with two-dimensional reprojections of the three-dimensional map. This was achieved by visual and statistical comparison between classes and reprojections of the three-dimensional map, taking into account the distribution of assigned angles. This served to ensure that only well preserved and properly aligned filament segments were used in the analysis. Accordingly, in the final round of refinement 38 classes were selected out of the 225 calculated from the full data set. The distribution of angles assigned to the final 225 class averages, the entire data set, and the 38 used in the map provided a good coverage around the equator of the Euler sphere (Fig. 1). Model tests have shown that angular reconstitution can be successfully applied using a starting model that deviates from the desired structure: a model of F-actin provides enough information to accurately assign Euler angles to projections of a model of the full thin filament (25Paul D. Patwardhan A. Squire J.M. Morris E.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alternative angle assignment methods of projection matching using projection images of the helical reconstruction as references and a method based on the extent of correlation between corresponding central sections (29Patwardhan A. Paul D. Al-Khayat H.A. Morris E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 707-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) provided consistent results. Once Euler angles had been assigned, an initial three-dimensional map was calculated using the exact filter back projection algorithm adapted for filamentous macromolecular complexes (25Paul D. Patwardhan A. Squire J.M. Morris E.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The consistency of Euler angle assignment within filaments was monitored. The Euler angles of adjacent segments assigned via projection matching was evaluated and compared with theoretical values calculated for actin filaments with 13/6 symmetry. The average departure from 13/6 symmetry of adjacent segments was 18.9° while 55% of segments were assigned angles within ±20° of the expected value and 78% within ±40° (supplemental Fig. S2). Cumulative angular disorder is known to perturb the total angle traversed by the actin one-start helix Φj (after N subunits) (32Stokes D.L. DeRosier D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) according to Equation 1.Φj=NΦ+N1/2drmsEq. 1 The average angle between adjacent subunits is Φ¯ (167°). Reported values of drms the root mean square angular deviation per subunit for actin are 5°-6° (33Egelman E.H. DeRosier D.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1299-1305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For adjacent segments centered on troponin complexes (N = 14) the cumulative disorder is thus 19°-22°, which compares closely with the value of 18.9° observed in our studies. The regulatory proteins are believed to increase rigidity of the thin filament, but even in this case substantial angular disorder has been observed (32Stokes D.L. DeRosier D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Location of Troponin—Extra density in the central region of the segments on opposing sides of the filament was apparent in most of the initial class averages: this density can be attributed to troponin. After subsequent rounds of refinement, as the data became better aligned, the density attributed to troponin became easier to visualize. The identification of densities attributed to troponin depends primarily on the orientation of the filament around its long axis. Although particularly clear in a number of classes (Fig. 1C, γ =-115°) density caused by troponin is less readily visualized in others (Fig. 1C, γ = 162°). This can be explained by the orientation of the filament: it was observed that troponin was less readily identified in orientations where it superimposes directly on top of the actin subunits. It was possible to check the location of troponin in a class average from the one-dimensional density profile (Fig. 1B). The presence of troponin was indicated by a significant peak close to the midpoint. This approach was used to assess class averages for inclusion in the three-dimensional analysis. A second peak was also often observed at a distance from the first peak close to the 385-Å troponin repeat. Comparison of Two-dimensional Class Averages with Reprojections of the Three-dimensional Map—The level of detail that can be seen in an individual class average was used as the selection criterion for inclusion in the three-dimensional analysis. Another measure of the quality of a class average and the accuracy of its angular assignment was by comparison with the reprojection of the resulting three-dimensional reconstruction at the same viewing angle. Visual similarity was used to assess the accuracy of angular assignment and the effectiveness of classification. Five typical class averages with corresponding reprojections and surface views of the three-dimensional reconstruction are displayed in Fig. 1C. The central portion of each class average is asymmetric. The class averages (Fig. 1, Ci) show good visual agreement with reprojections of the three-dimensional reconstruction (Fig. 1, Cii) as well high levels of correlation (correlation coefficients ∼0.9). Refinement of the structure was achieved by iterating over the image processing steps of alignment, classification, angle assignment, three-dimensional reconstruction, and reprojection (see “Experimental Procedures”) until no significant changes in three-dimensional density distribution were observed. The 38 class averages used in the final three-dimensional reconstruction were taken from a set of 225: the average number of segments per class in this set was ∼12. The polarity of the segments was checked for consistency with respect to other segments from the same filament: 13% proved to be inconsistent and were removed from the final refinement. The helical arrangement of the troponin complexes was exploited to improve the signal to noise ratio of our analysis. Addition of the two actin strands by translating and rotating along troponin helical path allowed a 2-fold averaging of the structure in a novel way (see Experimental Procedures). The alignment was refined further using routines in Spider (34Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar) and the two strand averaging repeated. Prior to two-strand averaging, a quantitative assessment of the resolution of the final map was made using the Fourier shell correlation criterion. The 0.5 criteria (35Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 36Bottcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) returned a resolution of 32 Å and the ½ bit criteria (37van Heel M. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) returned a resolution of 27 Å (Fig. 1D). These values are close to a qualitative estimate of ∼35 Å obtained by visually comparing our final density map to model data filtered to a known resolution. Three-dimensional Reconstruction of the Thin Filament—The three-dimensional reconstruction of the thin filament is displayed in Fig. 2 as a surface-rendered map (2A) and a wire mesh (2C). Using the known stoichiometry of binding (actin/troponin/tropomyosin, 7:1:1), we calculated the expected particle molecular mass (∼1630 kDa). Maps are contoured to include 125% of this weight assuming a protein density of 0.844 dalton/Å3. It has been reported that three-dimensional reconstructions of intermediate resolution frequently require thresholding at a higher molecular weight primarily due to the degree to which the low-spatial frequencies are represented (38Frank J. Agrawal R.K. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 589-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 39Mouche F. Zhu Y. Pulokas J. Potter C.S. Carragher B. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 144: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A range of molecular weights were trialled up to 140% and the contours of the three-dimensional map inspected carefully. An increased molecular mass improved the connectivity of the density attributed to tropomyosin up to a value of 125%. Increasing the volume further produced a noisier map. The filament has an average width of 110 ± 7 Å and at its widest point measures 141 ± 7 Å (Fig. 3B). Two strands of actin subunits clearly twist around each other in the well recognized right-handed, long pitch actin helix. The interstrand cleft is particularly clear and the subunits appear bilobed. There is an area of localized mass on each actin strand around the midpoint of the reconstruction which can be attributed to the globular part of the troponin complex. The exact axial stagger of the density peaks attributed to the globular head of troponin was found to be 27.5 Å through the alignment procedure prior to averaging the two strands.FIGURE 3Filament width.

https://openalex.org/W2094897541,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) serves as the obligate heterodimeric partner for bHLH-PAS proteins involved in sensing and coordinating transcriptional responses to xenobiotics, hypoxia, and developmental pathways. Although its C-terminal transactivation domain is dispensable for transcriptional activation in vivo, ARNT has recently been shown to use its N-terminal bHLH and/or PAS domains to interact with several transcriptional coactivators that are required for transcriptional initiation after xenobiotic or hypoxic cues. Here we show that ARNT uses a single PAS domain to interact with two coiled coil coactivators, TRIP230 and CoCoA. Both coactivators interact with the same interface on the ARNT PAS-B domain, located on the opposite side of the domain used to associate with the analogous PAS domain on its heterodimeric bHLH-PAS partner HIF-2alpha. Using NMR and biochemical studies, we identified the ARNT-interacting motif of one coactivator, TRIP230 as an LXXLL-like nuclear receptor box. Mutation of this motif and proximal sequences disrupts the interaction with ARNT PAS-B. Identification of this ARNT-coactivator interface illustrates how ARNT PAS-B is used to form critical interactions with both bHLH-PAS partners and coactivators that are required for transcriptional responses."
https://openalex.org/W1996179550,"APOBEC3G (A3G) is a cellular protein that has been identified as an innate anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) factor. One of the major functions of HIV-1 virion infectivity protein (Vif) protein is to target A3G for ubiquitination/proteasome-mediated degradation and, as a result, evade the host innate defense mechanism. Thus, we wished to devise a strategy to restore the anti-HIV activity of A3G by actively targeting it into HIV-1 virions and countering HIV-1 Vif-targeted degradation. In the current study we performed a series of proof-of-concept experiments for this strategy using as a delivery vehicle of A3G, a derivate of non-pathogenic Nef mutant Nef7 that is capable of being efficiently incorporated into HIV-1 virions. We demonstrate that the Nef7.A3G fusion protein retains several important properties of Nef7; that is, the higher virion incorporation efficiency, no PAK-2 (p21-activated kinase 2) activation, and no CD4 and major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation. Meanwhile, we show that virion incorporated Nef7.A3G possesses the anti-HIV infectivity function of A3G. Moreover, we show that virus-like particle-mediated inverse fusion delivery of Nef7.A3G into HIV-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes leads to potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication in these cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Nef7.A3G can effectively restrict HIV infection and replication by restoring the virion incorporation of A3G, even in the presence of Vif."

To explore this possibility, we generated single cysteine mutants (hcTnI-S5C and hcTnI-I19C), which were labeled with the hetero-bifunctional cross-linker benzophenone-4-maleimide. The labeled hcTnI was reconstituted to whole troponin and exposed to UV light to form cross-linked proteins. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and SDS-PAGE indicated intra- and intermolecular cross-linking with hcTnC and hcTnT. Moreover, using tandem mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing, specific intramolecular sites of interaction were determined at position Met-154 (I19C mutant) and Met-155 (S5C mutant) of hcTnI and intermolecular interactions at positions Met-47 and Met-80 of hcTnC in all conditions. Even though specific intermolecular cross-linked sites did not differ, the relative abundance of cross-linking was altered. We also measured the Ca2+-dependent ATPase rate of reconstituted thin filament-myosin-S1 preparation regulated by either cross-linked or non-labeled troponin. Ca2+ regulation of the ATPase rate was lost when the Cys-5 hcTnI mutant was cross-linked in the absence of Ca2+, but only partially inhibited with Cys-19 cross-linking in either the presence or absence of Ca2+. This result indicates different functional effects of cross-linking to Met-154 and Met-155, which are located on different sides of the hcTnI switch peptide.

An especially significant region of specialization is a unique N-terminal extension of 30–32 amino acids, which contains serial serines at positions 23/24 that are substrates for kinases that control cardiac dynamics (6Moir A.J.

Despite its significance in control of cardiac function, molecular mechanisms of how the N-terminal human cardiac troponin I (N-hcTnI) region controls sarcomeric and cardiac function remain poorly understood. There is evidence that upon phosphorylation the interaction between the N-hcTnI and the N-lobe of N-hcTnC is weakened (9Ward D.G. Brewer S.M. Calvert M.J. Gallon C.E. Gao Y. Trayer I.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4020-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Ward D.G. Brewer S.M. Cornes M.P. Trayer I.P.

Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). However, we recently reported (12Howarth J.W. Meller J. Solaro R.J. Trewhella J. Rosevear P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 706-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) the structure of the N-terminal peptide using NMR. Docking of this structure into the core troponin structure indicated the potential for a previously unappreciated intramolecular interactions of the N terminus with the regions at or near the highly basic inhibitory peptide region of cardiac troponin (12Howarth J.W. Meller J. Solaro R.J. Trewhella J. Rosevear P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 706-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Solaro R.J. Rosevear P. Kobayashi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This interaction appeared plausible not only on the basis of the structure of hcTnI, but also on the basis of the preponderance of basic amino acids in the inhibitory peptide and the presence of acidic residues in the N terminus. In experiments reported here, we tested the hypothesis that the unique N-terminal region of hcTnI engages in both intra- and intermolecular interactions. We introduced Cys residues into the N-hcTnI at positions 5 and 19 and labeled the Cys residue with the hetero-bifunctional cross-linker, BP-MAL, which upon UV irradiation cross-links to residues within ∼10 Å of the modified Cys (14Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). We analyzed the cross-linked peptides by Edman sequencing and mass spectrometry to determine specific sites of interaction. The intramolecular sites of interaction were Met-154 and Met-155 in the hcTnI switch peptide for labeled positions 19 and 5, respectively. The intermolecular cross-linking sites on N-hcTnC were 47 and 80 for hcTnI labeled at either position 5 or 19. Measurement of Ca2+-dependent ATPase rate in reconstituted preparations indicated that allosteric effects of the different specific intramolecular cross-links (position Met-154 versus Met-155) to different hydrophobic positions on the switch peptide may affect hcTnC interaction with the switch peptide. Protein Purification and Mutagenesis—hcTnT, hcTnI, and hcTnC were expressed and purified as previously described with some modifications (15Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The hcTnT cDNA was cloned into the pSBETa vector (16Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbiss H.H. BioTechniques. 1995; 19 (200): 196-198PubMed Google Scholar). Two cysteines in hcTnC were changed to serines by site-directed mutagenesis (Invitrogen). The hcTnI was cloned into pET17b (Novagen), and two mutants were generated, C80S/C97S/S5C and C80S/C97S/I19C, using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen). The hcTnI was expressed in Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen), and hcTnT and hcTnC were both expressed using BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Troponin Complex Formation and Photocross-linking—HcTnI was dissolved from a freeze-dried powder in 6 m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl. BP-MAL was added to the hcTnI in a 2:1 molar ratio. The labeling reaction was incubated at room temperature for 2 h protected from light, then quenched with 2 mm dithiothreitol (17Wang Z.Y. Sarkar S. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4953-4957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 6 m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl, and 1 m NaCl to remove unincorporated BP-MAL. The hcTnT and hcTnC were resolubilized in 6 m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl, and 1 m NaCl. The subunits were then mixed, and the rest of the troponin complex formation and purification was performed as described (15Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The troponin complex was cross-linked in the presence of Ca2+ (0.2 mm) or absence of Ca2+ (2 mm EGTA) by irradiating with 365 nm UV light on ice protected by borosilicate glass for 0–30 min (18Luo Y. Wu J.L. Li B. Langsetmo K. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Reconstituted Thin Filament and ATPase Assay—Tropomyosin was prepared from bovine left ventricle and actin from rabbit skeletal tissue as previously described (19Rarick H.M.

The myosin subfragment-1 (S1) was prepared from rabbit skeletal tissue as described (20Swartz D.R. Moss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20497-20506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To reconstitute the thin filament for actin-activated-S1 ATPase assays we mixed: 0.2 μm S1, 5 μm actin, 2 μm tropomyosin, 3.29 μm troponin in 28 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 140 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl. The final reaction conditions were: 21 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 105 mm NaCl, and 5.25 mm MgCl at 25 °C. Components were mixed in the order given: 85 μl of protein, 20 μl of Ca2+ buffer (0.1 mm Ca or 1 mm EGTA final), 15 μl of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside and purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (substrate and enzyme ratio 1:17, EnzChek Phosphate assay kit, Molecular Probes), and 20 μl of 7 mm ATP (1 mm ATP final). The inorganic phosphate was measured directly in the cuvette in real-time every 10 s for 5 min at 360 nm (21Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To compare ATPase assays, two-tailed t-tests were performed with the level of significance set at p value of <0.05 expressed as the means ± S.E. Protein and Peptide Separations—Cross-linked and non-cross-linked proteins were separated in 15% total acrylamide, 0.5% cross-linked bis-acrylamide, pH 8.8, and the stacking gel was 2.95% total acrylamide, 15% cross-linked with N,N-diallyltartardiamide, pH 6.8, as previously described (22Fritz J.D.

The troponin units were separated using a Grace Vydac C4 reversed-phase HPLC column 150 mm × 4.6 mm at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a Dionex U-3000 analytical HPLC. The mobile phase solution A (5% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was used to equilibrate the column, and protein was eluted using solution B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The linear gradient was stepped with solution B: 0% B, 0–5 min; 0–30% B, 5–20 min; 30–50% B, 20–80 min; 50–90% B, 80–85 min; 90% B, 85–90 min; 90–0% B, 90–91 min; and 0% B, 91–101 min. Protein fractions separated in the C4 column as above were digested with proteinases to generate small peptides. Endoproteinase Arg-C from Roche Applied Science was used to digest the intramolecular TnI cross-links. The final Arg-C digestion conditions were incubated overnight at 37 °C in 1 m urea, 56 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5.6 mm CaCl, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5 μgof enzyme. To digest the intermolecular cross-links between TnI and TnC, we used immobilized l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin from Pierce. Then the tryptic digests were sequentially treated with Glu-C to better digest the hcTnC. The final Glu-C digest conditions were 1 m urea, 200 mm NaCl, 40 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, and 0.2 μgof enzyme. The reaction mixtures were incubated overnight at 37 °C. After the proteins were digested into peptides, they were separated using a Dionex U-3000 capillary LC system with a C18 PepMap 150- × 0.3-mm column and a flow rate of 4 μl/min. The mobile phase solution A (5% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was used to equilibrate the column, and protein was eluted using solution B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The linear gradient was stepped with solution B: 0% B, 0–10 min; 0–60% B, 10–130 min; 60–90% B, 130–135 min; 90% B, 135–140 min; 90–0% B, 140–142 min; and 0% B, 140–160 min. Cross-linked Peptide Analysis—Peptide fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry using an ABI 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF, LTQ hybrid ion-trap/FTICR (Thermo Scientific Inc.), and a Voyager De Pro MALDI-TOF (Applied Biosystems), or by Edman sequencing using a Procise 494 cLC instrument at the W.M. Keck Foundation, Yale University. The ABI 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF was used to generate tandem mass spectrometer data using an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix as previously described (25Parker L. Engel-Hall A. Drew K. Steinhardt G. Helseth Jr., D.L. Jabon D. McMurry T. Angulo D.S. Kron S.J. J. Mass Spectrom. 2008; 43: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The samples used for direct infusion via static spray into the LTQ-FTICR were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The sample was loaded into a coated nanospray emitter with a 4-μm inner diameter (New Objective Inc.) and a 1.5-kV spray voltage. The peptide peaks were manually detected and selected for MS2 fragmentation using collision-induced dissociation (26Yuan C. Sheng Q. Tang H. Li Y. Zeng R. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 295: H647-H656Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The use of the Voyager DE Pro was similar to the ABI 4700, except 150 shots were performed. All mass spectrometry experiments were repeated in full at least four times. The analysis of the mass spectrometry data were largely done manually. However, Edman sequencing and use of software “Links” were helpful in first determining the cross-linked peptides (27Yu E.T. Hawkins A. Kuntz I.D. Rahn L.A. Rothfuss A. Sale K. Young M.M. Yang C.L.

After determining cross-linked peptides, manual tandem mass spectrometry analysis was manageable. With cross-linking experiments it is not possible to use the normal search algorithms. Using the peptide known to be cross-linked, manual de novo sequencing was done to determine the b/y ions that corresponded to the cross-linked peptide complex and thus determine site-specific cross-links. The suspected cross-linked peptide complex was input into an MS/MS fragment ion calculator from the Institute for Systems Biology available on the web allowing matching of experimental to theoretical b/y ions, and with trial and error we determined the specific cross-linking site. PyMOL software was used to create Fig. 6C using available crystal structure (PDB: 1J1D). 3W. L. DeLano (2002) The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, DeLano Scientific, Palto Alto, CA. We used SDS-PAGE analysis to determine if the N-hcTnI cross-links to itself or other units of troponin. A time-based response of BP-MAL to exposure of 365 nm light showed cross-linking at positions 5 and 19 of the N-hcTnI with itself and other troponin units (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1A the S5C hcTnI mutant cross-linked to itself (I-I), hcTnC (I-C), and hcTnT (I-T) in the lanes designated “T-I-C ± Ca” from 0- to 30-min exposure to light. In addition, the binary complex of hcTnI and hcTnC (I-C ± Ca) showed similar inter- and intramolecular cross-linking with hcTnI and hcTnC as seen in the left part of Fig. 1A. We included non-labeled hcTnI incorporated into a troponin complex as a negative control for breakdown. The N-hcTnI labeled with BP-MAL at position 19 cross-linked to all troponin subunits, but there were less cross-linked bands compared with position 5. This may be due to the increased reach of position 5 being at a more terminal end compared with position 19. Fig. 2A shows results in which we determined Ca2+-dependent ATPase rate of reconstituted thin filament-myosin-S1 preparations regulated by a control troponin complex containing hcTnI (S5C or I19C) non-labeled or labeled with BP-MAL and cross-linked in the absence or presence of Ca2+ prior to reconstitution into thin filaments. Ca2+ regulation of ATPase rate was similar for controls and for preparations regulated by troponin (hcTnI-S5C) cross-linked in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). However, Ca2+ regulation was lost in preparations reconstituted with troponin (hcTnI-S5C) cross-linked in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B there was regulation of Ca2+ activation of ATPase rate, albeit blunted, in preparations regulated by troponin (hcTnI-I19C) compared with non-labeled troponin (no BP-MAL) independent of whether cross-linked in presence or absence of Ca2+. We also established specific cross-linked sites. Our first step was to separate the cross-linked proteins and subsequent digested peptides by HPLC. To separate the whole troponin cross-linked (dark line) and non-cross-linked subunits (light line), we used a reversed-phase C4 column evaluated at 280 nm as shown in Fig. 3A. The cross-linked proteins and peptides are represented by the horizontal bars through the peaks (Fig. 3). The cross-linked proteins were manually fractionated and digested for determination of sites of intramolecular cross-linking using endoproteinase Arg-C (Fig. 3, B and D) and for intermolecular cross-linking sequentially with immobilized trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C (Fig. 3, C and E). The intramolecular cross-links illustrated in Fig. 3 (B and D) are represented as dark lines, and the light lines are non-cross-linked and digested TnI used as negative controls to help identify cross-linked peptides. The manually collected peptide fractions were analyzed with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to confirm the cross-linked fractions. To determine cross-linked peptides, we used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). The cross-linked peptide complex has three components depicted the N-hcTnI on top of the complex, the cross-linker (BP-MAL) in the middle, and the peptide cross-linked on the bottom of the complex. As shown in Fig. 4 (A–F) we were able to fragment the components as well as the intact complex allowing for more confidence in our peptide assignment. Once the cross-linked fractions were determined by MALDI-TOF, fractions were analyzed by either Edman sequencing or tandem mass spectrometry. The intramolecular cross-linked fraction illustrated in Fig. 3B was Edman sequenced, and both cross-linked and non-cross-linked peptides were present; however, the cross-linked peptides were in higher abundance (Table 1). The most abundant intermolecular cross-linked fraction (Fig. 3E) was Edman sequenced, and both cross-linked and non-cross-linked peptides were present (Table 2). The Edman sequencing results supported the cross-linked peptide designations from the MALDI-TOF experiments.TABLE 1Edman sequence of peptides from C18 Arg-C digested fraction from Fig. 3B (intramolecular cross-link S5C)CycleX-link TnI (2-6)X-link TnI (149-163)Non-X-link TnI (52-66)1A 35.2I 44.4T 9.52D 20.3S 19.5L 9.53G 7.1A 19.8L 8.14NDaND, not determined quantitatively due to low yields.D 16.9L 7.45S 4.4A 12.6Q 5.36M 1.6I 4.57M 3.2A 8.68Q 4.8ND9A 7.8Q 4.510L 3.0E 2.111L 5.2L 5.212G 2.1E 1.513A 2.3R 0.714R 0.6E 1.015A 1.7a ND, not determined quantitatively due to low yields.

The triply charged precursor ion 2608 was static sprayed into an LTQ-FTICR to determine the specific intramolecular cross-link of the S5C mutant specifically to aa Met-155 of hcTnI (Fig. 5A).

The doubly charged precursor ion 2055 was static sprayed into an LTQ-FTICR to determine the specific intermolecular cross-link of the S5C mutant specifically to amino acid Met-80 of TnC (Fig. 5C). The triply charged precursor ion 2454 was static sprayed into an LTQ-FTICR to determine the specific intramolecular cross-link of the I19C mutant specifically to aa Met-154 of hcTnI (Fig. 5D). The singly charged precursor ion 2491 was infused into an ABI 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF to determine the specific intermolecular cross-link of the I19C mutant specifically to aa Met-47 of TnC (Fig. 5E). The singly charged precursor ion 1901 was infused into an ABI 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF to determine the specific intermolecular cross-link of the I19C mutant specifically to amino acid Met-80 of hcTnC (Fig. 5F). Our data are the first to identify specific sites of intramolecular interactions between the unique N terminus of hcTnI and the switch peptide (∼149–162) at Met-154 and Met-155. Under all conditions we also identified sites of intermolecular cross-linking between N-hcTnI at I19C and S5C and positions Met-47 and Met-80 of N-hcTnC. Moreover, measurements of Ca2+ regulation of ATPase rate revealed insights into the interaction of the N-hcTnI with hcTnI Met-154 and Met-155. As discussed below these new insights on the role of Met residues in the switch peptide comes from our data on the different effects of cross-linked products with BP-Mal located at position 19 of hcTnI (cross-linked to Met-154) versus BP-MAL located at position 5 of the N terminus (cross-linked to Met-155). In thin filaments reconstituted with troponin-containing hcTnI-I19C there was intramolecular cross-linking to Met-154, and Ca2+ was able to partially switch on myosin-S1 ATPase activity (Fig. 2B) whether the cross-linking was carried out in either the presence or absence of Ca2+. However, when thin filaments were regulated by hcTnI-S5C with an intramolecular cross-link to Met-155, Ca2+ regulation was completely lost, when the cross-linking was carried out in the absence of Ca2+. There are several possibilities for the differential Ca2+ regulation with hcTnI-I19C compared with hcTnI-S5C mutant. One possibility as illustrated in Fig. 6, is that Met-154 (cross-linked from I19C) exists on a different side of the switch peptide from Met-155 (cross-linked to S5C) (28Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Met-155 is more exposed and accessible compared with the Met 154 in the core crystal structure in the presence of Ca2+. The 10-Å distance of the cross-linker along with the flexibility of the N-hcTnI (11Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 12Howarth J.W. Meller J. Solaro R.J. Trewhella J. Rosevear P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 706-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) should allow for the interaction as depicted in Fig. 6. Thus we speculate when cross-linking occurred at Met-154 there was a more prominent effect on the closed state by reducing the movement of the complex not allowing hcTnC to fully open, or by stabilizing the closed state of hcTnC to a greater extent. Moreover, the N-hcTnI likely moves to a different position when interacting with either Met-155 or Met-154 allowing for different stabilizing effects of the switch peptide. The Ca2+ binding site of hcTnC may be affected by the interaction between N-hcTnI and Met-154 as depicted in Fig. 6A. Conversely when the N-hcTnI cross-links with Met-155 the N-hcTnI may move around to the other side of the N-hcTnC, which allows for normal Ca2+ regulation when cross-linked in the presence of Ca2+ Fig. 6B. When cross-linked in the absence of Ca2+ the conformation of hcTnC is likely different and this different interaction of the N-hcTnI with hcTnC may contribute to the ablation of Ca2+ regulation. As proposed by Baryshnikova et al. (29Baryshnikova O.K. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 735-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Li et al. (28Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), there is also the possibility that cross-linking of the N-hcTnI to the switch peptide induces an allosteric effect influencing hcTnC conformation. In the case of Met-155 the N-hcTnI may hold the switch peptide in a conformation that inhibits normal allosteric effects on hcTnC conformation. The position of I19C relative to S5C in hcTnI structure may also be responsible for the different effects of the cross-linked products on Ca2+ control of ATPase rate. Position 19 is closer to the core structure of troponin than position 5 and, when cross-linked, may retard the interaction of the switch peptide with N-hcTnC thus stabilizing the closed state of hcTnC. Our demonstration of relatively abundant cross-linking for N-hcTnI-I19C to hcTnC is consistent with a previous report (10Ward D.G. Brewer S.M. Cornes M.P. Trayer I.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10324-10332Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and may contribute to the blunted response to Ca2+. Therefore, position hcTnI-I19C interacting with N-hcTnC (suspected Met-47 see “Discussion” below) may be the intermolecular site responsible for the blunted response to Ca2+ in the N-hcTnI-I19C mutant. It is also possible that differences in Ca2+ regulation of thin filaments regulated by hcTnI-S5C and hcTnI-I19C are due to increased cross-linked products in the S5C mutant involving troponin T. Compared with results obtained with hcTnI-I19C, Ca2+ regulation was completely lost, when the cross-linking was carried out in the absence of Ca2+ in thin filaments regulated by hcTnI-S5C with an intramolecular cross-link to Met-155. This result indicates that the conformational state in the absence of Ca2+ is such that, when cross-linked at Met-155 and then reconstituted into the thin filament, the troponin complex is locked in a closed state. Once cross-linked in the absence of Ca2+ the closed state may interfere with Ca2+ binding to hcTnC, however, due to the flexibility of the N-hcTnI the Ca2+ binding site of hcTnC should only be partially blocked. Our data support the idea of flexibility in N-hcTnI based on multiple sites of interaction identified at the same point of time during cross-linking. In addition, the specific cross-linking sites of N-hcTnI (S5C mutant) to hcTnT may be different and cause the loss of Ca2+ regulation. We were not able to determine specific sites for hcTnT due to low yields from the HPLC (retention time 47.4 min in Fig. 3A). The intermolecular cross-linking sites N-hcTnC from N-hcTnI were at positions Met-47 and Met-80. The Met-47 and Met-80 flank the switch peptide with Met-47 being more exposed to the surface and the Met-80 residue being more internally positioned in a similar fashion as the Met-155 and Met-154 cross-links (Fig. 6C). The relative abundance of site-specific intermolecular cross-linking could not be definitively determined with mass spectrometry or SDS-PAGE. However, the intramolecular cross-linking abundance was not greatly changed from hcTnI position 5 and 19 based on SDS-PAGE. We found two cross-linked protein bands migrating at different positions in SDS-PAGE corresponding to an I-C complex. We were unable to use in gel digests to identify specific sites due to low yield. Thus we used in-solution digests, which were much more efficient, and only then were we able to obtain enough cross-linked peptide to determine the specific sites of interaction. We were unable to determine specifically which band corresponded to which cross-link due to incomplete separation using HPLC. We think the SDS-PAGE band difference arises from the two sites identified as Met-47 and Met-80; one site is exposed in the Ca2+ saturated structure (Met-47), whereas the other is embedded (internally located) in the N-lobe. Based on the structure (Fig. 6C) and accessibility, the I-C2 is likely the cross-link with Met-47 and the I-C1 is from the Met-80. The intramolecular cross-linking efficiency did not change significantly in ±Ca2+ conditions nor did the intermolecular cross-linking of hcTnI to hcTnT suggesting the proximities or efficiency of cross-linking was not affected by ± Ca2+. Our data have important implications with regard to advancing our understanding of the role of N-hcTnI. The N-terminal peptide of hcTnI is now known to be a critical factor in control of cardiac dynamics (13Solaro R.J. Rosevear P. Kobayashi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13471-13477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although the last ∼12 amino acids of the N-terminal extension of cTnI are highly conserved, there are significant differences in the primary structure of the first 20 amino acids of cTnI in hearts of large and small animals. For example, the first 20 amino acids in both human and mouse cTnI are acidic; however, the mouse has more of a net negative charge than the human isoform due to an additional glutamic acid and a lack of two basic arginines. Our identification of the intramolecular sites of interaction of the hcTnI N-terminal region with the hcTnI switch peptide provides a basis for further testing hypotheses for the relation between primary structure of the N-terminal peptide of cTnI and tuning the contraction/relaxation dynamics of the heart to heart rate.

https://openalex.org/W2106850092,"Estrogen (E2) signaling is conveyed by the transcription factors estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta. ERs modulate the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation, motility, and death. The regulation of transcription by E2-ERalpha through binding to estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) in DNA constitutes the ERE-dependent signaling pathway. E2-ERalpha also modulates gene expression by interacting with transregulators bound to cognate DNA-regulatory elements, and this regulation is referred to as the ERE-independent signaling pathway. The relative importance of the ERE-independent pathway in E2-ERalpha signaling is unclear. To address this issue, we engineered an ERE-binding defective ERalpha mutant (ERalpha(EBD)) by changing residues in an alpha-helix of the protein involved in DNA binding to render the receptor functional only through the ERE-independent signaling pathway. Using recombinant adenovirus-infected ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells derived from a breast adenocarcinoma, we found that E2-ERalpha(EBD) modulated the expression of a subset of ERalpha-responsive genes identified by microarrays and verified by quantitative PCR. However, E2-ERalpha(EBD) did not affect cell cycle progression, cellular growth, death, or motility in contrast to E2-ERalpha.ERalpha(EBD) in the presence of E2 was also ineffective in inducing phenotypic alterations in ER-negative U-2OS cells derived from an osteosarcoma. E2-ERalpha, on the other hand, effectively repressed growth in this cell line. Our findings suggest that genomic responses from the ERE-dependent signaling pathway are required for E2-ERalpha to induce alterations in cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2081243758,"Epigenetic silencing involving the aberrant DNA methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands is one mechanism leading to the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this event remains poorly understood. TMS1/ASC is a novel proapoptotic signaling factor that is subject to epigenetic silencing in human breast and other cancers. The TMS1 promoter is embedded within a CpG island that is unmethylated in normal cells and is spanned by three DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS). Silencing of TMS1 in cancer cells is accompanied by local alterations in histone modification, remodeling of the HS, and hypermethylation of DNA. In this study, we probed the functional significance of the CpG island-specific HS. We identified a methylation-sensitive complex that bound a 55-bp intronic element corresponding to HS2. Affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry identified a component of this complex to be the GA-binding protein (GABP) α. Supershift analysis indicated that the GABPα binding partner, GABPβ1, was also present in the complex. The HS2 element conferred a 3-fold enhancement in TMS1 promoter activity, which was dependent on both intact tandem ets binding sites and the presence of GABPα/β1 in trans. GABPα was selectively enriched at HS2 in human cells, and its occupancy was inversely correlated with CpG island methylation. Down-regulation of GABPα led to a concomitant decrease in TMS1 expression. These data indicate that the intronic HS2 element acts in cis to maintain transcriptional competency at the TMS1 locus and that this activity is mediated by the ets transcription factor, GABPα.

Methylation of DNA in the human genome is tightly controlled during development by the action of DNA methyltransferases. DNA methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the carbon-5 position of cytosine in the dinucleotide 5′-CpG-3′. This epigenetic mark is copied after DNA synthesis, providing a heritable memory of transcriptional status. Overall, CpG dinucleotides are depleted in the human genome except in CpG islands (1Plass C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2479-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). CpG islands are ∼200 bp to several kb in length and are found mainly in the 5′-regions of 70% of human genes (2Cross S.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Most CpG dinucleotides in the genome are heavily methylated whereas, in contrast, the CpG sites in the CpG islands, especially those associated with gene promoters, are usually unmethylated. Aberrant methylation of such CpG islands is associated with inappropriate gene silencing and has been implicated in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human cancers.At present, the mechanisms underlying cancer-associated CpG island methylation are unknown. There are at least two mechanisms in which aberrant DNA methylation is thought to contribute to stable gene repression. DNA methylation can affect gene expression through its affects on local chromatin structure. Methylated DNA is recognized by methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins, which are components of repressor complexes that contain histone deacetylases and other chromatin modifying activities (1Plass C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2479-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Histone deactylase-mediated deacetylation of lysine residues (e.g. H3K9) allows for their subsequent methylation by histone methyltransferases and recruitment of methyl lysine-binding proteins such as HP1 leading to a compact chromatin configuration. Indeed, cancer-associated methylation of CpG islands is associated with a shift to a more compact chromatin structure characterized by hypoacetylated histones H3 and H4 and a shift in the histone methylation pattern from H3 methylated at K4 to H3 methylated at K9 (3Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349: 2042-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar) and/or K27 (4Swigut T. Wysocka J. Cell. 2007; 131: 29-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). DNA methylation can also play a more direct role in the transcriptional response by interfering with the binding of some transcription factors (e.g. AP-2, E2F, c-myc, NF-κB) (5Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) or by influencing long-range chromatin interactions, for example, by blocking the binding of the chromatin insulator and enhancer blocker CTCF (6Zhao H.

TMS1/ASC is also widely expressed in epithelial cells, where it is up-regulated in response to cell stress stimuli, such as the death ligands TNFα and TRAIL (17Parsons M.J. Vertino P.M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6948-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Overexpression or forced oligomerization of TMS1 in epithelial cells promotes a caspase-8-dependent cell death (17Parsons M.J. Vertino P.M.

Recently, we showed that TMS1 plays a critical role in anoikis, or apoptosis induced in response to the loss of integrin-mediated contacts with the substratum, in breast epithelial cells (20Parsons M.J. Patel P. Brat D.J. Colbert L. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1706-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Aberrant methylation of the TMS1/ASC CpG island is frequently observed in primary breast cancers, and loss of TMS1 expression accompanies the transition from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma in primary breast lesions (20Parsons M.J. Patel P. Brat D.J. Colbert L. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1706-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that epigenetic silencing of TMS1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancers by allowing cells to bypass normal cell death cues in the early stages of cancer progression.Little is known about the transcriptional regulation of TMS1, and the mechanisms underlying its epigenetic silencing during tumorigenesis remain unclear. In normal cells and breast cancer cells that retain TMS1 expression, the TMS1 CpG island is unmethylated, and exhibits an “active” chromatin signature characterized by hyperacetylated histones H3 and H4, enrichment of H3K4me2, and positioned nucleosomes (21Stimson K.M. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Kapoor-Vazirani P. Kagey J.D. Powell D.R. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6810-6821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Three DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS) span the CpG island in the active state; HS1 and HS3 mark the boundaries between unmethylated CpG island DNA and densely methylated flanking DNA, whereas HS2 forms at the center of the CpG island (21Stimson K.M. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Epigenetic silencing of TMS1 in breast cancer is accompanied by the remodeling of the CpG island-associated HS sites, hypoacetylation of histones, a shift in histone methylation status, and hypermethylation of DNA (21Stimson K.M. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Kapoor-Vazirani P. Kagey J.D. Powell D.R. Vertino P.M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6810-6821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These findings have led us to propose that there may be an activity and/or a structural barrier occurring at the level of chromatin, and marked by the HS sites, that protects the TMS1 CpG island from methylation in normal cells. Loss of function at these sites might allow for aberrant methylation, changes in chromatin structure and gene silencing.In this study, we sought to characterize the functional significance of the TMS1 CpG island-associated HS sites. We identified a novel protein complex that binds to HS2, located within intron 1 of the TMS1 gene. Using DNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry we identified a component of this complex to be the ets family transcription factor GA-binding protein α (GABPα). We find that GABPα binds TMS1 at HS2 in a methylation-sensitive manner in vitro and in vivo, and acts as a positive mediator of TMS1 expression. These data indicate that GABPα acts in trans to maintain transcriptional competency at the TMS1 locus, and suggest that methylation-mediated inhibition of GABP binding may be one factor contributing to the stable repression of TMS1 in cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Nuclear Extracts—Cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 20 packed cell volumes of ice-cold 0.67× phosphate-buffered saline, swollen on ice 10 min, pelleted, and resuspended in 5 packed cell volumes of ice-cold hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were Dounce homogenized with a Type B pestle and nuclei were harvested by centrifugation at 3300 × g. Nuclei were resuspended in ½ packed cell volume of Buffer A, followed by the addition of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0–1.5 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) to a final concentration of 750 mm NaCl. Nuclei were extracted for 30 min at 4 °C. Clarified nuclear extracts were dialyzed (6,000–8,000 Mr) against Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 5 h, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).Mobility Shift Assays—The HS2–236bp probe was amplified by PCR using the “HS2” primers from Stimson-Crider et al. (21Stimson K.M. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All other probes were either amplified by PCR followed by purification on Promega Wizard® Minicolumns (catalog number A7170) or were synthesized as single-stranded oligonucleotides and annealed. Probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions (20 μl) were performed at room temperature for 30 min and contained nuclear extract (5–10 μg) plus 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and ∼20 fmol of end-labeled double-stranded DNA (∼50,000 cpm) in 1× Binding Buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). Competitor DNA was included at 100-fold molar excess unless otherwise indicated. For supershift analysis, antibodies (GABPβ1, sc-13444, Santa Cruz) were added to binding reaction after an initial 30 min and followed by an additional 20-min incubation. Samples were electrophoresed at 25 mA on 4% polyacrylamide 0.5× TBE gels, dried onto Whatman paper, and exposed to x-ray film (Biomax-MS, Kodak). Probe and competitor sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1.DNase I Footprinting—A 107-bp fragment of HS2 (supplemental Table 1) was amplified by PCR, gel purified, and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Unincorporated radioactivity was removed and the labeled product (4 ng) was digested with either HhaI or NlaIV followed by gel purification to generate fragments labeled on either the sense or antisense strand. Binding conditions were as described above and contained ∼20 fmol (20,000 cpm) of labeled probe and 25 μg of nuclear extract per 20 μl of reaction. After 30 min, MgCl2 (5 mm) and DNase I (0 to 30 ng) were added, and the reaction was carried out for another 2 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1% SDS, 30 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, and DNA was recovered by phenol: chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended in 2× loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, and electrophoresed on an 8 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide (19:1), 1× TBE sequencing gel at 80 watts. The gels were dried onto Whatman paper and exposed to x-ray film (Biomax MR, Kodak).Cation Exchange Chromatography—HeLa S3 cells (24 liters) were grown as spinner cultures to a density of 106 cells/ml. Nuclear extract (207 mg) was prepared as described above and applied to a 50-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (17-0729-01, Amersham Biosciences) cation exchange column in 1× binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin). The column was eluted stepwise with 3 column volumes each of 50 mm, 100 mm, 250 mm, 500 mm, and 1 m NaCl in 1× Binding Buffer. Fractions (8.5 ml) were collected, and binding activity monitored by mobility shift assays using the HS2–55bp fragment as a probe in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of HS2–55bp methylated in vitro with M.SssI. Binding activity corresponding to the methylation-sensitive Complex A eluted in 250 mm NaCl between fractions 46 and 48.DNA Affinity Purification—To prepare DNA affinity matrices, oligonucleotides (5′-phospho) corresponding to each strand of the HS2–55bp binding site plus a 5′-GATC overhang were synthesized and annealed. The resulting double-stranded DNA was oligomerized by ligation at room temperature for 4 h to an average length of 200–500 bp, and coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose-4B (∼200 μg of DNA per 1.5-ml bed volume) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). After successive washes in 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 m potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 m KCl, and H2O, the affinity columns were equilibrated with 10 column volumes of Binding Buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin). Unmethylated and methylated affinity columns were prepared by incorporating oligonucleotides that were either unmethylated or methylated on both strands at the two CpG sites.Fractions containing peak HS2 binding activity from the cation exchange column were pooled and dialyzed against 1× Binding Buffer. Poly(dI-dC) (180 μg/15 ml of sample) was added and insoluble material removed by centrifugation. The cleared sample was allowed to bind in bulk to a 1-ml affinity matrix consisting of the fully methylated HS2–55bp oligomer for 2 h at 4 °C. The flow-through fractions were then applied to a second 1-ml affinity column consisting of the unmethylated HS2–55bp oligomer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of 1× Binding Buffer and eluted with 3 column volumes of 500 mm NaCl. Fractions (250 μl) were collected and methylation-sensitive binding activity monitored as described above. Two additional rounds of binding and elution (500 mm NaCl) from the unmethylated HS2–55bp column were performed, with an additional 250 mm NaCl step added to the third elution. HS2 binding activity (Complex A) eluted in the 250 mm step. Fractions containing peak binding activity were precipitated in trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, dried at 37 °C, and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. The pH was adjusted to ∼8.0 with 1 m Tris base. Samples were separated on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with Gel Code Blue (Pierce 24590). Bands co-eluting with HS2 binding activity were excised and submitted to the Emory University Microchemical Facility for MALDI tandem MS/MS mass spectroscopy analysis.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Cells were cross-linked for 10 min in 1% formaldehyde at room temperature. ChIP was carried out essentially as described in the Acetyl-histone H3 Immunoprecipitation Assay Kit (Millipore) except that MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells were subject to a two-step lysis procedure in which nuclei were first harvested in Cell Lysis Buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) followed by lysis of nuclei in Nuclei Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green detection. Reactions (25 μl) contained 1 μl of DNA, 0.2 μm primers, and 12.5 μl of IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The reaction was subjected to a hot start for 3 min at 95 °C and cycles of 95 °C, 10 s; 55–60 °C, 60 s. Melt curve analysis was performed to verify a single product species. Starting quantities were determined relative to a common standard curve generated using MCF7 genomic DNA. Fold enrichment is calculated as the percent of input DNA immunoprecipitated by the GABPα antibody relative to that of a non-specific control antibody at each primer pair. Primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. Antibodies used were GABPα (sc-22810, Santa Cruz), rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz), or ApafI (AB16941, Chemicon).Plasmid Constructs and Luciferase Reporter Assays—A genomic SmaI-NcoI fragment containing 263 bp upstream of the TMS1 translation start codon was cloned in-frame into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) to generate p-min-TMS1. A 236-bp fragment containing HS2 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the SmaI site of p-min-TMS1 upstream of the TMS1 promoter to create pTMS1-HS2sense. Constructs in which one or the other GABP binding site (pTMS1-HS2-m1, pTMS1-HS2-m2), or both GABP binding sites (pTMS1-HS2-dm) were created by deleting the 4-bp central core (GGAA/T) of each site using the QuikChange® Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). All clones were verified by sequencing. Primers used to generate the mutation are listed in supplemental Table S1.MCF7 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected the next day with 1 μg of the reporter plasmids using the Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) reagent. A Renilla luciferase reporter (200 ng, pRL-TK, Promega) was included as a control for transfection efficiency. After 48 h, cells were lysed and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). For experiments incorporating GABPα/β siRNA, MCF7 cells (5 × 104) were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected the following day with 200 ng of reporter plasmids and 40 ng of pRL-TK control plus 10 pmol each of GABPα and GABPβ siRNA (Invitrogen Stealth™ Select, supplemental Table S1) or 20 pmol of scrambled siRNA using 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Luciferase activities were determined after 48 h as described above.Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture, Roche), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. Total protein (25 μg) was separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad), and probed with the indicated primary antibody. Immunocomplexes were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). For the analysis of luciferase lysates, cell lysates were prepared by 15 min incubation with 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega). The antibodies used were: anti-ASC (ProteinTech), GABPα (Santa-Cruz), GABPβ1/2 (Santa-Cruz), and GAPDH (Abcam).Lentiviral shRNA Production and Infection—293T cells were transfected with the viral packaging plasmid, psPAX2 (900 ng); viral envelope plasmid, pMD2G-VSV-G (100 ng); and the pLKO.1 vector (1 μg) or pLKO.1 containing a short hairpin sequence targeting GABPα (number 18288–18292, Open Bio-systems) using the FuGENE 6 reagent. After 18 h, the transfection medium was replaced with high serum growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 30% fetal bovine serum). Supernatant containing lentiviral particles was harvested at 24 and 48 h, combined, and stored at –80 °C. MCF7 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates and infected with 0.5 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. At 24 h post-infection, cells were placed under puromycin selection (0.5 μg/ml) and harvested 5 days later for immunoblot analysis.RESULTSIdentification of a Methylation-sensitive HS2 DNA Binding Activity—The human TMS1 gene spans about 3.5 kb on chromosome 16. A 5′ CpG island spans the promoter, first exon, and part of intron 1 (Fig. 1A). In normal diploid fibroblasts and breast epithelial cells where TMS1 is expressed, the CpG island is encompassed by a 1.2-kb unmethylated domain flanked by heavily methylated DNA (21Stimson K.M. Vertino P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In previous work (21Stimson K.M. Vertino P.M. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 6810-6821Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we have shown that this domain is spanned by positioned nucleosomes and marked by hyperacetylated histones H3 and H4 (H3Ac, H4Ac), and dimethylated at histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2). Four DNase I-hypersensitive sites were identified, three of which are within the CpG island domain and form only when the CpG island is unmethylated. HS1 and HS3 demarcate the boundaries between the unmethylated CpG island and heavily methylated flanking DNA, whereas HS2 resides in the center of the CpG island, near the exon 1/intron 1 interface (Fig. 1A). Silencing of TMS1 in DNA methyltransferase 1 overexpressing cells or certain breast cancer cell lines (e.g. MDA-MB231 cells) is associated with dense methylation of the CpG island, hypoacetylation of H3 and H4, a shift in histone methylation from H3K4me2 to H3K9me2/3, and remodeling of the CpG island-associated DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS1–HS3) (21Stimson K.M.

A fourth HS maps to a region 1 kb downstream of the CpG island and forms independently of the methylation status of the CpG island or gene expression. We hypothesized that there may be DNA-binding proteins defined by the HS sites that protect the CpG island from methylation in normal cells, and that loss of function at these sites might contribute to aberrant methylation, changes in chromatin structure, and gene silencing.As an initial screen, we utilized mobility shift assays to examine the pattern of nuclear factor binding to probes encompassing the regions surrounding HS1, HS2, or HS3, and compared nuclear extracts prepared from cells that are unmethylated at the CpG island and express TMS1 (IMR90) and cells in which TMS1 is methylated and silent (HMT.1E1) (Fig. 1A). We also examined complex binding to HS probes either unmethylated or methylated in vitro with M.SssI and S-adenosylmethionine. There was little difference in the pattern of nuclear factor binding to the HS1 and HS3 probes between nuclear extracts from IMR90 and HMT.1E1 cells, and methylation of the probes had no impact on nuclear factor binding (data not shown). In contrast, we observed a reduced mobility species that bound to a 236-bp probe encompassing HS2 (HS2–236bp) that was sensitive to the methylation status of the probe (Fig. 1B). This complex could be competed by a 100-fold excess of unmethylated, unlabeled (cold) competitor but not by a similar level of cold competitor methylated in vitro with M.SssI (Fig. 1B). There were several additional reduced mobility species that bound to the HS2–236bp probe, but these were not sensitive to DNA methylation and could be competed by similar concentrations of unlabeled methylated and unmethylated competitor DNA (Fig. 1B). We examined nuclear extracts from fibroblast-derived (IMR90, SV40-immortalized IMR90 (90SV)) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, and HS578T) for the presence of this methylation-sensitive binding activity. All cell lines tested contained the methylatio"

This study reveals a novel role of p150, but not p60, in gene-specific transcriptional activation. We found that p150 transcriptionally activated an essential viral promoter, the major immediate early promoter (MIEP) of the human cytomegalovirus, independently of p60. Knocking down p150 decreased the MIEP function in both transfected and virally infected cells. The chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and the in vitro protein-DNA binding assay demonstrated that p150 used its KER domain to associate with the MIEP from –593 to –574 bp. The N-terminal 244 residues were also found essential for p150-mediated MIEP activation, likely through recruiting the acetyltransferase p300 to acetylate local histones. Domain swapping experiments further showed that the KER and the N terminus of p150 acted as an independent DNA binding and transcriptional activation domain, respectively. Because p60 did not seem involved in the reaction, together these results indicate for the first time that p150 directly activates transcription, independently of its histone deposition function.

The 938 amino acid multidomain p150 binds via its C-terminal third to p60, which is an essential step for nucleosome assembly because knocking down either subunit disrupts the activity (2Takami Y.

In addition, CAF1 facilitates DNA synthesis depending on the binding of the N-terminal 31 residues of p150 to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which acts as a sliding clamp to stimulate the processivity of DNA polymerase (5Shibahara K.

The internal region of p150 contains two large bunches of charge residues called KER (a region enriched in lysine, glutamic acid, and arginine) and ED (a region enriched in glutamic acid and aspartic acid) domains, which are thought to be the binding sites for acetylated histones H3 and H4 (1Kaufman P.D.

Chem. 2006; 281: 9560-9568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p150 exists in a chromatin-remodeling complex WINAC, which coactivates ligand-induced transactivation function of the vitamin D receptor (17Kitagawa H. Fujiki R. Yoshimura K. Mezaki Y. Uematsu Y. Matsui D. Ogawa S. Unno K. Okubo M. Tokita A. Nakagawa T. Ito T. Ishimi Y. Nagasawa H. Matsumoto T. Yanagisawa J. Kato S.

Currently, these effects are thought to be controlled by the global chromatin structure that requires CAF1-mediated nucleosome assembly.Although p150, p60, and p48 cosediment in the fraction that exhibits the nucleosome assembly activity (7Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), each of the CAF1 subunits also displays its unique distribution pattern, especially during S phase of the cell cycle (18Marheineke K. Krude T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15279-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This implicates that each subunit may have additional roles beyond chromatin assembly, and the additional functions may not require them to complex with one another. In mouse cells, p150, but not p60, regulates progression of the middle-to-late S phase and promotes the replication of pericentric heterochromatin via interacting with the HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) (19Quivy J.P. Gerard A. Cook A.J. Roche D. Almouzni G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). p150 interacts with HP1 α/γ and the MBD1 (methyl-CpG binding domain protein 1) through its N- and C-terminal regions, respectively, and may guide them to heterochromatin regions (14Quivy J.P.

Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Whether CAF1 subunits have other independent functions remains to be explored.Previously, a yeast two-hybrid assay was used to screen for proteins associating with the immediate early protein 2 (IE2) of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (24Huang C.F. Wang Y.C. Tsao D.A. Tung S.F. Lin Y.S. Wu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We identified that the p150 fragment aa 87–938 interacted with the C-terminal half (aa 291–579) of IE2. Because proteins obtained using this strategy, such as Nrf1 and Nrf2 (24Huang C.F. Wang Y.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), antagonized the IE2-mediated transcriptional repression of its own promoter, the major IE promoter (MIEP), we examined if p150 has a similar effect. Unexpectedly, in the absence of IE2, p150, but not p60, increased the MIEP activity in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrated that p150 associated with the MIEP in transfected cells. Both the potential DNA binding and the transcriptional activation domains on p150 were also characterized. This study reveals a previously unidentified role for p150 as a direct transcriptional activator.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—pcDNA3.1-HA-p150 and pcDNA3.1-HA-p150C, which encode the HA-tagged, full-length p150 or the C-terminal residues 641–938, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. P. D. Kaufman (25Ye X. Franco A.A. Santos H. Nelson D.M. Kaufman P.D. Adams P.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To construct the plasmid for establishing a stable cell line expressing aa 641–938 of p150, pSEP7-HA-p150C was generated by inserting the corresponding cDNA into pSEP7 between the HindIII and XhoI sites. pcDNA3.1-HA-p60 was constructed by inserting the corresponding p60 cDNA into pcDNA3.1-HA between the XhoI and XbaI sites. pPK38, ΔPEST, ΔKER, and ΔED, which produce the in vitro translated wild-type p150 or p150 mutants with the corresponding internal deletion, were kindly provided by Dr. B. Stillman (1Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Kessler N. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1105-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing the series of terminally deleted mutants of p150, used for in vitro transcription/translation and for expression in mammalian cells, were generated by inserting the specific PCR-amplified p150 fragment flanked by EcoRI sites into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). To generate the internally deleted mutants of p150, two-step cloning was performed. The cDNAs encoding the p150 fragments N-terminal to the domain to be deleted were first PCR-amplified using primers with 3′ EcoRI linker, followed by cloning into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were then digested with EcoRI and ligated with the EcoRI site-flanked cDNAs encoding the p150 fragments C-terminal to the domain to be deleted. The orientation of the inserts was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids encoding the firefly luciferase gene driven by the HCMV major IE promoter (pMIEP–733/+2) and the MIEP derivatives pMIEP–540/+2 and pMIEP–235/+2 were kindly provided by Dr. Y. H. W. Lee. To generate plasmids encoding the luciferase reporter driven by serially 5′-deleted mutants of MIEP, the specific MIEP fragments were PCR-amplified with primers containing the NheI or HindIII site and then inserted into pGL2 between the NheI and HindIII sites. All the serially deleted mutants were checked by DNA sequencing after construction. To generate recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli to perform in vitro binding assays, the PCR-amplified cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–296 or 311–445 of p150 was inserted into the pET100D/TOPO vector (Invitrogen), which encodes proteins N-terminally tagged with His6 and Xpress. The plasmids encoding Gal4 activation domain (GalAD)-fused p150 fragments were generated by inserting the PCR-amplified cDNA of GalAD from pACT2 (Clontech) into the HindIII site of pcDNA3.1-p150/311–938-V5/His or pcDNA3.1-p150/505-938-V5/His. pMH100-TK, which contains a luciferase reporter gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus containing an additional five-Gal4-binding site, was kindly provided by Dr. Ronald Evan. To generate plasmids encoding the Gal4 DNA binding domain (GalDBD) fused to the C-terminal end of p150 fragments, the cDNA encoding GalDBD was PCR-amplified from pCMX-GalDBD and cloned into XbaI site of pcDNA3-p150/1–296-V5/His or pcDNA3-p150/1–641-V5/His. The orientation was checked by DNA sequencing. The plasmid encoding the chimera protein with GalDBD at its N terminus and p150 aa 564–938 at its C terminus was generated by inserting the EcoRI-digested p150 fragment from pcDNA3.1-p150/564–938-V5/His into pCMX-Gal4DBD. The cDNA encoding the GalDBD-p150 fragment was then PCR-amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-V5/His (Invitrogen). The plasmid encoding the KER domain fused to the C terminus of VP16 was generated by inserting the EcoRI-digested p150 fragment from pcDNA3.1-p150 311–445-V5/His into pVP16 (Clontech). The series of plasmid pLKO.1-puro-shp150, which encode several short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting to different regions of p150, were obtained from the National RNAi Core Facility located at the Institute of Molecular Biology/Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The following sequences are the regions targeted by each shp150: shp150-1 (CHAF1A, TRCN-0000074273), 3′-untranslated region, TTGAACCGACTCAATTCCTGTGTAAA; shp150-2 (CHAF1A, TRCN0000074274), +1523 to +1543, CCACCCGGAATGCAGATATTT; shp150-3 (CHAF1A, TRCN0000074275), +897 to +917, CCTCCGCAGAATAACTAAGAA.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Virus Infection—The human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 and osteosarcoma U2OS cells were obtained from and maintained as instructed by the ATCC. U373MG human glioblastoma astrocytoma cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and cultured in minimal essential medium alpha medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). All transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 × 105 or 3 × 106 cells were seeded, respectively, onto 6-well plates or 10-cm plates 1 day before transfection and harvested 24 h post-transfection. To generate stable lines, 300 μg/ml hygromycin or 25 μg/ml puromycin (both from Sigma) were used to enrich cells containing the plasmid. In transfection/infection experiments, cells were transfected with the MIEP-driven luciferase reporter and infected with HCMV 4 h post-transfection. HCMV strain RC256 (26Spaete R.R. Mocarski E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7213-7217Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was obtained from the ATCC and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions. Infections were performed at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 (Fig. 2A) or the indicated amount (Fig. 2B) for 2 h.Western and Luciferase Assay—Luciferase assays and Western analyses were performed as reported (27Hsu C.H. Chang M.D. Tai K.Y. Yang Y.T. Wang P.S. Chen C.J. Wang Y.H. Lee S.C. Wu C.W. Juan L.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed as described (27Hsu C.H. Chang M.D. Tai K.Y. Yang Y.T. Wang P.S. Chen C.J. Wang Y.H. Lee S.C. Wu C.W. Juan L.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The precipitated DNAs were analyzed by real time PCR using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) and a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers and annealing temperatures were as follows: MIE promoter, 5′-CAATATTGGCCATTAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGGCTATGAACTAATGACC-3′ (–733 to –537 bp, annealed at 58 °C); luciferase 1, 5′-TAGAGGATGGAACCGCTG-3′ and 5′-CCAACCGAACGGACATTT-3′ (+50 to +173 bp, annealed at 60 °C); luciferase 2, 5′-TACCAGAGTCCTTTGATCGT-3′ and 5′-GTGATGGAATGGAACAACACTT-3′ (+545 to +735 bp, annealed at 60 °C); and luciferase 3, 5′-TCCATCTTCCAGGGATACGA-3′ and 5′-CATAGGTCCTCTGACACATAA-3′ (+992 to +1188 bp, annealed at 60 °C).DNA Affinity Protein Assay (DAPA)—DNAs containing serial deletions of MIEP fragments were PCR-amplified from pMIEP–733/+2 with biotinylated primers and extracted by PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified DNAs were incubated with streptavidin beads (Sigma) in the DAPA buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and extensively washed with DAPA buffer. To prepare lysates for determining the association of the endogenous p150 on MIEP, H1299 cells cultured on 500-cm2 dishes with 80% confluence were trypsinized and lysed in a 4-fold pellet volume of high salt lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) with mild vortexing at 4 °C for 1 h. After that, the lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were then aliquoted at the concentration of 10 mg/ml and stored at –80 °C. 1 mg of lysate was incubated with the DNA-bead complex in 900 μl of DAPA buffer and rotated at 4 °C overnight. The pulled down proteins were washed three times with DAPA buffer containing 200 mm KCl and separated with 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western analysis. To map the MIEP binding domain of p150, the indicated p150 mutants were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine by the TnT® Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with streptavidin bead-DNA complex overnight and then washed with DAPA buffer three times. Pulled down proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. 10% of the lysate was loaded as input control.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The recombinant p150 fragments expressed in BL21 Star (DE3) One Shot Chemically Competent E. coli (Invitrogen) were purified using Ni-Sepharose™ 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) according to the procedure described in QIAexpress Detection and Assay Handbook (Qiagen). For probe labeling, the PCR-amplified MIEP fragments were purified and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml; NEG502Z, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the purification using G-25 column (GE Healthcare). DNA binding reactions were set up in 30 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 8% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 32P-labeled MIEP DNA fragments and various E. coli-expressing recombinant proteins. After incubation on ice for 20 min, reaction mixtures were separated by 4 or 6% native acrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE containing 5% glycerol and subjected to autoradiography. For antibody supershift assays, the anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen), which recognizes the epitope fused to the E. coli-expressing proteins, was added into the reactions before gel electrophoresis.Antibodies—The primary antibodies used in Western blots are as follows: rabbit anti-p150N antibody (H-300; Figs. 2B and 5F and supplemental Fig. S1), mouse anti-VP16 antibody (1Kaufman P.D.

A, KER domain (residues 311–445) is critical for p150 binding to MIEP. In vitro DAPA experiments similar to Fig. 4D were performed except that the MIEP oligo on beads was incubated with various in vitro translated, 35S-labeled p150 fragments. The GFP sequence and two nuclear localization sequences (NLS) from SV40 large T protein (GFP/2LTNLS) were fused to the KER domain (GFP/KER) or ED domain (GFP-(505–641)). Main panel, schematic diagram of the p150 deletion mutants. Right panel, autoradiography results. PEST, domain enriched in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T); KER, domain enriched in lysine (K), glutamic acid (E), and arginine (R); ED, domain enriched in glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D). B, E. coli-expressing KER domain binds to MIEP region from –733 to –537 bp. The E. coli-expressing His-Xpress-fused aa 311–445 (X-KER, lanes 3 and 4) or 1–296 (X-(1–296), lanes 2 and 5) of p150 was incubated with the 32P-labeled MIEP DNA fragments from –733 to –537 bp, followed by EMSA. The anti-Xpress antibody was used for super-shifting the DNA-protein complex. The reaction mixtures were separated on a 4% native acrylamide gel that was then subjected to autoradiography. C, MIEP region from –593 to –574 bp is required for KER binding to MIEP in vitro. The EMSA experiment similar to B was performed except that 32P-labeled MIEP DNA fragment from –593 to –537 bp (lanes 1, 2, and 5) or –573 to –537 bp (lanes 3, 4, and 6) was used, and the reaction mixtures were separated on a 6% native acrylamide gel. D, overexpression of KER suppresses the MIEP activity in cells. H1299 cells were transfected with pMIEP–733/+2 together with vector or the plasmid encoding two NLS sequence-fused aa 311–445 (2NLS-KER-V5, lane 2), 445–564 (2NLS-445–564-V5), or 505–641 (2NLS-505–641-V5) of p150. Cell lysates were harvested 24 h post-transfection and analyzed for luciferase activity (upper panel) and protein expression (lower panel). E, KER domain is required to guide the activation domain of Gal4 protein (GalAD) to act on MIEP. H1299 cells were transfected with pMIEP–733/+2 together with vector or the plasmid encoding the GalAD fused to the p150 fragment from aa 311–938 (lane 2) or 505–938 (lane 3) and analyzed for luciferase activity (upper panel) and protein expression (lower panel). F, KER alone directs the activation domain of VP16 protein (VP16AD) to act on MIEP. H1299 cells were transfected with pMIEP–733/+2 and the Renilla reporter driven by SV40 promoter, together with vector or the plasmid encoding the full-length p150-V5 (lane 2), the VP16AD fused to KER (VP16AD-KER, lane 3), or VP16AD fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 protein (GalDBD-VP16AD, lane 4) and analyzed for luciferase activity (upper panel) and protein expression (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 1p150 specifically activates the MIEP promoter. A, p150, but not p150C or p60, stimulates the MIEP-driven luciferase activity. H1299 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding the firefly luciferase gene driven by the HCMV major IE promoter (pMIEP–733/+2) with vector alone (lanes 1 and 5) or with plasmid encoding the indicated protein (lanes 2–4 and 6–8). Cell lysates were harvested 24 h post-transfection and analyzed for luciferase activity (upper panel) and protein expression (lower panel). The nonspecific protein in the Western blot was used as a loading control. B, knocking down p60 does not affect the p150-mediated MIEP activation. H1299 cells treated with oligo of the scrambled sequence (control) or the small interfering RNA oligo targeting to the p60 gene (si-p60) were transfected with pMIEP–733/+2 together with vector (lanes 1 and 3) or plasmid encoding the C-terminally V5-tagged p150 (p150-V5, lanes 2 and 4). The cell lysates were then collected for luciferase activity assays (upper panel) and Western analysis (lower panel). C, activities of PCNA, p16, or SV40 promoters are not affected by p150. H1299 cells were transfected with vector (white bar) or plasmid encoding p150-V5 (black bar) together with the luciferase reporter gene driven by HCMV major IE (pMIEP–733/+2, lanes 1 and 2), PCNA (lanes 3 and 4), or p16 (lanes 5 and 6) promoter, or the Renilla reporter gene driven by SV40 promoter (lanes 7 and 8) and analyzed for luciferase activity (upper panel) and protein expression (lower panel).View Large Image"
