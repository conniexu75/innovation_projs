https://openalex.org/W3161032756,"Betacoronaviruses caused the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as the current pandemic of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1–4. Vaccines that elicit protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses that circulate in animals have the potential to prevent future pandemics. Here we show that the immunization of macaques with nanoparticles conjugated with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, and adjuvanted with 3M-052 and alum, elicits cross-neutralizing antibody responses against bat coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (including the B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351 variants). Vaccination of macaques with these nanoparticles resulted in a 50% inhibitory reciprocal serum dilution (ID50) neutralization titre of 47,216 (geometric mean) for SARS-CoV-2, as well as in protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Nucleoside-modified mRNAs that encode a stabilized transmembrane spike or monomeric receptor-binding domain also induced cross-neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses, albeit at lower titres than achieved with the nanoparticles. These results demonstrate that current mRNA-based vaccines may provide some protection from future outbreaks of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, and provide a multimeric protein platform for the further development of vaccines against multiple (or all) betacoronaviruses. Immunization of macaques with nanoparticle-conjugated receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 adjuvanted with 3M-052 and alum results in cross-neutralizing antibodies against bat coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants, and may provide a platform for developing pan-coronavirus vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3162762824,"Several vaccines against COVID-19 have now been developed and are already being rolled out around the world. The decision whether or not to get vaccinated has so far been left to the individual citizens. However, there are good reasons, both in theory as well as in practice, to believe that the willingness to get vaccinated might not be sufficiently high to achieve herd immunity. A policy of mandatory vaccination could ensure high levels of vaccination coverage, but its legitimacy is doubtful. We investigate the willingness to get vaccinated and the reasons for an acceptance (or rejection) of a policy of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 in June and July 2020 in Germany based on a representative real time survey, a random sub-sample (SOEP-CoV) of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our results show that about 70 percent of adults in Germany would voluntarily get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine without side effects was available. About half of residents of Germany are in favor, and half against, a policy of mandatory vaccination. The approval rate for mandatory vaccination is significantly higher among those who would get vaccinated voluntarily (around 60 percent) than among those who would not get vaccinated voluntarily (27 percent). The individual willingness to get vaccinated and acceptance of a policy of mandatory vaccination correlates systematically with socio-demographic and psychological characteristics of the respondents. We conclude that as far as people's declared intentions are concerned, herd immunity could be reached without a policy of mandatory vaccination, but that such a policy might be found acceptable too, were it to become necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3160658661,"Excessive use of agrochemicals for weed controlling infestation has serious agronomic and environmental repercussions associated. An appropriate amount of pesticide/ chemicals is essential for achieving the desired smart farming and precision agriculture (PA). In this regard, targeted weed control will be a critical component significantly helping in achieving the goal. A prerequisite for such control is a robust classification system that could accurately identify weed crops in a field. In this regard, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can acquire high-resolution images providing detailed information for the distribution of weeds and offers a cost-efficient solution. Most of the established classification systems deploying UAV imagery are supervised, relying on image labels. However, this is a time-consuming and tedious task. In this study, the development of an optimized semi-supervised learning approach is proposed, offering a semi-supervised generative adversarial network for crops and weeds classification at early growth stage. The proposed algorithm consists of a generator that provides extra training data for the discriminator, which distinguishes weeds and crops using a small number of image labels. The proposed system was evaluated extensively on the Red Green Blue (RGB) images obtained by a quadcopter in two different croplands (pea and strawberry). The method achieved an average accuracy of 90% when 80% of training data was unlabeled. The proposed system was compared with several standards supervised learning classifiers and the results demonstrated that this technique could be applied for challenging tasks of crops and weeds classification, mainly when the labeled samples are small at less training time."
https://openalex.org/W3163275612,"The NHS 111 telephone advice and triage service is a vital part of the management of urgent and emergency care (UEC) services in England. Demand for NHS 111 advice has increased since its introduction in 2013, and the service is of particular importance in light of the current pandemic and resulting increased demand for emergency care. Currently, little is known about the effectiveness of NHS 111 in terms of the appropriateness of the advice given, or about the compliance of patients with that advice. We aimed to address this issue by analysing a large linked routine dataset of all NHS 111 calls (n = 3,631,069) and subsequent emergency department (ED) attendances made in the Yorkshire &amp; Humber region from March 2013-March 2017. We found that many patients do not comply with advice, with 11% (n = 289,748) of patients attending ED when they are advised to self-care or seek primary care. We also found that a considerable number of these patients are further classed as urgent (88%, n = 255,931) and a substantial minority (37%, 106,207) are subsequently admitted to hospital. Further, many patients who are sent an ambulance or told to attend ED are classed as non-urgent upon attending ED (9%, n = 42,372). This research suggests that the level at which NHS 111 is currently triaging results in many hundreds of thousands of mis-triaged cases annually. Additionally, patients frequently do not comply with the advice they receive. This has implications for understanding the accuracy and efficiency of triaging systems."
https://openalex.org/W3161239681,"The aim of this study was to quantify typical training load and periodisation practices of MMA athletes. MMA competitors (n = 14; age = 22.4 ± 4.4 years; body mass = 71.3 ± 7.7 kg; stature = 171 ±9.9 cm) were observed during training for 8 consecutive weeks without intervention. Seven athletes were training for competitive bouts whilst the remaining 7 were not. Daily training duration, intensity (RPE), load (sRPE and segRPE), fatigue (short questionnaire of fatigue) and body region soreness (CR10 scale) were recorded. Using Bayesian analyses (BF 10 ≥3), data demonstrate that training duration (weekly mean range = 3.9–5.3 hours), sRPE (weekly mean range = 1,287–1,791 AU), strain (weekly mean range = 1,143–1,819 AU), monotony (weekly mean range = 0.63–0.83 AU), fatigue (weekly mean range = 16–20 AU) and soreness did not change within or between weeks. Between weeks monotony (2.3 ± 0.7 AU) supported little variance in weekly training load. There were no differences in any variable between participants who competed and those who did not with the except of the final week before the bout, where an abrupt step taper occurred leading to no between group differences in fatigue. Training intensity distribution corresponding to high, moderate and low was 20, 33 and 47%, respectively. Striking drills accounted for the largest portion of weekly training time (20–32%), with MMA sparring the least (2–7%). Only striking sparring and wrestling sparring displayed statistical weekly differences in duration or load. Athletes reported MMA sparring and wrestling sparring as high intensity (RPE≥7), BJJ sparring, striking sparring and wrestling drills as moderate intensity (RPE 5–6), and striking drills and BJJ drills as low intensity (RPE≤4). We conclude that periodisation of training load was largely absent in this cohort of MMA athletes, as is the case within and between weekly microcycles."
https://openalex.org/W3162683095,"Melicope glabra (Blume) T. G. Hartley from the Rutaceae family is one of the richest sources of plant secondary metabolites, including coumarins and flavanoids. This study investigates the free radical scavenging and antibacterial activities of M. glabra and its isolated compounds. M. glabra ethyl acetate and methanol extracts were prepared using the cold maceration technique. The isolation of compounds was performed with column chromatography. The free radical scavenging activity of the extracts and isolated compounds were evaluated based on their oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) activities. The extracts and compounds were also subjected to antibacterial evaluation using bio-autographic and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) techniques against two oral pathogens, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus mutans. Isolation of phytoconstituents from ethyl acetate extract successfully yielded quercetin 3, 5, 3'-trimethyl ether (1) and kumatakenin (2), while the isolation of the methanol extract resulted in scoparone (3), 6, 7, 8-trimethoxycoumarin (4), marmesin (5), glabranin (6), umbelliferone (7), scopoletin (8), and sesamin (9). The study is the first to isolate compound (1) from Rutaceae plants, and also the first to report the isolation of compounds (2-5) from M. glabra. The ORAC evaluation showed that the methanol extract is stronger than the ethyl acetate extract, while umbelliferone (7) exhibited the highest ORAC value of 24 965 μmolTE/g followed by glabranin (6), sesamin (9) and scopoletin (8). Ethyl acetate extract showed stronger antibacterial activity towards E. faecalis and S. mutans than the methanol extract with MIC values of 4166.7 ± 1443.4 μg/ml and 8303.3 ± 360.8 μg/ml respectively. Ethyl acetate extract inhibited E. faecalis growth, as shown by the lowest optical density value of 0.046 at a concentration of 5.0 mg/mL with a percentage inhibition of 95%. Among the isolated compounds tested, umbelliferone (7) and sesamin (9) exhibited promising antibacterial activity against S. mutans with both exhibiting MIC values of 208.3 ± 90.6 μg/ml. Findings from this study suggests M. glabra as a natural source of potent antioxidant and antibacterial agents."
https://openalex.org/W3160671920,"Objective Investigators have extensively explored the short-term safety and efficacy data on 177 Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT) in mCRPC patients. However, scarce literature is reported on the long-term outcome of these patients. The current goal of this study is focused on the long-term outcome of mCRPC patients treated with 177 Lu-PSMA-617 RLT. Methods Among 135 patients, 121 mCRPC patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. Patients received a median of 3 cycles of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 RLT at 6 to 12-week intervals. Primary endpoint included overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints involved progression-free survival (PFS), predictive factors of OS and PFS, PSA response rate, molecular response, clinical response, and toxicity assessment. Results The median administered cumulative activity was 20 GBq (3.7–37 GBq). The median follow-up duration was 36 months (6–72 months). The estimated median PFS and OS were 12 months (mo) (95% CI: 10.3–13 mo) and 16 mo (95% CI: 13–17 mo), respectively. Any PSA decline and PSA decline &gt;50% was achieved in 73% and 61% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed only failure to achieve &gt;50% PSA decline as a significant factor associated with a poor PFS. Prognostic factors associated with reduced OS included, failure to experience &gt;50% PSA decline, heavily pre-treated patient cohort who received &gt;2 lines of prior treatment options, and patient sub-group treated with ≥2 lines of chemotherapy. Patients re-treated with additional treatment options after attaining 177 Lu-PSMA refractory disease showed a remarkably prolonged OS. A significant clinical benefit was achieved post 177 Lu-PSMA-617 RLT. The most common toxicities observed were fatigue (34.7%), followed by nausea (33%), and dry mouth (24.7%). Conclusion The current study supports the short-term safety and efficacy results of high response rates, prolonged PFS and OS, improved quality of life, and low treatment-related toxicities in patients treated with 177 Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3163781612,"Wisconsin and Quebec are the world leading cranberry-producing regions. Cranberries are grown in acidic, naturally low-fertility sandy beds. Cranberry fertilization is guided by general soil and tissue nutrient tests in addition to yield target and vegetative biomass. However, other factors such as cultivar, location, and carbon and nutrient storage impact cranberry nutrition and yield. The objective of this study was to customize nutrient diagnosis and fertilizer recommendation at local scale and for next-year cranberry production after accounting for local factors and carbon and nutrient carryover effects. We collected 1768 observations from on-farm surveys and fertilizer trials in Quebec and Wisconsin to elaborate a machine learning model using minimum datasets. We tested carryover effects in a 5-year Quebec fertilizer experiment established on permanent plots. Micronutrients contributed more than macronutrients to variation in tissue compositions. Random Forest model related accurately current-year berry yield to location, cultivars, climatic indices, fertilization, and tissue and soil tests as features (classification accuracy of 0.83). Comparing compositions of defective and successful tissue compositions in the Euclidean space of tissue compositions, the general across-factor diagnosis differed from the local factor-specific diagnosis. Nutrient standards elaborated in one region could hardly be transposed to another and, within the same region, from one bed to another due to site-specific characteristics. Next-year yield and nutrient adjustment could be predicted accurately from current-year yield and tissue composition and other features, with R 2 value of 0.73 in regression mode and classification accuracy of 0.85. Compositional and machine learning methods proved to be effective to customize nutrient diagnosis and predict site-specific measures for nutrient management of cranberry stands. This study emphasized the need to acquire large experimental and observational datasets to capture the numerous factor combinations impacting current and next-year cranberry yields at local scale."
https://openalex.org/W3161628547,"It has been evidenced that in attention-window tasks, the participants fixate on the center of a screen while inspecting two stimuli that appear at the same time in parafoveal vision. Such tasks have successfully been used to estimate a person’s breadth of attention under various conditions. While behavioral investigations of visual attention have often made use of response accuracy, recent research has shown that the pupil size can also be used to track shifts of attention to the periphery. The main finding of previous studies is that the harder the evaluation of the stimuli becomes, e.g., because they appear farther away from the central fixation point, the stronger the pupils dilate. In this paper, we present experimental data suggesting that in an attention-window task, the pupil size can also be used to assess whether the participants attend to static, non-moving, or dynamic, moving stimuli. That is, regression models containing information on presentation mode (static vs. dynamic) and the visual angle between spatially separated stimuli better predict accuracy of perception and pupil dilation than model without these sources of information. This finding is useful for researchers who aim at understanding the human attentional system, including potential differences in its sensitivity to static and dynamic objects."
https://openalex.org/W3162223311,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) causes injury to tissues and organs, including to the heart and kidney, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Thus, novel potential therapeutics are continuously required to minimize DM-related organ damage. We have previously shown that dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPPIII) has beneficial roles in a hypertensive mouse model, but it is unknown whether DPPIII has any effects on DM. In this study, we found that intravenous administration of recombinant DPPIII in diabetic db/db mice for 8 weeks suppressed the DM-induced cardiac diastolic dysfunctions and renal injury without alteration of the blood glucose level. This treatment inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis in the heart and blocked the increase in albuminuria by attenuating the disruption of the glomerular microvasculature and inhibiting the effacement of podocyte foot processes in the kidney. The beneficial role of DPPIII was, at least in part, mediated by the cleavage of a cytotoxic peptide, named Peptide 2, which was increased in db/db mice compared with normal mice. This peptide consisted of nine amino acids, was a digested fragment of complement component 3 (C3), and had an anaphylatoxin-like effect determined by the Miles assay and chemoattractant analysis. The effect was dependent on its interaction with the C3a receptor and protein kinase C-mediated RhoA activation downstream of the receptor in endothelial cells. In conclusion, DPPIII plays a protective role in the heart and kidney in a DM animal model through cleavage of a peptide that is a part of C3."
https://openalex.org/W3163382149,"Despite the gross enrolment ratio of Indian children, being almost 91% in grades 6-8, the equivalently soaring rates of school dropout after 8th grade remains a huge concern for the policymakers. Researches from the developed countries and some developing countries have shown the benefits of parental involvement in their children's education in terms of reduced dropout rates. However, there is a stark absence of similar evidence in the Indian context. Our study examines whether the lack of parental involvement during primary schooling of Indian children eventually results in school dropout when the children become adolescents. We used IHDS panel data of children (8-11 years) in round-I who become adolescents (15-18 years) in round-II. Bivariate, multivariable and stratified analyses were performed using logistic regression models. The findings from the multivariable models show that children, whose parents did not -participate in PTA meetings, -discuss academic progress with schoolteacher and -supervise their children's homework in round-I respectively had 1.15 (95% CI: 1.01-1.30), 1.14 (95% CI: 1.01-1.29) and 1.17 (95% CI: 1.01-1.34) times higher risk of school dropout in round-II. Further, a similar relationship was observed when hypothesized relationship by gender, type of school attended and type of community of the children were examined. Among male children, parents' non-participation in PTA meetings was associated with 1.21 (95% CI: 1.02-1.44) times greater odds of school dropout. Children from private schools also had a 2.17 (95% CI: 1.42-3.32) times greater risk of dropout if their parents did not supervise their children in homework These findings highlight the crucial role of parental involvement in their children's primary education, in terms of reduced school dropout. The findings call for programmatic interventions that create awareness and encourage parental participation in their children's schooling."
https://openalex.org/W3160844493,"Reading primary literature is a popular classroom practice that exposes students to the process of science. However, the analysis of primary literature can be taxing and time-consuming for students. For this reason, it is important to determine the source of student challenges and what motivates them to read primary literature. To better understand students’ challenges, preferences, and motivations towards analyzing primary literature, we held focus groups with biology undergraduates where we asked them about their thoughts and perceptions on this practice. Students felt they struggle with understanding the big picture of an article, certain aspects of scientific literacy like data interpretation and experimental setup, and lack of knowledge of terms and techniques. Further analysis of the data using the achievement goal and expectancy-value theories of motivation revealed that students: 1) demonstrate mastery and performance approach goal orientations, which are typically associated with positive learning outcomes, 2) value the usefulness of reading primary literature, and 3) feel most engaged in the process of reading an article when the topic interests them. We provide pedagogical recommendations based on our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3162777437,"We developed a facile detection method of spermine based on the fluorescence (FL) quenching of the ciprofloxacin-Tb 3+ complex, which shows astrong green emission. Ciprofloxacin (CP) makes efficient bondings to Tb 3+ ion as a linker molecule through carboxylic and ketone groups to form a kind of lanthanide coordination polymer. The addition of spermine that competes with Tb 3+ ions for the interaction with CP due to its positive charge brings about weakened coordination linkage of CP and Tb 3+ . The probe exhibited high sensitivity, selectivity, and good linearity in the range of 2–180 μM with a low limit of detection of 0.17 μM. Moreover, we applied this method on the paper strip test (PST), along with the integration of a smartphone and Arduino-based device. The practical reliability of the developed probe was evaluated on human serum samples with acceptable analytical results."
https://openalex.org/W3160207819,"A typical assessment for sarcopenia involves the use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) for calculating the skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). However, abdominal CT is not regularly performed on patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). We investigated whether masticatory SMI (M-SMI) measurements based on head and neck CT scans can be used to conduct sarcopenia assessments by evaluating whether M-SMI is correlated with L3-SMI.Abdominal and head and neck CT images of patients with trauma (n = 50) and HNC (n = 52) were analyzed retrospectively. Both manual delineation and threshold selection methods were used to measure cross-sectional areas of masticatory muscles and those of muscles at the L3 level on CT images. Muscle cross-sectional areas were normalized to height squared to calculate SMI, and a multivariate linear regression model was established to evaluate the correlation between the M-SMI and L3-SMI. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the ability of the M-SMI to identify sarcopenia, and Cox logistic regression was used to identify predictors of sarcopenia.Patients with HNC had significantly lower M-SMI and L3-SMI than did patients with trauma (p = 0.011 and 0.03, respectively). M-SMI and L3-SMI were strongly correlated (r = 0.901, p < 0.001); in the multivariate model that included sex, the correlation was stronger (r = 0.913, p < 0.001). The associations of sarcopenia with a lower M-SMI (p < 0.001), male sex (p = 0.028), and advanced age (p = 0.011) were significant, and multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated that an M-SMI of <5.5 was an independent predictor of sarcopenia (hazard ratio = 5.37, p < 0.001).M-SMI assessment in routine head and neck CT scans is feasible and can be an alternative for detecting sarcopenia in patients with HNC."
https://openalex.org/W3162185899,"Background Intestinal parasitosis is a common disease that causes misery and disability in poor populations. The number of individuals affected is staggering. From two billion peoples who harbor parasites worldwide, 300 million suffer severe morbidity and more than 25% of pregnant women are infected with hookworm, which causes intestinal bleeding and blood loss, and has been most commonly associated with anemia. Intestinal parasite infection during pregnancy has been associated with iron deficiency, maternal anemia, and impaired nutritional status, as well as decreased infant birth weight. Objective This study aimed to assess the effects of intestinal parasite infection on hematological profiles of pregnant women attending antenatal care in Debre Markos Referral Hospital from December 2017 to February 2019. Method A prospective cohort study design was conducted among 94 intestinal parasite-infected pregnant women as an exposed group and 187 pregnant women free from intestinal parasite were used as a control group. The effect of intestinal parasites on hematological profiles of pregnant women was assessed at Debre Markos Referral Hospital antenatal care ward. Socio-demographic data and nutrition status were assessed by using structured questionnaires and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), respectively. Two ml of venous blood and 2 gm of stool samples were collected to analyze the hematological profiles and detect intestinal parasites, respectively. Wet mount and formol-ether concentration (FEC) techniques were used to detect intestinal parasites. Hematological profile was analyzed using Mind ray BC-3000 plus instrument. Data were double entered into EpiData version 3.1 software and exported to SPSS version 24 software for analysis. Results were presented using tables and graphs. Associations of hemoglobin levels with intestinal parasitic infections were determined using binary logistic regression models. P ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. The mean hematological profile difference between parasite-infected and parasite-free pregnant women was computed using independent t -test. Results In the present study, the predominant parasites identified were Entamoeba histolytica , hookworm, Giardia lamblia , Schistosoma mansoni , and Ascaris lumbricoides . About 8.2% of intestinal parasite-infected pregnant women had mild anemia while 4% had moderate anemia. Only 1.2% of intestinal parasite-free pregnant women developed moderate anemia. The mean HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC values of intestinal parasite-infected pregnant women were 12.8g/dl, 38.2%, 94.7fl, 33.1pg and 34.7g/dl, respectively. But the mean HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH and MCHC values of pregnant women who were free from intestinal parasites were 14.4 g/dl, 39.8%, 94.9fl, 33.9pg and 35.5g/dl, respectively. Anemia was strongly associated with hookworm (AOR = 21.29, 95%CI: 8.28–54.75, P&lt;0 . 001 ), S . mansoni (AOR = 63.73, 95% CI: 19.15–212, P&lt;0 . 001 ) and A . lumbricoide (AOR = 14.12, 95% CI 3.28–60.65, P&lt;0 . 001 ). Conclusion Intestinal parasitic infection in pregnant women caused adverse impact on hematological profiles and was an independent predictor of anemia. Intestinal parasitic infection significantly decreased pregnant the level of HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, and MCHC values. To minimize maternal anemia deworming could be good before pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3163043969,"The ANEMI model is an integrated assessment model of global change that emphasizes the role of water resources. The model is based on the principles of system dynamics simulation to analyze changes in the Earth system using feedback processes. Securing water resources for the future is a key issue of global change, and ties into global systems of population growth, climate change, carbon cycle, hydrologic cycle, economy, energy production, land use and pollution generation. Here the third iteration of the model-ANEMI3 is described, along with the methods used for parameter estimation and model testing. The main differences between ANEMI3 and previous versions include: (i) implementation of the energy-economy system based on the principles of system dynamics simulation; (ii) incorporation of water supply as an additional sector in the global economy that parallels the production of energy; (iii) inclusion of climate change effects on land yield and potentially arable land for food production, and (iv) addition of nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient cycles as indicators of global water quality, which affect the development of surface water supplies. The model is intended for analyzing long-term global feedbacks which drive global change. Because of this, there are limitations related to the spatial scale that is used. However, the model's simplicity can be considered a strength, as it allows for the driving feedbacks to be more easily identified. The model in its current form allows for a variety of scenarios to be created to address global issues such as climate change from an integrated perspective, or to examine the change in one model sector on Earth system behaviour. The endogenous structure of the model allows for global change to be driven entirely by model structure rather than exogenous inputs. The new additions to the ANEMI3 model are found to capture long term trends associated with global change, while allowing for the development of water supplies to be represented using an integrated approach considering global economy and surface water quality."

This paper focuses on an efficient pre-and post-processing technique (PP-AFT) to address and rectify the problems of quantization error, ringing, blocking artifact, and flickering effect, which significantly degrade the visual quality of video frames. The PP-AFT method differentiates the blocked images or frames using activity function into different regions and developed adaptive filters as per the classified region. The designed process also introduces an adaptive flicker extraction and removal method and a 2-D filter to remove ringing effects in edge regions. The PP-AFT technique is implemented on various videos, and results are compared with different existing techniques using performance metrics like PSNR-B, MSSIM, and GBIM. Simulation results show significant improvement in the subjective quality of different video frames. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art de-blocking methods in terms of PSNR-B with average value lying between (0.7–1.9db) while (35.83–47.7%) reduced average GBIM keeping MSSIM values very close to the original sequence statistically 0.978."
https://openalex.org/W3163423805,"Studies of African immigrant health in the U.S. have traditionally focused on infectious diseases. However, the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) indicates the increasing importance of general preventive health care. As part of a series of community health events designed for African-born individuals in King County, Washington, we administered key informant interviews (KIIs) with 16 health event participants, medical professionals, and community leaders to identify barriers and facilitators to use of preventive health care among African-born individuals. We used descriptive thematic analysis to organize barriers according to the socio-ecological model. Within the individual domain, KII participants identified lack of knowledge and awareness of preventive health benefits as barriers to engagement in care. Within the interpersonal domain, language and cultural differences frequently complicated relationships with health care providers. Within the societal and policy domains, healthcare costs, lack of insurance, and structural racism were also reported as major barriers. Participants identified community outreach with culturally competent and respectful providers as key elements of interventions to improve uptake. In conclusion, African immigrant communities face several barriers, ranging from individual to policy levels, to accessing health services, resulting in substantial unmet need for chronic disease prevention and treatment. Community-centered and -led care may help facilitate uptake and engagement in care."
https://openalex.org/W3160077157,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic overwhelmed healthcare systems, highlighting the need to better understand predictors of mortality and the impact of medical interventions. Methods This retrospective cohort study examined data from every patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to White Plains Hospital between March 9, 2020, and June 3, 2020. We used binomial logistic regression to analyze data for all patients, and propensity score matching for those treated with hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). The primary outcome of interest was inpatient mortality. Results 1,108 admitted patients with COVID-19 were available for analysis, of which 124 (11.2%) were excluded due to incomplete data. Of the 984 patients included, 225 (22.9%) died. Risk for death decreased for each day later a patient was admitted [OR 0.970, CI 0.955 to 0.985; p &lt; 0.001]. Elevated initial C-reactive protein (CRP) value was associated with a higher risk for death at 96 hours [OR 1.007, 1.002 to 1.012; p = 0.006]. Hydroxychloroquine and CP administration were each associated with increased mortality [OR 3.4, CI 1.614 to 7.396; p = 0.002, OR 2.8560, CI 1.361 to 6.160; p = 0.006 respectively]. Conclusions Elevated CRP carried significant odds of early death. Hydroxychloroquine and CP were each associated with higher risk for death, although CP was without titers and was administered at a median of five days from admission. Randomized or controlled studies will better describe the impact of CP. Mortality decreased as the pandemic progressed, suggesting that institutional capacity for dynamic evaluation of process and outcome measures may benefit COVID-19 survival."

However, it remains unclear to what extent a combination of wear analyses acting at distinct temporal scales can be beneficial in interpreting the tooth use of primates with a high variation in their intraspecific dietary ecology. Here, we combine macroscopic tooth wear (occlusal fingerprint analysis, long-term signals) with microscopic 3D surface textures (short-term signals) exploring the tooth use of a historical western chimpanzee population from northeastern Liberia with no detailed dietary records. We compare our results to previously published tooth wear and feeding data of the extant and continually monitored chimpanzees of Taї National Park in Ivory Coast. Macroscopic tooth wear results from molar wear facets of the Liberian population indicate only slightly less wear when compared to the Taї population. This suggests similar long-term feeding behavior between both populations. In contrast, 3D surface texture results show that Liberian chimpanzees have many and small microscopic wear facet features that group them with those Taї chimpanzees that knowingly died during dry periods. This coincides with historical accounts, which indicate that local tribes poached and butchered the Liberian specimens during dust-rich dry periods. In addition, Liberian females and males differ somewhat in their 3D surface textures, with females having more microscopic peaks, smaller hill and dale areas and slightly rougher wear facet surfaces than males. This suggests a higher consumption of insects in Liberian females compared to males, based on similar 3D surface texture patterns previously reported for Taї chimpanzees. Our study opens new options for uncovering details of feeding behaviors of chimpanzees and other living and fossil primates, with macroscopic tooth wear tracing the long-term dietary and environmental history of a single population and microscopic tooth wear addressing short-term changes (e.g. seasonality)."
https://openalex.org/W3160780995,"The majority of Columbia River summer-run steelhead encounter high river temperatures (near or &gt; 20°C) during their spawning migration. While some steelhead pass through the mid-Columbia River in a matter of days, others use tributary habitats as temperature refuges for periods that can last months. Using PIT tag detection data from adult return years 2004–2016, we fit 3-component mixture models to differentiate between “ fast ”, “ slow ”, and “ overwintering ” migration behaviors in five aggregated population groups. Fast fish migrated straight through the reach on average in ~7–9 days while slow fish delayed their migration for weeks to months, and overwintering fish generally took ~150–250 days. We then fit covariate models to examine what factors contributed to the probability of migration delay during summer months ( slow or overwintering behaviors), and to explore how migration delay related to mortality. Finally, to account for the impact of extended residence times in the reach for fish that delayed, we compared patterns in estimated average daily rates of mortality between migration behaviors and across population groups. Results suggest that migration delay was primarily triggered by high river temperatures but temperature thresholds for delay were lowest just before the seasonal peak in river temperatures. While all populations groups demonstrated these general patterns, we documented substantial variability in temperature thresholds and length of average delays across population groups. Although migration delay was related to higher reach mortality, it was also related to lower average daily mortality rates due to the proportional increase in reach passage duration being larger than the associated increase in mortality. Lower daily mortality rates suggest that migration delay could help mitigate the impacts of harsh migration conditions, presumably through the use of thermal refuges, despite prolonged exposure to local fisheries. Future studies tracking individual populations from their migration through reproduction could help illuminate the full extent of the tradeoffs between different migration behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3162551321,"Introduction Low adherence to medications, specifically in patients with Diabetes (DM) and Hypertension (HTN), and more so in refugee settings, remains a major challenge to achieving optimum clinical control in these patients. We aimed at determining the self-reported medication adherence prevalence and its predictors and exploring reasons for low adherence among these patients. Methods A mixed-methods study was conducted at Médecins Sans Frontières non-communicable diseases primary care center in the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon in October 2018. Data were collected using the validated Arabic version of the 8-items Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) concurrently followed by in-depth interviews to explore barriers to adherence in patients with DM and/or HTN. Predictors of adherence were separately assessed using logistic regression with SPSS© version 20. Manual thematic content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. Results Of the 361 patients included completing the MMAS, 70% (n = 251) were moderately to highly adherent (MMAS-8 score = 6 to 8), while 30% (n = 110) were low-adherent (MMAS-8 score&lt;6). Patients with DM-1 were the most likely to be moderately to highly adherent (85%; n = 29). Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with a lower HbA1C were 75% more likely to be moderately to highly adherent [(OR = 0.75 (95%CI 0.63–0.89), p-value 0.001]. Factors influencing self-reported moderate and high adherence were related to the burden of the disease and its treatment, specifically insulin, the self-perception of the disease outcomes and the level of patient’s knowledge about the disease and other factors like supportive family and healthcare team. Conclusion Adherence to DM and HTN was good, likely due to a patient-centered approach along with educational interventions. Future studies identifying additional factors and means addressing the barriers to adherence specific to the refugee population are needed to allow reaching optimal levels of adherence and design well-informed intervention programs."
https://openalex.org/W3162697279,"Objective Infants with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) are at risk for developmental delays, though the mechanisms of brain injury that impair development are unknown. Potential causes could include cerebral hypoxia and cerebrovascular instability. We hypothesized that we would detect significantly reduced cerebral oxygen saturation and greater cerebrovascular instability in CHD infants compared to the healthy controls. Methods We performed a secondary analysis on a sample of 43 term infants (28 CHD, 15 healthy controls) that assessed prospectively in temporal cross-section before or at 12 days of age. CHD infants were assessed prior to open-heart surgery. Cerebral oxygen saturation levels were estimated using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, and cerebrovascular stability was assessed with the response of cerebral oxygen saturation after a postural change (supine to sitting). Results Cerebral oxygen saturation was 9 points lower in CHD than control infants in both postures (β = -9.3; 95%CI = -17.68, -1.00; p = 0.028), even after controlling for differences in peripheral oxygen saturation. Cerebrovascular stability was significantly impaired in CHD compared to healthy infants (β = -2.4; 95%CI = -4.12, -.61; p = 0.008), and in CHD infants with single ventricle compared with biventricular defects (β = -1.5; 95%CI = -2.95, -0.05; p = 0.04). Conclusion CHD infants had cerebral hypoxia and decreased cerebral oxygen saturation values following a postural change, suggesting cerebrovascular instability. Future longitudinal studies should assess the associations of cerebral hypoxia and cerebrovascular instability with long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in CHD infants."
https://openalex.org/W3163644987,"Ship collision accidents are the primary threat to traffic safety in the sea. Collision accidents can cause casualties and environmental pollution. The collision risk is a major indicator for navigators and surveillance operators to judge the collision danger between meeting ships. The number of collision accidents per unit time in a certain water area can be considered to describe the regional collision risk However, historical ship collision accidents have contingencies, small sample sizes and weak regularities; hence, ship collision conflicts can be used as a substitute for ship collision accidents in characterizing the maritime traffic safety situation and have become an important part of methods that quantitatively study the traffic safety problem and its countermeasures. In this work, an EMD-QPSO-LSSVM approach, which is a hybrid of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) optimized least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model, is proposed to forecast ship collision conflicts. First, original ship collision conflict time series are decomposed into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue with EMD. Second, both the IMF components and residue are applied to establish the corresponding LSSVM models, where the key parameters of the LSSVM are optimized by QPSO algorithm. Then, each subseries is predicted with the corresponding LSSVM. Finally, the prediction values of the original ship collision conflict datasets are calculated by the sum of the forecasting values of each subseries. The prediction results of the proposed method is compared with GM, Lasso regression method, EMD-ENN, and the predicted results indicate that the proposed method is efficient and can be used for the ship collision conflict prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3161316933,"We present the development of a dual-mode imaging platform that combines optical microscopy with magnetic resonance microscopy. Our microscope is designed to operate inside a 9.4T small animal scanner with the option to use a 72mm bore animal RF coil or different integrated linear micro coils. With a design that minimizes the magnetic distortions near the sample, we achieved a field inhomogeneity of 19 ppb RMS. We further integrated a waveguide in the optical layout for the electromagnetic shielding of the camera, which minimizes the noise increase in the MR and optical images below practical relevance. The optical layout uses an adaptive lens for focusing, 2 × 2 modular combinations of objectives with 0.6mm to 2.3mm field of view and 4 configurable RGBW illumination channels and achieves a plano-apochromatic optical aberration correction with 0.6μm to 2.3μm resolution. We present the design, implementation and characterization of the prototype including the general optical and MR-compatible design strategies, a knife-edge optical characterization and different concurrent imaging demonstrations."
https://openalex.org/W3162241321,"The development of walking in young toddlers is an important motor milestone. Walking patterns can differ widely amongst toddlers, and are characterised by unique biomechanical strategies. This makes comparisons between newly walking toddler’s and older children’s walking difficult. Little is currently understood regarding the effects of footwear on the gait in newly walking toddlers. A quasi-experimental pre-post study design was used to assess whether spatiotemporal parameters of gait, and in-shoe foot and lower limb kinematics, differed when walking barefoot and in soft-soled footwear in newly walking toddlers. There were 18 toddlers recruited, with 14 undergoing testing. The GAITRite system collected spatial and temporal data. The Vicon camera system collected kinematic data. The testing conditions included barefoot and footwear. Footwear tested was a commercially available soft soled shoe (Bobux XPLORER). Data was extracted directly from the GAITRite system and analysed. Walking in footwear did not change spatial or temporal data, however there were small but significant decreases in hip adduction/abduction range of motion (mean difference (MD) = 1.79°, 95% CI = -3.51 to -0.07, p = 0.04), knee flexion (MD = -7.63°, 95% CI = 2.70 to 12.55, p = 0.01), and knee flexion/extension range of movement (MD = 6.25°, 95% CI = -10.49 to -2.01, p = 0.01), and an increase in subtalar joint eversion (MD = 2.85°, 95% CI = 5.29 to -0.41, p = 0.03). Effect sizes were small for hip and ankle range, peak knee extension, and subtalar joint ranges ( d &lt;0.49), medium for knee flexion/extension range ( d = 0.75) and large for peak knee flexion ( d = 0.87). The magnitude of kinematic changes with soft-soled footwear were small thus the clinical importance of these findings is uncertain. Future longitudinal studies are needed to develop recommendations regarding footwear for newly walking toddlers."

Current clinical monitoring, however, does not directly measure spinal cord blood flow, resulting in poor sensitivity/specificity, delayed alerts, and delayed intervention. We have developed an epidural device employing diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to monitor spinal cord ischemia continuously at multiple positions. We investigate the ability of this device to localize spinal cord ischemia in a porcine model and validate DCS versus Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF). Specifically, we demonstrate continuous (&gt;0.1Hz) spatially resolved (3 locations) monitoring of spinal cord blood flow in a purely ischemic model with an epidural DCS probe. Changes in blood flow measured by DCS and LDF were highly correlated (r = 0.83). Spinal cord blood flow measured by DCS caudal to aortic occlusion decreased 62%. This monitor demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.91 for detection of a 25% decrease in flow. This technology may enable early identification and critically important localization of spinal cord ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W3162706321,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the physical changes of the lower leg muscles in the compartment by observing the changes in the shear wave velocity of the gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior muscles with time in the sitting position for 2 hours and after elevation of the lower leg.The subjects were 24 healthy adult males (average age 26.6 years). Shear wave velocity was measured by Aplio 500 in immobilized leg immediately after the start of sitting, 60 minutes and 120 minutes after the start of sitting. After 120 minutes the subjects raised the lower leg for 3 minutes, then measured again.In the lateral and medial gastrocnemius, there was a significant increase in the velocity at 60 (1.58 ± 0.06, 1.70 ± 0.09 m/s) and 120 minutes (1.70 ± 0.10, 1.83 ± 0.11 m/s) after the start of the test (1.52 ± 0.06, 1.66 ± 0.10 m/s), respectively (p<0.01). In the soleus and the tibialis anterior, there was a significant increase in the velocity at 120 minutes (1.89 ± 0.17, 2.30 ± 0.24 m/s) compared to after the start (1.60 ± 0.15, 2.15 ± 0.26 m/s), respectively (p<0.01). In all muscles, there was a significant decrease in the velocity after the raising compared to that of 120 minutes (p<0.01).It has been reported that the change of shear wave velocity with time is proportional to the intramuscular pressure in the leg compartment, and it is assumed that the increase of shear wave velocity in the 2-hour seated leg is due to fluid retention in extra-cellular space of the compartment."
https://openalex.org/W3163100316,"Anxiety disorders are a group of mental illnesses that cause constant and overwhelming feelings of anxiety and fear. Excessive anxiety can make an individual avoid work, school, family get-togethers, and other social situations that in turn might amplify these symptoms. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in thirteen persons globally suffers from anxiety. It is high time to understand the roles of various clinical biomarker measures that can diagnose the types of anxiety disorders. In this study, we apply machine learning (ML) techniques to understand the importance of a set of biomarkers with four types of anxiety disorders—Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Agoraphobia (AP), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Panic Disorder (PD). We used several machine learning models and extracted the variable importance contributing to a type of anxiety disorder. The study uses a sample of 11,081 Dutch citizens’ data collected by the Lifelines, Netherlands. The results show that there are significant and low correlations among GAD, AP, PD and SAD and we extracted the variable importance hierarchy of biomarkers with respect to each type of anxiety disorder which will be helpful in designing the experimental setup for clinical trials related to influence of biomarkers on type of anxiety disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3160377072,"The impact of protected areas on local communities is the subject of intense discussions as part of the implementation of the global ecosystem protection agenda. Conflicts between the interests of environmental protection and the needs of socio-economic development become particularly acute when large areas of land are taken out of economic circulation as a result of organizing protected areas. In this case, there is an urgent need for detailed and reliable information about the social impacts of such land withdrawal on the well-being of the local population. An analysis of the methodological approaches widely presented in the literature, used to assess the social impact of protected areas, testifies to the insufficiency of completed and practically applicable methodological guidelines for the areas with significant restrictions for people who form part of the protected landscape. In this study, we understand the cost estimate of the social impact of national parks on the local population as a quantitative calculation of the losses due to restrictions on their ownership rights to land and property assets. The methodological approach consists in considering the category of losses as a sum total of the actual damage and lost profits. The assessment algorithm includes three stages: systematization of social impacts on citizens, development of indicators and data collection, and calculation of actual damage to the population and lost profits. The assessment is performed using the example of the Tunkinsky National Park located in the Tunkinsky municipal district of the Republic of Buryatia, a region of the Russian Federation, where there are 14 rural settlements with a population of more than 20,000 people. The results of the calculations show that the losses of the rural population due to legal restrictions on the registration of land dealings amount to 170.4 million USD. Taking into account the potential amount of administrative fines and the value of property subject to demolition, the losses amount to 239.2 million USD. It is more than an order of magnitude greater than the amount of own revenues of the Tunkinsky municipal district in 2011–2019. The results obtained demonstrate the real picture of the impact of restrictions on the rights of local people to land within the boundaries of national parks and are useful for developing measures to account for their interests and include protected areas in the socio-economic development of regions. The methodological approach developed by the authors can be used in other national parks, where it is necessary to optimize the policy of improving land use for local residents."
https://openalex.org/W3160386390,"Introduction The Curitiba (Brazil)-based Project, A Hora é Agora (AHA), evaluated a comprehensive HIV control strategy among men who have sex with men (MSM) aimed at expanding access to HIV rapid testing and linking HIV-positive MSM to health services and treatment. AHA’s approach included rapid HIV Testing Services (HTC) in one mobile testing unit (MTU); a local, gay-led, non-governmental organization (NGO); an existing government-run health facility (COA); and Internet-based HIV self-testing. The objectives of the paper were to compare a) number of MSM tested in each strategy, its positivity and linkage; b) social, demographic and behavioral characteristics of MSM accessing the different HTC and linkage services; and c) the costs of the individual strategies to diagnose and link MSM to services. Methods We used data for 2,681 MSM tested at COA, MTU and NGO from March 2015 to March 2017. This is a cross sectional comparison of the demographics and behavioral factors (age group, race/ethnicity, education, sexually transmitted diseases, knowledge of AHA services and previous HIV test). Absolute frequencies, percentage distributions and confidence intervals for the percentages were used, as well as unilateral statistical tests. Results and discussion AHA performed 2,681 HIV tests among MSM across three in-person strategies: MTU, NGO, and COA; and distributed 4,752 HIV oral fluid tests through the self-testing platform. MTU, NGO and COA reported 365 (13.6%) HIV positive diagnoses among MSM, including 28 users with previous HIV diagnosis or on antiretroviral treatment for HIV. Of these, 89% of MSM were eligible for linkage-to-care services. Linkage support was accepted by 86% of positive MSM, of which 66.7% were linked to services in less than 90 days. The MTU resulted in the lowest cost per MSM tested ($137 per test), followed by self-testing ($247). Conclusions AHA offered MSM access to HTC through innovative strategies operating in alternative sites and schedules. It presented the Curitiba HIV/AIDS community the opportunity to monitor HIV-positive MSM from diagnosis to treatment uptake. Self-testing emerged as a feasible strategy to increase MSM access to HIV-testing through virtual tools and anonymous test kit delivery and pick-up.

https://openalex.org/W3160614202,"Acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) is a lysosomal glycogen-catabolizing enzyme, the deficiency of which leads to Pompe disease. Pompe disease can be treated with systemic recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), but the current standard of care exhibits poor uptake in skeletal muscles, limiting its clinical efficacy. Furthermore, it is unclear how the specific cellular processing steps of GAA after delivery to lysosomes impact its efficacy. GAA undergoes both proteolytic cleavage and glycan trimming within the endolysosomal pathway, yielding an enzyme that is more efficient in hydrolyzing its natural substrate, glycogen. Here, we developed a tool kit of modified rhGAAs that allowed us to dissect the individual contributions of glycan trimming and proteolysis on maturation-associated increases in glycogen hydrolysis using in vitro and in cellulo enzyme processing, glycopeptide analysis by MS, and high-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection for enzyme kinetics. Chemical modifications of terminal sialic acids on N-glycans blocked sialidase activity in vitro and in cellulo, thereby preventing downstream glycan trimming without affecting proteolysis. This sialidase-resistant rhGAA displayed only partial activation after endolysosomal processing, as evidenced by reduced catalytic efficiency. We also generated enzymatically deglycosylated rhGAA that was shown to be partially activated despite not undergoing proteolytic processing. Taken together, these data suggest that an optimal rhGAA ERT would require both N-glycan and proteolytic processing to attain the most efficient enzyme for glycogen hydrolysis and treatment of Pompe disease.

Future studies should examine the amenability of next-generation ERTs to both types of cellular processing. Acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) is a soluble acid hydrolase that catabolizes glycogen in lysosomes (1Hers H.G. alpha-Glucosidase deficiency in generalized glycogenstorage disease (Pompe's disease).Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Approximately three-fourths of the body’s total glycogen is stored in muscles (2Jensen J. Rustad P.I. Kolnes A.J. Lai Y.C. The role of skeletal muscle glycogen breakdown for regulation of insulin sensitivity by exercise.Front. Physiol. 2011; 2: 112Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but unlike cytoplasmic glycogen that has a well-defined biological function as an energy source, the role of lysosomal glycogen has not yet been elucidated. Nonetheless, GAA plays an essential role in glycogen metabolism to help maintain cellular homeostasis in many cells, particularly in cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Biallelic pathogenic mutations in GAA result in Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II), a phenotypically variable disorder characterized by lysosomal glycogen accumulation, progressive muscle weakness, and respiratory insufficiency. The most severe cases have infantile onset and typically result in death by 1 year of age because of cardiac failure (3Kishnani P.S. Hwu W.L. Mandel H. Nicolino M. Yong F. Corzo D.

Late-onset patients also face the prospect of early mortality because of respiratory failure. Existing treatments for Pompe disease intend to restore lysosomal GAA activity through enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). As with many other enzymes targeted to the lysosome, endogenous GAA is post-translationally modified with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), which facilitates high-affinity binding to cation-dependent M6P receptors and cation-independent M6P receptor (CI-MPR), and enables transport to lysosomes from the trans-Golgi network (7Van der Ploeg A.T.

It is this natural endocytic CI-MPR pathway that is exploited for most lysosomal ERT. ERT is an unnatural process whereby recombinant lysosomal enzymes are infused into the circulation and requires the exogenous enzyme to be internalized into affected target cells to supplement the deficient activity. Several factors make lysosomal ERT targeting particularly difficult for rhGAA. The most problematic issue is that only a small fraction of intravenously delivered rhGAA reaches the interstitial space such that very low resultant ERT concentrations (estimated to be in tens of nanomolar range) are available for uptake in targeted muscle cells (estimated to be <1% of total enzyme dose) (13Do H.V. Khanna R. Gotschall R. Challenges in treating Pompe disease: An industry perspective.Ann. Transl. Med. 2019; 7: 291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore critical for rhGAA to be efficiently internalized via the CI-MPR pathway under these low enzyme conditions. However, the current U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved rhGAA ERT has a low abundance of M6P, particularly bisphosphorylated high-mannose N-glycans (bearing two M6Ps on same N-glycan), which severely limits cellular uptake of ERT at low interstitial enzyme concentrations. Bisphosphorylated N-glycans are known to have the highest binding affinity of all known carbohydrate structures for the CI-MPR and enable binding at low nanomolar concentrations (12Dahms N.M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2018; 495: 2418-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because monophosphorylated N-glycans cannot bind the CI-MPR at low nanomolar enzyme concentrations, this leads to inefficient cellular uptake and lysosomal delivery (14Tong P.Y. Gregory W.

Abnormal mannose-6-phosphate receptor trafficking impairs recombinant alpha-glucosidase uptake in Pompe disease fibroblasts.Pathogenetics. 2008; 1: 6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), compounding these difficulties in target muscle cells, where pathology is often widespread at the time of treatment. In the face of these limitations, it is critical for the small amount of rhGAA that is internalized in cells to exhibit optimal glycogen hydrolytic activity once in lysosomes. Endolysosomal processing appears to be essential for attaining peak activity (10Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J.

After endolysosomal delivery, the single-chain, 110-kDa GAA precursor undergoes sequential proteolytic processing to attain the mature 76/70 kDa forms (18Moreland R.J. Jin X. Zhang X.K. Decker R.W.

Glycan trimming also takes place within the endolysosomal system, whereby terminal monosaccharides are sequentially removed resulting in approximately five monosaccharides per glycan in the mature form as opposed to 9 to 11 monosaccharides per glycan in the precursor form (18Moreland R.J.

The mature GAA form has been reported to exhibit a 10-fold higher affinity for glycogen (10Wisselaar H.A. Kroos M.A. Hermans M.M. van Beeumen J. Reuser A.J.

Structure of human lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase-a guide for the treatment of Pompe disease.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the concomitant nature of these proteolytic and glycan trimming events has made it difficult to understand their individual contributions toward increased enzyme activity and affinity for glycogen. Although structural studies of rhGAA define a role for proteolytic processing in GAA maturation (19Roig-Zamboni V. Cobucci-Ponzano B. Iacono R. Ferrara M.C. Germany S. Bourne Y. Parenti G. Moracci M. Sulzenbacher G. Structure of human lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase-a guide for the treatment of Pompe disease.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), there are reasons to believe that glycan trimming may also be important. GAA contains seven potential N-glycosylation sites, six of which are always glycosylated, whereas a single site near the C terminus is glycosylated approximately 50% of the time (18Moreland R.J. Jin X. Zhang X.K. Decker R.W. Albee K.L. Lee K.L. Cauthron R.D. Brewer K. Edmunds T. Canfield W.M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6780-6791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One of these, site 5 (N652), is proximal to the active site of the enzyme (19Roig-Zamboni V. Cobucci-Ponzano B. Iacono R. Ferrara M.C. Germany S. Bourne Y. Parenti G. Moracci M. Sulzenbacher G. Structure of human lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase-a guide for the treatment of Pompe disease.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and bulky untrimmed glycan structures here could potentially hinder substrate interactions. Here, we developed a tool kit of modified rhGAAs that allowed us to individually dissect the relative contributions of glycan trimming and proteolysis on glycogen hydrolytic activity. First, we chemically modified terminal sialic acids on rhGAA N-glycans to block glycan trimming. Because N-glycan trimming proceeds in a sequential manner through the action of specific exoglycosidases within lysosomes, we hypothesized that blocking cleavage of the terminal sialic acid residue would also block all subsequent glycan trimming of sialylated complex-type glycans, without affecting proteolysis. This would enable us to assess the impact of proteolytic processing for improving GAA activity. We also generated an rhGAA with N-glycan structures that could be enzymatically removed in vitro without affecting its native protein structure or enzyme activity. This allowed us to assess the effects of glycan trimming on GAA activation without concomitant proteolytic cleavage. Together, these tools allowed us to discern the relative impacts of proteolysis and glycan trimming on the glycogen hydrolytic activity of GAA. To investigate the relative contributions of glycan trimming and proteolytic processing on GAA maturation, we developed a tool kit of modified rhGAAs that would allow us to assess these processes independently. First, we modified sialylated complex-type N-glycans, which are the most abundant N-glycan structures on rhGAA (11McVie-Wylie A.J. Lee K.L. Qiu H. Jin X. Do H. Gotschall R. Thurberg B.L. Rogers C. Raben N. O'Callaghan M. Canfield W. Andrews L. McPherson J.M. Mattaliano R.J. Biochemical and pharmacological characterization of different recombinant acid alpha-glucosidase preparations evaluated for the treatment of Pompe disease.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2008; 94: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), in such a manner that would render them nonhydrolyzable. The glycerol moiety extending from C7 of terminal sialic acid is known to be involved in substrate recognition by exosialidases through enzyme side-chain interactions with O7 and O9 oxygens on the sugar (20Mozzi A. Mazzacuva P. Zampella G. Forcella M.E. Fusi P.A. Monti E. Molecular insight into substrate recognition by human cytosolic sialidase NEU2.Proteins. 2012; 80: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that removing this moiety by oxidation or replacing it with aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) would disrupt substrate binding or positioning of the glycosidic bond for hydrolysis, and thereby block exosialidase activity. Given the sequential nature of glycan processing by various resident lysosomal exoglycosidases, we reasoned that blocking sialidase activity would also block the activities of downstream exoglycosidases by impeding access to their substrates, thereby interrupting all processing of sialylated glycans without impacting the processing of nonsialylated glycans or proteolytic processing. Oxidation of sialic acid with sodium periodate followed by aniline-catalyzed oximation to introduce aminooxy functional groups to C7 was utilized for this purpose because this approach is well established for applications such as solid support immobilization and tag conjugation (21Zeng Y.

High-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) revealed that 2 mM sodium metaperiodate treatment only partially oxidized terminal sialic acids (∼30%), whereas 10 mM sodium metaperiodate oxidized >90% of terminal sialic acids (data not shown). We therefore utilized rhGAA samples with >90% oxidized sialic acids for subsequent reactions with AOAA to obtain rhGAA–AOAA (Fig. 1, A and B) with oxime-bonded AOAA at C7. We examined the efficiency of AOAA conjugation via glycopeptide analysis by LC coupled to high-resolution tandem MS. An unbiased analysis of the glycan structures at each of the seven N-glycan sites on unmodified rhGAA revealed greater glycan microheterogeneity than previously reported (11McVie-Wylie A.J. Lee K.L.

Metab. 2008; 94: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). Examination of rhGAA–AOAA revealed that ∼4 mol of AOAA was added per mol of rhGAA (Table S1, Fig. S2), in agreement with published reaction efficiencies (25Zhou Q. Stefano J.E. Harrahy J. Finn P. Avila L. Kyazike J. Wei R. Van Patten S.M. Gotschall R. Zheng X. Zhu Y. Edmunds T. Pan C.Q. Strategies for neoglycan conjugation to human acid alpha-glucosidase.Bioconjug. Chem. 2011; 22: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As a representative example, we analyzed precursor (MS1) and higher-energy collisional dissociation MS2 (HCD MS2) spectra of the rhGAA tryptic glycopeptide, 882NNTIVNELVR891, bearing the highly abundant glycan structure FA2G2S2 at Asn882 [glycan structure nomenclature according to the Oxford convention, where F indicates a core fucose, Ax where x is the number of antenna (GlcNAc) on the trimannosyl core of the complex N-glycan structure, Gx, where x is the number of linked galactose, and Sx, where x is the number of sialic acids linked to galactose] (Fig. 2, A and B). The LC-MS spectra confirmed the presence of two terminal sialic acids on this glycopeptide derived from unmodified rhGAA (Fig. 2A). For the corresponding glycopeptide from rhGAA–AOAA, spectra revealed that both terminal sialic acids were oxidized, but only one of the two oxidized sialic acids were further modified with AOAA (Fig. 2B). Nonetheless, these LC-MS data indicate that there is sufficient modification of terminal sialic acids for assessing potential downstream impacts on glycan processing. We also sought to generate a form of rhGAA that could undergo glycan trimming in the absence of any proteolytic processing. To achieve this, we first expressed rhGAA in the presence of the alpha-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine (kif) and purified the secreted 110-kDa precursor GAA referred to here as rhGAA–kif, which primarily contained high mannose-type N-glycans (27Choi H.Y. Park H. Hong J.K. Kim S.D. Kwon J.Y. You S. Do J. Lee D.Y. Kim H.H. Kim D.I. N-glycan remodeling using mannosidase inhibitors to increase high-mannose glycans on acid α-glucosidase in transgenic rice cell cultures.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 16130Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As expected, LC-MS analysis confirmed that rhGAA–kif contained high-mannose-type N-glycans on sites 1 to 5 of seven possible N-glycan sites (Fig. S3). Representative HCD MS2 spectra for the glycopeptide 631ILQFNLLGVPLVGADVCGFLGNTSEE656 containing Asn 652 (site 5), which is proximal to the active site of GAA, demonstrate the presence of the glycan structure M8 (where Mx represents the number of mannose residues according to the Oxford convention) (Fig. 3, A and B). Sites 6 and 7 still were found to contain complex N-glycans in addition to high-mannose-type N-glycans (Fig. S3). We then subjected rhGAA–kif to in vitro deglycosylation by treatment with Endoglycosidase H (Endo H), which cleaves between the two GlcNAc residues of the chitobiose core of high-mannose-type N-glycans, leaving a single GlcNAc attached to Asn (28Freeze H.H. Kranz C. Endoglycosidase and glycoamidase release of N-linked glycans.Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2010; (Chapter 17, Unit 17.13A)Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Endo H treatment resulted in a single N-linked GlcNAc being the most abundant structure at all seven sites, although complex glycans were also observed at sites 6 and 7 at lower abundances (Fig. S4). A notable and expected shift in retention time was also observed between the untreated and Endo H–treated glycopeptides for site 5 (extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) with a shift in retention time compared with the corresponding untreated glycopeptide from rhGAA–kif and precursor MS1 and HCD MS2 spectra for the Endo H–treated glycopeptide containing Asn 652 bearing a single GlcNAc residue are shown in Figure 3, A–C). MS analysis confirmed that no proteolytic cleavage occurred after purification of the rhGAA–kif precursor, with peptide coverage obtained for both termini (data not shown). The major advantage of this approach was that we were able to remove N-glycans without denaturing the protein or altering enzyme activity for studying the direct impact of glycan trimming independent of protein processing for GAA activation. Human sialidases exhibit a high degree of substrate specificity (20Mozzi A. Mazzacuva P. Zampella G. Forcella M.E. Fusi P.A. Monti E.

To investigate this, we examined whether chemical modifications to C7 of terminal sialic acids impact sialidase activity. Sialidase activity can be monitored by Eastern blotting with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which recognizes terminal sialic acids. Unmodified precursor rhGAA, 30% oxidized rhGAA, 90% oxidized rhGAA, and rhGAA–AOAA all exhibited a robust WGA signal as expected given that WGA binds to sialic acids through the C2 through C4 positions of the pyranose ring (30Gol"

To understand where patients with STIs seek healthcare, we evaluated the relationship between CT infections and the place where individuals report usually receiving healthcare. Methods Our study used a nationally representative sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2016. The study population is adult patients, aged 18 to 39 years in whom a urine CT screen was obtained. Logistic regression models were used to determine if location of usual healthcare was predictive of a positive urine CT screen result. Models were adjusted for known confounders including age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and insurance status. Results In this nationally representative sample (n = 19,275; weighted n = 85.8 million), 1.9% of individuals had a positive urine CT result. Participants reported usually going to the doctor’s office (70.3%), “no place” (24.8%), Emergency Department (ED) (3.3%), or “other” place (1.7%) for healthcare. In adjusted models, the predicted probability of having a positive urine CT result is higher (4.9% vs 3.2%, p = 0.022; OR = 1.58) among those that reported the ED as their usual place for healthcare compared to those that reported going to a doctor’s office or clinic. Conclusions Individuals having a positive urine CT screen are associated with using the ED as a usual source for healthcare. Understanding this association has the potential to improve STI clinical and policy interventions as the ED may be a critical site in combatting the record high rates of STIs."
https://openalex.org/W3161937029,"The cytokine RANKL is essential for osteoclast formation during physiological and pathological bone resorption. RANKL also contributes to lymphocyte production, development of lymph nodes and mammary glands, as well as other biological activities. Transcriptional control of the Tnfsf11 gene, which encodes RANKL, is complex and involves distant regulatory regions. Nevertheless, cell culture studies suggest that an enhancer region near the transcription start site is involved in the control of Tnfsf11 expression by hormones such as 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D 3 and parathyroid hormone, as well as the sympathetic nervous system. To address the significance of this region in vivo, we deleted the sequence between -510 to -1413 bp, relative to Tnfsf11 exon 1, from mice using CRISPR-based gene editing. MicroCT analysis of the femur and fourth lumbar vertebra of enhancer knockout mice showed no differences in bone mass compared to wild type littermates at 5 weeks and 6 months of age, suggesting no changes in osteoclast formation. RNA extracted from the tibia, fifth lumbar vertebra, thymus, and spleen at 6 months of age also showed no reduction in Tnfsf11 mRNA abundance between these groups. However, maximal stimulation of Tnfsf11 mRNA abundance in cultured stromal cells by PTH was reduced approximately 40% by enhancer deletion, while stimulation by 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D 3 was unaffected. The abundance of B and T lymphocytes in the bone marrow did not differ between genotypes. These results demonstrate that the region between -510 and -1413 does not contribute to Tnfsf11 expression, osteoclast support, or lymphocyte production in mice under normal physiological conditions but may be involved in situations of elevated parathyroid hormone."

On the basis of the idea that education plays an important role in the socialization process, transmitted by the inherited culture, to integrate each subject within the specific community, and the notion of scale as the closest to heritage, we defined as general objectives to determine the relationships between geographic scales, heritage perspective and the didactic potential granted to heritage, within the framework of the construction of collective identities, and to contrast the perspectives of students and teachers regarding the geographical scale, heritage and their didactic potential, deducing implications for educational practices. In order to answer to these objectives, we carried out a non-experimental quantitative research, with a relational-predictive objective. Specifically, we used a survey method, being the context the whole of the local scale (Fuente Álamo, Murcia, Spain) and acting as participants all students and teachers of Secondary Education (n = 459) linked to social sciences. They answered the Test on Didactic Potentiality of Heritage according to Scale (TDPHS), and its information was analysed through different procedures (Spearman’s correlations, descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U…), using the statistical programs SPSS. The results show, on the one hand, that the scalar perspective scores are generally low, heritage perspective is consistent with the consideration of the scales, and the perceived didactic potential in relation to heritage is related to the importance given to each of the scales; and, on the other hand, the contrast in the perspectives of students and teachers regarding the geographical scale, heritage and their didactic potential is minimal."

Hence, we report the development of a fit-for-purpose assay for detection of blood PD-L1 mRNA expression using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). TaqMan® assays were selected based on coverage of the PD-L1 gene and were tested for linearity and efficiency using real-time quantitative PCR. Four reference genes were analyzed in positive control cell line (A549 treated with interferon gamma, [IFN γ]) genomic DNA. The PD-L1 primer/probe sets were also evaluated in ddPCR for limit of blank, limit of detection, and precision. Finally, thirty-five healthy volunteer samples were evaluated to establish a baseline level of PD-L1 expression. In ddPCR, the limit of blank was determined to be 0 copies and the limit of detection was determined to be less than or equal to 19 copies of PD-L1. The average intra-run coefficient of variation in the ddPCR assay was 7.44% and average inter-run CV was 7.70%. Treatment of A549 cells with IFN γ resulted in a 6.7-fold increase in PD-L1 expression (21,580 copies in untreated cDNA versus 145,000 copies in treated cDNA). Analysis of healthy human samples yielded a median value of 1659 PD-L1 copies/μL with a range of 768–7510 copies/μL. The assay was transferred to an external service provider and results from our in-house experiments and those conducted externally shows a correlation of 0.994. In conclusion, a fit-for-purpose liquid biopsy-based, purely quantitative ddPCR assay for the detection of PD-L1 mRNA expression was developed and validated using PAXgene RNA blood samples. Linearity, reproducibility, limit of blank and limit of detection were measured and deemed suitable for clinical application. This ultra-sensitive liquid biopsy ddPCR assay has promising clinical potential in screening, longitudinal monitoring and disease progression detection."
https://openalex.org/W3160726092,"The management of acute decompensated heart failure often requires intensive care. However, the effects of early intensive care unit/coronary care unit admission on activities of daily living (ADL) in acute decompensated heart failure patients have not been precisely evaluated. Thus, we retrospectively assessed the association between early intensive care unit admission and post-discharge ADL performance in these patients. Acute decompensated heart failure patients (New York Heart Association I-III) admitted on emergency between April 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018, were selected from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database and divided into intensive care unit/coronary care unit (ICU) and general ward (GW) groups according to the hospitalization type on admission day 1. The propensity score was calculated to create matched cohorts where admission style (intensive care unit/coronary care unit admission) was independent of measured baseline confounding factors, including ADL at admission. The primary outcome was ADL performance level at discharge (post-ADL) defined according to the Barthel index. Secondary outcomes included length of stay and total hospitalization cost (expense). Overall, 12231 patients were eligible, and propensity score matching created 2985 pairs. After matching, post-ADL was significantly higher in the ICU group than in the GW group [mean (standard deviation), GW vs. ICU: 71.5 (35.3) vs. 78.2 (31.2) points, P<0.001; mean difference: 6.7 (95% confidence interval, 5.1-8.4) points]. After matching, length of stay was significantly shorter and expenses were significantly higher in the ICU group than in the GW group. Stratified analysis showed that the patients with low ADL at admission (Barthel index score <60) were the most benefited from early intensive care unit/coronary care unit admission. Thus, early intensive care unit/coronary care unit admission was associated with improved post-ADL in patients with emergency acute decompensated heart failure admission."
https://openalex.org/W3161206241,"Background Urinary biomarkers for organ dysfunction could predict the outcomes of severe trauma patients. However, the use of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as a biomarker of trauma is not well studied. Objectives To evaluate the association between the short-term prognosis of trauma patients and NGAL levels. Methods We conducted a single center study and compared predictive performances between NGAL levels and the trauma severity. Results A total of 104 patients were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups based on ISS score of 16. There was no significant difference in patient characteristics based on trauma severity. However, the lactate level was significantly higher in the more severe group. There was a significant association between urinary NGAL levels and trauma severity indicators, such as intensive care unit stay (ICU) (p = 0.005) and emergency care unit (ECU) stay (p = 0.049). In addition, receiver operating curve analysis showed that as a predictor, NGAL could be used for detecting severity with moderate precision, especially for short-term outcomes (specificity 70.6 for ICU and 69.0 for ECU stay). Conclusion In this study, we revealed that the level of NGAL could predict the degree of invasiveness in trauma patients with moderate precision and estimate the duration of treatment during the acute phase. It is necessary to examine the validity of the findings of this study using a prospective, cohort, and multi-center collaborative study design."
https://openalex.org/W3162126058,"Background Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is a key effector molecule regulated by the Hippo pathway and described as a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer. Tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutation is well known as a biomarker related to poor survival outcomes. So far clinical characteristics and survival outcome according to YAP1 and TP53 mutation have been poorly identified in breast cancer. Patients and methods Retrospectively, 533 breast tumor tissues were collected at the Seoul St Mary’s hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital from 1992 to 2017. Immunohistochemistry with YAP1 and p53 specific antibodies were performed, and the clinical data were analyzed. Results Mutant p53 pattern was associated with aggressive tumor features and advanced anatomical stage. Inferior overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) were related with mutant p53 pattern cases with low nuclear YAP1 expression ( P = 0.0009 and P = 0.0011, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that mutant p53 pattern was an independent prognostic marker for OS [hazard ratios (HR): 2.938, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.028–8.395, P = 0.044] and RFS (HR: 1.842, 95% CIs: 1.026–3.304). However, in cases with high nuclear YAP1 expression, there were no significantly difference in OS and RFS according to p53 staining pattern. Conclusion We found that mutant p53 pattern is a poor prognostic biomarker in breast tumor with low nuclear YAP1 expression. Our findings suggest that interaction between nuclear YAP1 and p53 expression pattern impact survival outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3162219119,"The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the invasive European fire ant (Myrmica rubra) are both expanding throughout their sympatric range in coastal New England. Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is the causative agent of Lyme disease, and Mount Desert Island, Maine, home to Acadia National Park, currently is affected by a high Lyme disease burden. Ticks have many natural predators, including ants, although no previous studies have investigated interactions between these two species. To test the hypothesis that the presence of M. rubra alters I. scapularis abundance, we collected ticks by drag-sampling at eight ant-infested sites and eight uninfested control sites in Acadia National Park. We found that nymph density was significantly higher at ant-infested sites, while larval density was significantly higher at control sites. In addition, we conducted a laboratory bioassay to measure M. rubra aggression against I. scapularis larvae, nymphs, and adults and Dermacentor variabilis adults, and found that ant aggression was significantly higher against D. variabilis adults than I. scapularis adults. Our findings support the hypothesis that M. rubra has divergent effects across I. scapularis life stages, and we discuss possible ecological mechanisms, including optimal microclimate and predation, that could promote density of nymphs while inhibiting density of larvae."
https://openalex.org/W3162565602,"Species trees, which describe the evolutionary relationships between species, are often inferred from gene trees, which describe the ancestral relationships between sequences sampled at different loci from the species of interest. A common approach to inferring species trees from gene trees is motivated by supposing that gene tree variation is due to incomplete lineage sorting, also known as deep coalescence. One of the earliest methods motivated by deep coalescence is to find the species tree that minimizes the number of deep coalescent events needed to explain discrepancies between the species tree and input gene trees. This minimize deep coalescence (MDC) criterion can be applied in both rooted and unrooted settings. where either rooted or unrooted gene trees can be used to infer a rooted species tree. Previous work has shown that MDC is statistically inconsistent in the rooted setting, meaning that under a probabilistic model for deep coalescence, the multispecies coalescent, for some species trees, increasing the number of input gene trees does not make the method more likely to return a correct species tree. Here, we obtain analogous results in the unrooted setting, showing conditions leading to inconsistency of the MDC criterion using the multispecies coalescent model with unrooted gene trees for four taxa and five taxa."
https://openalex.org/W3163299268,"Buchnera aphidicola is an intracellular bacterial symbiont of aphids and maintains a small genome of only 600 kbps. Buchnera is thought to maintain only genes relevant to the symbiosis with its aphid host. Curiously, the Buchnera genome contains gene clusters coding for flagellum basal body structural proteins and for flagellum type III export machinery. These structures have been shown to be highly expressed and present in large numbers on Buchnera cells. No recognizable pathogenicity factors or secreted proteins have been identified in the Buchnera genome, and the relevance of this protein complex to the symbiosis is unknown. Here, we show isolation of Buchnera flagellum basal body proteins from the cellular membrane of Buchnera , confirming the enrichment of flagellum basal body proteins relative to other proteins in the Buchnera proteome. This will facilitate studies of the structure and function of the Buchnera flagellum structure, and its role in this model symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W3163363786,"In this study, we introduced a mixed-precision weights network (MPWN), which is a quantization neural network that jointly utilizes three different weight spaces: binary {−1,1}, ternary {−1,0,1}, and 32-bit floating-point. We further developed the MPWN from both software and hardware aspects. From the software aspect, we evaluated the MPWN on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. We systematized the accuracy sparsity bit score, which is a linear combination of accuracy, sparsity, and number of bits. This score allows Bayesian optimization to be used efficiently to search for MPWN weight space combinations. From the hardware aspect, we proposed XOR signed-bits to explore floating-point and binary weight spaces in the MPWN. XOR signed-bits is an efficient implementation equivalent to multiplication of floating-point and binary weight spaces. Using the concept from XOR signed bits, we also provide a ternary bitwise operation that is an efficient implementation equivalent to the multiplication of floating-point and ternary weight space. To demonstrate the compatibility of the MPWN with hardware implementation, we synthesized and implemented the MPWN in a field-programmable gate array using high-level synthesis. Our proposed MPWN implementation utilized up to 1.68-4.89 times less hardware resources depending on the type of resources than a conventional 32-bit floating-point model. In addition, our implementation reduced the latency up to 31.55 times compared to 32-bit floating-point model without optimizations."
https://openalex.org/W3163917143,"The Immune System-Released Activating Agent (ISRAA) was discovered as a novel molecule that functions as a mediator between the nervous and immune systems in response to a nervous stimulus following an immune challenge. This research investigated the role of ISRAA) in promoting the ontogeny of the mouse brain astrocytes. Astrocyte cultures were prepared from two-month-old BALB/c mice. Recombinant ISRAA protein was used to stimulate astrocyte cultures. Immunohistochemistry and ELISA were utilized to measure ISRAA and IFN-γ levels, IFN-γR expression and STAT1 nuclear translocation. MTT-assay was used to evaluate cellular survival and proliferation. To assess astrocyte cell lysates and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, SDS-PAGE and western blot were used. ISRAA was highly expressed in mouse embryonic astrocytes, depending on cell age. Astrocytes aged seven days (E7) showed increased proliferation and diminished differentiation, while 21-day-old (E21) astrocytes depicted reversed effects. IFN-γ was involved in the ISRAA action as ISRAA induced IFN-γ in both age groups, but only E21 astrocytes expressed IFN-γR. ISRAA stimulation of E21 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins and the nuclear translocation of STAT1, a signalling pathway utilized by IFN-γ. The results suggest that ISRAA is involved in mouse brain development through the cytokine network involving IFN-γ."
https://openalex.org/W3127613131,"Privacy concerns are widely discussed in research and society in general. For the public infrastructure of financial blockchains, this discussion encompasses the privacy of the originator of a transaction broadcasted on the underlying peer-to-peer network. Adaptive diffusion is an approach to expose an alternative source of a message to attackers. However, this approach assumes an unsuitable attacker model and a non-realistic network model for current peer-to-peer networks on the Internet. We transform adaptive diffusion into a new statistical privacy-preserving broadcast protocol for realistic current networks. We model a class of unstructured peer-to-peer networks as organically growing graphs and provide models for other classes of such networks. We show that the distribution of shortest paths can be modelled using a normal distribution [Formula: see text]. We determine statistical estimators for μ, σ via multivariate models. The model behaves logarithmic over the number of nodes n and proportional to an inverse exponential over the number of added edges per node k. These results facilitate the computation of optimal forwarding probabilities during the dissemination phase for maximum privacy, with participants having only limited information about network topology."
https://openalex.org/W3160048013,"As an alternative for phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, a simpler ester linked fatty acid (ELFA) analysis has been developed to characterize soil microbial communities. However, few studies have compared the two methods in forest soils where the contribution of nonmicrobial sources may be larger than that of microbial sources. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the two methods yield similar relationships of microbial biomass and composition with environmental variables. Here, we compared PLFA and ELFA methods with respect to microbial biomass and composition and their relationships with environmental variables in six oriental oak (Quercus variabilis) forest sites along a 1500-km latitudinal gradient in East China. We found that both methods had a low sample-to-sample variability and successfully separated overall community composition of sites. However, total, bacterial, and fungal biomass, the fungal-to-bacterial ratio, and the gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria ratio were not significantly or strongly correlated between the two methods. The relationships of these microbial properties with environmental variables (pH, precipitation, and clay) greatly differed between the two methods. Our study indicates that despite its simplicity, the ELFA method may not be as feasible as the PLFA method for investigating microbial biomass and composition and for identifying their dominant environmental drivers, at least in forest soils."
https://openalex.org/W3160679196,"During last years “irreproducibility” became a general problem in omics data analysis due to the use of sophisticated and poorly described computational procedures. For avoiding misleading results, it is necessary to inspect and reproduce the entire data analysis as a unified product. Reproducible Research (RR) provides general guidelines for public access to the analytic data and related analysis code combined with natural language documentation, allowing third-parties to reproduce the findings. We developed easyreporting , a novel R/Bioconductor package, to facilitate the implementation of an RR layer inside reports/tools. We describe the main functionalities and illustrate the organization of an analysis report using a typical case study concerning the analysis of RNA-seq data. Then, we show how to use easyreporting in other projects to trace R functions automatically. This latter feature helps developers to implement procedures that automatically keep track of the analysis steps. Easyreporting can be useful in supporting the reproducibility of any data analysis project and shows great advantages for the implementation of R packages and GUIs. It turns out to be very helpful in bioinformatics, where the complexity of the analyses makes it extremely difficult to trace all the steps and parameters used in the study."
https://openalex.org/W3161569934,"Background Majority of active tuberculosis (TB) cases in children in low-incidence countries are due to rapid progression of infection (latent TB infection (LTBI)) to disease. We aimed to assess common practice for managing paediatric LTBI in Austria, Germany and Switzerland prior to the publication of the first joint national guideline for paediatric TB in 2017. Methods Online-based survey amongst pediatricians, practitioners and staff working in the public health sector between July and November 2017. Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS. Results A total of 191 individuals participated in the survey with 173 questionnaires included for final analysis. Twelve percent of respondents were from Austria, 60% from Germany and 28% from Switzerland. Proportion of children with LTBI and migrant background was estimated by the respondents to be &gt;50% by 58%. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ-release-assay (IGRA), particularly Quantiferon-gold-test, were reported to be used in 86% and 88%, respectively. In children &gt; 5 years with a positive TST or IGRA a chest x-ray was commonly reported to be performed (28%). Fifty-three percent reported to take a different diagnostic approach in children ≤ 5 years, mainly combining TST, IGRA and chest x-ray for initial testing (31%). Sixty-eight percent reported to prescribe isoniazid-monotherapy: for 9 (62%), or 6 months (6%), 31% reported to prescribe combination therapy of isoniazid and rifampicin. Dosing of isoniazid and rifampicin below current recommendations was reported by up to 22% of respondents. Blood-sampling before/during LTBI treatment was reported in &gt;90% of respondents, performing a chest-X-ray at the end of treatment by 51%. Conclusion This survey showed reported heterogeneity in the management of paediatric LTBI. Thus, regular and easily accessible educational activities and national up-to-date guidelines are key to ensure awareness and quality of care for children and adolescents with LTBI in low-incidence countries."
https://openalex.org/W3161640894,"Chl1 is a member of the XPD family of 5'-3' DNA helicases, which perform a variety of roles in genome maintenance and transmission. They possess a variety of unique structural features, including the presence of a highly variable, partially-ordered insertion in the helicase domain 1. Chl1 has been shown to be required for chromosome segregation in yeast due to its role in the formation of persistent chromosome cohesion during S-phase. Here we present structural and biochemical data to show that Chl1 has the same overall domain organisation as other members of the XPD family, but with some conformational alterations. We also present data suggesting the insert domain in Chl1 regulates its DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W3163682993,"Background Increasing coffee intake was inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in Western countries. However, in China where coffee consumption and diabetes population has been growing fast in recent years, studies on the impact of coffee intakes on the onset of type 2 diabetes are lacking. This study attempts to determine the associations between coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes in Chinese adults. Methods This longitudinal study analyzed 10447 adults who had participated in at least two rounds of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), which is a survey database of multistage, random cluster process during 1993–2011. Coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes incidence were measured in the survey. Body mass index (BMI), age, sex, place of residence, waves, education level, smoking, drinking alcohol and tea drinking frequency were adjusted as covariate. We used longitudinal fixed effects regression models to assess changes within person. Results After adjusting confounding factors, lower risk of diabetes is observed among Chinese adults who drink coffee occasionally (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.34) and drink almost every day (AOR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.45, 0.83), compared with those who do not or hardly drink. In the subgroup analysis, among women aged 45–59 who drink coffee one to three times a week (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.08, 0.52) and men over 60 who drink coffee almost every day (AOR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.07, 0.53), protective effects were found. For young men aged 19–29, drinking coffee almost every day showed a risk effect (AOR = 20.21, 95% CI = 5.96–68.57). Conclusions Coffee drinking habit is an independent protective factor for adult on type 2 diabetes in China. And it varies among people with different ages and genders. The rapid growth of coffee consumption in China in recent years may help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but at the same time, the risk of type 2 diabetes in adolescents needs attention."
