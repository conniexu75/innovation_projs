https://openalex.org/W1535514846,"Abstract 1. A simple internal calibration technique was used to construct accurate molecular weight-mobility profiles on polyacrylamide gels with well characterized proteins, and the existence of a critical point was observed for small polypeptides. The useful size range limits were determined for several gel concentrations. Apparent molecular weights generally fell within 5 to 6% of literature values, although a few anomalous proteins, notably ribonuclease, considerably exceeded this margin of error. 2. The effects of intrinsic molecular charge and conformation on electrophoretic behavior in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, evaluated by studies on a set of model proteins, were found to be small. 3. The results are in accord with a model in which the protein somehow organizes the sodium dodecyl sulfate anions into a micellar complex of definite size. Although the stoichiometry of the complex is apparently governed not only by the size of the molecule, but also by its state of foldedness, the interplay of anion binding and frictional resistance to passage through the gel is such as to produce a relatively constant log size to mobility ratio. 4. The apparent molecular weights of the five polypeptide chains of Mouse-Elberfeld virus were determined."

As a gel filtration medium, 6% agarose permits useful molecular weight estimates between the extreme limits of 80,000 and 1,000. Provided weight rather than volume is used to measure elution position, excellent precision and accuracy can be obtained. A plot of log molecular weight versus elution position yields a sigmoidal curve from which molecular weights can be estimated with an accuracy of 7% in the nearly linear portion of the curve (40,000 to 10,000 molecular weight) and 10% at the extreme calibration limits."

Kinetin (6-furfurylaminopurine) is a specific requirement for this differentiation; the absence of this compound results in a blockage of the formation of grana. The possibility that kinetin exerts a direct effect upon chloroplast differentiation is considered.

Antibody activity was found in their spleens in localized areas whose number corresponded to the number of spleen cells injected. When sheep and pig erythrocytes were injected together, antibody against each was found in separate areas. Each area may consist of the progeny of a single precursor cell, restricted to forming a single antibody."

The enzyme has a pH optimum at 8.5, requires Mg++ or Mn++ as a cofactor, and has a molecular weight of 52,000 ± 5,000. It hydrolyzes denatured DNA four times more rapidly than native DNA with no apparent base specificity, but it does not attack RNA. DNA is degraded from the 3′ end with the release of 5′-mononucleotides and dinucleotides. DNase III is localized in the cell nucleus, and it appears to be the predominant DNA exonuclease in many different mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2065829699,Contamination of Strain L cell cultures by pleuropneumonia-like organismtis (PPLO) resulted in a complete inhibition of the incorporation of tritiated thymnidine and uridine. Contanminated cultures were characterized by a concentration of PPLO along the margins of the cells and in the intercellular-spaces of the cultures. Autoracliograins of PPLO-contaminated cultures were characterized by exposed silver grains over the margins of the cells. Kanamnycin was efjective in the elimination of PPLO and the restoration of nucleoside incorporation.

https://openalex.org/W1483047461,"Abstract A photosynthetic reaction center complex has been isolated from the blue-green mutant strain R-26 of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides by Triton X-100 treatment, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and gel filtration. In this complex, the only bacteriochlorophyll is the specialized reaction center component, P870, and the associated P800. The reaction center preparations appear nearly homogeneous by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. Gel filtration indicates a particle weight near 6.5 x 105, and the particle contains approximately 35% lipid-extractable material. Other components of the complex and their approximate ratios are: 1 P870, 2 P800, 13 ubiquinone, 2 cytochrome b562, 1 cytochrome c552, 16 total iron, and 9 copper. The light-induced absorbance changes of this complex are indistinguishable from those which have been associated with the primary photochemical reactions of bacterial photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2079801723,"The orbital region of the cortex in the cat is essential to the occurrence of spontaneous spindle bursts and thalamically induced recruiting responses, observed in both cortex and thalamus. Ablations of the entire dorsal convexity, and of the mesial and cingulate regions of the cortex, failed to interfere with the spindle bursts and recruiting responses, whereas ablations confined to the orbital cortex alone abolished completely these potentials in the cortex and thalamus. Therefore, the orbital cortex appears to be the only region of the neocortex to play a crucial role in the regulation of thalamocortical synchronizing and integrating functions. These functions are believed to be associated with a nonspecific system governing internal inhibition which manifests itself in inattention, drowsiness, and sleep."

https://openalex.org/W1521686209,"Abstract The passive binding of cations to submitochondrial fragments prepared by sonic oscillation of bovine heart mitochondria has been examined. At least two different types of binding sites can be distinguished. The first site appears to be phospholipid in nature and binds the following cations in the sequence indicated: La3+ g Ca2+ g Mg2+ g K+ and Na+. Each of these cations inhibits the binding of others in the series competitively, and in each case H+ is released into the suspending medium only when large amounts of the cation react with the membrane. Cations which interact primarily with this site or type of sites saturates the membrane at about 120 neq per mg of protein. In contrast, the binding of Zn2+ and certain other cations in the absence of energy occurs preferentially at protein binding sites and saturates the lipid sites only at high concentrations of cation. The binding of cations to this site is inhibited noncompetitively by cations in the series listed above and competitively by Zn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and chlorpromazine. In a like manner this group of cations inhibits the binding of cations to the lipid sites noncompetitively. Interaction of cations such as Zn2+ with the protein binding sites results in the release of substantial amounts of H+ into the medium. Binding to the lipid sites is inhibited noncompetitively by H+, but the binding of Zn2+ to the protein site is inhibited by a mechanism which is more complicated than either simple competitive or noncompetitive binding. The Zn2+-binding capacity of the membrane is saturated at about 250 neq of Zn2+ per mg of protein at pH 7.0. A number of lines of evidence also suggest that, in addition to the rather low affinity binding which is considered in this study, small numbers of binding sites with high affinity for cations are present in submitochondrial particles."
https://openalex.org/W1550768597,"Abstract The biosynthesis of DNA, histones, and other proteins has been studied in vivo in the rat mammary gland for the last 6 days of pregnancy and the first 6 days of lactation. In order to evaluate the incorporation of radioactive precursors, the pool of free amino acids in the gland was examined and was found to change both qualitatively and quantitatively as the gland developed. Furthermore, 15 min after the injection of lysine-14C the specific activity of lysine in the pool was observed to differ at different stages in pregnancy and lactation. The rate of incorporation of thymidine-3H into nuclear DNA showed a general downward trend during the period studied except for a very abrupt burst, consistent with a wave of cell division, on the 1st day of lactation. The rates of incorporation of lysine-14C followed qualitatively similar patterns for soluble and residual nuclear proteins and for histones. Like the synthesis of DNA, the synthesis of nuclear proteins reached a maximum rate on the 1st day postpartum and then declined. The rate of cytoplasmic protein synthesis remained high as lactation proceeded. Histones were separated chromatographically into lysine-rich, slightly lysine-rich, and arginine-rich classes; and the lysine-rich class was resolved further into its subfractions. The rates of synthesis for all of the histones followed similar patterns during late pregnancy and early lactation. However, at all times the lysine-rich and arginine-rich histones had higher rates of synthesis than the slightly lysine-rich histone. One of the subfractions within the lysine-rich class also had a higher rate of synthesis than the other subfractions."
https://openalex.org/W1495411364,"A product of the enzymatic oxidation of indole-3-acetic acid, 3-methyleneoxindole, is at least 10-fold more effective than indole-3-acetic acid as a plant auxin as estimated by stimulation of elongation of excised pea and mung bean stem segments and by the stimulation of protein synthesis in the subapical regions of decapitated pea seedlings. An obligatory role for 3-methyleneoxindole in such auxin-stimulated responses is suggested by the following additional observations. 1. Chlorogenic acid, which blocks the enzymatic oxidation of indole-3-acetic acid to 3-methyleneoxindole in peas, antagonizes the stimulatory effect of indole-3-acetic acid on elongation and protein synthesis but does not interfere with the same stimulatory effects of 3-methyleneoxindole, the product of the blocked reaction. 2. 3-Methyleneoxindole reacts directly with sulfhydryl compounds; as expected, its growth-promoting activity is blocked by reduced, but not by oxidized, glutathione. Reduced glutathione also blocks the action of indole-3-acetic acid, which does not react directly with sulfhydryl compounds. 3. A synthetic auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, cannot be oxidized to 3-methyleneoxindole; however, it has another relationship to 3-methyleneoxindole metabolism as an inhibitor of the enzymatic reduction of 3-methyleneoxindole to 3-methyloxindole, an inert substance. Small amounts of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, inactive alone, cause a considerable reduction in the amount of 3-methyleneoxindole required for optimal stimulation of growth. It is therefore suggested that 1-naphthaleneacetic acid might act by maintaining endogenous supplies of 3-methyleneoxindole at elevated intracellular levels through inhibition of 3-methyleneoxindole reductase. It is proposed that the stimulatory effects of 3-methyleneoxindole might result from its previously demonstrated ability to render a growth rate-limiting regulatory protein insensitive to its negative effector in a bacterial model system. The necessary specificity of action, both in terms of comparison to ordinary sulfhydryl reagents which do not have auxin activity and from the point of view of interaction with its cellular targets, may reside in its oxindolic structure and in the fact that it is a specific substrate for inactivating enzymes of plants, 3-methyleneoxindole reductases."
https://openalex.org/W1601405328,"1. A methyl viologen-linked sulfite reductase from spinach leaves was cleaved into two protein fractions. Both fractions were required for the oxidation of reduced methyl viologen with sulfite and the formation of sulfide under the assay conditions used. One fraction could be replaced by bovine serum albumin, by several other crystalline proteins, by thiol and disulfide compounds, or by yeast RNA. 2. The other fraction, sulfite reductase, has been purified 492-fold. The enzyme was homogeneous by ultracentrifugation but not by electrophoresis with polyacrylamide gel or cellulose acetate. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 84,000 from gel filtration. The enzyme contained 0.76 g atom of iron per 84,000 g of protein. Negligible amounts of flavin are observed, indicating that flavin is not directly involved in catalysis of sulfite reduction. 3. Sulfite reductase, in the oxidized form, has absorption maxima at 279, 404, and 589 mµ. The last two maxima were shifted and diminished upon reduction with sodium borohydride and partially restored by sulfite. Absorption at 404 and 589 mµ was modified by cysteine, cyanide, and carbon monoxide. 4. Prior incubation of the reduced enzyme with sulfite prevented inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzoate and carbon monoxide. The inhibition of sulfite reductase by carbon monoxide was reversed by light. Thus, the sulfite reductase has some of the properties of a hemoprotein. 5. After cleavage, sulfite reductase was inactivated by reduced methyl viologen unless albumin, cysteine, cystine, sulfite, or RNA were present. The possible role of these compounds in prevention of reductase inactivation by methyl viologen is discussed. 6. After cleavage, the enzyme ceased to catalyze the reduction of nitrite by methyl viologen and catalyzed only the reduction of sulfite and hydroxylamine. The ratio of these activities remained constant through the later purification steps, and it is concluded that hydroxylamine reduction, but not nitrite reduction, is catalyzed by sulfite reductase."

https://openalex.org/W1579303185,"Abstract Cell-free extracts of green Euglena gracilis catalyze the transfer of stearoyl and oleoyl groups from thioesters of Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein to monogalactosyl diglycerides. This reaction was stimulated by α-glycerophosphate. In the course of the transfer reaction, stearic acid was partly desaturated to unsaturated acids. Palmitoyl acyl carrier protein was poorly utilized in galactolipid synthesis. In the same system monogalactosyl diglycerides accepted acyl groups also from oleoyl-CoA. In none of the experiments did the digalactosyl diglycerides become labeled significantly. The fatty acyl carrier protein thioesters did not serve as substrate for phospholipid synthesis. Acyl groups from CoA thioesters were, however, transferred to the phospholipids. This reaction was not stimulated by added α-glycerophosphate and may not represent synthesis de novo. Waxlike lipids incorporated appreciable amounts of radioactivity from 1-14C-acyl-CoA derivatives."

The change due to insulin appears to be an alteration in the function of the ribosome.
https://openalex.org/W1555165103,"Abstract Ornithine aminotransferase concentrations are under the control of a sequence of antagonistic hormonal factors differing with age and different in liver and kidney. Developmental formation of ornithine aminotransferase normally occurs in rat liver 2 weeks after birth. A single injection of glucocorticoid as early as 4 days after birth prematurely raises the rate of formation to adult levels in 16 to 24 hours, whereas either estrogen administration or adrenalectomy inhibits the normal accumulation of the enzyme in the third postnatal week. Estrogen given 6 hours before glucocorticoids also prevents the rise in younger rats. The level in adult animals is not changed by glucocorticoids or adrenalectomy. In rat kidney, treatment with estrogen but not glucocorticoids elevates ornithine aminotransferase prematurely. The effect of estrogen is prevented by simultaneously administered triamcinolone."
https://openalex.org/W1530712175,"Abstract The interaction of deoxyhemoglobin with ATP, ADP, and AMP has been studied at pH 7.0, 25°, Γ/2 = 0.12 m. Under these conditions, ATP and ADP each form a 1:1 complex with the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer and they compete with 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, presumably for the same site on the protein. The order of binding affinities is 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid g ATP g ADP g AMP. The free energy of binding is approximately proportional to the net charge on the phosphate ligand, although other factors are also operative. Addition of ATP or ADP or AMP to oxyhemoglobin reversibly converts the protein to the deoxy form, thereby showing that these nucleotides bind to deoxyhemoglobin with an overwhelming preference. A discussion of these results is given."

Three different types of neurons are defined; the response of each type is remarkably similar to that of the corresponding stretch-receptors of the muscle. Accordingly, the cerebellum receives information on the mechanical situation in muscle from three qualitatively different channels: one has a high degree of sensitivity to dynamic stretch (Ia units) and provides a mixed signal of muscle length and speed of movement; another provides information mainly on muscle length (group-Il units); and the third signals information on the degree of contraction of the muscle (Ib units)."

Aminoacylation in vitro of the tRNA samples was carried out with a crude hybrid synthetase from normal and experimental rat livers. Of the 11 amino acids used in the experiments, lysine and phenylalanine revealed significant quantitative differences in the distribution of the iso-accepting forms from thyroidectomized as compared with normal rats. Treatment with a low level of thyroxine (0.5 µg per g) partially restored the original distribution pattern within 30 min."

https://openalex.org/W1561873897,"The kinetic distribution of hydrogen atoms back-exchanging from tritium-labeled proteins has been estimated from the results of interrupted flow and slow, continuous-flow gel filtration. Staphylococcal nuclease exchanges almost all of it bound tritium atoms in a few hours at pH 8.1, but in the presence of calcium ions and deoxythymidine 3′,5′-diphosphate about 34 hydrogen atoms remain associated with the protein for periods longer than 8 hours. The effect of temperature on the binding of tritium, in the presence and in the absence of these ligands, has been studied. Sperm whale myoglobin shows an analogous trapping of tritium atoms upon the addition of hematin to apomyoglobin. The hematin causes the retention of about 25 hydrogen atoms for periods longer than 20 hours at pH 7.0; protoporphyrin IX traps fewer hydrogen atoms. These results indicate that the addition of the ligands to these two proteins causes the exclusion of solvent water from otherwise exchangeable protein hydrogen atoms. The mechanism of this effect probably involves some combination of direct shielding of the protein from the solvent by the ligand, and changes in conformation and motility."

https://openalex.org/W1542218170,"Abstract The incorporation of d-glucose-14C from guanosine diphosphate d-glucose-14C into a β-1,4-linked polymer (cellulose) is catalyzed by a particulate preparation from Phaseolus aureus and Lupinus albus. The particulate enzyme preparations from both plants can be solubilized by extraction with digitonin; the solubilized proteins are also active in synthesizing β-(1 → 4)-glucan as the original particulate preparations. The reaction reaches half the maximal incorporation in less than 1 min. Upon degradation of the polymer, β-(1 → 4)-radioactive cellodextrins are formed. However, a small proportion of mannose-14C is also obtained, indicating the presence of an epimerase which interconverts d-glucose and d-mannose. A glycolipid, is, apparently, not involved as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the β-(1 → 4)-glucan from GDP-d-glucose."

At physiological pH this compound is dehydrated to 3-methyleneoxindole, a highly reactive sulfhydryl reagent and inhibitor of cell growth. 3-Methlyeneoxindole is in turn detoxified by an enzymatic, triphosphopyridine nucleotide-linked reduction to 3-methyloxindole, a nontoxic compound. These enzymatic conversions may be responsible for some of the responses to auxin, particularly sensitivity to its inhibitory effects on growth."
https://openalex.org/W1529053252,"Abstract The circular dichroism spectra of oxidized and reduced cytochrome b2, the l(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.2.3) of bakers' yeast, are observed in the wave length range 188 to 600 mµ. The spectrum at short wave lengths, which is unaffected by change in the oxidation state of the enzyme, is similar in character to that observed with α-helical polypeptides, the amplitudes of the extrema indicating an apparent helical content of roughly 25%. Between 250 and 600 mµ numerous dichroic bands are observed. Type I (DNA-containing) enzyme has a large positive band at 282 mµ because of the DNA component, and Type II (DNA-free) enzyme has a prominent negative band at 270 mµ which appears to result from an interaction of the flavin prosthetic group with 1 or more aromatic residues since it is entirely missing from FMN-free apoenzyme. Neither of these bands is much affected by the oxidation state of the enzyme. All the bands above 300 mµ are strongly dependent on the oxidation state of the enzyme, but are affected very little by removal of the DNA. These bands can be ascribed to transitions in the flavin and heme prosthetic groups, and many of them appear to be strongly affected by the flavin-heme interaction which also appears to be essential for enzymic activity. Numerical integration over the circular dichroism spectrum according to the Kronig-Kramers equation gives a calculated optical rotatory dispersion spectrum which reproduces all the features of the observed spectrum but falls below it in amplitude. A Lowry plot of the difference between the observed and calculated spectra suggests that a dichroic band or bands centered at 150 mµ, the result of peptide units in α-helical conformation, contributes significantly to the dispersion over the entire wave length range studied. The effects of urea and changes of pH on the circular dichroism and activity of the enzyme have been studied. A remarkable parallelism between the amplitude of the dichroic band in the region of the heme Soret band and the activity of the enzyme is observed. At a urea concentration of approximately 3 m (neutral pH) and a pH of 9.5 (no urea present), the dichroic spectrum of the enzyme is similar to that observed for the FMN-free apoenzyme and the enzyme is inactive. These observations give further support to the view that interaction of some sort between the FMN and heme groups is responsible for both the character of the circular dichroism spectrum and the catalytic activity. The circular dichroism of a heme peptide, with a molecular weight of about 12,000, obtained by tryptic digestion of cytochrome b2, is found to be similar to that observed for the FMN-free apoenzyme in the wave length region below 250 mµ and in the region of the Soret band. It is interesting that the apparent α-helical content is roughly the same as for the native enzyme. The cytochrome b2 obtained from the yeast Hansenula anomala, which has an activity approximately 6 times that of the enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is found to have circular dichroism spectra similar to those observed with the Type II enzyme below 300 mµ, but differing markedly at higher wave lengths, especially in the Soret region. The difference dichroic spectra of Hansenula enzyme minus Saccharomyces enzyme consist largely of a symmetrical positive band at 423 mµ for the reduced enzymes and one at 413 mµ for the oxidized enzymes. It appears that these bands do not involve the FMN-heme interaction responsible for enzyme activity."

https://openalex.org/W1491701026,"Abstract A hitherto unknown β1-glycoprotein was isolated from a subfraction of Cohn Fraction VI of pooled normal human plasma. For the isolation and purification of this very soluble globulin, precipitation with zinc ions at pH 5.8 in the presence of ethanol, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose at pH 5.0, and gel filtration through Sephadex G-100 were employed. The resulting preparation appeared monodisperse on ultracentrifugation and paper, starch gel, and disc electrophoresis at pH 8.6. The major physichemical and chemical properties of this β1-glycoprotein were determined. The molecular weight was 31,000. The isoelectric and isoionic points of this globulin were found to be at pH 4.4 and 4.9, respectively. The conformations which this protein assumed in pH 5.8 sodium acetate buffer, 50% aqueous 2-chloroethanol, and 7 m urea are completely reversible as judged by optical rotatory dispersion measurements. This β1-glycoprotein contains 30% carbohydrate, consisting of galactose, mannose, fucose, and glucosamine. Most striking is the lack of sialic acid. Its carboxyl-terminal amino acid proved to be asparagine, while the amino-terminal amino acid did not react with Sanger's reagent. Although monodisperse by a series of criteria, this plasma protein resolves into three components on starch gel electrophoresis near its isoelectric point, an observation that was interpreted as being indicative of variants. The apparent content of this glycoprotein in pooled plasma is approximately 2 mg per liter."
https://openalex.org/W1614727589,"Abstract Synthetic d-galacto- and d-glucomuramic acids were prepared from the condensation of l-α-chloropropionic acid with benzyl-2-acetamido-4,6-O-benzylidene-2-deoxy-α-d-galacto- or glucopyranoside. The configuration of the d(-) lactate moiety (i.e. 3-O-(d-1-carboxyethyl)-) obtained by alkaline β elimination, was proven by use of specific d(-)- and l(+)-lactic acid dehydrogenases. Standard methods commonly used for the detection of muramic acid were found to be unsuitable for distinction between the two products. Thus, although the Barker and Summerson, Morgan-Elson, Park-Johnson, and Rondle-Morgan tests were shown to detect both gluco and galacto epimers of muramic acid (color yields differed slightly), such colorimetric assays could not differentiate between the analogues. Ionophoresis did not distinguish the forms of muramic acid, and thin layer chromatography was found to be suitable for distinction only under carefully controlled conditions. Cation exchange chromatography, according to Gardell, was used successfully in the separation of the glucomuramic and galactomuramic acids, but it was found that glucosamine co-elutes with galactomuramic acid. The most rapid and precise detection method was that in which a commercial amino acid analyzer was used. Detection of nanomole quantities of material was possible. The muramic acid content of 16 bacterial species was determined. Only the glucomuramic acid analogue was found."
https://openalex.org/W2032614849,"When Osborne-Mendel female rats (white) were mated with both an Osborne-Mendel and an NIH Black rat male during the same breeding period, litters were born which contained both Osborne-Mendel (white) and crossbred (grey to black) offspring. The Osborne-Mendel and crossbred animals developed widely different levels of caries activity even though they were exposed to identical environmental conditions during the intrauterine, preweaning, and experimental periods. These findings are indicative of a strong heritable influence on the development of dental caries."
https://openalex.org/W2040658688,"Two acid phosphatases were demonstrable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They had different mobilities and different heat stabilities in 1.0M acetate buffer, pH 5.2. Both phosphatases had the same electrophoretic mobility in tris buffer at pH 7.5, gave one boundary in the analytical ultracentrifuge in tris or acetate buffer, and had the same sedimentation coefficient. The difference in these properties suggests an alteration in conformation of the proteins by the buffer systems."
https://openalex.org/W2121949431,"The presence of hemolysin in staphylococcal lesions of the rabbit kidney was detected by overlaying sections of kidney with blood agar. Hemolytic activity against rabbit, human, sheep, calf, and guinea pig erythrocytes was present and was not abolished by heating the sections to 60 degrees C for 30 minutes. In developing lesions, hemolytic activity appeared before necrosis or exudation."

https://openalex.org/W1970028015,Adipose tissue in the adult white rat changes in both quantity and histologic characteristics during a 5-week period of acclimatization to a simulated altitude of 4350 meters at 26°C. These findings are descriptive and do not at present permit conclusions as to the mechanisms involved.
