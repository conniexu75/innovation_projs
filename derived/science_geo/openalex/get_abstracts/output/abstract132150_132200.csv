The signal transduction proteins MEKK1, p21-activated kinase 2, and focal adhesion kinase are caspase substrates that contribute to the cell death response when cleaved. Thirty additional signaling proteins were screened for their ability to be cleaved during apoptosis. Twenty-two of these proteins were not affected in Jurkat cells stimulated to undergo apoptosis by Fas ligation, exposure to ultraviolet-C or incubation with etoposide. Ras GTPase-activating protein was found to be a caspase substrate whose cleavage followed the same time course as that for activation of caspase activity and the cleavage of MEKK1 and focal adhesion kinase. Four additional proteins, Cbl, Cbl-b, Raf-1, and Akt-1, were cleaved later in the apoptotic response. These signaling proteins were similarly cleaved in U937 cells undergoing apoptosis. Cleavage of the proteins was blocked by caspase inhibitors in Jurkat cells or in U937 cells expressing BclxL, demonstrating that the cleavage was dependent on caspase activation. Cleavage of Raf-1 and Akt correlated with the loss of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt activities in apoptotic cells. Neither c-Jun N-terminal kinase nor p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was cleaved in cells undergoing apoptosis, and the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways was not compromised in apoptotic cells. These results indicate that caspase-dependent cleavage of specific proteins induces the turn off of survival pathways, such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathways, that could otherwise interfere with the apoptotic response.

Apoptosis is regulated by a series of biochemical events that commit a cell to death. A common feature of cells undergoing apoptosis is the activation of caspases, a family of aspartic acid-directed proteases (1Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G.S. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). Caspase substrates are rapidly being identified, but the general assumption is that caspases recognize a limited set of cellular proteins (2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Caspase-mediated proteolysis of specific proteins results in an irreversible commitment of cells to undergo apoptosis characterized by cytoplasmic shrinkage, membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation. Caspase-dependent cleavage can inactivate protein substrates. Examples include poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, lamin, and focal adhesion kinase. Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase abolishes its DNA repair ability in cells undergoing apoptosis, nuclear lamin degradation contributes to nuclear condensation, and cleavage of focal adhesion kinase impairs the ability of cells to maintain matrix adherence (2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). In contrast, there are examples, besides the caspases themselves (3Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar), where cleavage actually activates the substrate; examples of such substrates include MEKK1, 1The abbreviations used are: MEKK, MEK kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HOG, high osmolarity glycerol response; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, RasGAP, Ras GTPase activating protein; SEK, stress-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; UV-C, ultraviolet-C. p21-activated kinase, protein kinase Cδ, and gelsolin. When cleaved, each of these proteins contributes to the apoptotic response (4Widmann C. Gerwins P. Lassignal Johnson N. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell.

Signal transduction pathways involving the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including the ERKs, JNKs, and p38/HOG1 kinase, have been shown to differentially contribute to pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways (10Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujuri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.G. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-regulated protein kinase Akt has been shown to have significant anti-apoptotic signaling properties (11Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). This is, at least in part, mediated by the ability of Akt to phosphorylate and inactivate BAD, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl family (12Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 13del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G.

In this study, we have surveyed a large set of proteins that are involved in pathways regulating cell growth, cell survival, or cell death, including members of the MAPK network. Among 30 signaling proteins tested, we have identified five new protease substrates, RasGAP, Raf1, Akt-1, Cbl, and Cbl-b, that were found to be cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner during the apoptotic response induced by Fas activation, ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation, and etoposide. Cleavage of Raf-1 and Akt-1 inhibited their kinase activity. This could explain why the anti-apoptotic ERK and Akt pathways are inhibited during the progression of apoptosis. Jurkat and U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.; catalog number 31800-022), supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bio-Products) and containing 10% fetal calf serum (Summit Biotechnology) (RPMI-c). Jurkat cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-Fas IgM antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; catalog number 05-201) in phosphate-buffered saline for 20–30 min on ice. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in RPMI-c, and incubated for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C, 5% CO2. When caspase inhibitors were used, they were incubated with Jurkat cells both during the incubation with anti-Fas antibodies and during the incubation at 37 °C. The cells were solubilized in TX-100 lysis buffer (70 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmEGTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. c-Jun kinase (JNK) activity was measured using a solid phase kinase assay in which glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1–79) (GST-Jun) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was used to affinity-purify JNK from cell lysates as described (14Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 15Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Develop. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the phosphorylation of GST-Jun was performed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). ERK2 was incubated with 2 μg/ml of an anti-ERK2 (C-14) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation, followed by the addition of 15 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma; catalog number P-3391) and a further 20-min incubation at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer without Triton X-100. Thirty-five μl of the last wash was left in the tube and mixed with 20 μl of ERK reaction mix (50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 μmNa3VO4, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, 400 μm epidermal growth factor receptor peptide 662–681, 100 μg/μl IP-20, 2 mm EGTA), incubated for 20 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid and spotted on P81 Whatman paper. The samples were washed three times for 5 min each in 75 mm phosphoric acid and once for 2 min in acetone and air-dried, and their radioactivity was determined in a β-counter. Four hundred μg of cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg/ml of an anti-Akt1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; catalog number sc-1618) as described for the ERK assay. The beads were then washed twice in 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice in 1 ml of Akt wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml IP-20). Thirty-five μl of the last wash was left in the tube and mixed with 25 μl of Akt reaction mix (Akt wash buffer, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mg/ml cross-tide peptide (GRPRTSSFAEG), 0.2 μCi/μl [γ32P]ATP) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and spotted on P81 Whatman paper as described for the ERK assay. p38 activity was measured exactly as described by Gerwins et al. (16Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). 200–400 μg of cell lysate protein was subjected to SDS-7–10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were performed exactly as described (17Widmann C. Dolci W. Thorens B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmEGTA. Sixty μg of lysate proteins were incubated with 5 μm DEVD-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem) in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmEGTA for 20 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was then monitored with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Fluorescence of the substrate alone was subtracted in each case. Cells (1–2 × 106) were resuspended in 100 μl of incubation buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma; P-4170) and a 1:50 dilution of Annexin-V-Flos solution (Boehringer Mannheim; catalog number 1828681) and incubated 15 min on ice. Four hundred μl of incubation buffer was then added, and the cells were sorted on a flow cytometer using 488-nm excitation and a 515-nm bandpass filter for fluorescence detection and a filter >560 nm for propidium iodide detection. Apoptotic cells were defined as green fluorescent positive and propidium iodide negative. Akt1.dn3 corresponds to the mouse Akt-1 cDNA (nucleotides 254–1729) subcloned into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (InVitrogen). h_Cbl.dn3 corresponds to the human Cbl cDNA (nucleotides 10–2892) subcloned into pcDNA3. JNK1.rst corresponds to the human JNK1α1 cDNA in pRSET (InVitrogen). MEK1.rst corresponds to the mouse MEK1 cDNA (nucleotides 38–1254) in pRSETb. Raf1.rst corresponds to the human Raf1 cDNA (nucleotides 133–2977) in pRSETa. h_RasGAP.dn3 corresponds to the human RasGAP cDNA (clone 101) (nucleotides 1–3987) in pcDNA3. SEK1.rst corresponds to the mouse SEK1 cDNA (nucleotides 16–2292) in pRSETb, and MEKK1.dn3 corresponds to the mouse MEKK1 cDNA in pcDNA3. Proteins were in vitrotranslated using the TNT® T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's conditions. The plasmids used were Akt1.dn3, h_Cbl.dn3, JNK1.rst, MEK1.rst, Raf1.rst, h_RasGAP.dn3, SEK1.rst, and MEKK1.dn3. The cleavage assay of the in vitrotranslated proteins was performed in the buffer used to measure DEVD-directed caspase activity (see above). The fate of specific cellular proteins involved in the regulation of signal transduction during the apoptotic response was analyzed. Jurkat cells were treated with etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor; UV-C (254-nm) irradiation, which generates oxygen radicals and induces RNA/DNA damage; or anti-Fas antibodies that activate Fas. The apoptotic response was temporally defined for each stimulus by measuring annexin V positive cells and the activation of DEVD-directed caspases (Fig.1). Both annexin V binding and caspase activation are well defined markers of apoptosis (18Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, Jurkat cells undergoing cell death showed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including cytoplasmic shrinkage and nuclear condensation (data not shown). Fas ligation induced a rapid apoptosis as assessed by the appearance of annexin V binding at the cell surface after 15 min that reached a maximum after 1 h. UV-C (100 J/m2) irradiation and incubation with etoposide (30 μm) induced a slower cell death response that reached a maximum for both stimuli at approximately 8 h. The kinetics of DEVD-caspase activation paralleled the induction of annexin V binding to the cells. Immunoblot analysis was performed against lysates from cells treated with etoposide, UV-C, or Fas antibody for different times with antibodies directed against 35 proteins having functions involved in different signaling pathways (Fig. 2 and Table I). Of these proteins, the expression of 22 was not significantly altered during apoptosis. These included ERK1, ERK2, and the p85 and p110 subunits of PI3K that have been implicated in survival responses in different cell types (11Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar) as well as components of the pro-apoptotic p38 and JNK MAPK pathways (JNK-1, SEK-1, p38 MAPK). Four proteins, phospholipase C-γ1, Src, 14-3-3β, and 14-3-3ε were partially cleaved during the apoptotic response. Proteolysis of these proteins occurred somewhat late in the apoptotic response. The fragments were clearly visible by immunoblotting, but the cleavage was incomplete and did not appear to significantly affect the amount of the full-length proteins.Table IAntibodies used in this studyAntigenAntibody (dilution/concentration)Company or referenceCatalog numberHuman 14–3-3βRabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SC1-aSC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology.sc-629Sheep 14–3-3εRabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-1020c-AblRabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-131ActinMouse IgG2A(1:500)SigmaA4700Rat adenylyl cyclase VRabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-1701Human Akt-1Goat IgG (2 μg/ml)SCsc-1618Human Bcl-2Mouse IgG1 (1 μg/ml)UBI1-bUBI, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.05–341CblRabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-170Cbl/Cbl-bRabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-1705Cdc2Mouse IgG2A (35 ng/ml)SCsc-54CPP32Rabbit serum (1:1000)Pharmingen65906EE1BMouse IgG (1 μg/ml)CalbiochemOP65Rat ERK1/ERK2Rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-93Human focal adhesion kinaseRabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-558Grb2Rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-422Human GRK21-cG protein-coupled receptor kinase 2.Rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-562ICH1LRabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-625Human JNK-1Rabbit IgG (0.7 μg/ml)SCsc-571Human MEK-1Rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-219Human MEK-2Rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-525Mouse MEKK1Rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-252Mouse MEKK2Rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-1089Human MAPK phosphatase-1Rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml)SCsc-1199Human c-MycMouse IgG1 (1 μg/ml)SCsc-40Mouse p38Rabbit serum (1/100)Ref.16Gerwins P.

Open table in a new tab Nine proteins showed essentially complete proteolysis during the apoptotic response. These proteins could be categorized into two groups based on their rate of cleavage following an apoptotic response. The first group is characterized by rapid cleavage after an apoptotic stimulus (extensive cleavage in 1 h of Fas stimulation). The prototypes of rapidly cleaved proteins are the caspases themselves, which are synthesized as inactive zymogens and are cleaved during their activation (3Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). The kinetics of ICH1L (caspase-2) and CPP32 (caspase-3) cleavage are shown in Fig. 2. Of the proteins assayed, three major signal transduction proteins were cleaved as fast as ICH1L and CPP32 (Fig. 2). These included the previously characterized caspase substrates MEKK1 and focal adhesion kinase (5Widmann C. Lassignal Johnson N. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Cardone M. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar,20Wen L.-P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.-L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26056-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that the 120-kDa RasGAP protein was also rapidly cleaved with a similar time course as that for caspase activation. The second group of signaling proteins were cleaved with slower kinetics in Fas-stimulated cells (extensive cleavage detected only after 2 h of Fas stimulation). These were the adapter proteins Cbl and Cbl-b and the serine-threonine kinases Raf-1 and Akt-1. Etoposide and UV-C, which are slow stimulators of apoptosis compared with anti-Fas antibodies (Fig. 1), induced the cleavage of the proteins of both groups between 8 and 16 h and between 4 and 8 h of treatment, respectively (Fig. 2). Because of their involvement in the PI3K/Akt and the ERK MAPK pathways, shown to have survival functions in different cell types (11Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 14Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar), Cbl and Cbl-b (which can bind PI3K), Raf-1 (the upstream regulator of the ERKs), and Akt-1 each have potential anti-apoptotic functions. The cleavage of RasGAP, Raf-1, Cbl/Cbl-b, and Akt-1 in response to apoptotic stimuli has not been described previously. To demonstrate the generality of these signaling proteins as substrates for proteolysis during apoptosis, their cleavage in U937 cells exposed to UV-C was examined (Fig. 3). RasGAP is cleaved with a similar time course as that for CPP32. Cbl/Cbl-b, Raf-1, and Akt-1 were also cleaved but with slower kinetics. As controls, the dual specificity phosphatase, MAPK phosphatase-1, and the p110 subunit of PI3K were not degraded during the U937 cell apoptotic response. The cleavage of proteins during the apoptotic response is highly restricted and is not a general degradation of cellular proteins. Using mild (0.5% TX-100-containing buffer) to strong (2% SDS-containing buffer) extraction procedures, no difference in Coomassie-stained protein profiles is observed between lysates from control and apoptotic Jurkat cells (Fig. 4 A). However, selective cleavage of proteins did occur as shown in the immunoblots in Fig. 4 B (RasGAP is cleaved, while CD45 or phospholipase C-γ1 are unaffected). To define whether the cleavage of RasGAP, Cbl/Cbl-b, Raf-1, and Akt-1 resulted from caspase activation, Jurkat cells were incubated with or without cell-permeable caspase inhibitors during Fas ligation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5 A). The caspase inhibitor effectively blocked the cleavage of each of the proteins tested, including MEKK1, a defined caspase substrate (4Widmann C. Gerwins P. Lassignal Johnson N. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cardone M. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Similarly, U937 cells overexpressing BclxL, which has anti-apoptotic functions and is involved in the regulation of caspase activation (21Rao L. White E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,22Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar), also blocked cleavage of RasGAP, Akt-1, Cbl, Raf-1, and CPP32 in response to UV-C irradiation (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the activation of caspases is required for the cleavage and degradation of these proteins in both Jurkat and U937 cells. Lysates from Fas-activated Jurkat cells have proven to be a good system for the assay of DEVD-directed caspases (4Widmann C. Gerwins P. Lassignal Johnson N. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 18Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, lysates were prepared from control and Fas-ligated T cells to which [35S]methionine labeled in vitro translation products for MEKK1, RasGAP, Akt-1, Cbl, Raf-1, and three control proteins shown not to be degraded during apoptosis, SEK1, MEK1, and JNK1. Only MEKK1 and RasGAP were shown to be proteolyzed when added to the lysate from Fas-activated cells (Fig. 6). Purified CPP32 generated the same RasGAP fragments as those generated by lysates from apoptotic Jurkat cells (data not shown). This defines RasGAP as a DEVD-directed caspase substrate, as is MEKK1. Cbl, Akt-1, and Raf-1 were not proteolyzed in lysates from Fas-activated Jurkat cells, indicating that they are not cleaved by the caspases proteolyzing RasGAP and MEKK1 in the in vitro conditions used here. Their cleavage is, however, dependent on the activation of caspases as demonstrated in Fig. 5. To assess the significance of protein cleavage on signaling pathways, we measured the activity of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways in Fas-stimulated Jurkat cells (Fig.7 A). The ERK pathway was transiently stimulated by anti-Fas antibodies as reported previously (23Goillot E. Raingeaud J. Ranger A. Tepper R.I. Davis R.J. Harlow E. Sanchez I. Proc. Natn. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3302-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), reaching a maximum 1 h following Fas stimulation and returning to basal levels 2 h following Fas stimulation. A similar pattern of activation was detected for Raf-1 (Fig. 7 A). Among the components of the ERK MAPK pathway, only Raf-1 was cleaved in response to Fas stimulation. Neither B-Raf, MEK1, MEK2, ERK1, nor ERK2 was cleaved in apoptotic cells (Fig. 2). The decline in the activity of Raf-1 and the ERK MAPK pathway correlated with the cleavage of Raf-1 in response to Fas stimulation. To determine whether the reduced activity of the ERK proteins in Fas-stimulated cells resulted from a general down-regulation mechanism, Jurkat cells were stimulated with anti-CD28 antibodies for 5 min after different periods of time following Fas stimulation. Fig. 7 B shows that the ERK pathway could be stimulated by CD28 cross-linking (24August A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1995; 46: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ERK pathway could still be stimulated over the Fas-induced response by the anti-CD28 antibody 1 h after Fas cross-linking. However, at later time points, when the Fas-induced ERK response started to decline, the anti-CD28 antibody had no stimulatory effect on the ERK pathway (Fig. 7, compare A and B). There is thus a general impairment of the ERK pathway in Fas-stimulated Jurkat cells. These results suggest that the cleavage of Raf-1 contributes to the shut-off of the ERK MAPK pathway in apoptotic Jurkat cells. Another potential survival pathway, the PI3K-Akt pathway, appears also to be compromised in apoptotic cells, as assessed by decreased activity of the Akt-1 protein in Fas-stimulated Jurkat cells (Fig.7 A). The decline of the Akt-1 activity follows a similar time course to its degradation after Fas ligation (compare Figs. 2 and7 A). The PI3K subunits were not cleaved in apoptotic cells (Fig. 2). This suggests that the PI3K-Akt pathway is down-regulated as a consequence of Akt1 cleavage. In contrast, the activities of the p38 and the JNK MAPK pathways remain high even 2 h following Fas ligation (Fig. 7 A). Among the components of these pathways that we tested for cleavage in apoptotic cells (MEKK1, MEKK2, SEK-1, JNK-1, p38 MAPK), only MEKK1 was cleaved (Fig. 2). However, this cleavage event does not destroy the kinase activity of the protein but rather leads to an amplification of the apoptotic response (4Widmann C. Gerwins P. Lassignal Johnson N. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cardone M. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Thus, no cleavage event could be determined to negatively affect the activation of the JNK and the p38 MAPK pathways in Fas-stimulated cells. These results demonstrate a selectivity in the turn-off of the ERK and Akt pathways in response to an apoptotic stimulus. Both JNK and p38 have been proposed to have pro-apoptotic functions in different cell types (10Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujuri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.G. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and their sustained activation when ERK and Akt activities have been lost could contribute to the apoptotic signaling in response to Fas ligation. The commitment of a cell to mitosis, differentiation, or apoptosis requires the integration of numerous inputs involving multiple signal transduction pathways. For each of these responses, check points during the progression to the final phenotype ensure the proper outcome (10Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujuri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.G. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the orchestration of signal transduction pathways controls the response of a cell to extracellular inputs. Relative to apoptosis, different signaling pathways can contribute to enhancing the death response or inhibit apoptosis and contribute to cell survival (10Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujuri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.G. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 11Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). A common end point in the commitment to apoptosis is the activation of caspases. Inhibition of caspases generally inhibits apoptosis. However, numerous caspases have been identified, and no one caspase has been shown to be required for apoptosis in all tissues. The prediction is that different caspases differentially contribute to the apoptotic program in different cell types. For example, the targeted deletion of CPP32 (caspase-3) causes loss of apoptosis in the developing brain of mice, but thymic selection appears normal (25Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C.-y. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), suggesting that CPP32 is necessary for normal brain development but not T cell selection. Caspase-dependent cleavage can inactivate proteins involved in repair mechanisms or the cell cycle (such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, Rb, protein kinase Cδ), lead to the degradation of structural proteins (such as lamins and actins), or activate proteins to become proapoptotic (such as p21-activated kinase, MEKK1, gelsolin, and the caspases themselves) (2Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar,4Widmann C. Gerwins P. Lassignal Johnson N. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cardone M. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. Frisch S.M.

Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Because of the role of various intracellular pathways in the control of the apoptotic response (10Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujuri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.G. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether signaling proteins could be cleaved in apoptotic cells. We have found that among 30 proteins with signaling functions, only a limited set is cleaved in apoptotic Jurkat T cell lymphomas and U937 myeloid cells. Our findings show that component members of signaling pathways involved in cell growth and survival can be cleaved in cells undergoing cell death. We demonstrate, for the first time, that RasGAP, Cbl/Cbl-b, Akt-1, and Raf-1 are degraded during apoptosis. The loss of these proteins during apoptosis is consistent with a hypothesis that the caspases turn off survival signals in addition to activating death signals. For example, Akt-1 and the ERK pathway activated by Raf-1 have clearly been shown to promote survival in different cell types (11Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 14Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that the ERK and Akt activities are inhibited during apoptosis. The role of Cbl/Cbl-b degradation is less clear. Cbl has been shown to function as an adapter protein and to bind PI3K (26Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartley D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Thus, Cbl can presumably lead to the activation of Akt-1, a kinase mediating survival responses in several cell types (11Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). The role of RasGAP cleavage is also not immediately obvious. However, Ras, even though it can regulate Raf-1 and lead to ERK activation, has been shown to enhance apoptotic responses (10Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujuri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.G. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mayo M.W. Wang C.-Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Also, targeted disruption of RasGAP has been shown to result in enhanced apoptosis in the brains of developing mouse embryos (28Henkemeyer M. Rossi D.J. Holmyard D.P. Puri M.C. Mbamalu G. Harpal K. Shih T.S. Jacks T. Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 377: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that loss of RasGAP contributes positively to apoptosis. Of the five proteins, RasGAP, Cbl/Cbl-b, Raf-1, and Akt-1, that we newly describe as being degraded during apoptosis, only RasGAP was cleaved in vitro using Jurkat cell lysates that contain high DEVD-directed caspase activity. In the RasGAP primary amino acid sequence, there is the sequence 452DTVD455G that would be efficiently recognized by DEVD-directed caspases. Cleavage at this site would generate a N-terminal fragment that is almost identical to a RasGAP construct that has been shown to alter cytoskeletal structure and cell adhesion (29McGlade J. Brunkhorst B. Anderson D. Mbamalu G. Settleman J. Dedhar S. Rozakis-Adcock M. Chen L.B. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3073-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, the caspase-dependent cleavage of RasGAP may generate a fragment that contributes to cell detachment, a feature often associated with cell death. Cell detachment is physiologically important because it facilitates removal of apoptotic cells by macrophages (30Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The sequence in MEKK1 recognized by caspase-3-like proteases is identical (4Widmann C. Gerwins P. Lassignal Johnson N. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cardone M. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Both MEKK1 and RasGAP are cleaved with kinetics similar to CPP32 (caspase-3) cleavage and activation, indicating that they are primary substrates for caspases. We are currently determining whether the RasGAP aspartic acid at residue 455 is indeed the caspase cleavage site and if RasGAP cleavage contributes to apoptosis. 2C. Widmann, manuscript in preparation. The fact that Cbl/Cbl-b, Akt-1, and Raf-1 were not cleaved in the in vitro assay using Jurkat lysates indicates that they are not DEVD-directed caspase substrates. They could be substrates either for other caspases or for non-caspase proteases that are not readily assayed in lysates from Fas-stimulated Jurkat cells. We are currently addressing this question biochemically, but in both Jurkat and U937 cells caspase activation is required for Cbl/Cbl-b, Akt-1, and Raf-1 degradation during apoptosis. In summary, we have identified five additional proteins that are degraded during apoptosis. One of these proteins, RasGAP, is a newly identified DEVD-directed caspase substrate. Cleavage of Raf-1 and Akt-1 inhibits their kinase activity, which may explain why the potential survival signals involving ERK and Akt activity are turned off. Components of the JNK and the p38 MAPK pathways, known to have pro-apoptotic functions in Jurkat cells (31Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

This suggests that caspases function in part to inhibit potential survival signals, allowing the death signals to predominate. The results are consistent with different sets of proteins being cleaved at various stages of the apoptotic response using different proteases in a temporally ordered manner to commit cells to death.

The <i>SLC</i> gene and the gene encoding another lymphocyte-specific CC chemokine, EBI1-ligand chemokine (ELC), form a mini-cluster at human chromosome 9p13. Here, we show that SLC is a high affinity functional ligand for chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) that is expressed on T and B lymphocytes and a known receptor for ELC. SLC induced a vigorous calcium mobilization in murine L1.2 cells stably expressing human CCR7. SLC tagged with the secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SLC-SEAP) showed specific binding to CCR7 that was fully competed by SLC with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.5 nm. SLC also induced a vigorous chemotactic response in CCR7-expressing L1.2 cells with a typical bell-shaped dose-response curve and a maximal migration at 10 nm. When assessed using CCR7-transfected L1.2 cells, SLC and ELC were essentially equivalent in terms of cross desensitization in calcium mobilization via CCR7, cross-competition in binding to CCR7, and induction of chemotaxis via CCR7. SLC and ELC were also shown to fully share receptors expressed on cultured normal T cells known to express CCR7. Notably, however, SLC was somehow less efficient in cross-desensitization against ELC in calcium mobilization and in cross-competition with ELC for binding when assessed using cultured normal T cells. Thus, SLC and ELC, even though sharing only 32% amino acid identity, constitute a genetically and functionally highly related subgroup of CC chemokines."

Although mitochondrial Ca2+ levels depend on Na+-dependent exchangers and the inner membrane Na+ and H+ gradients, the transporters have not been identified at the molecular level. Functional studies suggest there are at least two distinct types of monovalent cation/proton exchangers in mammalian mitochondria. One of these preferentially mediates the exchange of matrix Na+for intermembrane H+ generated by respiration (i.e. a Na+-selective Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) 1The abbreviations used are: NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino} ethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino} ethanesulfonic acid.)

This mechanism also transports Li+ (and possibly NH4+) at a much lower rate and is inhibited by benzamil derivatives of amiloride (14Nath S. Garlid K.D. Lemasters J.J. Hackenbrock C.R. Thurman R.G.

The other monovalent cation/H+exchanger is latent, transports all alkali cations (i.e.Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) at similar rates, and is antagonized by quinine, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and propranolol (19Garlid K.D.

In isolated mitochondria, it is active only upon depletion of matrix Mg2+ and simultaneous elevation of matrix pH or upon hypotonic swelling (19Garlid K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It is postulated to play a role in organellar volume homeostasis (23DiResta D.J. Kutschke K.P. Hottois M.D. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: R787-R793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria from Saccharomyces cerevisiae possess a similar nonselective K+/H+ exchanger, although the yeast transporter can be activated without depletion of matrix Mg2+ (24Manon S. Guérin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1108: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, functional studies of yeast mitochondria have not revealed any Na+-selective NHE activity (25Welihinda A.A. Trumbly R.J. Garlid K.D. Beavis A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in mitochondria, mammalian NHEs participate in a wide array of other essential cellular processes, including control of intracellular pH (pH i), maintenance of cellular volume, and reabsorption of Na+ across renal, intestinal, and other epithelia (26Mahnensmith R.L.

Mason M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) and is associated with events leading to apoptosis (28Rajotte D. Haddad P. Haman A. Cragoe Jr., E.J.

To date, five NHE isoforms (NHE1 to NHE5) have been identified that exhibit considerable differences in their primary structures (34–60% identity), tissue distribution, membrane localization, biochemical and pharmacological properties, and responsiveness to various stimuli (31Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouysségur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar,32Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). While characterization of some of these isoforms is incomplete, the existing data do not support a direct role for any of them in mitochondrial function. To identify mitochondrial type NHEs, we have focused our attention on S. cerevisiae because the sequence of the entire genome is known and because of the ease with which this organism can be manipulated genetically and analyzed functionally. In addition, yeast are facultative aerobes that can proliferate in the absence of aerobic respiration, which permits in vivo studies of mutations that disrupt mitochondrial function. To date, a S. cerevisiaegene (NHA1) conferring tolerance to increasing concentrations of external NaCl has been isolated (33Prior C. Potier S. Souciet J.L. Sychrova H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and its protein product was found to be homologous (40% amino acid identity) to the cell surface Na+/H+ antiporter Sod2 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is essential for Na+ extrusion (34Jia Z.-P. McCullough N. Martel R. Hemmingsen S. Young P.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Further examination of the S. cerevisiae genome has revealed additional anonymous open reading frames (YDR456w, YJL094c, YJR106w, YAL022c) whose encoded protein sequences show similarity to Na+/H+ exchangers. YDR456w is of particular interest, since PSORT analysis (35Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar) predicts that its protein product would be situated in the mitochondrial inner membrane due to potential targeting signals at its N terminus. To test this hypothesis, we isolated the YDR456w gene (renamed NHA2) and show that its protein product is localized to yeast mitochondria. We also characterized its function in isolated mitochondria and demonstrated its physiological role by comparing wild-type yeast with an isogenic strain lacking this gene. Yeast NHA2 also has strong sequence similarity to a partial cDNA (KIAA0267) that was recently cloned from a human bone marrow cell line. 2T. Nagase, N. Seki, K. Ishikawa, O. Ohara, and N. Nomura, GenBankTM accession number D87743. 2T. Nagase, N. Seki, K. Ishikawa, O. Ohara, and N. Nomura, GenBankTM accession number D87743. We report the complete primary structure and tissue distribution of this novel human isoform (renamed NHE6) and show that it is also localized exclusively in mitochondria. Carrier-free 22NaCl (range of specific activity, 300–900 mCi/mg; concentration, ∼5 mCi/ml) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products (Mandel Scientific, Guelph, Ontario, Canada). Benzamil, quinine, rotenone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. α-Minimal essential medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from Life Technologies (Burlington, Ontario). Cell culture dishes and flasks were purchased from Becton Dickinson and/or Corning (Montréal, Québec, Canada). All other chemicals and reagents used in these experiments were purchased from BDH Inc. (St. Laurent, Québec, Canada) or Fisher and were of the highest grade available. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are SEY6210 (MATα, leu2–2, ura3–52, his3-Δ200, lys2–801, trp1-Δ901; kindly provided by Dr. Marc Lussier, McGill University) (36Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) and L4244 (MATα, leu2-Δ1, ura3–52, his3-Δ200) (kindly provided by Dr. Gerald R. Fink, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA). A rich medium (YPD) containing 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose or a minimal medium (SD) containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base and 1% dextrose supplemented with required amino acids was used for standard growth of S. cerevisiae. To analyze mitochondrial function, 2% of galactose, glycerol, succinate, or lactate was substituted as the carbon source. Wild type and the corresponding Δnha2 strains were inoculated into 10 ml of YPD medium and grown at 30 °C in a shaking platform incubator. Following incubation for 2, 10, and 20 days, optical densities of the cultures were determined by absorbance at 600 nm. Aliquots of equivalent optical densities were plated onto YPD plates and cultured for a further 2 days. The anonymous open reading frame YDR456w in S. cerevisiae corresponding to gene D9461.40(renamed NHA2) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the known sequence (GenBank™ accession number U33007). The sequence identity and fidelity was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A partial human cDNA (KIAA0267) showing homology to members of the NHE gene family was generously provided by Dr. T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan). To obtain the full-length sequence, we extended the partial cDNA sequence by 5′-rapid amplification of its cDNA end (5′-RACE) (37Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar) using Marathon-ReadyTM cDNAs from human kidney (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as a template. For the initial PCR, the 5′-oligonucleotide primer was AP1, which corresponded to a sequence within the 5′-adaptor (CLONTECH), and the 3′-primer (5′-GGCTTGCTTCTCGGACACG-3′) was derived from the 5′-sequence of KIAA0267. Five μl of the initial 25-μl PCR product was reamplified with a nested 5′-adaptor primer AP2 (CLONTECH) and a nested 3′-primer (5′-GCTTCTCGGACACGATCTCCTCGTCC-3′). The PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on agarose gels, isolated, subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Then, a NotI–NcoI fragment was isolated from one of the 5′-RACE products containing the missing sequence and ligated to the partial cDNA to obtain the full-length sequence. HeLa cells were maintained in complete α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mm of NaHCO3 (pH 7.4) and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. A human poly(A+) RNA blot was purchased from CLONTECH and hybridized with a 0.6-kilobase pair ClaI–EcoRI fragment isolated from the 3′-end of the cDNA that exhibited little sequence identity to the other known mammalian NHE isoforms. The probe was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primer method (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and hybridized at 68 °C for 1 h in the Express HybTM solution (CLONTECH). The blot was washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 30 min each followed by a high stringency wash in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 40 min. The radioactive signals were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Creation of null alleles in yeast was accomplished using the PCR-based gene disruption technique (38Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 39Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This was accomplished using the pBM2983 plasmid carrying a gene replacement cassette, which encompasses a promoterless green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria and a tandemly located HIS3 marker with its own promoter (kindly provided by Dr. J. H. Hegemann, Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen, Germany) (39Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). GFP emits green fluorescence (sharp peak at ∼508 nm) when excited between 450 and 490 nm and can be followed in both living and formaldehyde-fixed cells. The presence of GFP in the replacement cassette is useful for examining the regulation of the endogenous NHA2 promoter, although this was not undertaken in the current study. The replacement gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers. Primer 1 (5′-oligonucleotide) contains 45 nucleotides immediately 5′ of the ATG start codon of NHA2followed by 19 nucleotides of the GFP coding region beginning at the ATG start codon (5′-TCAGAGGATAATCTTTTATCGCTGTCAGTACATCAACTATGAAAAATGAGTAAAGGAGAA-3′); primer 2 (3′-oligonucleotide) contains 45 nucleotides immediately 3′ of the stop codon of NHA2 followed by 19 nucleotides of the HIS3 coding region beginning 154 bp downstream of the HIS3 stop codon (5′-TTAATATATTTATATTAGAAACAAGGAAACCATACACTTTAAAGTGCGCGCCTCGTTCAG-3′). The PCR fragment was transformed into the SEY6210 haploid yeast strain by the lithium acetate/single-stranded DNA/polyethylene glycol method (40Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar) and grown on histidine-deficient medium. Homologous recombinants were selected by using the HIS3 auxotrophic marker and expression of GFP (under the control of the NHA2promoter). Deletion of NHA2 was confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA using specific primers to an upstream region of the NHA2 promoter and an internal sequence of GFP. The PCR fragment corresponding to the entire open reading frame of S. cerevisiae NHA2, but excluding the termination codon, was digested with XbaI and ClaI and cloned into the corresponding site in the yeast expression vector pGFP-C-FUS (kindly provided by Dr. Hegemann) (39Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). This resulted in an NHA2-GFP fusion construct under the control of the methionine-repressible MET25 promoter (pGFP-C-FUS-NHA2). To construct a human NHE6-GFP chimera, an XbaI site was introduced by PCR at the C-terminal end of the NHE6 open reading frame just before the stop codon. A NotI–XbaI fragment containing the entire NHE6 coding sequence was then fused in frame with the XbaI–EcoRI fragment of cDNA encoding a modified GFP exhibiting enhanced fluorescence (GFP-cycle 3) (41Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P.C. Nat. Biotech. 1997; 14: 315-319Crossref Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), and then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pIRES-neo (CLONTECH). The pGFP-C-FUS control plasmid and pGFP-C-FUS-NHA2 fusion construct were transformed into SEY6210 haploid strain and URA + colonies were selected on SD plates supplemented with Leu, His, Trp, and Lys. Transformed cells were inoculated into SD medium devoid of uracil and methionine to maintain selection and to induce high levels of expression from the MET25 promoter, respectively. To stain mitochondria in living cells, exponentially growing cells were incubated in SD medium plus 2.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by fixation by incubation for 30 min in SD medium containing 3.7% formaldehyde. Under these conditions, mitochondrial DNA is preferentially stained compared with nuclear DNA (42Shero J.H. Koval M. Spencer F. Palmer R.E. Hieter P. Koshland D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 749-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon) with the appropriate filter sets (filter set UV-1A for DAPI: excitation 365 ± 10 nm, emission 400 nm; filter set B-2A for GFP: excitation 450–490 nm, emission 520 nm). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the human NHE6-GFP fusion construct by the calcium phosphate method (43Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were kept for 24 h at 37 °C and then incubated at a reduced temperature (30 °C) for another 36 h to enhance the fluorescence signal of GFP, as described previously (44Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were selectively stained by incubating the cells with 25 nmof the MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRosTM dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min at 37 °C. This dye is not fluorescent until it enters metabolically active cells, where it is oxidized to the fluorescent probe and sequestered into mitochondria. The results were analyzed by confocal laser microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted microscope. The MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRosTM dye was excited with a helium/neon (543-nm) laser and was imaged on a photomultiplier after passage through FT560 and LP590 filter sets. The NHE6-GFP was imaged by exciting the sample with a 488-nm line from an argon/krypton laser, and the resulting fluorescence was collected on a photomultiplier after passage through FT510 and BP515–540 filter sets. All images were line averaged and printed on a Kodak XLS8300 high resolution (300 dots per inch) printer. Optical sections were taken using a × 63, 1.4 NA objective (optical thickness, ∼1.0 μm). Mitochondria from S. cerevisiae wild-type and Δnha2 strains, which were grown on 2% glycerol-containing medium, were isolated by differential centrifugation as described by Yaffe (45Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) in a concentration of 50 μl/g of original cells. NHE activity was assessed by measuring 22Na+ fluxes as described previously (14Nath S. Garlid K.D. Lemasters J.J. Hackenbrock C.R. Thurman R.G. Westerhoff H.V. Integration of Mitochondrial Function. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988: 357-364Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria (75 μg) were treated with 4 μg/ml rotenone in 300 μl of buffer containing 100 mm mannitol, 45 mm sodium acetate, 20 mm TES (pH 7.2), and 1 mm EGTA for 6 min at room temperature. The mitochondrial suspension was incubated with 1.5 μCi of 22Na+ for 15 s, immediately diluted in 5 ml of ice-cold stop solution (0.1 m LiCl), filtered through a 0.3-μm Millipore filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold stop solution. Each experiment was replicated 3–5 times from the same mitochondrial preparation. Analysis of the primary structure of S. cerevisiae Nha2 using PSORT (35Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar), which estimates the subcellular localization of proteins in eukaryotic cells based on known targeting motifs, predicted that it would be localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane due to targeting signals at its N terminus.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that Nha2 is targeted to mitochondria, we amplified the NHA2 gene by PCR from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and inserted it into the green fluorescent protein fusion vector pGFP-C-FUS (39Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) in the proper open reading frame to create an NHA2-GFP fusion gene (GFP at the C terminus of Nha2) under the control of the methionine-regulated MET25 promoter. The sequence of NHA2 was verified to ensure that mutations were not introduced during gene amplification. This approach has been used successfully for studying the expression and subcellular localization of other genes in budding yeast (39Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The pGFP-C-FUS-NHA2 fusion plasmid and the pGFP-C-FUS control plasmid were transformed into the yeast strain SEY6210 and maintained in medium lacking uracil (to select for transfectants) and methionine (to induce high levels of expression from the MET25 promoter). GFP fluorescence was monitored in formaldehyde-fixed yeast cells using fluorescence microscopy. Mitochondria were detected using the fluorescent DNA-binding dye, DAPI, under conditions that stain yeast mitochondrial DNA more intensely than nuclear DNA (42Shero J.H. Koval M. Spencer F. Palmer R.E. Hieter P. Koshland D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 749-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, DAPI staining was observed at discrete sites along the periphery of a representative cell, which are presumed to be mitochondria, and these co-localized with the fluorescence signal of the Nha2-GFP fusion protein (Fig.1 B). By contrast, expression of unfused GFP, which lacks membrane targeting motifs, showed a more diffuse green fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C). These data are consistent with the localization of Nha2-GFP to mitochondria. To define the function of yeast Nha2, the entire open reading frame of NHA2 was replaced with a cassette containing the HIS3 auxotrophic marker. Gene disruptants were selected by their ability to grow on histidine-deficient medium, and deletion of NHA2 was confirmed by PCR analysis (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 2, mitochondria isolated from the wild-type strain displayed measurable acid-induced22Na+ influx that was inhibited by 100 μm benzamil, an amiloride analogue that preferentially antagonizes mitochondrial NHE activity (14Nath S. Garlid K.D. Lemasters J.J. Hack"

The authors integrate recent work on a phenomenon called cosupression, in which introduced genes can suppress expression of the plant9s own genes, with other research on how plants resist viral infections and suggest that information-carrying molecules (likely RNAs) move through the plant in long tubes (phloem) and regulate cell physiology at a distance."
https://openalex.org/W1966525626,"Previous studies have demonstrated that non-visual arrestins function as adaptors in clathrin-mediated endocytosis to promote agonist-induced internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR). Here, we characterized the effects of arrestins and other modulators of clathrin-mediated endocytosis on down-regulation of the β2AR. In COS-1 and HeLa cells, non-visual arrestins promote agonist-induced internalization and down-regulation of the β2AR, whereas dynamin-K44A, a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin that inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis, attenuates β2AR internalization and down-regulation. In HEK293 cells, dynamin-K44A profoundly inhibits agonist-induced internalization and down-regulation of the β2AR, suggesting that receptor internalization is critical for down-regulation in these cells. Moreover, a dominant-negative mutant of β-arrestin, β-arrestin-(319–418), also inhibits both agonist-induced receptor internalization and down-regulation. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis reveals that the β2AR is trafficked to lysosomes in HEK293 cells, where presumably degradation of the receptor occurs. These studies demonstrate that down-regulation of the β2AR is in part due to trafficking of the β2AR via the clathrin-coated pit endosomal pathway to lysosomes.

Stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: GPR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. leads to adaptive changes that serve to modulate the responsiveness of a cell to further stimulation (1Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. Cohn P.M. Handbook of Physiology: Section 7; Endocrinology. I. Oxford University Press, New York1998: 125-164Google Scholar). Three temporally distinct mechanisms of agonist-promoted regulation of GPRs have been identified: desensitization, internalization, and down-regulation. Desensitization often occurs within seconds of stimulation and for many GPRs is mediated by phosphorylation of the receptor by a specific G protein-coupled receptor kinase. This phosphorylation promotes the binding of an arrestin to the receptor, which sterically prevents subsequent coupling to G proteins. Agonist stimulation also promotes rapid (minutes) internalization of many GPRs into an intracellular endosomal pool, thereby effectively removing the receptor from the cell surface. Finally, prolonged receptor stimulation (hours) results in receptor down-regulation, defined by an overall decrease in receptor number.The β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) has served as an important model for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in GPR regulation. The β2AR is rapidly desensitized after agonist stimulation, in part a consequence of phosphorylation of carboxyl-terminal serines and threonines by G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (2Benovic J.L. Strasser R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation promotes the binding of an arrestin (either β-arrestin or arrestin 3), which directly inhibits the ability of the receptor to couple to Gs (3Benovic J.L. Kuhn H. Weyand I.

Recent studies have suggested that β-arrestin and arrestin 3 are not only involved in the initial stages of desensitization of the β2AR but that they are important components in receptor internalization (6Ferguson S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 217: 363-366Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 7Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Since both β-arrestin and arrestin 3 can specifically bind to clathrin, the major structural protein of clathrin-coated pits, arrestins can function as adaptors to recruit G protein-coupled receptor kinase-phosphorylated receptors into coated pits where they can be internalized (7Goodman Jr., O.B.

Recent studies have demonstrated that β2AR internalization plays an important role in receptor resensitization, a process that involves dephosphorylation of the receptor and subsequent recycling back to the cell surface (8Yu S.S.

We have also recently shown that a β2AR tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) can also slowly accumulate in lysosomes after agonist activation (14Kallal L. Gagnon A.W. Penn R.B.

However, whether internalization of the β2AR via clathrin-coated pits directly contributes to its down-regulation remains speculative. Previous radioligand binding studies utilizing mutants of the β2AR have failed to link internalization and down-regulation and, in fact, suggest that the two processes may be distinct events (15Hausdorff W.P.

Moreover, in addition to protein degradation, prolonged agonist stimulation also leads to decreased steady state levels of β2AR mRNA in some cells (20Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 21Hadcock J.R. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

A. 1989; 86: 4853-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, down-regulation of the β2AR is composed of multiple mechanisms that function to both destroy existing receptor as well as decrease the synthesis of new receptors.The present studies were focused on addressing whether agonist-promoted internalization of the β2AR contributes to its down-regulation. To accomplish this, we expressed the β2AR in a variety of mammalian cell lines and examined the effect of coexpression of various modulators of clathrin-mediated endocytosis on agonist-induced down-regulation. The results of these studies indicate that increases or decreases in agonist-mediated internalization of the β2AR directly correlate with concomitant changes in the extent of receptor down-regulation. Moreover, in HEK293 cells, β2AR down-regulation appears very dependent upon internalization of the receptor and subsequent trafficking to lysosomes.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSince mutational analysis has not provided a clear picture of the link between agonist-stimulated internalization and down-regulation of the β2AR, we undertook studies examining the effect of modulators of endocytosis on agonist-mediated down-regulation of the wild-type β2AR. Presumably if internalized receptors are targeted for down-regulation, increasing or decreasing the proportion of these receptors should have a concomitant effect on down-regulation. Previously we demonstrated that non-visual arrestins increase agonist-induced internalization of the β2AR in COS-1 cells (7Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Thus, COS-1 cells provide a convenient model for establishing a potential link between agonist-mediated internalization and down-regulation of the β2AR. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with β2AR or cotransfected with β2AR plus either β-arrestin, arrestin 3, or visual arrestin and assayed for both agonist-induced internalization and down-regulation. Both β-arrestin and arrestin 3, but not visual arrestin, promoted an ∼3-fold increase in agonist-induced internalization of the β2AR after 30 min of isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 1 A). Previous studies have established that this effect is likely mediated via a carboxyl-terminal clathrin binding domain in β-arrestin and arrestin 3 (23Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) that functions to recruit the receptor complex to clathrin-coated pits, resulting in receptor internalization (7Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar).We next determined the effect of arrestins on β2AR down-regulation in COS-1 cells. Similar to the internalization results, expression of either β-arrestin or arrestin 3, but not visual arrestin, significantly increased isoproterenol-stimulated down-regulation of the β2AR after a 24-h incubation with agonist (Fig. 1 B). However, although the effect of β-arrestin and arrestin 3 appears specific, these proteins did not increase agonist-promoted down-regulation as effectively as they increase β2AR internalization. Thus, in an effort to increase the observed effect, we expressed both arrestin 3 and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 with the β2AR. G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 expression augments the effect of arrestins on agonist-stimulated β2AR sequestration in COS-1 cells (Ref. 24Menard L. Ferguson S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar and data not shown), presumably by promoting receptor phosphorylation and thereby increasing arrestin binding to the receptor. Expression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and arrestin 3 in COS-1 cells increased β2AR down-regulation from 32 ± 5 to 40 ± 1%. These results suggest that some fraction of the receptors that are internalized in response to isoproterenol are targeted for down-regulation.We also wanted to assess whether inhibitory modulators of clathrin-mediated endocytosis would affect down-regulation of the β2AR. For these studies we chose to examine the effect of dynamin-K44A on agonist-stimulated down-regulation. Dynamin is a GTP-binding protein that plays a critical role in clathrin-coated vesicle formation (25Damke H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that dynamin-K44A is deficient in GTP binding and functions as an effective dominant negative protein to potently block clathrin-mediated endocytosis (26Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Indeed, dynamin-K44A overexpression in several cell lines has been demonstrated to significantly attenuate agonist-induced internalization of the β2AR (27Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 28Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Since COS-1 cells have a relatively low intrinsic level of β2AR down-regulation, we tested the effect of dynamin-K44A on arrestin 3-promoted down-regulation in these cells. Overexpression of dynamin-K44A inhibited arrestin 3-promoted β2AR internalization ∼72% (Fig. 1 A), whereas an ∼53% reduction in down-regulation was observed (Fig. 1 B). This suggests that both β2AR internalization and down-regulation are primarily mediated via clathrin-coated pits in these cells.To determine whether agonist-promoted internalization via clathrin-coated pits plays a cell-specific role in β2AR down-regulation, we tested the effects of arrestins and dynamin-K44A in additional cell lines. HeLa cells appear to display many of the characteristics of agonist-induced internalization and down-regulation of the β2AR that we observed in COS-1 cells, although down-regulation was significantly higher after a 24-h treatment with isoproterenol (∼48%). Coexpression of arrestin 3 with the receptor promoted agonist-mediated internalization ∼2–2.5-fold, whereas coexpression of dynamin-K44A inhibited internalization ∼50% (Fig.2 A). Similarly, arrestin 3 promoted and dynamin-K44A inhibited receptor down-regulation, although the effects of arrestin 3 and dynamin-K44A appeared to be more pronounced at the shorter time points (1–5 h) compared with 24 h (Fig. 2 B). Notably, dynamin-K44A appeared only modestly effective at blocking agonist-induced down-regulation in these cells at 24 h. This suggests that additional pathways of intracellular protein degradation might contribute to β2AR down-regulation in HeLa cells. Such pathways could include receptor trafficking of the β2AR via caveolae, which appears to occur in A431 cells (29Raposo G. Dunia I. Delavier-Klutchko C. Kaveri S. Strosberg A.D. Benedetti E.L. Eur.

As previously demonstrated (6Ferguson S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 217: 363-366Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 28Krupnick J.G. Santini F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), overexpression of β-arrestin only marginally promoted isoproterenol-stimulated internalization of the β2AR in HEK293 cells (Fig.3 A). Similarly, β-arrestin overexpression also had no effect on agonist-induced down-regulation of the β2AR in HEK293 cells after 24 h of isoproterenol treatment (Fig. 3 B). Conversely, dynamin-K44A effectively attenuated agonist-mediated internalization of the β2AR (Fig. 3 A and Refs. 27Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar and 28Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Strikingly, inhibition of β2AR internalization by dynamin-K44A also resulted in virtually a complete blockade of β2AR down-regulation (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, β-arrestin (319–418), a dominant-negative mutant that contains the carboxyl-terminal clathrin binding domain of β-arrestin (28Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), had an intermediate effect on both internalization and down-regulation of the β2AR (Fig. 3). The ability of the β-arrestin dominant-negative mutant to partially inhibit agonist-induced internalization and down-regulation supports the idea that arrestins are involved in β2AR internalization, and by association, in receptor down-regulation. Taken together, the results from COS-1, HeLa, and HEK293 cells indicate that a proportion of β2ARs internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis are targeted for down-regulation.Figure 3Effect of inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis on agonist-induced β2AR redistribution in HEK293 cells.

Results represent the mean ± S.E. of four experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Presumably, the trafficking pattern for the β2AR might be similar to that seen for other G protein-coupled receptors in which activated receptors are sorted to lysosomes for degradation (11Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Petrou C. Chen L. Tashjian A.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14817-14824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, we might expect that some proportion of the β2ARs that are internalized might also be sorted to lysosomes for degradation. To better visualize agonist-induced trafficking of the β2AR, we expressed a previously characterized green fluorescent protein-conjugated β2AR (β2AR-GFP) (14Kallal L. Gagnon A.W. Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells transfected with β2AR-GFP were plated onto coverslips and initially incubated with rhodamine-labeled dextran, which is taken up by fluid phase endocytosis and accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes (33Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). Before agonist stimulation, the fluorescence pattern of β2AR-GFP suggested localization primarily at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 A). This contrasts with the fluorescence pattern of rhodamine-labeled dextran, which has a distinct intracellular punctate appearance (Fig. 4). After a 30-min incubation with isoproterenol, β2AR-GFP was primarily visualized as a distinct punctate pattern of fluorescence (Fig. 4 B). However, this staining pattern did not significantly colocalize with rhodamine-labeled dextran, suggesting that the β2AR is likely in early endocytic vesicles. Indeed previous studies have demonstrated that an epitope-tagged β2AR in HEK293 cells colocalizes with markers for early endocytic vesicles after several minutes of isoproterenol stimulation (34von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, 3 h of stimulation with isoproterenol resulted in significant colocalization of β2AR-GFP and rhodamine-labeled dextran, as seen by the appearance of yellow where the green and redpatterns are coincident (Fig. 4 C). Colocalization of β2AR-GFP and dextran can be detected as early as 1 h after agonist addition (data not shown) and increased out to 24 h (Fig. 4 D). These results are similar to those observed in HeLa cells, where β2AR-GFP colocalizes with rhodamine-labeled transferrin, a marker for early endosomes, after short term agonist treatment, whereas colocalization of β2AR-GFP with dextran is observed with longer incubation times (>1 h) (14Kallal L. Gagnon A.W. Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, these results demonstrate that in both HEK293 and HeLa cells some portion of the β2AR are sorted from early endosomes to lysosomes upon prolonged stimulation with isoproterenol, defining a mechanism for internalization-dependent, agonist-mediated degradation of the β2AR.Figure 4Visualization of isoproterenol-stimulated β2AR redistribution in HEK293 cells.

Studies utilizing carboxyl-terminal mutants of the β2AR that disrupt its ability to internalize in an agonist-dependent manner have not demonstrated an effect on down-regulation (15Hausdorff W.P.

Additional mutations ablate the ability of the β2AR to undergo agonist-mediated down-regulation, seemingly without affecting its ability to internalize (17Valiquette M. Bonin H. Hnatowich M.

The assumption from these studies was that these two regulatory processes were distinct. In contrast, our data demonstrate that β2AR internalization can directly contribute to down-regulation. Although some of the differences between these studies may be attributable to cell type, it also seems plausible that wild-type and mutant β2ARs may behave differently. Thus, we have focused our studies on the ability of proteins downstream of the receptor (arrestins and dynamin) to modulate internalization and down-regulation of the wild-type β2AR.The mechanisms involved in specific lysosomal targeting of G protein-coupled receptors remain poorly defined. However, some receptors appear to contain distinct cytoplasmic domains that are critical for differential intracellular targeting. For example, the thrombin receptor contains distinct but overlapping regions within its carboxyl tail that are involved in either tonic cycling or agonist-stimulated internalization of the receptor (35Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that targeting of the thrombin receptor is dependent on the binding of an as yet undefined protein to this region of the receptor (35Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R.

Following a 6-h hypoxic treatment, a time-dependent increase in intracellular ceramide level was observed with a concurrent decrease in sphingomyelin. It was also shown that the hypoxia-induced ceramide accumulation resulted from activation of neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase. Comparative kinetic analyses of the neutral sphingomyelinase in the cells under normoxia and hypoxia showed that hypoxia increased Vmax but did not affect Kmof the enzyme. In PC12 cells overexpressing Bcl-2 which show strong resistance to hypoxia, sphingomyelin hydrolysis was decreased and activation of neutral sphingomyelinase was reduced. Addition of exogenous C2-ceramide induced cell death and activated caspase-3 as markedly as the hypoxia treatment. On the other hand, in PC12 cells overexpressing Bcl-2, significant decreases in cell death and inhibition of caspase-3 activation were observed after exogenous addition of C2-ceramide. The inhibitors of caspase-3 prevented cell death by either hypoxia or C2-ceramide. These results suggest that ceramide generated by activation of neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase mediates hypoxic cell death and that Bcl-2 has inhibitory effects on ceramide formation and caspase activation.

Cell death due to hypoxia is a major concern in various clinical entities such as cerebral ischemia and other diseases.

Ten proteins homologous to interleukin-1β converting enzyme (caspase-1) have been identified in mammals and are classified into three subfamilies, caspase-1-, caspase-2 (NEDD2/ICH-1)-, and caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/apopain)-like proteases, based on their structures (22Alnemri E.S.

Among these caspases, caspase-3 has been deemed an attractive candidate as a putative mediator of apoptosis. On the other hand, recently the sphingomyelin (SM) 1The abbreviations used are: SM, sphingomyelin; SMase, sphingomyelinase; C2-ceramide, N-acetylsphingosine; FB1, fumonisin B1; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PI, propidium iodide; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase. cycle, with regulated conversion of SM to ceramide by sphingomyelinase (SMase), has been extensively studied as a key pathway involved in apoptosis as well as differentiation (23Okazaki T.

In the current study, to elucidate the involvement of SM metabolism in hypoxia-induced cell death, we have examined the intracellular levels of ceramide and SM in vector- and Bcl-2-transfected PC12 cells after exposure to hypoxia. N-Acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), a membrane-permeable analog, which is known to induce apoptosis in many types of cells including neuronal cells (28Brugg B. Michel P.P. Agid Y. Ruberg M. J.

We show here that hypoxia induces ceramide formation in PC12 cells through activation of neutral magnesium-dependent SMase, which was inhibited by highly overexpressed Bcl-2. These results suggest that ceramide formation contributes to hypoxic death of PC12 cell and that Bcl-2 has inhibitory effects on ceramide formation and caspase activation. The tetrapeptide substrate for caspase-3, Ac-DEVD-MCA, was purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). The relatively nonselective inhibitor of caspase-1-like proteases, z-VAD.FMK, the selective inhibitor of caspase-1, z-YVAD.AFC, and the selective inhibitor of caspase-3, z-DEVD.FMK, were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Dubin, CA).

The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay kit was from Kyokuto (Tokyo, Japan). Other chemicals were of highest quality available. A PC12 cell line (38Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 5% (v/v) horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Hypoxia was induced with a multigas incubator (SANYO MCO-175M, Osaka, Japan). Briefly, after the cells were plated at a low density (5 × 104/cm2) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% horse serum for 24 h, cells were incubated in the medium containing 2% FBS for 24 h, and then placed into the multigas incubator (set to 1.0% O2, with 5% CO2, and the balance N2) at 37 °C for indicated periods according to the methods previously described (39Goldberg M. Zhang H.L. Steinberg S.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,40Boniece I.R. Wagner J.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4220-4228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For treatment with exogenous C2-ceramide, the cells plated at a low density (5 × 104/cm2) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FBS for 24 h. After the cells were rinsed twice with serum-free RPMI medium, 20 μm C2-ceramide was delivered into the RPMI medium containing 2% FBS. To verify the effects of caspase inhibitors, the cells were preincubated for 1 h with medium containing 100 μm z-VAD.FMK, z-DEVD.FMK, or z-YVAD.AFC. For experiments using FB1, the cells were preincubated for indicated periods with medium containing 100 μm FB1, and then exposed to hypoxia. Optimal concentration of each agent was determined from dose-response curves versus the extent of cell death (data not shown). Human bcl-2 cDNA (41Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5214-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) was transfected using the pUC-CAGGS vector (42Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4626) Google Scholar) bearing a β-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer as described previously (10Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2161-2166PubMed Google Scholar). Production of Bcl-2 proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-human Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody, and the amount of Bcl-2 expressed using the pUC-CAGGS system was much higher than those using the pBC140 system (10Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 (10 μm) and PI (10 μm) for 10 min and analyzed under a non-confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60) with excitation at 360 nm, as previously reported (13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2161-2166PubMed Google Scholar). Because Hoechst 33258 stains all nuclei and PI stains nuclei of cells with a disrupted plasma membrane, nuclei of viable, necrotic, and apoptotic cells were observed as blue intact nuclei, red round nuclei, and fragmented (or condensed) nuclei, respectively, under a fluorescence microscopy. Extent of cell death was assessed using a kit to measure released LDH activity from dead cells, because loss of cell membrane integrity was observed in both necrotic and apoptotic cells (10Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar). LDH activity in the culture medium was determined using a commercially available kit (Kyokuto, Tokyo) exactly as described by the manufacturer. Cellular ceramide level was measured according to the previously described method (43Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Lipids were extracted by a Folch partition (44Folch J. Lees M. Sloan-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dried, and incubated in 0.1m KOH in chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v) at 37 °C for 1 h. Ceramide was converted to ceramide 1-[32P]phosphate by E. coli diacylglycerol kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Labeled lipids (ceramide 1-phosphate) were separated by high performance thin-layer chromatography in chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:20:15:10:5, v/v). Following autoradiography, spots corresponding to ceramide 1-phosphate were scraped and the radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. Quantitation of ceramide was based on a standard curve of known amounts of ceramide. The changes in ceramide content were normalized based on total protein. To label sphingolipids, PC12 cells (5 × 105 cells/120 ml) were cultured for 72 h in the medium containing 25 μCi of [14C]serine. Lipids were extracted as described previously (44Folch J. Lees M. Sloan-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the lower phase was collected and evaporated under a flow of nitrogen gas. The extracted lipids were incubated in 0.1 m KOH in chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v) at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were then separated on high performance thin-layer chromatography plates using the solvent system of chloroform:methanol:water (70:30:5, v/v) for SM or chloroform:methanol (95:5, v/v) for ceramide. Ceramide was observed as doublet; the upper band consisted mostly of a mixture of C22:0, C24:0, and C24:1 fatty acids and the lower band consisted primarily of C16:0, C16:1, and C18:0 fatty acids (45Banerjee P. Dawson G. Dasgupta A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1110: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following autoradiography, spots were scraped and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS-6500). The changes in ceramide content were normalized based on total protein. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared from the cells after exposure to hypoxia. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml E-64) using 20 strokes in a homogenizer (Iuchiseieido, Tokyo, Japan) with a Teflon pestle. The post-nuclear homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. The activities of both neutral and acid SMases were determined using a mixed micelle assay system as described (24Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9868-9876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For determining neutral SMase activity, membrane and cytosolic fractions (20 μg) were mixed with [methyl-14C]SM (40,000 cpm in 1 nmol of bovine brain SM in 0.25% Triton X-100 solubilized by sonication). The activities of magnesium-dependent and -independent neutral SMase were measured separately using 0.1m Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) with or without 6 mmMgCl2, respectively. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) followed by 0.2 ml of H2O. After phase separation, a portion of the upper phase was transferred to scintillation vials and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Negative controls containing no enzyme was run concomitantly. Acid SMase activity in membrane and cytosol was measured as above except that 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 5 mm EDTA replaced the Tris/HCl buffer. Cells were harvested after exposure to hypoxia or ceramide for the indicated periods of time and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and then suspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm EGTA. After addition of 10 μm digitonin, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Complete cell lysis was verified by the amount of released LDH activity. Lysates were centrifuged at 900 × g for 3 min, and the resulting supernatant (40 μg of protein) were incubated with 50 μm of the enzyme substrate Ac-DEVD-MCA at 37 °C for 1 h. Levels of released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin were measured using spectrofluorometers (Hitachi F-3000 and F-2000) with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. Excitation and emission slit width were adjusted to 10 and 20 mm, respectively. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 0.22 nmol of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin per min at 37 °C. Cytotoxicity was assayed by the morphological features of the cells using double staining with Hoechst 33258 and PI under fluorescence microscopy as described by Shimizu et al. (13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2161-2166PubMed Google Scholar). Viable, necrotic, early apoptotic, terminal apoptotic cells under hypoxia could be easily distinguished and quantified by this fluorescence microscope analysis with Hoechst 33258 (blue) which stains all nuclei and PI (red) which stains only nuclei in cells with disrupted membrane integrity. Nuclei of viable, necrotic, and apoptotic cells were observed as blue intact nuclei, red intact nuclei, and fragmented or condensed blue or red nuclei, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Cells with fragmented or condensed nuclei were classified further based on PI staining as “early” apoptotic with membrane integrity and “terminal” apoptotic without membrane integrity. These nuclear morphological changes under fluorescence microscopy are well corresponded to necrosis and apoptosis defined by electron microscopy in hypoxic PC12 cells and also in other cell lines. Vector-transfected PC12 cells (designated as PC12-V) were used as control cells. PC12-V cells underwent a time-dependent decrease in cell viability including apoptosis and necrosis after exposure to 1% hypoxia (Fig. 1, A and B). On the other hand, PC12 cells with highly overexpressed Bcl-2 using the pUC-CAGGS system (designated as PC12-Bcl-2) showed strong resistance to hypoxia throughout the time course (Fig. 1, A and C). To confirm cell viability during hypoxia, the LDH assay was performed because loss of cell membrane integrity was observed in both necrotic and apoptotic PC12 cells after exposure to hypoxia (13Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Itoh Y. Hasegawa J. Yamabe K. Otsuki Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2161-2166PubMed Google Scholar). The LDH assay in each group was well correlated with the morphological changes under fluorescent microscopy (data not shown). Changes in the levels of ceramide and SM during hypoxia were measured by the enzymatic analysis with E. colidiacylglycerol kinase and also by the metabolic labeling of cells with [14C]serine. Up to 3 h after exposure to hypoxia, no significant increase in ceramide level was observed in PC12-V nor PC12-Bcl-2 cells by the diacylglycerol kinase assay. However, a marked increase in the ceramide content was observed at 6 h in PC12-V cells (Fig. 2 A). The maximal level was obtained at 24 h (3-fold increase over the control level) and sustained to 48 h. In contrast, significant increase was not observed in PC12-Bcl-2 cells up to 24 h after exposure to hypoxia, but a slight increase was observed at 48 h. Similar profile of ceramide formation was observed in cells labeled with [14C]serine. An increase in [14C]ceramide was observed at 12 and 24 h after exposure to hypoxia in PC12-V cells, but not PC12-Bcl-2 cells (Fig. 2 B). There is a small difference in ceramide generation between Fig. 2, A and B, although temporal profiles of ceramide generation were similar. This difference could be due to the different assays used. In addition, changes in SM level were also analyzed by the metabolic [14C]serine labeling method (Fig. 2 C). In PC12-V cells, a decrease in [14C]SM was observed as early as 6 h and its level was declined (approximately 40% of control) at 24 h and sustained thereafter. In contrast, only a small decrease was observed in PC12-Bcl-2 cells even at 48 h. To confirm the possibility that ceramide formation could mediate hypoxic cell death, we used an inhibitor of sphinganine N-acyltransferase, FB1, which is known to inhibit de novo synthesis of ceramide (12Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar, 48Harel R. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14476-14481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Posse de Chaves E.I. Bussiere M. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3028-3035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Preincubation of PC12-V cells for 1 h with 100 μm FB1 before hypoxia was unable to prevent cell death (data not shown). In contrast, prolonged (for 96 h) incubation of cells with 100 μm FB1 decreased the intracellular level of both ceramide and SM, and decreased hypoxic cell death by about 40% compared with the control culture (data not shown). These results suggest that ceramide is produced from SM via SMase during hypoxia, but not from de novo synthesis, and that FB1 decreased intracellular ceramide and SM by prolonged incubation, which prevented hypoxic cell death. Thus, these findings also support the hypothesis that ceramide mediates cell death caused by hypoxia. Recently neutral and acid SMases were shown to be implicated in the production of ceramide in response to apoptosis inducers (for review, see Ref. 25Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have measured activities of three types of SMases (neutral magnesium-dependent, neutral magnesium-independent, and acid) in both membrane and cytosol fractions. It was observed that hypoxia treatment of PC12-V cells for 24 h produced an increase in membrane-bound neutral magnesium-dependent SMase activity (pH 7.5) (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, such an increase was not observed in PC12-Bcl-2 cells. No significant changes were observed in neutral magnesium-independent and acid (pH 5.5) SMase activities by hypoxia treatment, although the activity of acid SMase was higher than that of neutral SMase in both PC12-V and PC12-Bcl-2 cell membranes (the ratio of neutral to acid SMase is approximately 1:3). Activities of neutral and acid SMases in cytosol were very low and no significant changes were observed during hypoxia (data not shown). A kinetic analysis was performed to know whether hypoxia affects Vmax or Km of the magnesium-dependent membrane-bound neutral SMase. Double-reciprocal plots showed that hypoxic treatment did not significantly affect Km, but increased Vmax (1.5-fold increase over the control level) of the neutral SMase in PC12 cells cultured for 24 h under hypoxic condition (Fig. 3 B). The above results suggest that ceramide produced during hypoxia is closely involved in hypoxic death signaling. Recently, caspases, especially caspase-3, are regarded as important regulators of apoptosis. However, the relationship between ceramide and caspases remains unknown. If the caspase-3 acts downstream of ceramide, this caspase should be activated by exogenous C2-ceramide. To test this possibility, the proteolytic activity of the caspase was measured using fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrates. First, the activities of caspase-3(-like) proteases increased and reached a peak at 12 h after exposure to hypoxia in PC12-V cells (Fig.4 A). C2-ceramide also gave rise to the sharp increase in the activities of caspase-3(-like) proteases, which peaked at 6 h and rapidly decreased thereafter (Fig. 4 B). However, dihydro-C2-ceramide, often used as an inactive analog of C2-ceramide, failed to activate this caspase. To know the effect of Bcl-2 on the increase in this caspase activity by hypoxia and C2-ceramide, the activity of this caspase was also measured in PC12-Bcl-2. As shown in Fig.4, overexpression of Bcl-2 markedly inhibited activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases during both hypoxia and ceramide treatment. To further assess the involvement of caspases in cell death induced by hypoxia and C2-ceramide, the cell viability was assessed by the LDH assay after hypoxia or the ceramide treatment in the presence of a caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD.FMK, and a relatively nonselective caspase inhibitor, z-VAD.FMK in PC12-V cells. The cell death induced by hypoxia at 48 h was found to be less than 20% in the cells treated with 100 μm z-VAD.FMK or z-DEVD.FMK, whereas cell death was approximately 40% in the untreated cells (Fig. 5 A). In PC12-Bcl-2 cells, the percentage of cell death was about 15 and 25% at 48 and 72 h, respectively. To know the relationsh"

They include PI3Kα, -β, and -δ isoforms coupled to receptor tyrosine kinases and a PI3Kγ isoform activated by receptor-stimulated G proteins. This study examines the direct interaction of purified recombinant PI3Kγ catalytic subunit (p110γ) and Gβγ complexes. When phosphatidylinositol was used as a substrate, Gβγ stimulated p110γ lipid kinase activity more than 60-fold (EC50, ∼20 nm). Stimulation was inhibited by Gαo-GDP or wortmannin in a concentration-dependent fashion. Stoichiometric binding of a monoclonal antibody to the putative pleckstrin homology domain of p110γ did not affect Gβγ-mediated enzymatic stimulation, whereas incubation of Gβγ with a synthetic peptide resembling a predicted Gβγ effector domain of type 2 adenylyl cyclase selectively inhibited activation of p110γ. Gβγ complexes bound to N- as well as C-terminal deletion mutants of p110γ. Correspondingly, these enzymatically inactive N- and C-terminal mutants inhibited Gβγ-mediated activation of wild type p110γ. Our data suggest that (i) p110γ directly interacts with Gβγ, (ii) the pleckstrin homology domain is not the only region important for Gβγ-mediated activation of the lipid kinase, and (iii) Gβγ binds to at least two contact sites of p110γ, one of which is close to or within the catalytic core of the enzyme.

Hence, PI-(3,4,5)P3 has been suggested to act as a second messenger eliciting a wide array of cellular responses (5Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). PI-(3,4,5)P3-dependent functions include regulation of cell growth, protein sorting, exocytosis, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. The enzymes responsible for the formation of PI-(3,4,5)P3 are phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K; EC 2.7.1.137), which catalyze phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the 3 position of the inositol ring (6Zvelebil M.J. Macdougall L. Leevers S. Volina S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Domin J. Stein R. Pages F. Koga H. Salim K. Linacre J. Das P. Panaretou C. Wetzker R. Waterfield M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. 1996; 351: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Depending on substrate specificity and enzyme structures, three classes of PI3Ks have been distinguished. Class I enzymes are involved in receptor-induced hormonal responses. They utilize PI, PI-4P, and PI-(4,5)P2 in vitro though within the cell they exhibit a preference for PI-(4,5)P2. In addition, they show a moderate serine/threonine protein kinase activity (7Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell.

J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Further discrimination of the class I members is based on their association with receptor tyrosine kinase (class IA)- or of G protein-coupled receptor (class IB)-signaling pathways, although very recently one member (p110β) has been suggested to respond synergistically to both Gβγ and tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides (10Kurosu H.

Additionally a related retrovirus-encoded PI3K causing hemangiosarcomas was found (11Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tschlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several mechanisms for regulating their enzymatic activity in response to extracellular stimuli have been elucidated. Among them the class IA members p110α, β, and δ are stimulated by tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins through interaction with regulatory PI3K subunits such as p85 or p55 (17Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 18Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volina S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). They in turn bind to the N terminus of the catalytic p110 subunit, thereby inducing PI3K activity. In contrast, the only known class IB member p110γ does not bind to p85 adaptors, but instead associates with a noncatalytic p101 subunit (19Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M.

However, several lines of evidence indicate that G proteins stimulate p110γ in the absence of p101 both in vitro and in vivo(20Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 21Kular G.

Gβγ are thought to be the dominant physiological stimulus, while Gα subunits of the Gi but not Gq or G12 subfamilies only moderately activate p110γ.Whereas a precise picture of the molecular mechanisms for receptor-induced activation of class IA PI3Ks has been drawn, little is known about how Gβγ activates PI3Kγ and which structures of the enzyme are involved. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the catalytic subunits of class I members revealed several highly conserved regions of homology (HR) but also parts which are quite diverse (6Zvelebil M.J. Macdougall L. Leevers S. Volina S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Domin J. Stein R. Pages F. Koga H. Salim K. Linacre J. Das P. Panaretou C. Wetzker R. Waterfield M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. 1996; 351: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All enzymes have a C-terminally located catalytic domain (HR1). Interestingly, this domain requires N-terminal regions for enzymatic activity (9Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore a horseshoe-like folding of the p110, enabling interaction between the N- and C-terminal half of the enzyme, has been assumed (24Vanhaesebroeck B. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 249-270PubMed Google Scholar). HR2 represents a PIK domain found in all PI3- and PI4-kinases. Other regions of homology are specific for PI3Ks (HR3) and class I PI3Ks (HR4). All class I PI3Ks also contain a Ras-binding motif (25Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In contrast, only class IA enzymes have an N-terminal stretch assumed to interact with its p85 subunits, whereas only p110γ exhibits a Ras-GAP homology region, which may fold to form a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (6Zvelebil M.J. Macdougall L. Leevers S. Volina S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Domin J. Stein R. Pages F. Koga H. Salim K. Linacre J. Das P. Panaretou C. Wetzker R. Waterfield M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This region of p110γ has been speculated to be involved in Gβγ-mediated activation of PI3Kγ, since PH domains of Gβγ-regulated proteins such as β-adrenergic receptor kinase or phosducin have previously been identified to bind Gβγ (27Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, other enzymes with an inherent PH domain such as phospholipase Cγ are insensitive to modulation by Gβγ, while some effectors lacking PH domains, e.g. adenylyl cyclases and potassium or calcium channels, are regulated by Gβγ complexes (29Parker P.J. Hemmings B.A. Gierschik P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 54-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 31Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 32Qin N. Platano D. Olcese R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine whether the putative PH domain of the catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ is critical for interaction of p110γ with Gβγ. Binding of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to p110γ that blocked the PH domain did not reduce Gβγ-mediated stimulation. Furthermore, results obtained with deletion mutants of p110γ indicated that Gβγ binds to an N-terminal region as well as to a region near or within the C-terminally located catalytic core. Correspondingly, inactive N- and C-terminal mutants inhibited Gβγ-mediated activation of wild type p110γ by sequestration of Gβγ. We conclude that the PH domain of p110γ is not the only region interacting with Gβγ and hypothesize that N- and C-terminal stretches of p110γ contribute to form a common Gβγ effector region.RESULTSOur initial experiments with the purified recombinant p110γ yielded a 5–6-fold stimulation with 1 μm Gβγ and an EC50 of 200 nm for transducin βγ (20Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). As this effect of Gβγ is moderate compared with effects on other G protein-regulated cellular targets, we optimized the conditions for p110γ activation. Human recombinant p110γ was expressed as GST fusion protein in Sf9 cells. Purified cytosolic enzyme exhibited a basal specific activity of 1–3 nmol of PI-3P/min/mg of p110γ (Fig.1 A) and was much more sensitive to Gβγ than the enzyme isolated from Sf9 membrane extracts (not shown). To investigate the stimulatory effect of Gβγ complexes we used a mixture of highly concentrated purified bovine brain Gβγ (see Fig. 1 A) instead of using the less potent transducin βγ. Under these experimental conditions with phosphatidylinositol (PI) as substrate, Gβγ complexes stimulated purified cytosolic p110γ up to 60-fold with an EC50 of ∼20 nm in a bimodal manner (see Fig. 1, B and C). As expected, p110α was not stimulated by Gβγ (not shown). Gβγ increased the Vmax of the recombinant p110γ for ATP, corresponding to the data obtained with the native purified PI3Kγ (23Tang X. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14193-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Some variation in the efficiency of Gβγ on p110γ activity was probably due to either a well known variability in the quality of PI-liposome preparations used as substrates (40Morris A.J. Rudge S.A. Mahlum C.E. Jenco J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 532-539PubMed Google Scholar) or to the degree of autophosphorylation of p110γ. The specific covalent inhibitor wortmannin decreased Gβγ-stimulated enzymatic activity half-maximally at 15 nm and completely at 100 nm (Fig.2 A). An excess of GDP-bound Gαo also inhibited Gβγ-mediated stimulation of p110γ activity, most likely by sequestration of free Gβγ (Fig.2 B).Figure 2A, inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated p110γ PI3K activity by wortmannin. p110γ was maximally stimulated with 200 nm Gβγ and incubated with wortmannin at increasing concentrations. Shown are mean values (±S.D.) of three independent experiments. B, inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated p110γ PI3K activity by GDP-bound Gαo. p110γ was incubated without (basal) or with half-maximally stimulating amounts of Gβγ (25 nm) in the absence or presence of a 2- or 6-fold molar excess of Gαo. Shown is one representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the involvement of the putative PH domain of p110γ we took advantage of a mAb raised against the purified enzyme (22Lopez-Ilasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The mAb binds specifically to an amino acid stretch of the enzyme corresponding to the PH domain postulated between amino acids 87 and 302 (6Zvelebil M.J. Macdougall L. Leevers S. Volina S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Domin J. Stein R. Pages F. Koga H. Salim K. Linacre J. Das P. Panaretou C. Wetzker R. Waterfield M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser.

Commun. 1996; 220: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that the mAb did not recognize constructs lacking amino acids 75–398 (see Fig.3 B, lane 8) or amino acids 1–739 (lane 4), whereas it bound to constructs lacking amino acids 1–97 (lane 7), 335–1068 (lane 6), or 741–1068 (lane 5). Preparations containing active p110γ were incubated with different volumes of antibody solution to ensure binding of saturating amounts of the mAb to the enzyme. The p110γ-antibody complex was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig.4, upper panels) and subsequently stimulated with Gβγ. As seen in Fig. 4 (lower panel), blocking the p110γ PH domain by the mAb did not prevent Gβγ-mediated stimulation. Conversely, a peptide derived from the adenylyl cyclase 2 (AC2) (amino acids 956–982; Fig.5, upper part) not containing a PH domain did compete with p110γ for the Gβγ complex (41Chen J. DeVivo M.

Increasing concentrations of this peptide completely reversed Gβγ-mediated stimulation of p110γ with an IC50 of 50 μm (see Fig. 5, lower part). The adenylyl cyclase 2 peptide did not change basal activity, and a control peptide derived from the corresponding region of the Gβγ-insensitive adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3) did not compete for the Gβγ-stimulated activity (see Fig. 5).Figure 3Characterization of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to p110γ.

First, to test the specificity of this experimental approach we coexpressed Gβ1γ2 with GST-p110α and GST-p110γ (Fig. 6, center and upper panels). Since Gβγ does not activate p110α it should not copurify with p110α, whereas it should copurify with the Gβγ-activated p110γ. p110 isoforms were isolated from cell homogenates on a glutathione affinity matrix. Subsequently proteins were subjected to SDS gels, and copurified Gβγ complexes were detected by immunoblotting with a Gβ-specific antibody (see Fig. 6, lower panel). This assay revealed that Gβ1γ2 indeed copurified with p110γ, whereas no Gβ immunoreactivity was detected after purification of p110α or GST. Further experiments showed that Gβγ copurified only with membrane-bound p110γ but not with cytosolic p110γ, as could be explained by the membrane association of Gβγ complexes (not shown).Figure 6Copurification of recombinant Gβ1γ2 and GST-tagged PI3K isoforms after coexpression in Sf9 cells.Gβ1γ2 was coexpressed with constructs encoding GST alone or GST fused with p110α or p110γ as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lysates of Sf9 cells (center) were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (top and bottom), separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining (top) and immunoblotting with a Gβ-specific antibody AS 398 (center and bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we coexpressed wild type p110γ or different p110γ mutants as GST fusion proteins together with Gβ1γ2 and studied copurification. As shown in Fig.7, Gβγ copurified with different mutants expressing the N-terminal PH domain (lower panelΔ1–97, lane 5; Δ335–1068, lane 7; Δ741–1068, lane 9), but also with a mutant lacking the PH domain (Δ75–398, lane 6) and with a C-terminal mutant (Δ1–739, lane 8) bearing only the catalytic core of the enzyme. These results indicate that Gβγ specifically interacts with at least two binding sites of p110γ. One binding site is localized N-terminally, whereas the other one is found at the C terminus.Figure 7Copurification of recombinant Gβ1γ2 and GST-tagged p110γ-mutants after coexpression in Sf9 cells.Gβ1γ2 was expressed alone or coexpressed with constructs encoding GST or GST fused with full-length or mutant p110γ.

To support the assumption that Gβγ interacts with two regions of p110γ, we tested whether the inactive N- and C-terminal mutants would compete with wild type p110γ for Gβγ. This was done by coinfecting Sf9 cells with a constant amount of recombinant baculovirus encoding enzymatically active wild type p110γ-GST fusion protein and increasing amounts of viruses encoding the N terminus (Δ741–1068) or the C terminus (Δ1–739) of p110γ as GST fusion proteins. The coexpressed proteins were affinity-purified from Sf9 cytosol on glutathione-Sepharose beads and stimulated by addition of bovine brain Gβγ complexes, and the fold activation of p110γ was calculated. The C-terminal fragment bearing only the catalytic domain of p110γ (Δ1–739) as well as the N terminus of p110γ (Δ741–1068) inhibited Gβγ-mediated stimulation of wild type p110γ in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.8). GST alone did not affect Gβγ-mediated stimulation of p110γ. The enzymatically inactive K799R p110γ point mutant capable of binding to Gβγ (see Fig. 7, lower panel, lane 10) inhibited enzymatic activity to the same extent as the deletion mutants (see Fig. 8). This observation is in accordance with results from the copurification experiments (see above) and underlines the hypothesis that p110γ exhibits two domains interacting with Gβγ. Therefore, we suppose that both the N and C terminus bearing the catalytic domain of p110γ are important for direct interaction with Gβγ.Figure 8Gβγ-stimulated PI3K activity of coexpressed wild type and mutant p110γ in Sf9 cells.Constant amounts of wild type p110γ were coexpressed with increasing amounts of constructs encoding GST, GST fused with a catalytically inactive point mutant (K799R), or inactive N- (Δ1–739) or C-terminally (Δ741–1068) truncated forms of p110γ. The ratios of virus encoding mutant to wild type p110γ are indicated. PI3K activity of GSH-affinity purified cytosolic proteins was determined in the absence and presence of Gβγ (25 nm) and the -fold stimulation calculated. Shown are data from one representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThis study examines the direct interaction between p110γ and Gβγ. We show that the catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ is greatly stimulated by Gβγ in the absence of the recently reported p101 subunit. It extents our previous findings (20Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T.

Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Furthermore, preliminary results employing a purified recombinant heterodimer consisting of p110γ and p101 showed no further increase in PI-3P formation in response to Gβγ compared with p110γ alone. At present there is no conclusive evidence for an essential role of p101 as an adaptor protein linking G protein-coupled receptors and p110γ in a similar way as p85 mediates interaction of p110α with receptor tyrosine kinases (43Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). In addition, the recent observation that Gβγ can bind directly to the related p110β supports an interaction with p110γ as well (10Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino S. Fukui Y. Ui M. Hazeki O. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24252-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in reconstituted neutrophils we recently observed stimulation of p110γ lipid kinase activity by the agonist of the G protein-coupled fMet-Leu-Phe receptor in the absence of p101 (21Kular G. Loubtchenkov M. Swigart P. Whatmore J. Ball A. Cockcroft S. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is the observation that purified recombinant human p110γ degrades rapidly in the absence of p101, this subunit could stabilize the enzymatic activity of p110γ. In addition, p101 could also affect the extent of autophosphorylation of p110γ which may influence Gβγ-mediated activation of PI3Kγ. Furthermore, the possibility th"

Both proteoglycans show saturable, high affinity binding to tenascin-R with apparent dissociation constants in the 2–7 nmrange. Binding is reversible, inhibited in the presence of unlabeled proteoglycan, and increased by ∼60% following chondroitinase treatment of the proteoglycans, indicating that the interactions are mediated via the core (glyco)proteins rather than by the glycosaminoglycan chains, which may in fact partially shield the binding sites. In contrast to their interactions with tenascin-C, in which binding was decreased by ∼75% in the absence of calcium, binding of phosphacan to tenascin-R was not affected by the absence of divalent cations in the binding buffer, although there was a small but significant decrease in the binding of neurocan. Neurocan and phosphacan are also high affinity ligands of amphoterin and HB-GAM (Kd = 0.3–8 nm), two heparin-binding proteins that are developmentally regulated in brain and functionally involved in neurite outgrowth. The chondroitin sulfate chains on neurocan and phosphacan account for at least 80% of their binding to amphoterin and HB-GAM. The presence of amphoterin also produces a 5-fold increase in phosphacan binding to the neural cell adhesion molecule contactin. Immunocytochemical studies showed an overlapping localization of the proteoglycans and their ligands in the embryonic and postnatal brain, retina, and spinal cord. These studies have therefore revealed differences in the interactions of neurocan and phosphacan with the two major members of the tenascin family of extracellular matrix proteins, and also suggest that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans play an important role in the binding and/or presentation of differentiation factors in the developing central nervous system.

In previous studies we have demonstrated that two nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, neurocan and phosphacan, are high affinity ligands of the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C (1Grumet M.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These interactions have dissociation constants in the range of 0.04–3 nm and in many cases are modulated by different types of proteoglycan glycosylation (5Milev P. Maurel P. Häring M. Margolis R.K.

Rauch U. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 273-290PubMed Google Scholar). All of these contain a lectin-like domain in their C-terminal portion, and a recombinant form of the lectin-like domain of versican specifically recognizes tenascin-R in blot overlay binding experiments using brain extracts (12Aspberg A. Binkert C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10590-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Tenascin-R has the same domain structure as tenascin-C and a similarly complex array of biological properties but has a more restricted localization, a different developmental time course, and is synthesized by oligodendrocytes and a subpopulation of neurons rather than predominantly by astroglia (13Schachner M. Taylor J. Bartsch U. Pesheva P. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar, 14Faissner A. Steindler D.

Neurosci. 1996; 14: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).It has also recently been reported that phosphacan is a ligand of the heparin-binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM, 1The abbreviation used is: HB-GAM, heparin-binding growth-associated molecule. 1The abbreviation used is: HB-GAM, heparin-binding growth-associated molecule. also designated pleiotrophin) and that this interaction is mediated in part by the chondroitin sulfate chains of phosphacan (16Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). HB-GAM is an 18-kDa protein that was isolated from rat brain based on its neurite outgrowth promoting activity, and its expression in nervous tissue is developmentally regulated with the highest expression being during the perinatal period (17Rauvala H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). HB-GAM contains a high proportion of basic amino acids, with lysine clusters at the N- and the C-terminal ends of the mature protein. It is homologous to the midkine proteins and the retinoic acid-inducible heparin-binding protein and thus forms a novel family of proteins structurally distinct from the fibroblast growth factors that may play a role in cell differentiation (18Merenmies J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16721-16724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol.

The mitogenic activity of HB-GAM is questionable, and it is also likely that the mitogenic activity reported for pleiotrophin is due to contaminating heparin-binding growth factors (19Raulo E. Julkunen I. Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Amphoterin is another heparin-binding neurite outgrowth-promoting protein with a molecular size of 30 kDa and is prominently expressed in embryonic brain. It is a highly charged molecule, but unlike HB-GAM and basic fibroblast growth factor amphoterin has a dipolar nature, characterized by a 184-amino acid cationic region followed by a cluster of 30 acidic residues. The primary structure of amphoterin is not related to the HB-GAM or fibroblast growth factor families of heparin-binding growth and/or differentiation factors, but amphoterin is homologous to one form of the HMG1-type DNA-binding protein (21Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Laitinen J. Wartiovaara J. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16722-16729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is currently no evidence that amphoterin is involved in cell proliferation, and no enhancing or inhibitory effects were observed in standard mitogenic assays (22Parkkinen J. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Nolo R. Kajander E.O. Baumann M. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19726-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amphoterin has, however, recently been shown to bind specifically to the receptor for advanced glycation end products, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules that is homologous to N-CAM, and amphoterin and the receptor for advanced glycation end products were found to be colocalized in the developing rat brain (23Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M. Lundh E.R. Vijay S. Nitecki D. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25752-25761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Amphoterin has also been isolated recently from developing brain based on its ability to bind to oligosaccharides of sulfoglucuronyl glycolipids (24Nair S.M. Jungalwala F.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1286-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Although neurocan and phosphacan both interact with a number of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins (1Grumet M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15716-15723Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), distinctive properties of each proteoglycan, such as their relative affinity for different ligands, developmentally regulated proteolytic processing, and the effects on binding of chondroitin sulfate and N-linked oligosaccharides, are all capable of specifically modulating their interactions at different sites and periods with cell surface and extracellular matrix proteins (5Milev P.

In view of our previous demonstration of high affinity binding of neurocan and phosphacan to tenascin-C (1Grumet M. Milev P. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Bourdon M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12142-12146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Milev P. Fischer D. Häring M. Schulthess T. Margolis R.K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15501-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we have now studied the interactions of these two proteoglycans with the closely related molecule tenascin-R. The recent report of binding of HB-GAM/pleiotrophin to phosphacan (16Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) has also prompted us to compare its interactions with both neurocan and phosphacan and to examine their interactions with the related differentiation factor, amphoterin, on the premise that these proteins may also participate in proteoglycan-mediated regulation of cell adhesion, neurite growth, and cell migration during central nervous system development. An unexpected result of these studies is that although heparan sulfate proteoglycans are well known to bind and function as coreceptors for several polypeptide factors that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, we find that certain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans bind proteins such as amphoterin and HB-GAM with high affinity and must therefore also be considered in terms of their ability to present growth and differentiation factors during nervous tissue development.DISCUSSIONEarlier studies have shown that neurocan and phosphacan bind to the greatest extent and with the highest affinities to a variety of immunoglobulin superfamily neural cell adhesion molecules, including Ng-CAM/L1, N-CAM, Nr-CAM, and TAG-1/axonin-1 (3Friedlander D. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 4Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15716-15723Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Binding to these proteins usually amounts to 35–40% of the input radioactivity in radioligand binding assays (Fig. 11), with apparent dissociation constants in the subnanomolar range. There is also detectable but considerably less binding of neurocan and phosphacan to contactin, whereas no binding was observed to two other immunoglobulin superfamily neural cell adhesion molecules, the myelin-associated glycoprotein and neurotrimin. Other high affinity ligands of these proteoglycans are tenascin-C (1Grumet M. Milev P. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Bourdon M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12142-12146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Milev P. Fischer D. Häring M. Schulthess T. Margolis R.K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15501-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and tenascin-R, as described in this report. Binding of neurocan and phosphacan to both tenascins has the same apparent Kd of ∼3 nm, but the affinities and the percent of the input protein that is bound are significantly less than the corresponding values determined for their interactions with neural cell adhesion molecules. However, the neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascins represent the major ligands that have been identified up to now, insofar as no significant binding was observed to a number of other cell surface and extracellular matrix proteins such as N-cadherin, fibronectin, vitronectin, merosin, thrombospondin, the epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor receptors, and (at least in the case of phosphacan) collagens I–VI and laminin (Fig. 11).Using an affinity matrix containing the N-terminal cysteine-rich sequence and the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of tenascin-R expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein, Xiao et al. (37Xiao Z.-C. Bartsch U. Margolis R.K. Rougon G. Montag D. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32092-32101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have isolated from a mouse brain extract a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with biochemical and immunochemical properties resembling those of phosphacan. Although binding to the epidermal growth factor-like domain was calcium-dependent, in the present study the absence of calcium had no significant effect on the binding of phosphacan to native tenascin-R. These results with respect to tenascin-R differ from those previously obtained for both phosphacan and neurocan binding to tenascin-C, in which binding was decreased by ∼75% in the absence of calcium and magnesium (2Milev P. Fischer D. Häring M. Schulthess T. Margolis R.K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15501-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Milev P. Meyer-Puttlitz B. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24650-24653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The involvement of the epidermal growth factor-like domain in the binding of phosphacan to tenascin-R also differs from the situation with respect to phosphacan and neurocan interactions with tenascin-C, where binding is mediated by the fibrinogen-like globe, and in the case of neurocan is also influenced by the presence or absence of the adjacent fibronectin type III repeats (2Milev P. Fischer D. Häring M. Schulthess T. Margolis R.K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15501-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, because there is only ∼62% amino acid sequence identity in the fibrinogen-like domains of tenascin-C and tenascin-R, this domain of tenascin-R may not have the same binding properties as the fibrinogen globe of tenascin-C. It has also recently been found that the C-terminal half of neurocan binds to fibronectin type III repeats 4 and 5 of tenascin-C (39Rauch U. Clement A. Retzler C. Fröhlich L. Fässler R. Göhring W. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26905-26912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and that recombinant forms of the lectin-like domains of brevican and the other hyaluronan-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans interact with fibronectin type III repeats 3–5 of tenascin-R (40Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), with dissociation constants varying from 1 nm (brevican) to 31 nm (neurocan). These findings suggest that two binding sites, in the N- and C-terminal portions of neurocan, are involved in its interactions with tenascin-C and tenascin-R and that high affinity binding requires the presence of both sites in the full-length proteoglycan core protein.The highest level of binding that we have observed with neurocan and phosphacan (60–80% of input radioactivity) was seen with HB-GAM and amphoterin, which are relatively low molecular size basic proteins that are known to bind to heparin and that have neurite outgrowth-promoting activity. Almost all of this binding activity (>80%) was abolished by chondroitinase treatment to remove the glycosaminoglycan chains, indicating that chondroitin sulfate is the major mediator of their binding to these proteins.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) found that chondroitinase treatment of 125I-labeled phosphacan reduced its binding to HB-GAM by only 40%, a result that might be due to the different procedures used for iodination of phosphacan or to differences in the phosphacan preparations, binding assays, the completeness of chondroitinase digestion, or in the source of HB-GAM. These investigators also reported that their Scatchard analysis of phosphacan binding to HB-GAM indicated the presence of two binding sites with different affinities and that chondroitin 6-sulfate was a much more potent inhibitor of binding than chondroitin 4-sulfate. In view of our previous demonstration of developmental changes in the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate chains on phosphacan (25Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they suggested that this developmental change in sulfation may modulate phosphacan binding to HB-GAM. However, saturation curves and Scatchard analysis of the binding of phosphacan from 7-day postnatal brain (containing 67% chondroitin 4-sulfate and 33% chondroitin 6-sulfate) showed no significant difference in affinity as compared with the binding of phosphacan isolated from adult brain, containing 96% chondroitin 4-sulfate and <4% chondroitin 6-sulfate (data not shown).Although visual inspection of our Scatchard plot of phosphacan/HB-GAM interactions (Fig. 7) suggests the possibility of two binding sites, the data analysis program that we used (31Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar), in which the parameters are estimated by means of a weighted nonlinear least squares algorithm, does not accept a model with two binding sites. However, linear curve fitting using the Deltagraph program (DeltaPoint Inc., Monterey, CA) yielded dissociation constants of 0.12 and 3.6 nm, which are very similar to the values of 0.25 and 3 nm reported by Maeda et al. (16Maeda N. Nishiwaki T. Shintani T. Hamanaka H. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) for the binding of phosphacan from 16 day postnatal brain to HB-GAM. Linear curve fitting was also performed for the interactions of neurocan and phosphacan with tenascin-R (Fig. 3). In these cases also the Ligand program did not accept a model with two binding sites, but using Deltagraph dissociation constants of 0.97 and 10.5 nm could be calculated for the neurocan/tenascin-R interaction and 0.35 and 4.3 nm for binding of phosphacan to tenascin-R. Whether one considers the one- or the two-component model most reliable, it is clear from our data that the binding is of high affinity, with dissociation constants in the 0.1 to 10 nm range.In all cases we found that there is an overlapping localization in the central nervous system of neurocan and phosphacan with tenascin-R, amphoterin, and HB-GAM, which fulfills a basic condition for the biological significance of their high affinity interactions demonstrated in radioligand binding assays.Our previous studies have demonstrated the interactions of neurocan and phosphacan with several neural cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteins (1Grumet M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21446-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and the present study now identify a new class of ligands for neurocan and phosphacan which shares a high affinity for heparin and promotes neurite outgrowth. HB-GAM and amphoterin are small proteins that are rich in basic amino acids, and although they lack the modular organization of the neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascins, they are associated with the extracellular matrix of nervous tissue where they are thought to be involved in developmental and regenerative processes and in neurite growth. Because amphoterin forms dimers and possibly higher oligomers under physiological conditions (38Rauvala H. Pihlaskari R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16625-16635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and produces a 5-fold increase in the binding of phosphacan to contactin (Fig. 9), it is possible that it may serve to link phosphacan in the extracellular matrix, or the transmembrane phosphatase on adjacent cells, to cell surface glycoproteins such as contactin to which phosphacan alone binds only minimally.The result of neurocan and phosphacan interactions with amphoterin and HB-GAM is, however, likely to differ in most respects from the consequences of proteoglycan binding to neural cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during nervous tissue histogenesis. Rather, it is more probable that by virtue of their ability to bind amphoterin and HB-GAM, neurocan, and/or phosphacan may be involved in the storage, release, or presentation of these differentiation factors to cells in a process analogous to that whereby heparan sulfate proteoglycans mediate the actions of basic fibroblast growth factor. Although most studies of growth factor interactions with proteoglycans have concerned heparan sulfate proteoglycans and more specifically their glycosaminoglycan chains, it would appear that the interactions of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans with differentiation factors may also play a significant role in developmental processes. In previous studies we have demonstrated that two nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, neurocan and phosphacan, are high affinity ligands of the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C (1Grumet M.

Key events leading to these processes are migration and proliferation of these cells. Here, we demonstrate that GAS6, encoded by the growth arrest-specific gene 6, induces a directed migration (chemotaxis) of both rat and human primary vascular smooth muscle cells while showing only marginal mitogenic potential in human vascular smooth muscle cells. GAS6 stimulation induces Axl autophosphorylation in human vascular smooth muscle cells, indicating that specific GAS6-Axl interactions may be associated with GAS6-directed chemotaxis. To test this hypothesis, vascular smooth muscle cells overexpressing Axl were generated by gene transfer and assessed for their ability to migrate along a GAS6 gradient. These Axl overexpressors exhibited 2–5-fold increased sensitivity to GAS6-induced chemotaxis. Furthermore, vascular smooth muscle cells expressing the kinase dead mutant of Axl or exposure to the soluble Axl extracellular domain showed attenuated GAS6-induced migration. Taken together, these results suggest that GAS6 is a novel chemoattractant that induces Axl-mediated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. The separation of mitogenesis from migration provided by this study may enhance the molecular dissection of cell migration in vascular damage.

The separation of mitogenesis from migration provided by this study may enhance the molecular dissection of cell migration in vascular damage. Atherosclerosis and arterial restenosis is a consequence of accumulation of connective tissue in conjunction with proliferation and directed migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells;ECD, extracellular domain; AoSMC, aortic smooth muscle cells; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor. 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells;ECD, extracellular domain; AoSMC, aortic smooth muscle cells; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor.

To evaluate potential in vivo effects of proliferation and directed migration of VSMC following treatment of agonists or growth factors, primary, cultured VSMC have proven to be an excellent in vitro model system.In cultured rat VSMC, GAS6, encoded by the growth arrest-specific gene 6 (gas6), was identified and characterized as an important growth-potentiating factor whose expression is up-regulated after serum starvation (2Nakano T.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). GAS6 possesses a 44% sequence identity with protein S, an anti-coagulation factor (4Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In quiescent VSMC, GAS6 stimulation specifically potentiates proliferation induced by Ca2+-mobilizing receptors indicating that GAS6 may be involved in regulating signaling pathways mediated by heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein-coupled receptors. GAS6 alone, however, is able to prevent growth arrest-induced apoptosis in these cells (5Nakano T. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have identified GAS6 to be the ligand for Axl, a member of a tyrosine kinase receptor family whose extracellular domains resemble cell adhesion molecules (6Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliot G. Garcia A.

It was subsequently demonstrated that GAS6 is also a ligand for Sky, an Axl-related receptor tyrosine kinase (14Godowski P.J. Mark M.R. Chen J. Sadick M.D. Raab H. Hammonds R.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Ohashi K. Nataga K. Toshima J. Nakano T. Arita H. Tsuda H. Suzuki K. Mizuno K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9785-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, it was recently shown that GAS6 may be the ligand for another Axl family member, Mer, although the affinity of the GAS6-Mer interaction is much lower than that for Axl and Sky (17Nagata K. Ohashi K. Nakano T. Arita H. Zong C. Hanafusa H. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30022-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In rat VSMC, a high affinity, specific binding site for GAS6 was characterized and the molecular weight of the cross-linked complex coincided with that of the Axl·GAS6 complex (18Nakano T. Kishino J. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In support of the hypothesis that the GAS6/Axl pathway is involved in G protein receptor-mediated signaling events is recent evidence indicating that Axl expression is up-regulated by G protein-coupled receptor agonists both in cultured VSMC and in vivo following balloon injury. 2M. G. Melaragno, D. A. Wuthrich, V. Poppa, B. C. Berk, and M. A. Corson, submitted for publication. 2M. G. Melaragno, D. A. Wuthrich, V. Poppa, B. C. Berk, and M. A. Corson, submitted for publication. Thus, these results suggest that GAS6 may be important in VSMC biology and may involve signaling by its receptor, Axl, in conjunction with G protein receptor-mediated signaling pathways.In addition to its biological implications in cultured VSMC, the function of GAS6 has been investigated in several other cell systems. In 3T3 cells, it was shown that GAS6 mediates both mitogenic and survival activities through ARK, the murine homologue of Axl (20Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 471-480PubMed Google Scholar, 21Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4442-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This mitogenic effect is also observed in cultured human Schwann cells where GAS6 is found to stimulate DNA synthesis in these cells (22Li R. Chen J. Hammonds G. Phillips H. Armanini M. Wood P. Bunge R. Godowski P.J. Sliwkowski M.X. Mather J.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, in murine hematopoietic 32D cells, we have demonstrated that exogenous GAS6 stimulation results in Axl autophosphorylation but no mitogenic or anti-apoptotic responses (23Fridell Y.-W. Jin Y. Quilliam L.A. Burchert A. McCloskey P. Spizz G. Varnum B. Der C. Liu E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In these cells, GAS6 promotes Axl-mediated adhesion, suggesting adhesion as one function for the GAS6-Axl interaction (24McCloskey P. Fridell Y.-W. Attar E. Villa J. Jin Y. Varnum B. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23285-23291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, the GAS6-associated biology appears complex and may be dependent upon the cellular context in which Axl and GAS6 operate.In light of the findings that GAS6 appears important in the growth regulation of VSMC, we sought to investigate the effect of Axl-GAS6 interactions on other biological consequences in these cells. Here, we describe that in both rat and human primary VSMC, GAS6 can act as a chemoattractant for migration in modified Boyden chambers (25Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 26Pauly R.R. Passaniti A. Bilato C. Monticone R. Cheng L. Papadopoulos N. Gluzband Y.A. Smith L. Weinstein C. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The chemotactic nature of the GAS6-induced migration is evidenced in that a GAS6 gradient is necessary for this action. The specificity of GAS6-induced migration was further confirmed in that addition of purified Axl extracellular domain (ECD) attenuates migration. In agreement with previous studies in rat VSMC, GAS6 alone does not induce proliferation of human AoSMC (aortic smooth muscle cells). However, in response to GAS6, human AoSMC overexpressing Axl augment cell migration whereas ectopic expression of the Axl kinase dead mutant reduces the ligand-associated migration. Thus, these results strongly suggest that GAS6-Axl interactions induce chemotaxis of VSMC.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDirected migration of VSMC from tunica media to intima and subsequent proliferation of neointima are two key events involved in atherogenesis following both the mechanical injury and inflammatory responses of the arteries (28Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Graves L.M. Skinner M.P. Krebs E.G. Ross R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 416-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Ross R. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 527-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given the findings that GAS6 may play a role as a cofactor in proliferation for rat VSMC, we wished to investigate whether GAS6 also possessed chemotactic properties in these cells. To examine whether GAS6 could induce chemotaxis of VSMC, migration assays in modified Boyden chambers were conducted (Refs. 25Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholarand 26Pauly R.R. Passaniti A. Bilato C. Monticone R. Cheng L. Papadopoulos N. Gluzband Y.A. Smith L. Weinstein C. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, also see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.1 A, human recombinant GAS6 induced chemotaxis of rat VSMC at approximately 6-fold greater than controls. A dose-response experiment showed that 200 ng/ml GAS6 induced the maximal level of migration, a concentration of GAS6 comparable to that observed for inducing maximal Axl autophosphorylation (data not shown) (6Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliot G. Garcia A. Bartley T.D. Fridell Y.W. Hunt R.W. Trail G. Clogston C. Toso R.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In comparison, PDGF-BB, the most potent chemoattractant for VSMC described to date, induced chemotaxis of these cells 4–5-fold greater than that induced by GAS6 (Fig. 1 A) (19Jawien A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Lindner V. Schwartz S.M. Clowes A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 28Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Graves L.M. Skinner M.P. Krebs E.G. Ross R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 416-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The chemotactic but not chemokinetic effect of GAS6 on these cells was evidenced by the fact that a GAS6 gradient induced directed migration. When the same concentration of GAS6 was included in both upper and lower wells of the chambers, migration of these cells was reduced to one-third to one-half of that seen when gradients were maintained (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, this effect can be attenuated by the addition of soluble, recombinant Axl extracellular domain protein (Axl-ECD) at a 1:1 molar ratio in the lower well of the chambers indicating that GAS6 serves as the signal for chemotaxis of these cells (6Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliot G. Garcia A. Bartley T.D. Fridell Y.W. Hunt R.W. Trail G. Clogston C. Toso R.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 24McCloskey P. Fridell Y.-W. Attar E. Villa J. Jin Y. Varnum B. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23285-23291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).To verify that the chemotactic effect induced by human GAS6 in rat VSMC is physiologically relevant, we investigated whether human recombinant GAS6 would induce directed migration of primary human AoSMC in a similar fashion. As expected, human AoSMC migrated in response to GAS6 in the same manner as observed in rat VSMC (Fig. 1 B). Chemotaxis of these cells toward GAS6 was dependent upon the presence of a GAS6 concentration gradient between the upper and lower wells of the modified Boyen chamber (Fig. 1 B). Again, GAS6-induced chemotaxis was reduced by the presence of purified Axl-ECD. Finally, epidermal growth factor, a known mitogen for VSMC that has no chemoattractant properties showed no effect in inducing migration of these cells demonstrating that mitogenicity and cell migration can be separated by these in vitro assays (Fig. 1 B). Thus, GAS6 functions as a chemoattractant for VSMC migration in vitro.To determine if GAS6 alone can act as a mitogen in human AoSMC, DNA synthesis was measured in these cells following GAS6 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2, marginal mitogenic effects were detected in quiescent cells when stimulated with GAS6 (1.5-fold increase as compared with control) whereas PDGF-BB treatment induced potent mitogenesis of these cells (Fig. 2). Although previous studies indicated that GAS6 potentiates a 2-fold increase in proliferation of rat VSMC in the presence of thrombin, we did not observe such an increase in cultured human AoSMC using human GAS6 under the same conditions (data not shown) (2Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that the primary function of human GAS6 in vivo is to induce migration of AoSMC without stimulating proliferation of these cells.Figure 2GAS6 does not induce mitogenesis in human AoSMC. In 24-well plates, confluent human VSMC were rendered quiescent after incubation in DMEM-H for 48 h. For ligand stimulation, fresh DMEM-H containing BSA (200 ng/ml), GAS6 (200 ng/ml), or PDGF (50 ng/ml) was added to each well. At the indicated times, cells were pulsed with 1.5 μCi/well [3H]thymidine for 4 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We sought to identify specific ligand-receptor interactions responsible for GAS6-induced VSMC migration. Following GAS6 stimulation, Axl-specific antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate lysates from quiescent AoSMC. As shown in Fig. 3, when probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, GAS6 stimulation resulted in Axl autophosphorylation. Thus, GAS6-Axl interactions may be associated with GAS6-induced migration of human AoSMC. Several attempts were made to determine the phosphorylation status of Mer and Sky following GAS6 stimulation in AoSMC. However, due to the lack of suitable Mer and Sky antibodies for these analyses, the exact involvement of these two receptor kinases in this process remains to be determined. To further test the hypothesis that Axl mediates GAS6-induced AoSMC migration, primary human AoSMC ectopically expressing Axl were generated.3 Migration assays were then performed to assess the ability of these Axl-expressing cells to migrate in the presence of GAS6 in the lower well of the modified Boyden chamber (25Bornfeldt K.E.

Two AoSM cell lines overexpressing the wild-type Axl were generated. As demonstrated in Fig.4 A, Axl/AoSMC expressed moderately higher Axl than the parental cells whereas a dramatic overexpression of Axl was achieved in 1B1/AoSMC.3 When tested for migration, moderate Axl-overexpressors (Axl/AoSMC) exhibited a 2.5–3-fold increase in GAS6-dependent migration as compared with parental AoSMC (Fig. 4 B). By contrast, 1B1/AoSMC demonstrated a further increase (up to 5-fold) in numbers of migrated cells as compared with parental AoSMC in response to GAS6 (Fig. 4 B). In addition, the increased migration seen in Axl-overexpressing AoSMC was again attenuated by the application of the Axl-ECD in the lower well of the chambers (data not shown). To further confirm the direct involvement of Axl in this process, AoSMC expressing the kinase dead mutant of Axl (AxlK567R) were generated (Fig.4 A) (24McCloskey P. Fridell Y.-W. Attar E. Villa J. Jin Y. Varnum B. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23285-23291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Significantly, when tested for chemotaxis, these cells exhibited reduced migration in response to GAS6 as compared with the uninfected parental AoSMC (Fig. 4 B). In the same assays, the parental AoSMC and the ectopic Axl-expressing AoSM cells had identical migratory responses to PDGF-BB, indicating the specificity of Axl-dependent effects on migration in these cell lines (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that the Axl receptor mediates GAS6-induced migration of AoSMC in vitro and that the kinase activity of the Axl receptor is involved in migration in response to GAS6. Furthermore, the fact that AxlK567R bearing AoSM cells showed reduced levels of GAS6-induced migration suggests that other Axl-related tyrosine kinase receptors may not be playing a significant role in this process.Figure 3Axl phosphorylation in response to exogenous GAS6 stimulation in human AoSMC. Primary human AoSMC were mock stimulated (−), stimulated with 1 × GAS6 (200 ng/ml) or 2 × GAS6 (400 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Axl polyclonal antibody at 1:250. Subsequent Western blotting analysis with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody at 1:1000 (PT-66, Sigma) was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Molecular weight markers are indicated. The position of the p140 Axl is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Ectopic expression of wild-type and the kinase dead mutant of Axl in human AoSMC (A) and migration assays (B) of these cells. A, 100 μg of total protein from each cell line was separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis with anti-Axl antibody (1:1000) was performed. AxlK567R is the kinase dead Axl mutant. Axlcontains the wild-type Axl cDNA sequence. 1B1 construct containing a wild-type Axl cDNA sequence overexpresses the Axl protein. B, for migration assays, modified Boyden chambers were assembled by adding either BSA (200 ng/ml) or human recombinant GAS6 (200 ng/ml) in DMEM-H to the lower well of the chambers. Filters were coated with collagen I and then placed in the apparatus. Fifty thousand cells resuspended in DMEM-H were then added to the upper well of the chamber. Following 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed, stained, and counted at × 100–200 magnification. Each bar represents the average (±S.D.) fold increase in migration (subtracted from migration of parental AoSMC) as determined from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Melaragno and co-workers recently showed an up-regulation of Axl expression 7–14 days following balloon injury of rat carotid arteries.2 This increased Axl expression correlates well with the time course of neointima thickening due to medial VSMC migration post-injury (29Ross R. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 527-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the immunohistochemical staining of injured vessels showed increased Axl expression localized to the neointima.2 Northern blot analysis on denuded vessels following balloon injury of rat carotid arteries has revealed an increase of GAS6 transcripts in these tissues. 4V. Lindner, personal communication. In light of these findings, we suggest the following hypothesis for Axl and GAS6 involvement in response to arterial injury: following arterial injury, increased local GAS6 concentration permits formation of GAS6 gradient. This gradient may then induce the migration of medial smooth muscle cells to the intima. The subsequent up-regulation of Axl expression post-injury, perhaps influenced by G protein-coupled agonists on site, thus renders VSMC more sensitive to GAS6 for proliferation. These processes may, in turn, contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation and arterial restenosis.In summary, we have uncovered a novel function for human recombinant GAS6 as a chemoattractant in cultured rat and human VSMC. Significantly, we have demonstrated that GAS6-induced migration appears to be mediated by its receptor, Axl. Further insights into atherogenesis can be gained by determining the signaling pathways activated by GAS6-Axl interactions in these cells. Thus, interventions may be devised to block specific downstream effectors following Axl activation to alleviate the consequences of vascular damage. Atherosclerosis and arterial restenosis is a consequence of accumulation of connective tissue in conjunction with proliferation and directed migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells;ECD, extracellular domain; AoSMC, aortic smooth muscle cells; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor. 1The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells;ECD, extracellular domain; AoSMC, aortic smooth muscle cells; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor.

To evaluate potential in vivo effects of proliferation and directed migration of VSMC following treatment of agonists or growth factors, primary, cultured VSMC have proven to be an excellent in vitro model system. In cultured rat VSMC, GAS6, encoded by the growth arrest-specific gene 6 (gas6), was identified and characterized as an important growth-potentiating factor whose expression is up-regulated after serum starvation (2Nakano T.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). GAS6 possesses a 44% sequence identity with protein S, an anti-coagulation factor (4Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In quiescent VSMC, GAS6 stimulation specifically potentiates proliferation induced by Ca2+-mobilizing receptors indicating that GAS6 may be involved in regulating signaling pathways mediated by heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein-coupled receptors. GAS6 alone, however, is able to prevent growth arrest-induced apoptosis in these cells (5Nakano T. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have identified GAS6 to be the ligand for Axl, a member of a tyrosine kinase receptor family whose extracellular domains resemble cell adhesion molecules (6Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliot G. Garcia A.

It was subsequently demonstrated that GAS6 is also a ligand for Sky, an Axl-related receptor tyrosine kinase (14Godowski P.J. Mark M.R. Chen J. Sadick M.D. Raab H. Hammonds R.G.

In addition, it was recently shown that GAS6 may be the ligand for another Axl family member, Mer, although the affinity of the GAS6-Mer interaction is much lower than that for Axl and Sky (17Nagata K. Ohashi K. Nakano T. Arita H. Zong C. Hanafusa H. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30022-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In rat VSMC, a high affinity, specific binding site for GAS6 was characterized and the molecular weight of the cross-linked complex coincided with that of the Axl·GAS6 complex (18Nakano T. Kishino J. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In support of the hypothesis that the GAS6/Axl pathway is involved in G protein receptor-mediated signaling events is recent evidence indicating that Axl expression is up-regulated by G protein-coupled receptor agonists both in cultured VSMC and in vivo following balloon injury. 2M. G. Melaragno, D. A. Wuthrich, V. Poppa, B. C. Berk, and M. A. Corson, submitted for publication. 2M. G. Melaragno, D. A. Wuthrich, V. Poppa, B. C. Berk, and M. A. Corson, submitted for publication. Thus, these results suggest that GAS6 may be important in VSMC biology and may involve signaling by its receptor, Axl, in conjunction with G protein receptor-mediated signaling pathways. In addition to its biological implications in cultured VSMC, the function of GAS6 has been investigated in several other cell systems. In 3T3 cells, it was shown that GAS6 mediates both mitogenic and survival activities through ARK, the murine homologue of Axl (20Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 471-480PubMed Google Scholar, 21Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4442-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This mitogenic effect is also observed in cultured human Schwann cells where GAS6 is found to stimulate DNA synthesis in these cells (22Li R. Chen J. Hammonds G. Phillips H. Armanini M. Wood P. Bunge R. Godowski P.J. Sliwkowski M.X. Mather J.P. J. Neurosci. 199"
https://openalex.org/W2014881508,"We examined the DNA binding activity of mouse and human MTF-1 in whole cell extracts from cells cultured in medium containing zinc or cadmium and from untreated cells after the in vitro addition of zinc or cadmium, as well as using recombinant MTF-1 transcribed and translated in vitro and treated with various transition metals. Incubation of human (HeLa) or mouse (Hepa) cells in medium containing cadmium (5–15 μm) did not lead to a significant increase (<2-fold) in the amount of MTF-1 DNA binding activity, whereas zinc (100 μm) led to a 6–15-fold increase within 1 h. MTF-1 binding activity was low, but detectable, in control whole cell extracts and was increased (>10-fold) after the in vitroaddition of zinc (30 μm) and incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. In contrast, addition of cadmium (6 or 60 μm) did not activate MTF-1 binding activity. Recombinant mouse and human MTF-1 were also dependent on exogenous zinc for DNA binding activity. Cadmium did not facilitate activation of recombinant MTF-1, but instead inhibited the activation of the recombinant protein by zinc. Interestingly, glutathione (1 mm) protected recombinant MTF-1 from inactivation by cadmium, and allowed for activation by zinc. It was also noted that zinc-activated recombinant MTF-1 was protected from cadmium only when bound to DNA. These results suggest that cadmium interacts with the zinc fingers of MTF-1 and forms an inactive complex. Of the several transition metals (zinc, cadmium, nickel, silver, copper, and cobalt) examined, only zinc facilitated activation of the DNA binding activity of recombinant MTF-1. These data suggest that transition metals, other than zinc, that activate MT gene expression may do so by mechanisms independent of an increase in the DNA binding activity of MTF-1.

Metallothioneins (MT) 1The abbreviations used are: MT, metallothionein; MRE, metal response element; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. constitute a conserved family of cysteine-rich heavy metal-binding proteins (1Kagi J.H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 205: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In the mouse, MT-I and MT-II display a wide tissue distribution and have been demonstrated to participate in detoxification of transition metals such as cadmium (2Masters B.A. Kelly E.J. Quaife C.J.

MT-I and MT-II gene transcription is induced dramatically by heavy metals (especially zinc and cadmium) (6Andrews G.K. Prog. Food Nutr. Sci. 1990; 14: 193-258PubMed Google Scholar). Metal response elements (MRE) are essential for this induction, and these elements are present in multiple copies in the proximal promoters of MT genes. MREs were initially shown to mediate transcriptional response of MT genes to zinc and cadmium (7Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Chen H.Y. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A protein that binds specifically to MREs and that transactivates MT gene expression has been cloned from mouse and human, and is termed MTF-1 (MRE-binding transcription factor-1) (12Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13Brugnera E. Georgiev O. Radtke F. Heuchel R. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3167-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). MTF-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor in the Cys2His2family. The DNA binding activity of MTF-1 is reversibly regulated by zinc interactions with the zinc finger domain (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast with some zinc finger proteins, including zinc finger transcription factors, which can bind zinc with picomolar to nanomolar disassociation constants (15Shi Y. Beger R.D. Berg J.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 749-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Berg J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6513-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MTF-1 is regulated by micromolar concentrations of this metal. Thus, MTF-1 may serve as a sensor for “free” zinc within the cell. Manipulation of MTF-1 expression by targeted deletion of both genes in embryonic stem cells (17Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) or by expression of antisense MTF-1 (18Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) eliminates metal responsiveness of transfected MRE-driven reporter genes. Thus, MTF-1 is thought to be essential for activation of MRE activity by all of the transition metals that have been examined. Although MTF-1 may play a role in activating MT gene expression in response to several transition metals, the nature of the interaction between MTF-1 and metals other than zinc has not been examined. To clarify the mechanisms of activation of MTF-1 by transition metals, we examined the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 in vivo in cells treated with cadmium, and we utilized whole cell extracts prepared from mouse and human cells and recombinant mouse and human MTF-1, transcribed and translated in vitro, to study effects of transition metals on MTF-1 DNA binding activity. We found that MTF-1 DNA binding activity is poorly activated in vivo by cadmium, and that it is activated in vitro by zinc but not by any of the other transition metals tested. These data suggest that transition metals, other than zinc, activate MT gene expression through mechanisms independent of a significant increase in DNA binding activity of MTF-1. Mouse Hepa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and canine Madin-Darby kidney cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (19Zimarino V. Wu C. Nature. 1987; 327: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), with modifications (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D.

The supernatant was collected and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) using rabbit IgG as a standard. The mouse MTF-1 cDNA clone was described previously (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell.

Human MTF-1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using flanking primers and subcloned into the XbaI site of the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen Corp., Palo Alto, CA). Recombinant MTF-1 was synthesized in vitro using a TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Transcription/Translation System (Promega Biotech), containing 1 μg of the MTF-1 plasmid and Sp6 (mouse MTF-1) or T7 (human MTF-1) RNA polymerase according to the manufacturers' suggestions. EMSA was performed as described (11Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Proteins from whole cell extracts (20 μg) or the MTF-1 in vitro transcription/translation reaction (1 μl of a 50-μl reaction) were incubated in buffer containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 12% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μg of poly(dI·dC)/μg of protein, 2–4 fmol of end-labeled MRE-s double-stranded oligonucleotide (5000 cpm/fmol) in a total volume of 20 μl (20Fried M.G.

ZnSO4, CdCl2, CoCl2, CuSO4, NiCl2, AgNO3, were dissolved in acidified H2O as 1000 times concentrated stock solutions.

Protein-DNA complexes were separated at 4 °C using 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 80:1) electrophoresis (PAGE) at 15 V/Cm. The gel was polymerized and run in buffer consisting of 0.19 m glycine (pH 8.5), 25 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and labeled complexes were detected by autoradiography. MTF-1 binding activity was examined in whole cell and nuclear extracts by EMSA using a consensus MRE oligonucleotide (MRE-s) that has a specific, high affinity MTF-1-binding site (12Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have established that MTF-1 is a component of the complex formed with MRE-s in whole cell and nuclear extracts (11Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and is restored after transfection with a mouse MTF-1 expression plasmid (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The mobility shift, sequence specificity, and zinc dependence of this complex are indistinguishable from that of recombinant MTF-1. Our previous studies documented that the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 is positively regulated both in vivo and in vitroby zinc. In contrast, the effects of other transition metals on the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 have not been examined. A modest activation (<2-fold) of MTF-1 binding activity was detected in whole cell extracts from Hepa cells incubated in medium containing 6 or 60 μm cadmium (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cadmium is a 5–10-fold more potent inducer of MT mRNA than zinc (23Wan M. Hunziker P.E. Kägi J.H.R. Biochem.

Andrews G.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5016-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from mouse Hepa and human HeLa cells incubated for 1 h in medium containing zinc (60 μm) or cadmium (6 μm) were analyzed for MTF-1 binding activity using EMSA (Fig.1 A). MTF-1 binding activity was low, but detectable, in untreated Hepa and HeLa cells, and increased 15- and 6-fold, respectively, after zinc treatment, but <2-fold in response to cadmium. Sp1 binding activity was unaffected by zinc or cadmium treatment of these cell lines (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, addition of zinc (30 μm) to the whole cell extracts from cadmium-treated cells resulted in a temperature dependent activation of MTF-1 binding activity, which demonstrated that MTF-1 was recovered from the cadmium-treated cells (data not shown). We also noted that zinc, but not cadmium resulted in increased MTF-1 binding activity in nuclear extracts from HeLa and Hepa cells (data not shown). Thus, zinc but not cadmium, in concentrations that dramatically activate MT gene expression, leads to a rapid increase in MTF-1 binding activity in vivo. MTF-1 binding activity can be dramatically increased in vitro by the addition of low micromolar concentrations of zinc to whole cell extracts from control (untreated) cells (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This activation process is time and temperature dependent and is maximal in whole cell extracts containing exogenous zinc (30 μm) after incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. The effects of cadmium on the binding activity of MTF-1 were examined using whole cell extracts from untreated Hepa, HeLa, and canine Madin-Darby kidney cells (Fig.2 A). The indicated concentrations of zinc and/or cadmium were added to the EMSA binding reactions, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before addition of labeled MRE-s and subsequent electrophoresis. Under these conditions, cadmium, even at high (60 μm) concentration, had no effect on MTF-1 binding activity. In contrast, as little as 2 μm zinc caused a detectable activation of MTF-1 and 30 μm zinc resulted in a >10-fold activation. Furthermore, cadmium did not appreciably effect the ability of zinc to activate MTF-1 in vitro in these whole cell extracts discounting the possibility that cadmium irreversibly denatures MTF-1 (Fig. 2 A). In vitro activation of MTF-1 by zinc is temperature sensitive, so we examined the effects of temperature on cadmium (6 μm) activation of MTF-1 binding activity (Fig.2 B). Again, cadmium failed to cause activation of MTF-1 in Hepa whole cell extracts, regardless of the incubation temperature examined (4–37 °C). Remarkably, cadmium did not reduce the constitutive Sp1 binding activity in these same whole cell extracts (Fig. 2 C). The effects of zinc and cadmium on mouse and human MTF-1 binding activity were examined using recombinant MTF-1 produced in a coupled transcription/translation system (TnT lysate). As reported previously (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), mouse MTF-1 synthesized in the TnT reaction exhibits little or no DNA binding activity before the addition of exogenous zinc (30 μm) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. This was also the case for human MTF-1, and half-maximal activation of recombinant mouse and human MTF-1 required 2–3 μm zinc under these conditions (Fig.3 A). In contrast, cadmium (3 μm) did not lead to activation of MTF-1, nor did it inhibit the ability of zinc to activate this DNA binding activity (Fig.3 B, data for mouse MTF-1 are shown). However, it was noted that activation of recombinant MTF-1 by zinc (30 μm) was reduced by 60% when 6 μm cadmium was included during the activation process (37 °C for 15 min) (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). Higher concentrations of cadmium (30 μm) completely prevented zinc activation of MTF-1 (Fig. 3 D, lanes 4 and 5). Similar results were obtained using recombinant human MTF-1 (data not shown). The TnT lysate contains 18.8 ± 3.7 μm total zinc (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, these EMSA reactions contained about 2 μm zinc. If cadmium had caused the redistribution of this zinc, then the MTF-1 binding activity would have been half-maximal. Effects of cadmium on recombinant MTF-1 that had been previously activated with zinc were examined. Zinc-activated mouse MTF-1 or mouse MTF-1·MRE-s complexes were incubated with cadmium. Relative to free mouse MTF-1, pre-existing mouse MTF-1·MRE-s complexes were significantly more resistant to cadmium. Pre-existing mouse MTF-1·MRE-s complexes were resistant to 6 μm cadmium (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes 2 and 3) and 30 μm cadmium (Fig. 3 D, compare lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, 60 μm cadmium dramatically reduced the amount of complex detected regardless of whether the protein was bound to DNA or free (Fig. 3 D, compare lanes 2 and 3). Thus, cadmium can negatively effect the ability of zinc to activate MTF-1, and can reverse the DNA binding activity of zinc-preactivated MTF-1. In contrast, DNA-bound MTF-1 is resistant to cadmium inactivation. The above results suggested that cadmium, which is highly reactive with thiols, may be interacting with cysteine residues of MTF-1, the majority of which are found in the six zinc fingers. The finding that zinc-activated MTF-1·DNA complexes are more resistant to cadmium inactivation is consistent with this notion. Interestingly, native MTF-1 in whole cell extracts was much more resistant than was recombinant MTF-1 to the effects of cadmium inhibition of zinc activation. Therefore, we examined whether the major cellular antioxidant GSH could protect MTF-1 from this effect of cadmium. GSH also binds metal ions (25Ballatori N. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and thus might compete for or facilitate metal interactions with MTF-1. GSH when oxidized facilitates release of zinc from MT (26Maret W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and when reduced facilitates transfer of copper into MT (27Da Costa Ferreira A.M. Ciriolo M.R. Marcocci L. Rotilio G. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Inclusion of 1 mm GSH in the EMSA binding buffer did not interfere with zinc (30 μm) activation of recombinant MTF-1, whereas 10 mm GSH prevented zinc activation (Fig.4 A). GSH (1 mm) provided protection for MTF-1 against 6 μm cadmium and provided some protection against 30 μm cadmium (Fig.4 A). However, even in the presence of GSH, neither recombinant mouse nor human MTF-1 were activated to a DNA binding form by cadmium (Fig. 4 B). Although not as effective as GSH, other reducing agents (DTT and β-mercaptoethanol) also provided some protection against the detrimental effects of cadmium on MTF-1, and in higher concentrations (>10 mm) prevented zinc activation (data not shown). Many transition metals have been reported to induce MT gene expression (17Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 18Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that some of these metals may cause the redistribution of zinc, thus leading to activation of MTF-1 (18Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of these metals can directly activate MTF-1, the effects of nickel, silver, copper, and cobalt on the DNA binding activity of recombinant MTF-1 were determined. Each metal ion was tested at several concentrations, ranging from 3 to 500 μm, in the presence or absence of 1 mm GSH. Each metal at higher concentrations inhibited the zinc activation of MTF-1. However, the effective inhibitory concentration was metal-specific, and in each case 1 mm GSH provided significant protection (see Fig. 5). Of the metals examined, cadmium, copper and nickel were inhibitory in the lowest concentrations to zinc activation of MTF-1. Using the maximal concentration of each metal ion that allowed for complete activation of MTF-1 in the presence of zinc (30 μm) and 1 mm GSH (Fig. 5), it was found that none of the metals tested caused the activation of MTF-1 binding activity. The zinc finger transcription factor MTF-1 has been suggested to play an essential role in induction of MT gene expression by several transition metals (17Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 18Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Among these transition metals, zinc and cadmium are the most effective inducers of MT gene expression in mouse cells. The dose-response for induction of MT genes and MRE-driven reporter genes by cadmium is 5–10-fold lower than that for zinc. We recently reported that zinc can reversibly and directly activate the DNA binding activity of mouse MTF-1 (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the amount of MTF-1 DNA binding activity, measured in vitro, is dramatically and rapidly increased after treatment of cells with zinc or oxidative stress-inducing agents (11Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This increased MTF-1 activity correlates with increased occupancy of MREs in the MT-I promoter (11Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the efficacy of induction by many transition metals, of MRE-driven reporter gene expression in transfected cells, is diminished when the concentration of zinc in the culture medium is reduced. Therefore, it has been suggested that zinc mediates induction of MT gene expression by other transition metals (18Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genomic footprinting suggests that cadmium increases the occupancy of MREs in MT promoters in cultured cells (28Andersen R.D. Taplitz S.J. Oberbauer A.M. Calame K.L. Herschman H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6049-6055Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) which implies that cadmium activates the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 in vivo. Therefore, we examined MTF-1 DNA binding activity in cells treated with zinc or cadmium, and of recombinant MTF-1 synthesized in a coupled transcription-translation system and exposed to various transition metals in vitro. In contrast with oxidative stress and zinc (11Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), cadmium has little effect on the amount of MTF-1 DNA binding activity extracted from Hepa cells cultured in medium containing cadmium. Furthermore, the modest increase in MTF-1 activity that we reported previously (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was detected later than induction of MT-I gene expression by cadmium in these cells. The results reported herein confirm and extend our previous conclusion that cadmium, in concentrations that rapidly and efficiently induce MT gene expression, does not cause the rapid activation of MTF-1 DNA binding activity in mouse, human, and dog cells. These results suggest that cadmium does not simply cause the redistribution of zinc which, in turn, rapidly activates MTF-1 to bind to DNA. Our results cannot exclude the possibility that cadmium causes an increase in the binding affinity of a small amount of MTF-1. This might explain the increased occupancy of MREs detected in vivo after treatment of cultured cells with cadmium (28Andersen R.D. Taplitz S.J. Oberbauer A.M. Calame K.L. Herschman H.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6049-6055Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Due to the difficulty in detecting the small amount of MTF-1 binding activity in the cadmium-treated cells, it was not possible to accurately compare the affinity of binding of this transcription factor in cadmium-treated versus zinc-treated cells. Recombinant human and mouse MTF-1 synthesized in vitro in a coupled transcription-translation system is not competent to bind to DNA, but can be activated by low micromolar concentrations of zinc (2–3 μm) in a temperature-dependent manner. Examination of the ability of several transition metals, including cadmium, to activate recombinant MTF-1 in vitro revealed that none of these metal ions, other than zinc, directly activated this transcription factor to bind to DNA. The TnT lysate contributed 2 μm zinc to the EMSA reactions, which if freed would be expected to cause half-maximal activation of MTF-1. However, similar to the whole cell extracts which contained significant levels of zinc, cadmium and other transition metals did not activate MTF-1. A wide range of metal concentrations was examined in these experiments. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that transition metals that activate MT gene expression do so by indirect mechanisms independent from those used by zinc. Unlike recombinant human and mouse MTF-1 which display no binding activity in the absence of exogenous zinc, in cultured cells about 10% of the MTF-1 extracted is active to bind to DNA in the absence of exogenous zinc (11Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This constitutive activity does not result from activation during extraction since at 4 °C even high concentrations of exogenous zinc do not activate the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The presence of a basal amount of activated MTF-1 in the cell is perhaps not surprising since it has been hypothesized that maintenance of zinc homeostasis within the cell involves not only the efflux of zinc by specific transporters (29Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 30Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), but also a balance between zinc-dependent MTF-1 activation of MT gene transcription and the synthesis of the major intracellular zinc-binding protein MT. This scenario is analogous to the control of copper homeostasis in yeast by the copper-dependent transcription factor ACE1 and the yeast MT, CUP1 (31Dameron C.T. Winge D.R. George G.N. Sansone M. Hu S. Hamer D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6127-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Jensen L.T. Howard W.R. Strain J.J. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18514-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Since all transition metals that activate mammalian MT gene expression are thought to do so via MTF-1, and with the exception of zinc, without a significant increase in MTF-1 binding activity, our data suggest that these transition metals make use of the activated MTF-1 that pre-exists in the cell to increase MT gene expression. This notion is indirectly supported by the observation that zinc concentration in the culture medium influences the extent of induction of an MRE-driven reporter gene by other transition metals, including cadmium (18Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which transition metals other than zinc act on MTF-1 to increase MT gene expression is poorly understood. It is possible that transition metals alter the transactivation potential of MTF-1 by releasing an inhibitor or activating a co-activator. We speculate that reversible phosphorylation of MTF-1 may play a role in modulating the activities of this transcription factor. Cadmium can stimulate myosin light chain kinase (33Chao S.H. Bu C.H. Cheung W.Y. Arch. Toxicol. 1995; 69: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), affect calmodulin activity in the brain (34Vig P.J.S. Nath R. Biochem. Int. 1991; 23: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar), and evoke inositol polyphosphate formation (35Smith J.B. Dwyer S.D. Smith L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7115-7118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cadmium induction of c-myc may involve the activation of protein kinase C (36Tang N. Enger M.D. Toxicology. 1993; 81: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cadmium may modulate gene expression by interfering with normal cellular signaling mechanisms at the levels of receptors, calcium and zinc homeostasis, protein phosphorylation, and modification of transcription factors (37Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Mouse MTF-1 contains a serine/threonine-rich transactivation domain (22Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H.-P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and several potential sites of phosphorylation, but no studies of the phosphorylation state of the protein have been reported. The proximal promoter of the mouse MT-I gene contains a complex array of transcriptional activation elements, and although it has been shown that MTF-1 is essential for basal level expression of MT, as well as heavy metal induction (17Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 18Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), it seems likely that MTF-1 may function in cooperation with other transcription factors to regulate MT gene expression. Therefore, induction of MT by heavy metals other than zinc may involve the enhanced interaction of other transcription factors with MTF-1 in the absence of an increase in MTF-1 DNA binding activity. It is clear that MTF-1 plays an integral role in transducing a complex cascade of signals resulting in the activation of MT gene transcription. Determining the nature of the mechanism by which heavy metals initiate this cascade requires further investigation. Rather than activate the DNA-binding capacity of recombinant MTF-1, it was noted that, in vitro, several transition metals actually inhibited the activation of recombinant MTF-1 by zinc. Cadmium was much less efficient at inhibiting preformed MTF-1·DNA complexes than it was at inhibiting free MTF-1. We (11Dalton T.P. Li Q.W. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26233-26241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and others (12Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) have noted that zinc-activated MTF-1 bound to MRE-s contains a proteinase-resistant DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, relative to Sp1, MTF-1 binding activity is more sensitive to EDTA, and is stabilized by DNA interactions (14Dalton T.D. Bittel D. Andrews G.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2781-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These data, and deletion mutagenesis experiments, suggest that the reversible interactions of zinc with the zinc finger domain of MTF-1 modulates its DNA binding activity. Other transition metals likely inhibit zinc binding to MTF-1 zinc fingers (16Berg J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6513-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, it was found that GSH, in physiological concentrations (1 mm), and low levels of DTT or β-mercaptoethanol, provided protection against the detrimental effects of transition metals on zinc activation of MTF-1, whereas, higher concentrations (10 mm) of reducing agents prevented the activation of recombinant MTF-1 by zinc. Thus, the redox status of thiols in MTF-1 may be critical for zinc activation of DNA binding activity. Alternatively, or in addition, the effects of GSH may reflect its metal binding ability (25Ballatori N. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 27: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Chaberek S. Martell A.E. Organic Sequestering Agents. Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1959Google Scholar). GSH binds cadmium with an equilibrium constant of 3 × 10−10m and zinc with an equilibrium constant of 2 × 10−8m (38Chaberek S. Martell A.E. Organic Sequestering Agents. Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1959Google Scholar). At higher concentrations (10 mm) GSH may simply chelate zinc and prevent activation of MTF-1. In lower concentrations (1 mm), GSH may preferentially bind cadmium and prevent its interactions with MTF-1. In contrast, the protective effects of DTT and β-mercaptoethanol are unlikely to reflect their metal binding capacity. in vivo, MTF-1 may be protected from inactivation by transition metals by the reducing environment within the cell and/or by the binding of these metals by metallothionein (39Kagi J.H. Schaffer A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8509-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Several transition metals (cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, nickel, and zinc) can bind to zinc finger motifs (reviewed in Ref. 16Berg J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6513-6516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These motifs fold in the presence of transition metal ions but not in their absence. Metal binding constants are governed by the geometry of the binding site and by the amino acid sequence of the zinc finger (15Shi Y. Beger R.D. Berg J.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 749-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Krizek B.A. Amann B.T. Kilfoil V.J. Merkle D.L. Berg J.M. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4518-4523Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of the Cys2Cys2 zinc finger domains from the glucocorticoid receptor (41Pan T. Freedman L.P. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9218-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and GAL4 (42Pan T. Coleman J.E. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3145-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) can be restored by cadmium and/or cobalt. In contrast, the DNA binding activity of Cys2His2 zinc finger protein TFIIIA is not restored by cobalt, nickel, or iron, but can be partially restored by manganese (43Berg J.M. Merkle D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3759-3761Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that the DNA binding activity of MTF-1 is not affected by the other transition metals examined, and that zinc binding, at least as assessed by EMSA of MTF-1 activity, is of a much lower affinity than might be predicted from studies of zinc finger peptides which bind zinc with picomolar to nanomolar binding constants (15Shi Y. Beger R.D. Berg J.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 749-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Berg J.M. J. Biol.

Therefore, MTF-1 appears to be unique among the zinc finger transcription factors in its relatively low affinity yet high specificity for zinc activation of DNA binding activity. The factors governing metal specificity and affinity of binding to MTF-1 remain to be determined. We are indebted to Jim Geiser and Steve Eklund for excellent technical assistance."

The chloroplast, the photosynthetic organelle of eukaryotic cells, is composed of six compartments: three different membranes and the three aqueous compartments delimited by them. The chloroplast envelope, composed of an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and an intramembrane space, surrounds the stroma, the soluble compartment where most carbon metabolism reactions take place. The third membrane is the extensive network of thylakoid membranes, harboring the photosynthetic antennae, the photosynthetic electron transport system, and the ATP synthesis machinery. The sixth compartment is the thylakoid lumen, into which protons are pumped to form a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This gradient is the driving force for ATP synthesis. Proteins found within the lumen, either soluble or bound to the inner side of the thylakoid membrane, include the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, components of the photosynthetic electron transport system, and many as yet unidentified proteins. As in other biological systems, maintenance of the lumen is expected to require protein degradation to remove damaged or otherwise nonfunctional proteins. However, the proteolytic machinery in this compartment has never been detailed. Many examples of protein degradation in the chloroplast have been documented (for review, see Ref. 1Adam Z. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Specific degradation of luminal proteins has also been demonstrated, with plastocyanin being the best characterized example. When Chlamydomonas cells are grown in a Cu2+-deficient medium, apoplastocyanin is synthesized, imported into the chloroplast, and translocated across the thylakoid membrane; however, it fails to accumulate due to rapid degradation (2Merchant S. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15850-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar observation was made recently in an in vitrosystem. Apoplastocyanin was sensitive to proteolytic digestion, whereas the native or reconstituted holoproteins were not (3Li H.H. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23504-23510Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This increased sensitivity of the apoprotein probably resulted from its lacking the characteristic secondary structure displayed by the holoprotein, as revealed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (3Li H.H. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23504-23510Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In another recent study, truncated forms of a 23-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex, OE23, were correctly targeted to the lumen and processed to their mature size, but then rapidly degraded (4Roffey R.A. Theg S.M. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 111: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the lumen contains its own proteolytic machinery, capable of degrading unassembled or damaged soluble proteins. It also implies that luminal proteases participate in the degradation of thylakoid membrane proteins exposed to the lumen. Limited proteolytic processing also occurs in the lumen. Nuclear encoded thylakoid proteins, targeted to the lumen by N-terminal “thylakoid transfer” signals, are processed to their mature forms by a membrane-bound thylakoid-processing peptidase (5Hageman J. Robinson C. Smeekens S. Weisbeek P. Nature. 1986; 324: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6James H.E. Bartling D. Musgrove J.E. Kirwin P.M. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 26: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that has not yet been purified or cloned. The plastid-encoded D1 protein of the photosystem II reaction center is also processed in the lumen. It is synthesized with a C-terminal extension of 8–16 amino acids that is removed within the thylakoid lumen immediately after synthesis (8Inagaki N. Fujita S. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 218-222Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Marder J.B. Goloubinoff P. Edelman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3900-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Why this protein is synthesized with this extension is not clear, but its proteolytic removal is necessary to establish active photosystem II (10Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme involved in this activity has been partially purified (8Inagaki N. Fujita S. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 218-222Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Bowyer J.R. Packer J.C.L. McCormack B.A. Whitelegge J.P. Robinson C. Taylor M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5424-5433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and characterized as a monomeric protein of 45 kDa (12Fujita S. Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Taguchi F. Matsumoto A. Satoh K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1169-1177Google Scholar). Recently, the gene encoding this peptidase was isolated from cyanobacteria (13Shestakov S.V. Anbudurai P.R. Stanbekova G.E. Gadzhiev A. Lind L.K. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19354-19359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and spinach (14Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and was found to be homologous to the periplasmic protease Tsp (tail-specificprotease) of Escherichia coli, which is responsible for C-terminal processing of at least two bacterial proteins (13Shestakov S.V. Anbudurai P.R. Stanbekova G.E. Gadzhiev A. Lind L.K. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19354-19359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Inagaki N. Yamamoto Y. Mori H. Satoh K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Jentsch S. Science. 1996; 271: 955-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Keiler K.C. Waller P.R.H. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it is also responsible for complete degradation of some proteins in E. coli (16Keiler K.C. Waller P.R.H. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). However, whether the luminal homologue of Tsp can also participate in complete degradation or, alternatively, its activity is limited to C-terminal processing of the D1 protein is unknown. The occurrence of a homologue of the bacterial periplasmic protease Tsp in the lumen suggests the existence of other periplasmic protease homologues there. This idea is also supported by the notion that the lumen is functionally and evolutionarily equivalent to the bacterial periplasm. Both are compartments into which protons are pumped by the respective ATPases, and the machinery responsible for protein translocation into the lumen resembles that into the bacterial periplasm (7Robinson C. Klosgen R.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To identify other homologues of bacterial periplasmic proteases in the lumen, we initiated an immunological screening and data base search for a chloroplastic homologue of the bacterial periplasmic serine-type heat-shock protease DegP (also known as HtrA or Protease Do) (18Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Skorko-Glonek J. Krzewski K. Lipinska B. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Kolmar H. Waller P.R.H. Sauer R.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5925-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Skorko-Glonek J. Krzewski K. Zolese G. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8974-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A DegP homologue was found in the thylakoid, strongly associated with the inner side of the thylakoid membrane. This suborganellar fraction also exhibited the ATP-independent, serine-type β-casein-degrading activity typical of bacterial DegP. Moreover, expression of the chloroplastic homologue was rapidly stimulated by high temperature. Isolation of a cDNA encoding this protein and features of its sequence support its localization and proposed activity. Pea seedlings (Pisum sativum var. Alaska) were germinated and grown at 25 °C for 10–12 days under a 12-h photoperiod, at a light intensity of 150 microeinsteins·m−2·s−1. To test the effects of high temperature, seedlings were thoroughly watered and then transferred to an incubator kept at 40 °C. Intact chloroplasts were purified on Percoll gradients (23Adam Z. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 102: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). They were subfractionated by osmotic shock in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, followed by a 10-min centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing stromal extract, was separated from the pellet containing intact thylakoids; the latter was then washed twice and resuspended in 110 mm sorbitol and 17 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, to 2 mg of chlorophyll/ml. Intact thylakoids were further fractionated by sonication on ice, three times for 10 s each, with 1-min cooling intervals. The sonicated thylakoids were then centrifuged for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C to remove intact thylakoids, and thylakoid membranes were separated from the lumen extract by ultracentrifugation of the supernatant at 200,000 × gfor 1 h. The pellet containing thylakoid membranes was resuspended in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, to 2 mg of chlorophyll/ml. Intact thylakoids, as well as thylakoid membranes, were incubated in 0.1 mg/ml thermolysin on ice for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding a 5 mm EDTA. Intact thylakoids were then collected by a 5-min centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C; washed once in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0; and resuspended in the same medium. Thylakoid membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min. Intact thylakoids and thylakoid membranes were finally resuspended in 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8.0, to a concentration of 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml. To characterize the association between the proteins and thylakoid membranes, they were washed in high salt and/or low detergent concentrations. The membranes were resuspended in 1 m NaBr, 1 m NaCl, or 1 m NaCl supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, to a concentration of 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml. Proteins were resolved on polyacrylamide gels (23Adam Z. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 102: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. DegP was detected with an antibody against the E. coli protein (18Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generously donated by B. Lipinska (University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland). This antibody was used at a 1:100 dilution. Antibodies against the luminal 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex, OE33 (donated by N. Hoffman, Carnegie Institution), were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Samples contained 7 and 0.1 μg of chlorophyll/lane (or their equivalent for stroma and lumen samples) for detection of DegP and OE33, respectively. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and bands were quantified by laser densitometry. Casein-degrading activity was determined using a method previously described to assay bacterial DegP activity (18Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures for the proteolytic activity assay contained 0.3 mg/ml β-casein (Sigma), 0.4 mg of chlorophyll/ml of thylakoid membranes, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and the reaction was carried out at 37 °C. Where indicated, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 4 mm o-phenanthroline were included in the reaction mixture. Proteins were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% acrylamide gels, and the relative amount of casein in each sample was quantified by laser densitometric scanning of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag 125C11T7 showing homology to E. coli DegP and the Arabidopsis cDNA library λ-PRL2 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University. A 680-base pair XbaI fragment was isolated from the expressed sequence tag clone, radioactively labeled, and used as a DNA probe to screen the cDNA library. Isolated phages were excised in vivo, plasmid DNA was prepared, and the longest clones were further analyzed. Automated sequencing of both strands was performed in an Applied Biosystems Model 373 DNA Sequencer. DNA and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with the Genetics Computer Group program. On preliminary immunoblots of pea chloroplasts with an antibody against bacterial DegP, we detected a single band with apparent molecular mass of ∼40 kDa (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that this protease has a homologue in chloroplasts. When chloroplasts were fractionated, the cross-reacting protein was detected in the intact thylakoid fraction, protected from external protease treatment (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained using an antibody against OE33, localizing chloroplastic DegP to within the thylakoid. To further characterize the intraorganellar location of DegP, intact thylakoids were sonicated and subjected to ultracentrifugation to separate the thylakoid membranes from their soluble lumen contents. DegP was associated exclusively with the thylakoid membrane, with no traces detectable in the lumen, whereas OE33 was equally distributed between the two fractions (Fig.1 B). These results suggested that DegP is strongly associated with the inner side of the thylakoid membrane. The association of DegP with the thylakoid membrane was further characterized by subjecting membranes recovered after sonication to different treatments followed by immunoblot analysis. High salt washes with a 1 m concentration of either NaBr or NaCl, treatments that were effective in removing a considerable amount of OE33 from the membrane, failed to remove DegP (Fig. 1 C). DegP could only be washed off the membrane when a low concentration of detergent was added to the salt. The low concentration of Triton X-100 used in this experiment (0.05%) was not sufficient to solubilize the membrane, suggesting that DegP is peripherally associated with the thylakoid membrane via hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interactions. Consistent with the contention that DegP is a peripheral membrane protein was its high sensitivity to proteolytic treatment (Fig.1 C). The residual signal left after protease treatment suggested that following sonication, most of the thylakoid membranes are in an inside-out orientation. Bacterial DegP is a heat-shock protein, necessary for survival at elevated temperatures (18Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of heat on chloroplastic DegP expression, we transferred pea seedlings grown at 25 °C to 40 °C. Increased levels of DegP were observed after 2 and 4 h, with a decrease after longer exposures to high temperature (Fig. 2). The transient increase in DegP levels in response to elevated temperature was in contrast to the constant level of OE33 observed throughout the experiment. Similar to OE33, levels of the stromally exposed thylakoid protease FtsH (24Lindahl M. Tabak S. Cseke L. Pichersky E. Andersson B. Adam Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) also remained unchanged (data not shown). Thus, it appears that in addition to a constitutive role, DegP may play a role in the chloroplast's response to transient elevated temperatures. β-Casein is the preferred substrate to assay bacterial DegP activity under in vitro conditions (18Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the chloroplast fraction containing the DegP homologue also exhibits β-casein-degrading activity. When thylakoid membranes prepared by sonication followed by centrifugation were incubated with β-casein, >50% of the casein was degraded within the first 60 min (Fig. 3 A). Addition of 0.2% Triton X-100 only slightly increased the degradation rate. Together with the aforementioned conclusion that the thylakoid membranes were for the most part inside-out (Fig. 1 C), this suggested that most of the casein-degrading activity resides on the inner side of the thylakoid membrane and that no additional molecules of the enzyme are exposed by solubilizing the membrane. To determine the class of protease involved in β-casein degradation by thylakoid membranes, protease inhibitors were included in the reaction mixture. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and o-phenanthroline, inhibitors of serine proteases and metalloproteases, respectively, showed considerable inhibition (Fig.3 B), whereas inhibitors of cysteine proteases had no effect (data not shown). A mixture of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and o-phenanthroline almost totally inhibited the degradation of β-casein (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that both metalloproteases and serine proteases are involved in this degradation activity and that the serine-type proteolytic activity may be attributed to DegP. It should also be noted that the casein-degrading activities were independent of ATP (data not shown). A search of the Arabidopsis data base revealed an expressed sequence tag showing considerable homology to bacterial DegP, including its active serine region. Since this cDNA was only a partial clone, we used it as a DNA probe to isolate the full-length homologue from an Arabidopsis cDNA library. The resultant 1477-base pair-long cDNA, designated AtDegP, encodes a protein of 437 amino acids (Fig. 4), with a calculated molecular mass of 46,212 Da and a pI of 6.37. The N terminus of the protein demonstrates the characteristics of a chloroplast bipartite transit peptide (17Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Its stroma-targeting domain, estimated to be 51 amino acids long, starts with a stretch of 13 residues devoid of Gly and Pro. It is rich in hydroxylated and basic residues (39 and 10%, respectively) and contains no acidic residues (Fig. 4). Since the recognition site of the stromal peptidase is only loosely conserved among different chloroplastic proteins (25Gavel Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), the stromal processing site was not obvious. We predicted it to be either at Ser-43 or at Ser-51, based on the occurrence of Ile residues at positions 41 and 49, a residue that is often found at position −3 of processed precursors (25Gavel Y. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The stroma-targeting domain is followed by a sequence of at least 52 amino acids, with characteristics of a lumen-targeting domain. It consists of an N-terminal charged region (rich in acidic residues), a hydrophobic domain, and a more polar C-terminal region ending with a recognition site for the thylakoid-processing peptidase (AXA). The characteristics of the N terminus of the protein suggested that it serves as a bipartite transit peptide to facilitate first the import of the protein into the chloroplast and then its translocation across the thylakoid membrane, consistent with the immunolocalization of the protein presented in Fig. 1. If the second processing event indeed occurs at the ASA sequence (after Ala-103), the mature portion of the protein is predicted to contain 334 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 35,218 Da. The predicted mature part of chloroplastic DegP exhibits high homology to the bacterial protein (37% identity and 60% similarity), with the proteins largely differing at their ends: the chloroplastic protein is longer at its N terminus due to the presence of the stroma-targeting domain, and the bacterial protein contains a C terminus, which is missing in the chloroplastic protein (Fig.5). The homology starts at the lumen-targeting domain, which is similar to the sequence targeting the bacterial protein to the periplasm, and extends to the mature region of the protein. The observed homology in the signal sequence region also suggests that stromal processing of the precursor protein occurs at Ser-51. The residues composing the catalytic triad (His-171, Asp-201, and the nucleophile Ser-280) (26Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) are found in highly conserved regions of the protein (Figs. 4 and 5). The active serine is found within the characteristic motif GXSGG, which is common to most serine proteases (26Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The strong resemblance of the chloroplastic protein to E. coli DegP and the order and spacing between the residues of the triad classify it as a member of the α-lytic endopeptidase family (also designated as the S2 family) of serine proteases (26Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). This study provides the first description of a putative general purpose protease inside the chloroplast thylakoid. Chloroplastic DegP is peripherally attached to the inside of the thylakoid membrane, making it available for cleavage of luminal soluble proteins as well as hydrophilic portions of thylakoid membrane proteins exposed to the lumen. The localization of DegP to the inner side of the thylakoid is consistent with the occurrence of its bacterial homologue on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane (22Skorko-Glonek J. Krzewski K. Zolese G. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8974-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with the thylakoid lumen being considered the functional and evolutionary equivalent of the bacterial periplasm. In this respect, it is also interesting to note that members of the α-lytic endopeptidase family of serine proteases have been described only in eubacteria, where they are secreted to act extracellularly (26Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The DegP-membrane association is fairly strong, as evidenced by its resistance to high salt washes that remove OE33, another peripheral thylakoid membrane protein. Similar resistance to such washes has been observed with bacterial DegP (22Skorko-Glonek J. Krzewski K. Zolese G. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8974-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This association appears to be mediated by hydrophobic interactions since it is destabilized by low concentrations of detergent. Hydrophobic interactions between bacterial DegP and the inner membrane can also be implied by the fact that this protein has recently been shown to interact with phospholipid membranes (22Skorko-Glonek J. Krzewski K. Zolese G. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8974-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Hydropathy plots of both the Arabidopsis and E. coli proteins did not reveal any hydrophobic sequence long enough to span the membrane (data not shown). However, the occurrence of shorter (∼10 residues) hydrophobic stretches may explain their strong interactions with membranes. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of chloroplastic DegP with the Arabidopsis data base revealed two related genomic clones (F5I14.16 and F5I14.17) found on chromosome 1. These genes were clearly different from the cDNA isolated in this work and are unlikely to encode chloroplastic proteins because they lack putative transit peptides. However, since their N termini are similar to the bacterial signal peptide, they may be translocated through the secretory pathway. Localization of the products of these two genes to cellular sites other than plastids can also be envisioned, as gene homologues of DegP have been recently identified in mammalian cells (27Hershkovits G. Dubinsky Z. Katcoff D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although the physiological substrates of chloroplastic DegP are unknown, one may speculate that it participates in the degradation, or at least partial cleavage, of either soluble or membrane proteins. For example, proteolytic degradation of the photosystem II reaction center D1 protein involves two initial ATP-independent cleavage events in luminal loops connecting transmembrane helices, and the protease(s) involved are of the serine type (for review, see Ref. 28Andersson B. Aro E.-M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 780-793Crossref Google Scholar). The possible involvement of DegP in D1 protein degradation awaits direct examination. Efficient degradation of proteins extruding from both sides of the membrane, such as D1, is expected to require protease activity at both membrane surfaces. In this respect, DegP may be an important addition to the FtsH protease found on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane (24Lindahl M. Tabak S. Cseke L. Pichersky E. Andersson B. Adam Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 29Ostersetzer O. Adam Z. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Of particular interest was the observation that the steady-state level of chloroplastic DegP increases rapidly upon exposure of seedlings to elevated temperatures. This finding is consistent with the heat-stimulated expression of the bacterial gene (18Lipinska B. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a homologous gene in algae (27Hershkovits G. Dubinsky Z. Katcoff D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, proteins may undergo conformational changes, resulting in irreversible aggregation. One of the roles of DegP may be to prevent this by degrading heat-denatured proteins in the thylakoid lumen. Our findings provide tools for studying the physiological roles of this newly discovered chloroplastic protease. We thank B. Lipinska for the antibody against bacterial DegP, N. Hoffman for the antibody against OE33, and the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University for the Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag clone and the cDNA library."
https://openalex.org/W2001153871,"A mathematical model is presented in which a single mutation can affect multiple phenotypic characters, each of which is subject to stabilizing selection. A wide range of mutations is allowed, including ones that produce extremely small phenotypic changes. The analysis shows that, when three or more characters are affected by each mutation, a single optimal genetic sequence may become common. This result provides a hypothesis to explain the low levels of variation and low rates of substitution that are observed at some loci."
https://openalex.org/W2095454266,"Recently it has been reported that caspase-3 activation occurs in stimulated T-lymphocytes without associated apoptosis (Miossec, C., Dutilleul, V., Fassy, F., and Diu-Hercend, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 13459–13462). To explore this phenomenon, human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated with mitogenic lectins or anti-CD3 antibody, and the proteolytic processing of different caspases and caspase substrates was analyzed by immunoblotting. Proteolytic processing of caspases-3 and -7 and the caspase substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, GDP dissociation inhibitor, and PKCδ was observed when PBLs were activated in vitro, and lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer which contains 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. In contrast, when a lysis buffer containing 2% SDS was used, the caspases remained in their zymogen pro-forms, and no proteolytic processing of caspase substrates was detected. Moreover, in experiments using intact cells and a cell-permeable fluorigenic caspase substrate, no caspase activity was observed in activated T-cells, whereas it was clearly detected when PBLs were treated with the apoptosis-inducing anticancer drug etoposide. Since the granzyme B is a direct activator of caspase-3 and its expression is induced following T-cell activation, we tested the effects of anti-GraB, an engineered serpin that specifically inhibits GraB. When the activated T-lymphocytes were lysed in RIPA buffer containing anti-GraB, no proteolytic processing or activation of caspase-3 was observed, strongly suggesting that release of GraB or similar proteases from their storage sites in cytotoxic granules during the lysis procedure is responsible for caspase activation. These findings demonstrate that T-cells do not process caspases upon activation and caution about the method of cell lysis used when studying granzyme-expressing cells. Recently it has been reported that caspase-3 activation occurs in stimulated T-lymphocytes without associated apoptosis (Miossec, C., Dutilleul, V., Fassy, F., and Diu-Hercend, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 13459–13462). To explore this phenomenon, human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were stimulated with mitogenic lectins or anti-CD3 antibody, and the proteolytic processing of different caspases and caspase substrates was analyzed by immunoblotting. Proteolytic processing of caspases-3 and -7 and the caspase substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, GDP dissociation inhibitor, and PKCδ was observed when PBLs were activated in vitro, and lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer which contains 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. In contrast, when a lysis buffer containing 2% SDS was used, the caspases remained in their zymogen pro-forms, and no proteolytic processing of caspase substrates was detected. Moreover, in experiments using intact cells and a cell-permeable fluorigenic caspase substrate, no caspase activity was observed in activated T-cells, whereas it was clearly detected when PBLs were treated with the apoptosis-inducing anticancer drug etoposide. Since the granzyme B is a direct activator of caspase-3 and its expression is induced following T-cell activation, we tested the effects of anti-GraB, an engineered serpin that specifically inhibits GraB. When the activated T-lymphocytes were lysed in RIPA buffer containing anti-GraB, no proteolytic processing or activation of caspase-3 was observed, strongly suggesting that release of GraB or similar proteases from their storage sites in cytotoxic granules during the lysis procedure is responsible for caspase activation. These findings demonstrate that T-cells do not process caspases upon activation and caution about the method of cell lysis used when studying granzyme-expressing cells.

Diverse stimuli that cause apoptosis result in activation of these cysteine proteases, which have specificity for aspartic acid in the P1 position of substrates. Accordingly, specific peptidyl inhibitors of caspases are potent inhibitors of apoptosis, thus implying that caspases play an essential role as either initiators or effectors of apoptotic cell death pathways. Experiments involving caspase gene disruption in mice also support the idea of a critical role for caspases in apoptosis (5Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S.-S.

Nevertheless, caspase involvement in cellular processes other than apoptosis has also been documented. In this regard, the caspase-1 subfamily (which includes caspases-1, -4, and -5) is primarily involved in the processing of pro-IL-1β (26Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Van Ness K.

In contrast to the caspase-1 subfamily which is involved in cytokine pro-protein processing, caspase-3 and the other CED-3-like members of the caspase family have uniformly been associated with apoptosis, and no other function for these proteases is known. Recently, however, Miossec et al. (30Miossec C. Dutilleul V. Fassy F. Diu-Hercend A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13459-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) reported that caspase-3 activation might be involved in regulating proliferation and lymphocyte activation events in T-cells, in the absence of associated apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrate that caspase-3-like proteases are not normally activated during T-cell stimulation, and therefore they are unlikely to play a role in lymphocyte activation or proliferation. Moreover, our findings suggest that post-lysis release from intracellular granules of GraB or similar serine proteases with specificity for aspartic acid can lead to artifactual proteolytic processing and activation of caspases. The caspase inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) and acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fmk (Ac-DEVD-fmk) were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA) and dissolved in Me2SO. The preparation and purification of the active caspase-3 and the specific granzyme B inhibitor anti-GraB have been described elsewhere (31Orth K. O'Rourke K. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

PBLs were isolated from heparinized venous blood from human volunteers by Ficoll-histopaque (Sigma) centrifugation. PBLs were left unstimulated or treated at the onset with 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Difco). After 2 days, cells were washed and incubated thereafter with 50 units/ml IL-2 (Genzyme, Boston, MA). In some experiments, PBLs were activated with 2.5 μg/ml anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (kindly provided by Orthodiagnostics, Inc. Stamford, CT) or with 5 μg/ml concanavalin A (Sigma). Cell extracts were made using two different protocols. The first one involved lysis of 10–50 × 106 cells in 50–200 μl of either RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) or Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 142 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) on ice for 2 min, followed by removal of DNA and cell debris by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were collected and frozen at −80 °C or used immediately. The second protocol involved lysis with modified Laemmli buffer (60 mmTris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 2% SDS, without β-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue). Cell disruption was completed by sonication for 30 s on ice, followed by centrifugation as above, and the supernatants were frozen at −80 °C or used immediately. Protein concentration was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce). Immunoblot analyses were performed as described in detail elsewhere, using the multiple antigen detection immunoblotting method (34Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were normalized for total protein content (50 μg per lane) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel), followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filters (0.4 μm). The primary antibodies employed were directed against caspase-3 (35Krajewska M. Wang H.-G. Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Reed J.C.

The cell-permeable fluorigenic substrate (PhiPhilux-G6D2) was used to monitor caspase activity in intact cells, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (OncoImmunin, Inc, Kensington, MD). Briefly, cells were collected and washed twice in PBS. Then, 106 cells were resuspended in 50 μl of substrate solution and supplemented with 5 μl of fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a water bath in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed once and the fluorescence emission was determined using the FL-2 channel of a Becton Dickinson FACSort flow cytometer. Caspase-3-like protease activity was measured at 37 °C using a spectrofluorometric plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, LS50B) in the kinetic mode with excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 505 nm, respectively. Activity was measured by the release of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (AFC) from the synthetic substrate Z-DEVD-AFC (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA). Lysates (5–10 μg of total protein) were mixed with 100 μl of caspase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Chaps, 10% sucrose, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), and reactions were initiated by addition of 100 μm of Z-DEVD-AFC. To assess the putative role of caspases in T-cell activation events, human PBLs were either cultured for up to 7 days in medium without stimulants or were activated in vitro using either phytohemagglutinin or concanavalin A in combination with IL-2 or by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. These activated cells were actively proliferating, and >99% were non-apoptotic as determined by microscopic evaluation of 4–6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained cells and by flow cytometric DNA content analysis (not shown). T-cells were recovered from cultures at different times and lysed in RIPA buffer, and the proteolytic processing of caspases and caspase substrates was evaluated by immunoblotting. In lysates derived from unstimulated PBLs, caspases and caspase substrates were consistently present in their unprocessed forms (Fig.1, A–E, lane 1). In contrast, in all experiments where PBLs were activated in vitro and cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (n = 6), marked reductions in the ∼36-kDa proform of caspase-3 were found, and two processed forms of ∼24 and ∼20 kDa appeared (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), similar to results described by Miossec et al.(30Miossec C. Dutilleul V. Fassy F. Diu-Hercend A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13459-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The p24 form of caspase-3 has been previously attributed to the cleavage at Asp-175, which produces an ∼24-kDa large subunit and ∼12-kDa small subunit, the latter of which is not detected by the antibody employed here (35Krajewska M. Wang H.-G. Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Shabaik A. Gascoyne R. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1605-1613PubMed Google Scholar). Further processing of the large subunit usually at either Asp-9 or Asp-28 to yield p20 or p17 large subunits, respectively, has also been described (38Han Z. Hendrickson E.A. Bremner T.A. Wyche J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13432-13436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The p24 and p20 processed forms of caspase-3 seen in activated PBL lysates appear to represent active proteases, based on experiments where an irreversible biotinylated caspase-3 substrate, biotin-VAD-fmk (39Faleiro L. Kobayashi R. Fearnhead H. Lazebnik Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), was incubated with these lysates, and both the p24 and p20 bands were subsequently shown to bind avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (not shown). Similar results were obtained when caspase-7 was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1 B, unstimulated PBLs contained exclusively the unprocessed ∼38-kDa zymogen form of caspase-7, whereas only the ∼20-kDa processed large subunit of this protease was detected in RIPA lysates from activated PBLs (lanes 1 and 2). In addition, the caspase substrates PARP, D4-GDI, and PKCδ (10Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11209-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) were found to be at least partially cleaved in lysates derived from activated but not unstimulated PBLs (Fig. 1, C–E, lanes 1 and 2). This same pattern of caspase and caspase substrate cleavage was observed for PBLs that had been stimulated in culture with mitogenic lectins and IL-2 for 3–14 days and lysed in RIPA (not shown). Surprisingly, culturing PBLs with 25 μm cell-permeable broad specificity caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk or the relatively caspase-3/caspase-7-selective inhibitor Ac-DEVD-fmk failed to prevent the proteolytic processing of the pro-forms of caspases-3 and -7, implying that a Z-VAD and Ac-DEVD-resistant protease was responsible (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, these same peptidyl inhibitors of caspases were effective blockers of caspase processing in other types of cells when used at the same or even 10-fold lower concentrations (not shown). The Z-VAD-fmk and Ac-DEVD-fmk reagents, however, did at least partially inhibit proteolytic processing of PARP, D4-GDI, and PKCδ, implying that caspases were responsible for these proteolytic events and confirming that the peptidyl inhibitors were indeed active (Fig. 1, C–E, lanes 3 and 4). Lysates derived from activated but not resting PBLs that had been made with RIPA buffer or with an isotonic buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 as the only detergent contained active caspases, as determined by in vitro measurements of Z-DEVD-AFC hydrolysis (Fig.2). In contrast, lysates derived from PBLs that had been activated in culture in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk or Ac-DEVD-fmk contained far less Z-DEVD-AFC hydrolyzing enzymes. This result implies that while processing of caspase-3 and caspase-7 had occurred in these lysates (Fig. 1), the activated caspases were effectively inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk and DEVD-fmk. Addition to PBL lysates of a combination of serine protease inhibitors, including aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, leupeptin, and pepstatin, failed to suppress the caspase activity that was present in these extracts (Fig. 2), thus confirming the caspase specificity of the proteolytic activity detected by this Z-DEVD-AFC hydrolysis assay. To explore further the mechanisms responsible for the proteolytic processing and activation of caspases observed in these experiments with activated T-cells, PBLs were lysed in a modified Laemmli solution that contained 2% SDS instead of RIPA or Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. When the same preparations of activated T-cells were lysed in this 2% SDS solution, no proteolytic processing of caspases-3 or -7 was found by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B;lane 6). Moreover, no cleavage of PARP, D4-GDI, or PKCδ was detected under these conditions (Fig. 1, C–E, lane 6). Although the high concentrations of SDS in these lysates may have precluded effective assay of these proteases, no elevations in Z-DEVD-AFC hydrolytic activity were detected (Fig. 2). As a control to verify that lysis of cells in Laemmli buffer did not preclude recovery of processed caspases or caspase substrates, activated PBL were treated with the anticancer drug etoposide which induced approximately half the cells to undergo apoptosis under these conditions, then lysed with Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A (lane 9), etoposide-treated PBLs contained the ∼17-kDa processed form of caspase-3 corresponding to the fully processed large subunit of the enzyme (38Han Z. Hendrickson E.A. Bremner T.A. Wyche J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13432-13436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This 17-kDa caspase-3 band co-migrated with the purified recombinant p17 large subunit of caspase-3 produced in bacteria (A, lane 10). Although etoposide-treated PBLs contained little processed caspase-7, cleavaged PARP, D4-GDI, and PKCδ were readily detected in these lysates (Figs. 1, C–E, lane 9). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that activation of the caspases and subsequent proteolysis of their substrates in activated T-lymphocytes occur after mechanical disruption of the cells in RIPA buffer. A cell-permeable fluorigenic caspase substrate PhiPhilux-G6D2 was used to evaluate further whether caspases become activated in intact PBLs after stimulation with mitogenic lectins and IL-2. Very few cells produced fluorescence emissions above background in cultures of activated PBLs (Fig.3 A), whereas over half the etoposide-treated PBLs apparently cleaved the PhiPhilux-G6D2 substrate (Fig. 2 B). To confirm that the cleavage of the fluorigenic substrate PhiPhilux-G6D2 seen in etoposide-treated T-cells was indeed caspase-dependent, these cells were pretreated with either Z-VAD-fmk or Ac-DEVD-fmk prior to exposure to PhiPhilux-G6D2, demonstrating nearly complete suppression of the fluorescence emission (Fig. 3, C and D). These results therefore demonstrate that while caspase-3-like proteases are activated in T-cells treated with the apoptosis-inducing anticancer drug etoposide, these proteases evidently do not become activated within T-cells after stimulation with mitogens and lymphokines under conditions where apoptosis does not occur. In agreement with these observations, no effect of the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk or Ac-DEVD-fmk was seen on proliferation rates or on expression of T-cell surface activation markers (CD25 and CD71) (not shown). Comparisons of caspase processing in lysates prepared with RIPA versus Laemmli buffer using a variety of non-T-cell lines suggested that post-lysis activation of these proteases may be relatively unique to activated PBLs (not shown). We hypothesized, therefore, that one possible explanation for the post-lysis activation of caspases seen with activated PBLs might be the presence of GraB in the cytolytic subpopulation of T-lymphocytes (40Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GraB is stored in granules within cytolytic T-cells and secreted during cytolytic T-cell-mediated killing of target cell. GraB is a direct activator of caspase-3 (32Quan L.T. Tewari M. O'Rourke K.

Furthermore, GraB expression is induced following T-cell activation (50Haddad P. Wargnier A. Bourge J.F. Sasportes M. Paul P. Eur. J.

To ascertain if the activation of caspases after PBL cell lysis is mediated by GraB, activated PBLs were lysed in RIPA buffer in the presence or absence of anti-GraB, an engineered form of the serpin antichymotrypsin which has been converted to a highly specific inhibitor of GraB (32Quan L.T. Tewari M. O'Rourke K. Dixit V. Snipas S.J. Poirier G.G. Ray C. Pickup D.J. Salvesen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1972-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, RIPA lysates of activated PBLs contained DEVD-AFC cleavaging activity (Fig. 4 A), which correlated with the presence of the p24- and p20-processed fragments of caspase-3 in extracts (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). In contrast, when the cell lysis was performed in the presence of anti-GraB, the hydrolysis of DEVD-AFC was nearly completely abrogated, and processing of caspase-3 to the p24 and p20 fragments was inhibited (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). Activated T-cells treated with etoposide and lysed in RIPA contained the p24 and p20 fragments of caspase-3, as well as the p17 form of the fully processed large subunit of the mature enzyme (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). Lysis of these cells in the presence of anti-GraB blocked the formation of the p24 and p20 fragments, but the p17 form remained (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). Accordingly, although Z-DEVD-AFC cleavage activity was partially inhibited by lysis of etoposide-treated PBLs in the presence of GraB, some protease activity remained, presumably reflecting the etoposide-induced processing of caspase-3 to the p17 mature isoform. These results suggest that anti-GraB inhibits the post-lysis processing of caspase-3 but does not interfere with the pre-lysis activation of caspases that was induced by etoposide. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that T-cells express other granzymes besides GraB which might also possess aspartic acid specificity and which could serve as targets of the anti-GraB protein. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that release liberation of GraB or similar proteases from cytotoxic granules during the lysis procedure results in artifactual activation of caspase-3. In this regard, lysates prepared with RIPA buffer contained more caspase activity than those generated with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, suggesting that RIPA may disrupt GraB-containing granules more efficiently. Moreover, in these experiments, GraB activated caspases-3 and -7, and the activated caspases cleaved their substrates such as PARP, D4-GDI, and PKCδ even though the lysates were kept at 0–4 °C. These observations thus highlight the importance of choosing appropriate lysis buffers for processing of cells and tissues if post-lysis activation of caspases is to be avoided. Of potential relevance, GraB-containing lymphocytes can be found in various tissues of both lymphoid and non-lymphoid origin and in both physiological and pathological situations (53Kummer J.A.

Therefore, the presence of GraB should be taken into consideration in studies involving regulation of apoptosis or caspase activation in such tissues. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that other proteases might activate caspases after cell lysis. In this regard, cathepsin G and subtilisin have recently been reported to activate caspase-7 (45Zhou Q. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate that activated PBLs do not normally produce active caspase-3-like proteases under circumstances where apoptosis does not occur and warn about of the proper selection of lysis buffers for studies of GraB-containing cell populations.

Here we show that the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was associated with the insulin receptor (IR) at the basal level. Activation of IR by insulin resulted in a rapid and transient increase of tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, its substrates IRS-1 and Shc, and also of SHP-1. This was then followed by a rapid dephosphorylation of these molecules, which was related to the insulin-induced increase of SHP-1 association to IR and of SHP-1 activity. On the other hand, addition to insulin of the somatostatin analogue, RC160, resulted in a higher and faster increase of SHP-1 association to IR directly correlated with an inhibition of phosphorylation of IR and its substrates, IRS-1 and Shc. RC160 also induced a higher and more sustained increase in SHP-1 activity. Furthermore, RC160 completely suppressed the effect of insulin on SHP-1 phosphorylation. Finally, in CHO cells coexpressing sst2 and a catalytically inactive mutant SHP-1, insulin as well as RC160 could no longer stimulate SHP-1 activity. Overexpression of the SHP-1 mutant prevented the insulin-induced signaling to be terminated by dephosphorylation of IR, suppressed the inhibitory effect of RC160 on insulin-induced IR phosphorylation, and abolished the cell proliferation modulation by insulin and RC160. Our results suggest that SHP-1 plays a role in negatively modulating insulin signaling by association with IR. Furthermore, somatostatin inhibits the insulin-induced mitogenic signal by accelerating and amplifying the effect of SHP-1 on the termination of the insulin signaling pathway.

Somatostatin is a neuropeptide localized in numerous mammalian tissues. It exerts pleiotropic biological processes including neurotransmission, inhibition of hormonal and hydroelectrolytic secretions, and cell proliferation. This neuropeptide induces its biological effects by interacting with specific receptors that belong to the seven-transmembrane domain receptor superfamily. Five receptors have been recently cloned (sst1–5) and shown to mediate a variety of signal transduction pathways as inhibition of adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase, modulation of ionic conductance channels, and protein dephosphorylation (1Yamada T.

Among the five somatostatin receptors, it has recently been shown that sst2 selectively mediates the inhibitory effect of somatostatin analogues on serum- or insulin-induced cell proliferation by a mechanism involving stimulation of a PTPase in NIH 3T3 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing sst2 (14Buscail L.

Recent studies have revealed that SHP-1 associates with sst2 and becomes activated in response to somatostatin, suggesting that SHP-1 may be part of the antiproliferative signal promoted by sst2 (17Lopez F.

SHP-1, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing intracellular PTPase, is predominantly expressed in multiple hematopoietic lineages and to a lesser degree in epithelial cells (18Shen S.H. Bastien L.

This enzyme has been described to interact with numerous activated growth factor, cytokine, and antigen receptors. It is also implicated in the negative regulation of various immunoreceptor transduction pathways by dephosphorylating and inactivating these receptors or their cognate substrates (22Tomic S.

Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The essential role of SHP-1 as a negative regulator of hematopoietic cell signal transduction is consistent with the multiple defects in hematopoietic cells observed in motheaten mice characterized by mutations in the SHP-1 gene and loss of SHP-1 activity (26Shultz L.D.

The identification of substrates of SHP-1 is essential for understanding the negative growth signal promoted by sst2. Because activated sst2 inhibits the mitogenic signal promoted by insulin, the insulin receptor is a potential candidate. Thus, we analyzed the early steps occurring downstream of activation of insulin receptor and sst2 in CHO cells expressing sst2. Our data suggest that SHP-1 is one negative regulator of the insulin signaling, and that upon activation, sst2 negatively modulates insulin signaling by accelerating and amplifying the regulatory functions of SHP-1. Monoclonal anti-SHP-1 and anti-Shc antibodies and polyclonal anti-IRβ (β subunit of insulin receptor (IR)) antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-IRS-1 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) antibodies were from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology. RC-160 was a kind gift from Dr A. V. Schally (Tulane University, New Orleans, LA). The 1.2-kilobase XbaI fragment of mouse sst2A cDNA subcloned into pCMV6c vector was stably co-transfected in CHO (DG44 variant) cells using Lipofectin reagent with pSV2neoas described previously (Dr. G.

Stable transfectants were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing geneticin at 600 μg/ml.

The 2.1-kilobase HindIII/NotI fragment of human SHP-1 cDNA (Dr. M. L.

The SHP-1(C453S) mutant was constructed with the oligonucleotide primer 5′-GAT GCC AGC GCT GGA ATG CAC AAT-3′ by using the method of Kunkel et al. (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

The mouse sst2 gene in the pCMV6c vector was stably co-transfected in CHO cells using Lipofectin reagent with the SHP-1(C453S) mutant in pcDNA I neo. Stable colonies obtained by selection with G418 (600 μg/ml) were screened for somatostatin binding and cellular clones expressing somatostatin binding sites at similar levels to CHO/sst2 clones were screened for the presence of SHP-1 using Western blot analysis as described below. CHO-DG44 stably expressing the cloned mouse sst2 (CHO/sst2) or sst2 and SHP-1(C453S) (CHO/sst2-SHP-1(C453S)) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (αMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum and G418 (200 μg/ml) as described previously (14Buscail L.

After an overnight attachment phase, cells were serum-starved in αMEM for 18 h before peptide addition. For cell growth assay, cells were cultured in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and plated in 35-mm diameter dishes at 75 × 103 cells/ml (2 ml/dish). After an attachment phase, cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight (time 0), and then medium was replaced by fresh αMEM containing 100 nm insulin with or without different concentrations of RC-160. Cell growth was measured after a 24-h treatment by cell counting with a Coulter counter model ZM (Coulter Electronics) as described previously (15Buscail L. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Bertrand V.

Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7) and then with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4). Cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin. After a 15-min incubation at 4 °C, the lysate was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. For immunodetection of association of SHP-1 with the β subunit of insulin receptor, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.03% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate (pH 7.8). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was solubilized in 500 μl of lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C, and the lysate was then collected and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated with either monoclonal antibodies coupled to protein G-Sepharose or polyclonal antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose during 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with a 30 mm HEPES buffer containing 30 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), boiled for 5 min in 50 μl of sample buffer (4.5 mmNa2HPO4, 2.7%, SDS, 9% glycerol, 10% bromphenol blue/β-mercaptoethanol). The proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in saline buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, 14 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 5% non-fat dry milk and blotted with specific antibodies for 3 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL immunodetection system (Amersham Corp.). Cells were plated in 100-mm diameter dishes for 48 h, then treated with 100 nminsulin with or without 1 nm RC-160 for various times. The cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 2.5% CHAPS, 0.5 mg/ml cholesterol hemisuccinate, 0.05% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Soluble proteins (300 μg) were incubated with anti-SHP-1 antibody prebound to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed once with a buffer (0.2% CHAPS, 0.05 mg/ml cholesterol hemisuccinate, 0.05% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.3% bovine serum albumin), and once with PTPase buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mg/ml bacitracin, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The immune complexes were then collected for PTPase activity in 300 μl of PTPase buffer. The reaction was initiated by addition of 30,000 cpm of33P-poly(Glu, Tyr) prepared as described in Buscail et al. (15Buscail L. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A.M. Bell G.I.

One unit of PTPase activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that released 1 pmol of phosphate/min at 30 °C from the radiolabeled substrate. We previously reported that, in CHO cells expressing sst2, RC160 inhibited the mitogenic effect of insulin by a mechanism involving the stimulation of a PTPase (15Buscail L. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A.M. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To assess whether SHP-1 plays a role in somatostatin-induced inhibition of insulin signaling, CHO/sst2 cells were incubated in the presence of 100 nm insulin with or without 1 nm RC160 for various times. SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-SHP-1 antibodies, and then the PTPase activity was examined in SHP-1 immunoprecipitates. As previously reported on the CCL39 fibroblast cell line (28Rivard N. McKenzie F.R. Brondello J.-M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), insulin caused a stimulation of SHP-1 activity in CHO/sst2 cells (Fig.1 A). A slight increase (20%, p < 0.02) was detected after 1 and 3 min of insulin treatment, with a maximal increase (70%) being observed at 10 min. Addition of RC160 in the incubation medium also resulted in an increase of SHP-1 activity, but the intensity and the time course of the stimulation were different from those observed with insulin alone. The stimulation of SHP-1 activity reached a maximum of about 170% of control as early as 1 min after RC160 addition and remained elevated for at least 10 min. The RC160-induced stimulation of SHP-1 activity was dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B). It was observed at concentrations of RC160 in relation to its affinity for the sst2 receptor (15Buscail L. Estève J.P. Saint L.N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A.M. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Indeed, half-maximal and maximal stimulation occurred at 23 ± 4.9 pm and 1 nm RC160, respectively. As reported previously for the effect of analogues on tyrosine phosphatase activity (13Colas B. Cambillau C. Buscail L. Zeggari M. Estève J.P. Lautre V. Thomas F. Vaysse N. Susini C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Buscail L. Delesque N.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the stimulation of SHP-1 was decreased at 10 nm RC160. This could account for the coupling of sst2 to phospholipase C at concentrations higher than 1 nm (29Akbar M. Okajima F. Tomura H. Majid M.A. Yamada Y. Sino S. Kondo Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results indicate that SHP-1 is a common target for insulin- as well as somatostatin-activated receptors and that activation of sst2 by RC160 leads to a rapid stimulation of SHP-1, which was more sustained and more efficient than that observed with insulin alone. Several growth factors are known to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1, and insulin has been shown to phosphorylate SHP-1 on Tyr536 in a lymphoma cell line (30Uchida T. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Horita K. Suzuki T. Fujioka Y. Sakamoto C. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12220-12228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of insulin and somatostatin on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1, we performed Western blotting of SHP-1 immunoprecipitates with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-SHP-1 antibodies. Our immunoblots revealed that SHP-1 was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin (Fig.2). Maximal stimulation of SHP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin (2-fold increase) was reached at 1 min and decreased up to 10 min in our time course. Addition of RC160 to insulin-stimulated cells completely suppressed the stimulatory effect of insulin on SHP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. A maximal inhibitory effect of RC160 was observed at 3 min, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 being significantly lower than the control level (p < 0.002). These results indicate that SHP-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated following the activation of the insulin receptor and that this effect is suppressed by RC160. The IR is a heterotetrameric transmembrane tyrosine kinase. Binding of insulin to the extracellular receptor α subunit results in the rapid autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the IRβ, activating receptor tyrosine kinase activity toward endogenous substrates (31Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens Liao Y-C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar, 32White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cheatam B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142PubMed Google Scholar). These early steps of insulin action are believed to be crucial for the propagation of the insulin signal. Since SHP-1 appears to be a substrate of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, we examined whether SHP-1 interacts with IRβ. The possible association of SHP-1 with IR was assessed by looking for the presence of IRβ in SHP-1 immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated cells cultured with or without 1 nm RC160 for various periods of time. As seen in Fig. 3, in resting cells, there was a detectable association of SHP-1 with IRβ. Following insulin stimulation of the cells, the amount of SHP-1 associated with IRβ did not change at 1 min of insulin treatment but increased by 2-fold above control levels (p < 0.02) within 3–10 min of treatment. When insulin-stimulated cells were treated with RC160, we observed different kinetics of the association of SHP-1 with IRβ. Within 1 min of RC160 treatment, the amount of SHP-1 associated with IRβ was 3-fold higher than control (p < 0.002) and remained elevated up to 10 min. Thus, insulin induces an association of SHP-1 with IRβ, and the major effect of RC160 is a change in the kinetics and the magnitude of insulin-induced SHP-1-IRβ interaction, which is induced more rapidly and efficiently. Since autophosphorylation of IRβ is one of the initial signaling events after binding of insulin to its receptor and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase, we examined whether the phosphorylated IRβ could be a target of SHP-1. Insulin-stimulated cells were treated or not with 1 nm RC160, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-β subunit of IR antibody and then immunoblotted with either the polyclonal anti-IRβ or the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 95-kDa β subunit of insulin receptor was barely detectable in control CHO/sst2 cells but in response to insulin stimulation, IRβ became highly tyrosine phosphorylated with a maximal level at 1 min (Fig.4). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ was transient and rapidly decreased by 60–70% at 3 and 10 min (p < 0.001). Thus the recruitment of SHP-1 to IRβ was followed by the dephosphorylation of IRβ. Addition of 1 nm RC160 to insulin-stimulated cells strikingly decreased the effect of insulin on IRβ tyrosine phosphorylation. The time course for RC160-induced IRβ dephosphorylation correlates well with that for RC160-induced SHP-1-IRβ association. Indeed, the phosphorylation of IRβ was maximally reduced by 80% (p < 0.001) at 1 min of RC160 treatment and the inhibitory effect of RC160 was sustained up to 10 min. The effect of RC160 was dose-dependent. Half-maximal and maximal effects were observed with 16 ± 6 pm and 1 nmRC160, respectively, the effect of RC160 being reversed at higher concentration. Furthermore, RC160 inhibition of insulin-stimulated IRβ tyrosine phosphorylation was reversed by pretreatment of cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, orthovanadate, at 1 μm for 15 min (data not shown). Our results indicate that, first, the dephosphorylation of the activated IR is correlated with the association of SHP-1 with IR. Second, the RC160-mediated prevention of insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IR is time-related with the RC160-induced increase of SHP-1-IR association. This suggests that SHP-1 is a common target of insulin and somatostatin receptors and acts as a negative regulator of IR. The two best characterized substrates for IRβ kinase have been identified as the 185-kDa protein termed IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1) and the adaptator protein Shc (Src homology 2/α-collagen related), which are required for the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing proteins (reviewed in Refs. 34Sun X.J.

We also next investigated whether RC160-activated SHP-1 could affect the phosphorylation levels of these two IRβ target proteins. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots on either IRS-1 or Shc immunoprecipitates revealed IRS-1 to be hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine by insulin treatment (Fig. 5). The time course of insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was comparable to that of IRβ phosphorylation seen in Fig. 4. IRS-1 phosphorylation peaked at 1 min and then decreased by about 50% (p < 0.001) up to 10 min. Cells treated with insulin in the presence of 1 nm RC160 exhibited reduced IRS-1 phosphorylation in comparison with insulin alone, RC160 inducing an inhibition of about 50% of the level of insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation, throughout the 10-min time course. When cells were preincubated with 1 μm vanadate for 15 min prior RC160 treatment, the inhibitory effect of RC160 was completely blocked and the level of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was similar to that observed with insulin alone (data not shown). The decrease of IRS-1 phosphorylation in response to increasing concentrations of RC160 indicated that half-maximal and maximal effects were obtained with 14 ± 8 pm and 1 nm RC160, respectively, the effects of RC160 being decreased at 10 nm RC160 (data not shown). We then examined whether the phosphorylation of Shc was also altered by insulin and RC160. Shc is an SH2 domain-containing protein found as two dominant, widely expressed forms of 46 and 52 kDa as well as a 66-kDa form with a more restricted expression. Shc proteins act as adaptator proteins in signaling pathways generating from diverse stimuli. Shc phosphorylation was detected in the basal state, and insulin stimulated by about 2-fold the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc with a slower time course compared with that of IRβ and IRS-1 as previously reported (36Sasaoka T.

In contrast to tyrosine kinase receptors such as the platelet-derived growth factor and the hepatocyte growth factor receptors, which induce p125Fakphosphorylation, insulin has been shown to promote its dephosphorylation. In this study, we compared p125Fakphosphorylation in insulin-stimulated cells maintained in suspension or in an adhesion state. We found that, in nonattached cells, insulin promotes p125Fak phosphorylation, whereas dephosphorylation occurred in attached cells. This was observed in Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing the insulin receptor, as well as in Hep G2 hepatocytes and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing more natural levels of insulin receptors. Insulin-induced p125Fak phosphorylation correlated with an increase in paxillin phosphorylation, indicating that p125Fak kinase activity may be stimulated by insulin. Mixing of purified insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors with p125Fak resulted in an increase in p125Fak phosphorylation. Using a kinase-deficient p125Fak mutant, we found that this protein is a direct substrate of the insulin and IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinases. This view is supported by two additional findings. (i) A peptide corresponding to p125Fak sequence comprising amino acids 568–582, which contains tyrosines 576 and 577 of the kinase domain regulatory loop, is phosphorylated by the insulin receptor; and (ii) p125Fak phosphorylation by the insulin receptor is prevented by addition of this peptide. Finally, we observed that p125Fak phosphorylation by the receptor results in its activation. Our results show that the nature of the cross-talk between the insulin/IGF-I receptors and p125Fak is dependent on the cell architecture, and hence the interaction of the insulin/IGF-I signaling system with the integrin system will vary accordingly.

IRS-1 is also found to be associated with Csk, the C-terminal Src kinase that is an inhibitor of the Src kinase family. It has been shown recently that the insulin-induced complex of IRS-1 and Csk could be involved in dephosphorylation of p125Fak observed after insulin treatment of fibroblasts (35Tobe K. Sabe H. Yamamoto T. Yamauchi T. Asai S. Kaburagi Y. Tamemoto T. Ueki K. Kimura H. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Hanafusa H. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fact that insulin induces p125Fak dephosphorylation suggests the existence of an antagonistic action of insulin on the integrin signaling pathway. However, examples of cooperation between insulin and integrin signals have been reported. For instance, stimulation of DNA synthesis by insulin is potentiated by engagement of the αvβ3 integrin. Moreover, insulin promotes the association of IRS-1 with this integrin, which is indicative of a putative role for IRS-1 in the cooperation between the two signaling pathways (36Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies indicate that conjunction of insulin or IGF-I activation with integrin engagement plays an important role in dissemination of tumor cells (37Brooks P.C. Klemke R.L. Schön S.

In the present work, we show that the effect of insulin on p125Fak phosphorylation depends on the adhesion status of the cells. Indeed, in nonattached cells insulin stimulates p125Fak phosphorylation, whereas in attached cells it induces its dephosphorylation. In addition, we provide several lines of evidence for the view that p125Fak is a direct substrate of the insulin receptor and the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinases, and that cross-phosphorylation of p125Fak by a tyrosine kinase receptor results in its activation. This may explain the positive cooperation occurring between integrins and insulin/IGF-I signaling pathways. p125Fak cDNA, inserted at the EcoRI site into pBluescript (KS−), was a generous gift from Dr. Thomas J.

Breittmayer J.-P. Ballotti R. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11449-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 293 EBNA cells are human embryo kidney cells, which constitutively express the EBNA-I protein from Epstein-Barr virus, and Hep G2 is a cell line derived from human hepatocyte carcinoma (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). These cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 10 mm glutamine. All transfected cells were maintained in 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS and 10 mm glutamine and were induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (39Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded into six-well plates or into 100 mm-diameter dishes and grown until confluence. They were starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10 mmglutamine before use. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Transformer™ kit from CLONTECH. The two primers (Genset, Paris, France) were CCg CTC TAg AAC TAg Tgg gCC CCC Cgg gCT gC, which changes the BamHI site for ApaI in the pBKS polylinker, and ggC TgT AgC AAT CAg AAC ATg TAA AAA CTg C, which replaced Lys-454 with Arg in p125Fak. The manufacturer's instructions were followed without modifications. The mutated plasmid was amplified into XL-1Blue Escherichia colistrain, and the mutation was checked by sequence analysis. The cDNA was subcloned into pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen) by excision at the sites NheI and XhoI and ligation between the sites XbaI and XhoI of pCEP4. Cells were trypsinized and seeded at 250,000 cells/well of a six-well plate 2 days before use. Transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Chen and Okayama (40Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (1 μg/well) was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with 0.25 mCaCl2 and BES. This solution was added dropwise to the cells, which were incubated overnight at 35 °C under 3% CO2. Cells were starved for 15 h before use in DMEM containing 0.2% BSA (w/v). Insulin was added to the cells at a final concentration of 0.1 μm. After the indicated time periods, insulin was removed by two washes in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF (stop buffer). Cells were solubilized for 30 min on ice in the above buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (20 μm leupeptin, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C before being added for 4 h at 4 °C to antibodies to p125Fak (1 μg/500 μg of protein) preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose. Pellets were washed three times in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 3% (w/v) SDS and 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% resolving gel before Western blot analysis. In some experiments, we performed immunoprecipitation using antibodies to p125Fak and antibodies to paxillin mixed on protein G-Sepharose (1 and 1.5 μg/500 μg of protein, respectively). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm EDTA, and detached gently from the dishes using a rubber policeman. They were washed once in PBS. Cells were maintained in suspension in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of insulin (0.1 μm) for the indicated time periods. Cells were dipped into ice, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and washed twice with stop buffer. Cell solubilization and immunoprecipitation of lysates were performed as described above using antibodies to p125Fak mixed or not with antibodies to paxillin. We used 293 EBNA cells transiently transfected with the plasmids encoding wild-type or kinase-deficient p125Fak (p125Fak/K454R). Cells were washed twice and solubilized in lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Cleared lysates were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with antibodies to p125Fak (1 μg/200 μg of protein) preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose. Pellets were washed three times in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and resuspended into this buffer. Insulin or IGF-I receptors, partially purified by chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin, were stimulated by insulin or IGF-I (0.1 μm) for 30 and 15 min, respectively. Where indicated, insulin and IGF-I receptors were purified by immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. The receptors were mixed with pellets containing the immunoprecipitated p125Fak. Phosphorylation mix was added to each sample (50 mm MgCl2, 60 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 mCi/mmol)) for 15 min at 22 °C. In some experiments, the reaction was stopped by addition of 4-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer. In other experiments, the reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100), and pellets were washed twice in this buffer before SDS-PAGE analysis. Samples were submitted to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane following the method of Towbin et al.(41Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with saline buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) BSA for 4 h at 22 °C. Antibodies to phosphotyrosine (1 μg/ml) were added in blocking buffer for 15 h at 4 °C. Several washes were performed using the saline buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20. Rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (1 μg/ml) were added for 1 h at 22 °C in blocking buffer, followed by several washes. The membrane was then incubated with 125I-protein A (250,000 cpm/ml) for 1 h at 22 °C. After several washes, the membrane was autoradiographed. The peptide corresponding to p125Fak amino acids 568–582 (SRYMEDSTYYKASKG) was synthesized by Eurogentec (Belgium). The insulin receptor kinase activity toward this peptide was measured as follows. Partially purified insulin receptors were incubated without or with insulin (0.1 μm) for 60 min at 22 °C in a final volume of 40 μl containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Increasing peptide concentrations were added to the receptors. Phosphorylation was initiated by addition of 15 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 mCi/mmol), 8 mm MgCl2, 4 mmMnCl2. The reaction was stopped by spotting a constant volume of each sample onto phosphocellulose papers, which were dipped into 1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid. Papers were washed extensively, and 32P incorporation into the peptide was quantified by Cerenkov counting. The reaction was found to be linear for at least 2 h. We wished to investigate whether the effect of insulin on p125Fak phosphorylation depends on cellular adhesion. To test this, we compared attached RHIR (Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing the insulin receptor) with RHIR in suspension, a condition that causes disassembly of focal adhesion plaques and p125Fakdephosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p125Fak was revealed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies to p125Fak, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. In attached RHIR cells (Fig. 1, top panel), insulin induced rapid dephosphorylation of p125Fak. These data are in accordance with previous studies reporting p125Fak dephosphorylation in response to insulin in quiescent cultures of fibroblasts or CHO cells (21Knight J.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10199-10203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Pillay T.S. Sasaoka T. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). No effect could be seen in parental cells, or in cells expressing kinase-deficient insulin receptors, indicating that p125Fakdephosphorylation is due to overexpression of a functional insulin receptor (data not shown). To determine if the effect of insulin on p125Fak phosphorylation is also observed in cells that express physiological levels of endogenous insulin receptors, we performed similar experiments in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in Hep G2 hepatocytes (Fig. 1, middle and bottom panels). As shown, insulin stimulation of Hep G2 hepatocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes also resulted in dephosphorylation of p125Fak. Fig. 2 shows experiments in which cells were gently detached, maintained in suspension for 30 min, and subsequently stimulated with insulin. In these conditions, we observed only a weak phosphorylation of p125Fak in unstimulated cells. Interestingly, insulin induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125Fak, both in RHIR and in Hep G2 hepatocytes. Phosphorylation of p125Fak was undetectable in nonattached 3T3-L1 adipocytes, although this could be due to low levels of protein expression (data not shown). Quantification of p125Fak phosphorylation was performed to compare the time-courses (Fig. 3). Dephosphorylation of p125Fak in attached RHIR cells was maximal at 15 min and returned to initial phosphorylation level within 2 h. The decrease in p125Fak phosphorylation reached 67.5 ± 5% of control after 15 min of insulin treatment. The time dependence shown here is consistent with previously published results (21Knight J.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10199-10203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). No major difference was observed between the three cell lines (see Fig. 1). In contrast, the time course of p125Fakphosphorylation in detached cells was different in RHIR and Hep G2 cells. Indeed, stimulation was observed within 2 min and was maximal between 5 and 10 min in RHIR cells. At 5 min, we measured a 4-fold induction of p125Fak phosphorylation. Phosphorylation decreased rapidly and returned to basal levels within 30 min. In Hep G2 hepatocytes, p125Fak phosphorylation reached its maximal level after 30 min (6-fold induction), but fully persisted until at least 60 min. As a whole, our data indicate that the effect of insulin on the phosphorylation of p125Fak is regulated by integrin engagement. Interestingly, insulin has opposite effects compared with other growth factors such as bombesin, which induces p125Fak phosphorylation in attached cells but not in cells maintained in suspension (43Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It should be noted that stimulation of p125Fakphosphorylation was also observed in detached NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing IGF-I receptors, whereas dephosphorylation was observed in attached cells, indicating that insulin and IGF-I have similar effects (data not shown). We were then interested to approach the mechanism of p125Fak phosphorylation seen in cells exposed to insulin or IGF-I. The simplest explanation could be that, in these cells, p125Fak is directly activated by insulin or IGF-I receptors, leading to its autophosphorylation. To test this, p125Fak was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated cells. Concomitantly, immunopurified insulin or IGF-I receptors were activated or not by their respective ligand. The receptors and p125Fak were then mixed together, and [γ-32P]ATP was added to the samples. As shown in Fig.4 A, autophosphorylation of p125Fak in the absence of insulin receptor was detected (first lane). The unstimulated receptor did not modify p125Fak phosphorylation (second lane). By contrast, addition of insulin-activated receptor induced a 2.3-fold increase in the level of p125-Fak phosphorylation (third lane). When unstimulated IGF-I receptors were used, an increase in p125Fak phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 4 B, second lane compared with first lane). This is due to the high basal kinase activity and autophosphorylation levels of the IGF-I receptor in vitro that we have described previously (38Tartare S. Mothe I. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Breittmayer J.-P. Ballotti R. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11449-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I addition to the receptor further increased p125Fak phosphorylation (4.4-fold stimulation compared with control). We noticed that the intrinsic kinase activity of p125Fak was lower using the phosphorylation mixture suitable for the IGF-I receptor (i.e. containing 50 mm MgCl2). Therefore, further experiments using either the insulin or the IGF-I receptors were performed in these conditions. In summary, incubation of p125Fak with insulin receptor or IGF-I receptor results in an enhancement of p125Fakphosphorylation in vitro. In these experiments, the proteins were immunopurified, and therefore this process is unlikely to be due to an intermediate kinase. We can probably rule out the possibility that p125Fak coimmunoprecipitates with Src, since it has been shown that p125Fak and Src are not associated in resting cells. To determine whether this augmentation in p125Fakphosphorylation is due to direct phosphorylation of the protein by the receptors or to activation of p125Fak, we constructed a kinase-deficient mutant of p125Fak by substitution of Lys-454 to Arg (44Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We first compared the expression level and kinase activity of the mutant and wild-type proteins in transfected 293 EBNA cells. Protein expression was checked by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to p125Fak followed by p125Fakimmunoblotting with antibodies to p125Fak (Fig.5, left panel). The mock-transfected cells express low levels of endogenous p125Fak compared with both the wild-type and mutant-transfected cells. To measure p125Fak kinase activity, the proteins immunoprecipitated from transfected cells were submitted to autophosphorylation (Fig. 5, right panel). As expected, the wild-type protein was markedly phosphorylated, whereas the mutant protein did not show detectable kinase activity. Next, we looked for direct phosphorylation of the mutant p125Fak by the two tyrosine kinase receptors. The kinase-deficient p125Fak was overexpressed in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to p125Fak. Insulin receptors or IGF-I receptors, stimulated or not, were added to the p125Fak-containing pellets. Phosphorylation was performed using [γ-32P]ATP. After extensive washes, the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6). Since this p125Fak is kinase-deficient, no phosphorylation was detected in absence of receptors, or in presence of unstimulated receptors. However, phosphorylation of the kinase-dead protein occurred upon addition of ligand-stimulated receptors. Our results indicate that p125Fak is a direct substrate for the insulin and IGF-I receptors, at least in vitro. In some experiments, partially purified receptors were used, whereas in others, receptors were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies. No difference conc"

The antibody recognized imidazolysine and argpyrimidine and a glyoxal-derived lysine-lysine cross-link. It did not react with Nε-carboxymethyllysine. Incubations with amino acids revealed strongest reactivity with Nα-t-butoxycarbonylarginine and MG, and we identified argpyrimidine as one of the epitopes from this incubation mixture. Serum proteins from human diabetics reacted more strongly with the antibody than those from normal individuals, and the levels correlated with glycemic control. Collagen from human corneas contained MG-derived modifications, with those from older subjects containing higher levels of modified proteins than those from younger ones. An immunoaffinity-purified antibody showed higher reactivity with old corneas than with younger ones and localized the antigens primarily within the stromal region of the cornea.

Although formation of cross-linking structures by glyoxal occurs in vitro (29Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 30Wells-Knecht K.J. Zyzak D.V. Litchfield J.E. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3702-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), there is still no evidence for such cross-linking in vivo. Methylglyoxal (pyruvaldehyde) (MG) is an α-ketoaldehyde that originates from dephosphorylation of the glycolytic intermediates, polyol pathway metabolites and acetone (31Thornalley P.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 287-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Several tissues and plasma of diabetic individuals exhibit increased levels of MG (31Thornalley P.J. Mol.

Eye Res. 1994; 59: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). MG is a potential player in various pathological processes. It can modify amino acids, nucleic acids, and proteins (31Thornalley P.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 287-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 35Lo T.W.C. Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C.

Binding of MG-modified proteins to receptors on macrophages (37Westwood M.E. McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32293-32298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monocytic (THP-1) cells can induce cytokines such as interleukin-1β (38Westwood M.E. Thornalley P.J. Immunol.

Lett. 1996; 53: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We reported formation of an MG-derived lysine-lysine cross-link in proteins and showed that it could be formed in vivo (40Nagaraj R.H. Shipanova I.N. Faust F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19338-19345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We recently identified a major fluorescent arginine adduct derived from MG, but we have not yet shown it in tissue proteins (41Shipanova I.N. Glomb M.A. Nagaraj R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Ahmed et al.(42Ahmed M.U. Frye B. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) identified carboxyethyllysine, a lysine modification of MG in human lens proteins, and showed that it accumulated with aging. In addition to its protein-altering effects, MG is a potential mutagen. Carboxyethylguanine was identified as a modification caused by MG (43Papoulis A. al-Abed Y. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and other studies indicate that MG can damage cells (31Thornalley P.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 287-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that increased MG concentrations in diabetes alter various macromolecules, which, in turn, contribute to long term complications of diabetes. Additionally, chronic exposure to MG may deteriorate protein structure and cause progressive protein aging and age-associated impairments. To understand better the role of MG in protein modifications during aging and diabetes, we developed antibodies that recognize MG-derived modifications in human tissues and serum. These antibodies enabled us to identify MG-mediated Maillard reactions in vivo and to define further specific epitopes involved in the modified proteins. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), ascorbate, l-threose, MG (40% aqueous solution), Pronase E (from Streptomyces griseus), leucine aminopeptidase M (type IV-S from porcine kidney microsomes), carboxypeptidase A (type II from bovine pancreas), collagenase (type VII from Clostridium histolyticum), rabbit IgG, and pepsin (from porcine stomach mucosa) were obtained from Sigma. Ribonuclease A was from Boehringer Mannheim. Glyoxal (40% w/v) and dehydroascorbate were from Aldrich. 3-Deoxyglucosone was synthesized according to Madson and Feather (44Madson M.A. Feather M.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 94: 183-191Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 2,3-Diketogulonate was synthesized by the method of Otsuka et al. (45Otsuka M. Kurata T. Arawaka N. Fujimaki M. Namiki M. kato H. Aminocarbonyl Reactions in Food and Biological Systems. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1985: 1-74Google Scholar). Xylosone was a gift from Dr. Milton Feather, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO. MG was purified by vacuum distillation (46Perrin D.D. Purification of Laboratory Chemicals. 3rd Ed. Pergamon Press, New York1988Google Scholar). All other chemicals were commercially available reagents. Human corneas were kindly supplied by the Cleveland Eye Bank. Human plasma samples were obtained from the University Hospitals of Cleveland and volunteers. Nε-Carboxymethyllysine was a generous gift from Dr. John Baynes, University of South Carolina. Imidazolysine (also known as MOLD (methylglyoxal-lysine dimer) and GOLD (glyoxal-lysine dimer) were purified by methods described elsewhere (40Nagaraj R.H. Shipanova I.N. Faust F.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 60: 6246-6247Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). BSA and RNase A in PBS (both 100 mg/ml) were incubated with 50 mm MG (purified as described above) for 3 weeks at 37 °C under sterile conditions. Unbound MG was removed by dialysis against PBS, and the proteins, BSA-MG and RNase-MG, were lyophilized. Incubations were done over different time periods with BSA (50 mg/ml of 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and different concentrations of MG (0, 5, 10, and 25 mm). Aliquots were withdrawn on days 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 and dialyzed against 2 liters of PBS for 24 h. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized by subcutaneous injection with a total of 1.0 mg each of RNase-MG emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and boosted with injections in Freund's incomplete adjuvant every 2 weeks. After the fourth booster injection, the rabbits were bled, and the serum was separated. The IgG fraction was purified on a protein-G Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BSA-MG was coupled to EAH-Sepharose (Pharmacia) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 25 mg of BSA-MG in 4.0 ml of water was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 n HCl. This solution was added to a 3.25-ml suspension of EAH-Sepharose containing 40 mg of EDC. The mixture was shaken at room temperature for 2 h followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight. The gel was then packed in a column and washed twice, first with 30 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0; buffer A) and then with 30.0 ml of 0.1 mTris/HCl (pH 8.0; buffer B), each containing 0.5 m NaCl. The gel was finally washed with 80.0 ml of PBS. The IgG fraction (obtained as described above) (0.5 ml) was mixed with the gel and reacted at 4 °C overnight while shaking. The gel was loaded onto a column and washed with 40.0 ml of PBS. 1-ml fractions were collected, and the absorption at 280 nm was recorded. When the absorbance reached base line, the column was eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.28), and 1-ml fractions were collected in glass tubes containing 150 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) to bring the pH to neutral. The protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of PBS and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, CA). The column was reused after sequential washing with buffers A and B. Microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg/well BSA-MG in PBS for 2 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. The wells were blocked with 300 μl of 3% BSA in PBS for 1.5 h and washed twice with PBS. Direct ELISA used 50 μl of the diluted antibody, and competitive ELISA used diluted antibody that was preincubated with the test sample for 1 h at 37 °C before addition to the plate. After incubation for 2 h and washing four times with PBS, the plates were developed for 2 h with 1:60,000 diluted goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase, washed four times with PBS, and incubated with 100 μl of substrate (p-nitrophenylphosphate) in 1.0m diethylamine with 0.5 m MgCl2 and 0.2% sodium azide (pH 9.8). Samples were incubated for 1.0–1.5 h at 37 °C until A410 nm reached 0.6–0.8. The plates were read on a Dynatech microplate reader (model MR 5000, Dynatech Laboratories, Inc., Chantilly, VA). 50 mm Nα-acetyllysine or Nα-acetylarginine alone or in combination was incubated with a 50 mm concentration of the designated carbohydrate in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 0, 3, 7, and 21 days. Carbohydrates were glucose, fructose, 3-deoxyglucosone, d-ribose, dl-glyceraldehyde, MG, glyoxal, ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, 2,3-diketogulonate,l-xylosone, and l-threose. BSA (50 mg/ml) in 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was incubated with 100 mm glucose, fructose, ribose, MG, glyoxal, glyceraldehyde, ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, 2,3-diketogulonate, or l-threose at 37 °C. The samples were incubated for 2 weeks, except those containing glucose and fructose, which were incubated for 1 month. The protein from each incubation was dialyzed against PBS for 48 h and lyophilized. Collagen was isolated from human corneas by scraping off the endothelial and epithelial layers and mincing the remaining tissue. The mince was suspended in 3.0 ml of PBS and homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) three times for 10 s each at a speed setting of 8. This homogenate was lyophilized, and the dried sample was extracted twice with 1.5 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 m NaCl by stirring overnight at room temperature and centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (Brinkmann Instruments). The supernatant fraction was discarded from each extraction. The pellet was then extracted twice with 3.0 ml of 0.5 m acetic acid (stirring at 4 °C) followed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g. The supernatant fraction was discarded, and the pellet was lyophilized, reconstituted in 10% pepsin (w/w) in 0.4m acetic acid, and stirred overnight at 4 °C. Centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 90 min separated the pepsin-soluble fraction (supernatant) and the pepsin-insoluble fraction (pellet). The pepsin-insoluble fraction was then digested with 1% collagenase (w/w) in 0.02 m HEPES containing 0.1m CaCl2 at 37 °C for 16 h. The digested material was filtered through a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff centrifugal filter (Gelman Sciences). Amino acid estimation, withl-leucine as the standard, was done by the ninhydrin reaction method of Moore and Stein (48Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 907-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to 0.2 μmol of leucine equivalent were used for competitive ELISA in which the antibody was reacted with corneal collagen extract for 1 h at 37 °C before addition to the microplate. Human corneas were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were cut in a microtome. The sections were deparafinized with xylene and hydrated in a series of increasing water concentrations in ethyl alcohol. They were allowed to stand in water for 3 min and washed twice with PBS before blocking with 10% goat serum for 1 h in a humid chamber. The sections were then reacted overnight at 4 °C with IgG specific for MG modifications (1:500 dilution in 10% goat serum), washed three times (5 min each time) with PBS, and incubated with 20 μg/ml rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 1 h in a humid chamber. The sections were washed three times (5 min each time) with PBS and then further developed for 60 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma) (2.5 μg/ml). After washing three times (5 min each time) with PBS, the specimens were equilibrated for 10 min in Slow Fade buffer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), stabilized with one drop of Slow Fade antifading reagent, and mounted in Gel/Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). They were examined at a magnification of × 20 with a Zeiss LSM 410 scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an Axiovert 100 inverted microscope, an argon-krypton external laser, and rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 4.0 software for the Power Macintosh computer. Serum samples were obtained from 12 normal subjects (age range 22–50 years) and 12 diabetic patients (age range 45–75 years). Diabetic sera had glycated hemoglobin levels of more than 10% (range 10–18%), and controls had levels between 3.5 and 5%. Serum proteins were precipitated with an equal volume of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitate was treated with 5.0 ml of diethyl ether (5 min). The ether was evaporated, and the residue was desiccated and stored at −80 °C. The proteins (5 mg) were digested with Pronase E (2% w/w in 0.5 ml of PBS) for 16 h followed by another addition of Pronase E (2% w/w) and further incubation for 8 h. Further digestion was accomplished by 51 units of carboxypeptidase A and 50 units of leucine aminopeptidase M. The final digested material was filtered through a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Gelman Sciences). Amino acid estimation was by the ninhydrin reaction as described above. 100-μl samples were taken from each specimen for competitive ELISA. Human serum protein samples were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-gel (60 min, 40 mA, 13 μg of protein/lane). The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 90 V. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (blotto) in TBST (Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20) buffer (pH 7.0) overnight at 4 °C, reacted for 2 h with the immunoaffinity-purified antibody (1:2,500 diluted in blotto), washed three times (15 min each time) with TBST buffer, incubated for 1 h in blotto with 1:30,000 diluted anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), washed 8–10 times (10–15 min each time) with TBST buffer (10 min each time), then incubated with a 1:1 mixture of solution A and B (Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate kit; Pierce) for 3–5 min and exposed to x-ray film (reflection/autoradiography film from NEN Life Science Products). Data were analyzed by Student's t test, and the results were expressed as mean ± S.D. To establish specificity of the antibodies for MG-derived protein modifications, microplates were coated with 1 μg of BSA modified with 0, 5, 10, and 25 mm MG. The immunoreactivity of BSA-MG was directly related to the fluorescence (excitation/emission 370/440 nm) of the protein (Fig.1, upper panel), suggesting that antibody binding is directly proportional to AGE formation and that the fluorescent AGEs are antigenic epitopes. As can been seen in Fig. 1, lower panel, the immunoreactivity increased with time of incubation and MG concentration. The reaction was rapid initially at all three concentrations of MG and was maximal after 15 days. Thereafter, the slight decrease in reactivity might indicate extensive modification of the protein with decreased availability of epitopes. Nonspecific binding to carrier protein is unlikely because the plate was coated with BSA-MG, and the antibodies were directed against RNase-MG. Mixtures of Nα-acetyllysine or Nα-acetylarginine with various sugars, MG, glyoxal, and ascorbate oxidation products helped us to characterize the antibody with competitive ELISAs. In the incubations with Nα-acetyllysine, the antibody was inhibited slightly (10–20%) in incubation mixtures containing glucose, fructose, ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, and 2,3-diketogulonate and more in samples containing ribose, l-threose, MG, and glyoxal (10–30%) (Fig. 2 A). Samples combining Nα-acetylarginine with carbohydrates showed varying degrees of inhibition. The greatest inhibition was achieved in samples with MG (Fig. 2 B). A rapid formation of reactive antigens occurred in samples with MG, as revealed by 74% inhibition with the sample taken out immediately after starting the reaction. This inhibition declined to 62% on day 3 and stayed almost at that level throughout the incubation. Inhibition was also observed in samples containing glyceraldehyde (63% after 21 days of incubation); reactive antigens formed within 3 days and remained almost at that level. Other carbohydrates tested showed varying degrees of inhibition from 0 to 52%.Figure 2Characterization of antibody. Nα-Acetyllysine (aL) (panel A) or Nα-acetylarginine (aA) (panel B), or Nα-acetyllysine + Nα-acetylarginine (panel C) (50 mm each) was incubated with a 50 mm concentration of glucose, fructose, ribose, glyceraldehyde (GLD), MG, glyoxal, ascorbate, dehydroascorbate (DHA), 2,3-diketogulonate (DKG), or threose. Incubations were in 0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for up to 3 weeks; samples were tested for reactivity with antibody by the competitive ELISA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When incubations were carried out with Nα-acetyllysine, Nα-acetylarginine, and carbohydrates, the inhibition pattern was somewhat similar to that of samples with Nα-acetylarginine and carbohydrates, but there was an additive effect (Fig. 2 C). Samples with MG were inhibited nearly 100%. This occurred in samples taken out immediately after starting the reaction also, suggesting a very rapid formation of reactive antigens. This is not li"
https://openalex.org/W2019781203,"The major high affinity ligand for P-selectin on human leukocytes is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). To bind P-selectin, PSGL-1 must be modified with tyrosine sulfate and sialylated, fucosylated, core-2 O-glycan(s). The required sites for these modifications on full-length PSGL-1 have not been defined. The N-terminal region of mature PSGL-1, which begins at residue 42, includes tyrosines at residues 46, 48, and 51, plus potential sites for Thr-linked O-glycans at residues 44 and 57. We expressed full-length PSGL-1 constructs with substitutions of these residues in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. The cells were co-transfected with cDNAs for the glycosyltransferases required to construct sialylated and fucosylated, core-2O-glycans on PSGL-1. The transfected cells were assayed for their abilities to bind fluid-phase P-selectin and to support rolling adhesion of pre-B cells expressing P-selectin under hydrodynamic flow. In both assays, substitution of Thr-57 with alanine eliminated binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin without affecting sulfation of PSGL-1, whereas substitution with serine, to which an O-glycan might also be attached, did not affect binding. Binding was not altered by substituting alanines for the two amino acids on either side of Thr-57, or by substituting alanine for Thr-44. Substitution of all three tyrosines with phenylalanines markedly reduced sulfation and prevented binding to P-selectin. However, all constructs in which one or two tyrosines were replaced with phenylalanines bound P-selectin. These results suggest that full-length PSGL-1 requires an O-glycan attached to Thr-57 plus sulfation of any one of its three clustered tyrosines to bind P-selectin.

J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Instead, PSGL-1 must be sialylated and fucosylated on branched core-2 O-glycans to interact with selectins (25Li F. Wilkins P.P. Crawley S. Weinstein J. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Almost all of the O-glycans on PSGL-1 from HL-60 cells have core-2 structures, but only ≈14% of these glycans are fucosylated (27Wilkins P.P. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol.

This suggests that Ser/Thr-linked O-glycans may be modified in a site-specific manner.The O-glycans of PSGL-1 are not sulfated (22Wilkins P.P. Moore K.L. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol.

Enzymatic removal of sulfate, blockade of sulfation, or replacement of the three tyrosines with phenylalanines prevents binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin but not to E-selectin (22Wilkins P.P.

These data indicate that PSGL-1 must be modified with tyrosine sulfate as well as with specific O-glycan(s) to bind P-selectin. An important unresolved issue is which of the three tyrosine residues must be sulfated for PSGL-1 to bind P-selectin.The location of the O-glycan(s) on PSGL-1 required for binding to P-selectin is also unclear. An Ig chimera containing only residues 42–60 of PSGL-1 binds to P-selectin when it is co-expressed with an α1,3 fucosyltransferase (FTIII) in COS cells (24Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) or with core-2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT) and FTVII in CHO cells (28Goetz D.J. Greif D.M. Ding H.

This small N-terminal sequence contains two potential sites for attachment of O-glycans at residues 44 and 57. Substitution of Thr-57 with alanine in this Ig chimera decreases binding to both P- and E-selectin (24Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). When co-expressed with FTVII in COS cells, a membrane-anchored form of PSGL-1 with residues 38–57 attached directly to residue 118 of the extracellular domain mediates cell adhesion to immobilized P-selectin. Replacement of Thr-44 and Thr-57 with alanines decreases but does not eliminate adhesion (23Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The limited mutational analysis of these truncated chimeras suggests that O-glycans located at Thr-44 and Thr-57 participate in binding to P-selectin. However, a key unanswered question is whether these residues are required for P-selectin recognition in the context of full-length PSGL-1, in which fucosylated O-glycans attached to other residues might have equal or greater importance.In this study we examined how substitutions of the N-terminal clustered tyrosines or the adjacent potential sites for O-glycan addition affected binding of full-length PSGL-1 to P-selectin. We co-expressed each PSGL-1 construct with C2GnT and either FTIII or FTVII in CHO cells. Two complementary assays were used: binding of fluid-phase P-selectin to suspended CHO cells, and rolling of pre-B cells expressing P-selectin on CHO cell monolayers under hydrodynamic flow. Our results suggest that full-length PSGL-1 requires an O-glycan attached at Thr-57 plus sulfation of any one of its three clustered tyrosines to bind P-selectin.DISCUSSIONEarlier studies have suggested that P-selectin binds to a small N-terminal region on both native and recombinant PSGL-1 (15Moore K.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Previous analyses of specific residues required for binding have relied on truncated or chimeric forms of recombinant PSGL-1 (23Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 24Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). As a result, the key sites for tyrosine sulfation and O-glycosylation on full-length PSGL-1 have not been well characterized. We have co-expressed full-length PSGL-1 with C2GnT and either FTIII or FTVII in CHO cells. The recombinant PSGL-1, like native PSGL-1 on leukocytes, is tyrosine-sulfated and carries appropriately modified core-2O-glycans that promote high affinity binding to P-selectin (25Li F. Wilkins P.P. Crawley S. Weinstein J. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Here we show that PSGL-1 binds P-selectin when Thr-57 is replaced with serine, but not when it is replaced with alanine, suggesting that PSGL-1 requires an O-glycan attached to residue 57 to bind to P-selectin. We also show that any one of the three clustered tyrosines at residues 46, 48, and 51 is sufficient for binding to P-selectin. The PSGL-1 constructs that bind soluble P-selectin also support rolling of P-selectin-expressing cells under hydrodynamic flow, supporting the physiological relevance of the data.Residues 42–62 of PSGL-1 represent the first 21 amino acids in the mature molecule following cleavage of the signal peptide and propeptide (Fig. 1). This sequence has two threonines at residues 44 and 57 that are potential attachment sites for O-glycans. Substitution of Thr-44 with alanine had no effect on binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin, whereas substitution of Thr-57 with alanine eliminated binding. Substitution of Thr-57 with serine had no effect on binding, suggesting that an O-glycan attached to either a serine or threonine at this position might interact with P-selectin. the O-glycans of PSGL-1 require α2,3-linked sialic acid and α1,3-linked fucose on a core-2 backbone to mediate interactions with P-selectin (25Li F. Wilkins P.P. Crawley S. Weinstein J. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The fucosylated O-glycans of PSGL-1 from HL-60 cells are a mixture of short disialylated, monofucosylated core-2 heptasaccharides and long monosialylated, trifucosylated core-2 glycans with polylactosamine, both of which contain a terminal sLexdeterminant (27Wilkins P.P. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18732-18742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The structures of the fucosylated O-glycans on recombinant PSGL-1 may depend on the specific α1,3-FT that is co-expressed in CHO cells (25Li F. Wilkins P.P. Crawley S. Weinstein J. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Significantly, only a minority of the O-glycans on PSGL-1 from HL-60 cells are fucosylated (27Wilkins P.P. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18732-18742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that one of these fucosylated glycans is attached to Thr-57.We cannot formally exclude the possibility that loss of P-selectin binding to the T57A construct resulted from indirect effects on glycosylation at other sites. However, P-selectin bound normally to constructs in which the two tandem residues on either side of Thr-57 were replaced with alanines. This indicates that not all amino acid substitutions in this region affect binding. The sequence immediately surrounding Thr-57 is the core of the epitope for PL1, the IgG mAb that blocks binding to P-selectin. Consistent with this feature, PL1 did not detectably bind to the P55A/E56A and E58A/P59A constructs, each of which contains two substitutions in the middle of the core epitope. PL1 also bound less well to other PSGL-1 constructs with mutations in this region (T44A/T57A, T57A, and T57S/E61A).Previous studies have also examined specific residues on PSGL-1 to which key O-glycans might be attached. When co-expressed with FTIII in COS cells, an Ig chimera containing only residues 42–60 of PSGL-1 bound to P-selectin (24Sako D. Comess K.M. Barone K.M. Camphausen R.T. Cumming D.A. Shaw G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This sequence has only two potential O-glycosylation sites at Thr-44 and Thr-57. Substitution of Thr-57 with alanine in this Ig chimera markedly decreased binding to P-selectin. These results demonstrated that Thr-57 is required for P-selectin binding in this short construct. However, they did not indicate whether this residue is required for recognition in the context of full-length PSGL-1, in which many serines and threonines are glycosylated. This issue is critical, because PSGL-1 contains several fucosylated O-glycans that could potentially interact with selectins (27Wilkins P.P. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18732-18742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).When co-expressed with FTVII in COS cells, a shortened membrane-anchored form of PSGL-1 with residues 38–57 attached directly to residue 118 of the extracellular domain mediated cell adhesion to immobilized P-selectin (23Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Replacement of both Thr-44 and Thr-57 with alanines in the shortened PSGL-1 construct decreased, but did not eliminate, adhesion of transfected COS cells (23Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Because this shortened construct fused a small N-terminal fragment of PSGL-1 directly to the decameric consensus repeats, the juxtaposition of the two sequences may have altered local O-glycosylation, accounting for the residual adhesion despite the loss of the putative O-glycan at Thr-57 (23Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the site densities of immobilized P-selectin were not reported, and there was significant adhesion of transfected COS cells expressing only FTVII. Perhaps some of the residual adhesion of the T44A/T57A-transfected COS cells was mediated by non-PSGL-1-dependent interactions with high densities of immobilized P-selectin. In any event, the experiments with this chimeric molecule did not address the function of Thr-44 or Thr-57 in the context of full-length PSGL-1.We found that PSGL-1 constructs containing at least one of the three clustered tyrosines at residues 46, 48, or 51 bound soluble P-selectin and supported rolling of P-selectin-L1–2 cells under shear stress. These results indicate that only one tyrosine on each subunit of the PSGL-1 homodimer is required for binding, and suggest that each tyrosine can be sulfated under some conditions. Whether a single tyrosine sulfate presented on a monomeric form of PSGL-1 is sufficient for binding is unknown. More quantitative assays are required to determine whether the three tyrosines allow wild-type PSGL-1 to bind with higher affinity to P-selectin than do constructs with only one or two tyrosines. P-selectin-L1–2 cells detached slightly more easily from CHO cells expressing the Y46F/Y48F and Y48F/Y51F constructs than from cells expressing wild-type PSGL-1, but this could reflect subtle differences in site density or glycosylation among the constructs.It is noteworthy that murine PSGL-1 also has an N-terminal consensus sequence for tyrosine sulfation, but it has only two tyrosines rather than the three found in the human sequence (42Yang J. Galipeau J. Kozak C.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4176-4186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although several features of consensus sites for tyrosine sulfation have been described (43Niehrs C. Kraft M. Lee R.W.H. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8525-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tyrosine sulfation in some proteins is incomplete (44Mikkelsen J. Thomsen J. Ezban M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1533-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Further studies of the substrate specificity of the tyrosine protein sulfotransferase are needed to define the features required for optimal tyrosine sulfation. The current data do not establish whether there is preferential sulfation of specific tyrosines in wild-type PSGL-1. As expected, very little sulfate was attached to the Y46F/Y48F/Y51F construct. The small amount of residual sulfation may represent incorporation of [35S]sulfate into cysteine or methionine residues. Alternatively, the CHO cells may have attached minor quantities of labeled sulfate esters to newly synthesized N- or O-glycans (45Roux L. Holojda S. Sundblad G. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8879-8889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our results support a model in which P-selectin binds to a small N-terminal region of PSGL-1 that requires a sialylated and fucosylated, core-2 O-glycan at Thr-57 and a sulfate at Tyr-46, Tyr-48, or Tyr-51. Characterization of a specific glycan structure attached to Thr-57 is required to further support this model. Because any one of the tyrosines is sufficient for binding, there may be variability allowed in the distance between the tyrosine sulfate and the O-glycan. This raises the question as to whether P-selectin binds simultaneously or sequentially to the tyrosine sulfate and the O-glycan. The selectins are Ca2+-dependent lectins that initiate rolling adhesion of leukocytes on blood vessel surfaces at inflammatory sites (reviewed in Refs. 1McEver R.P. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11025-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar and 2Kansas G.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 3259-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L-selectin is expressed on leukocytes, and E- and P-selectin are expressed on activated endothelial cells or platelets. The selectins bind weakly to sialylated and fucosylated glycans such as sialyl Lewis x (sLex), 1The abbreviations used are: sLex, sialyl Lewis x; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; C2GnT, core-2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reduct"
https://openalex.org/W2053002668,"SIRPs (signal-regulatory proteins) are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that were identified by their association with the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in response to insulin. Here we examine whether SIRPα and SHP-2 are signaling molecules for the receptors for growth hormone (GH), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), or interferon-γ (IFNγ), cytokine receptor superfamily members that bind to and activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). In 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, GH rapidly stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of both SIRPα and SHP-2 and enhances association of SHP-2 with SIRPα. Consistent with JAK2 binding and phosphorylating SIRPα in response to GH, co-expression of SIRPα and JAK2 in COS cells results in tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα and JAK2 association with SIRPα. LIF does not stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα but stimulates greater tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 than GH. Additionally, LIF enhances association of SHP-2 with the gp130 subunit of the LIF receptor signaling complex. IFNγ, which stimulates JAK2 to a greater extent than LIF, is ineffective at stimulating tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα or SHP-2. These results suggest that SIRPα is a signaling molecule for GH but not for LIF or IFNγ. Differential phosphorylation of SIRPα and SHP-2 may contribute to the distinct physiological effects of these ligands. SIRPs (signal-regulatory proteins) are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that were identified by their association with the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in response to insulin. Here we examine whether SIRPα and SHP-2 are signaling molecules for the receptors for growth hormone (GH), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), or interferon-γ (IFNγ), cytokine receptor superfamily members that bind to and activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). In 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, GH rapidly stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of both SIRPα and SHP-2 and enhances association of SHP-2 with SIRPα. Consistent with JAK2 binding and phosphorylating SIRPα in response to GH, co-expression of SIRPα and JAK2 in COS cells results in tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα and JAK2 association with SIRPα. LIF does not stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα but stimulates greater tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 than GH. Additionally, LIF enhances association of SHP-2 with the gp130 subunit of the LIF receptor signaling complex. IFNγ, which stimulates JAK2 to a greater extent than LIF, is ineffective at stimulating tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα or SHP-2. These results suggest that SIRPα is a signaling molecule for GH but not for LIF or IFNγ. Differential phosphorylation of SIRPα and SHP-2 may contribute to the distinct physiological effects of these ligands. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2) is a member of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase family characterized by two tandem SH2 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology 2; GH, growth hormone; hGH, human growth hormone; GHR, growth hormone receptor; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; LIFRβ, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor β; gp130, glycoprotein 130; IFNγ, interferon-γ; IL, interleukin; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; JAK, Janus kinase; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; αSHP-2, anti-SHP-2 antibody; αPY, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10; αGHR, antibody to GHR; αSIRP, antibody to SIRP. domains in the N terminus and a catalytic domain in the C terminus.

Binding of the SH2 domains of SHP-2 to tyrosyl phosphorylated signaling molecules is thought to regulate SHP-2 phosphatase activity because phosphopeptides corresponding to SHP-2 binding sites in PDGF receptor and IRS-1 stimulate SHP-2 phosphatase activity (13Lechleider R.J.

The tyrosines in SHP-2 that are phosphorylated by PDGF receptor, JAK1, or JAK2 are within consensus binding sites for the adapter protein Grb2 and have been shown to mediate Grb2-SHP-2 association in response to PDGF, IL-3, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (17Welham M.J.

Thus, SHP-2 has been hypothesized to play a positive role in signal transduction by serving as an adapter protein between the receptor and Grb2, linking SHP-2 phosphorylation to the Grb2-SOS-Ras-MAPK pathway (22Bennett A.M.

However, the role of SHP-2 in growth factor and cytokine receptor signaling pathways may be more complex than that of an adapter molecule. The catalytic activity of SHP-2 is critical for its ability to modulate certain cellular responses to ligands for some receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors. For example, SHP-2 phosphatase activity is required for fibroblast growth factor-induced Xenopus development, EGF-induced cell cycle progression, and PDGF-induced mitogenesis (25Tang T.L.

Additionally, overexpression of catalytically inactive SHP-2 but not of wild-type SHP-2 inhibits ligand-stimulated reporter gene activity or MAPK activity in response to insulin, EGF, prolactin, or IFNα/β (19David M.

One possible mechanism is that overexpression of inactive SHP-2 prevents dephosphorylation by endogenous SHP-2 of a negative regulator of signaling. In support of this model, overexpression of catalytically inactive but not of active SHP-2 results in hyper tyrosyl phosphorylation of an SHP-2-associated 115-kDa protein in response to insulin in NIH3T3 and CHO cells (28Milarski K.L.

Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), respectively, and are both substrates for SHP-2. SIRPs are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins that are divided into two subgroups, based on the presence (SIRPα) or the absence (SIRPβ) of a cytoplasmic domain. SIRPα proteins contain four potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites and a proline-rich region in their cytoplasmic region. The tyrosine phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain is required for growth factor-induced association of SHP-2 with SIRP (34Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Four SIRPs, SIRPα1, SIRPα2, SIRPα3, and SIRPβ1, have been cloned. The best characterized is SIRPα1. SIRPα1 is believed to be a negative regulator of growth factor signaling because overexpression of wild-type but not mutant SIRPα1 lacking the SHP-2 binding region inhibits growth factor-induced MAPK activation and cell proliferation (34Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Whether SIRPα family members are regulated by cytokine receptor signaling is unknown. We therefore examined the role of SIRPα in signaling initiated by GH, LIF, or IFNγ, ligands that activate the Janus tyrosine kinases (35Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X.

Antibody to SIRP (αSIRP) raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 336–503 of human SIRPα1 was used at dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:4000 for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, respectively (34Kharitonenkov A.

COS-7 cells were transfected with prk5 expression vectors encoding the indicated cDNAs by calcium phosphate precipitation (40Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

Empty prk5 expression vector was added to ensure equivalent amounts of DNA in each transfection. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for an additional 24 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mml-glutamine and antibiotics. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h post-transfection. Confluent 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were incubated in serum-free medium (41Campbell G.S. Christian L.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7427-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GH, LIF, or IFNγ were then added at 37 °C for the indicated times at the indicated concentrations. COS or 3T3-F442A cells were washed twice with ice-cold 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4 and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were incubated on ice for 2 h with the indicated antibody. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-agarose for 1 h at 8 °C, washed three times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mmEGTA, and boiled for 5 min in a mixture of lysis buffer and 5× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 40% glycerol). Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies using the ECL detection system (41Campbell G.S. Christian L.J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7427-7434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were either directly reprobed with antibody as indicated or stripped in stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl) at 55 °C for 30 min and then reprobed with the indicated antibody. For deglycosylation experiments, immunoprecipitated proteins were deglycosylated as described previously (34Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. We first examined whether GH treatment induces tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2. 3T3-F442A cells were incubated with GH for various times, and SHP-2 was immunoprecipitated using αSHP-2. GH induces a rapid and transient tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2, with tyrosyl phosphorylation apparent at 2.5 min after GH treatment (the earliest time tested) and decreasing to near basal levels 60 min after GH stimulation (Fig.1, lanes 1–6). Reprobing the blot with αSHP-2 indicated that the amount of SHP-2 did not change (Fig. 1, lower panel). A prominent tyrosyl phosphorylated protein with an Mr of ∼120,000 (p120) co-precipitated with SHP-2. p120 displayed a rapid and transient time course of tyrosyl phosphorylation in response to GH, similar to that of SHP-2. To determine if GH enhances the association of p120 with SHP-2 or stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of p120 constitutively associated with SHP-2, we first had to determine the identity of p120. The SHP-2-associated p120 migrates with a size appropriate for either GHR or a SIRPα protein. To distinguish between these proteins, αSHP-2, αSIRP, or αGHR immunoprecipitates from GH-treated 3T3-F442A cells were deglycosylated, and proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with αPY. In the absence of endoglycosidase, the SHP-2-associated p120 more closely co-migrates with SIRPα than with GHR (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1, 3, and 5). Deglycosylation of αSIRP immunoprecipitates reduces the Mr of SIRPα to ∼60,000 (Fig. 2, lane 2), whereas deglycosylation of αGHR immunoprecipitates reduces the Mr of GHR to ∼90,000 (Fig. 2, lane 6), in agreement with previous results (34Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 42Silva C.M. Day R.N. Weber M.J. Thorner M.O. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2307-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of αGHR immunoprecipitates revealed an additional 130-kDa phosphoprotein that is believed to be GHR-associated JAK2 (Fig. 2, lane 6) (35Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Importantly, deglycosylation of αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates results in reduction of the majority of SHP-2-associated p120 to 60 kDa, a size appropriate for a SIRPα protein (Fig. 2, lane 4). A small amount of deglycosylated protein from αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates also co-migrates with GHR (Fig. 2, lane 4). These data suggest that SHP-2 associates with both GHR and SIRPα, with SIRPα being the major SHP-2-associated tyrosyl phosphorylated protein in GH-treated 3T3-F442A cells. To confirm that the SHP-2-associated p120 protein is SIRPα and to determine if GH stimulates SHP-2 association with SIRPα, αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates from untreated or GH-treated cells were immunoblotted with αSIRP. Because the specificity of this antibody for SIRPα1, SIRPα2, and SIRPα3 has not been determined, we shall refer to the SIRP that this antibody Western blots or immunoprecipitates as SIRPα. As shown in Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2, GH stimulates the association of SIRPα with SHP-2. No GHR was detectable by immunoblotting αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates with αGHR (data not shown), as predicted from the small amount of tyrosyl phosphorylated GHR that seems to co-precipitate with αSHP-2 (Fig. 2). Stripping and reprobing the blot in Fig. 3 A(lanes 1 and 2) with αPY (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4) shows that SIRPα co-migrates with the tyrosyl phosphorylated p120 in αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates, providing additional evidence that the tyrosyl phosphorylated 120-kDa protein that associates with SHP-2 is SIRPα. An additional tyrosyl phosphorylated protein of 130 kDa, a mass appropriate for JAK2, also co-precipitated with αSHP-2 (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). To determine whether GH enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα, SIRPα was immunoprecipitated from cells that were treated with or without GH and immunoblotted with αPY. As shown in Fig.3 B, GH enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα. The results of Fig. 3 therefore indicate that GH promotes tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα and its association with SHP-2. The GH-activated tyrosine kinase JAK2 was thought to be the most likely candidate for the SIRPα tyrosine kinase. To determine if JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylates SIRPα proteins, we transiently expressed in COS-7 cells JAK2 or kinase-inactive JAK2 in which the critical lysine 882 in the ATP binding region is replaced with glutamate (JAK2 K/E) or SIRPα1. As shown in Fig. 4, co-expression of SIRPα1 with JAK2 (lane 3), but not kinase-inactive JAK2 (lane 5), results in tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα1. JAK2 associates with SIRPα1, as shown by co-precipitation by αSIRP of a tyrosyl phosphorylated protein with a size appropriate for JAK2 in cells overexpressing wild-type JAK2 (Fig.4, lane 3). The identity of this phosphoprotein as JAK2 was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibody to JAK2 (data not shown). Upon reprobing the nitrocellulose membrane with αSIRP, multiple bands corresponding to SIRPα1 were apparent at 60–80 kDa in cells transfected with SIRPα1 (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 3, and 5, lower panels). Because deglycosylation of αSIRP immunoprecipitates reduces the multiple bands to a single 60-kDa band (data not shown), the multiple bands most likely represent glycosylation intermediates of overexpressed SIRPα1 in COS cells. Because JAK2 is activated in response to LIF and IFNγ as well as GH (35Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C.

Nature. 1993; 366: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), we compared the abilities of GH, LIF, and IFNγ to induce tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 and SHP-2-associated proteins such as SIRPα. 3T3-F442A cells were incubated with 25 ng/ml LIF or 10 ng/ml IFNγ, concentrations shown previously to induce maximal JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation. 2L. S. Argetsinger and C. Carter-Su, unpublished data. Although LIF stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 poorly in comparison with GH (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 4), LIF induces a more robust tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 than GH (Fig. 5, lanes 2, 3, 5 and 6). Our results support previous findings that IL-6, oncostatin M, or LIF, ligands that utilize gp130 in their receptor signaling complexes, stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of a protein that migrates with a size appropriate for SHP-2 (18Boulton T.G. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11648-11655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LIF did not increase the amount of tyrosyl phosphorylated SIRPα associated with SHP-2 (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6). Instead, LIF stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of two other SHP-2-associated proteins that migrate at sizes appropriate for gp130 and LIFRβ. In contrast to GH and LIF, IFNγ does not stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 or SHP-2-associated proteins such as SIRPα, even though IFNγ promotes a more robust tyrosyl phosphorylation of JAK2 than LIF does (Fig. 5, lanes 7–9). To determine whether LIF stimulates association of SHP-2 with gp130 or tyrosyl phosphorylation of gp130 constitutively associated with SHP-2, αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates from untreated or LIF-treated cells were immunoblotted with antibody to gp130. As shown in Fig.6 (lanes 1 and 2), LIF stimulates association of SHP-2 with gp130. Reprobing this blot with αPY demonstrates that gp130 and the SHP-2-associated 130-kDa phosphoprotein co-migrate (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4). In this experiment, LIF induces tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2-associated SIRPα to a small extent. However, LIF-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2-associated SIRPα was not reproducible, occurring in only three out of ten experiments. To determine whether SIRPα is tyrosyl phosphorylated in response to LIF or IFNγ, 3T3-F442A cells were treated with GH, LIF, or IFNγ, and αSIRP immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with αPY. Consistent with the previous data (Fig.5, lanes 2 and 3), GH potently stimulates tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 2). However, neither LIF nor IFNγ stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that GH, but not LIF or IFNγ, regulates SIRPα. Our findings that GH induces tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα and association of SHP-2 with SIRPα demonstrate that SIRPα is involved in GHR signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that SIRPs are involved in cytokine receptor signaling. JAK2 is the most likely candidate for the tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates SIRPα in response to GH. JAK2 is potently activated by GH (35Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), and co-expression of wild-type but not kinase-inactive JAK2 with SIRPα1 in COS cells results in tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα1 (Fig. 4). The association of SIRPα1 with JAK2 in COS cells may not be dependent on phosphorylated tyrosines in either JAK2 or SIRPα1, because neither JAK2 nor SIRPα1 contains a known phosphotyrosine binding domain (e.g., SH2 or PTB). However, SIRPα1 contains a proline-rich region (PKQPAPKP) that conforms to the consensus sequence (hydrophobic-XXX-aliphatic-PXP) of the proline-rich box1 region of cytokine receptors that mediates JAK2-cytokine receptor association (43O'Neal K.D. Yu-Lee L.-Y. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 309-312PubMed Google Scholar, 44Tanner J.W. Chen W. Young R.L. Longmore G.D. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6523-6530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the association of JAK2 with SIRPα involves binding of JAK2 to the proline-rich region of SIRPα. Whether or not GH-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα in 3T3-F442A cells is a consequence of a direct interaction of JAK2 with SIRPα, as suggested by the COS cell transfection experiments, or involves an additional protein(s) remains to be determined. Interestingly, not all ligands that activate JAK2 induce detectable levels of tyrosyl phosphorylated SIRPα in 3T3-F442A cells. The ability of GH, but not LIF or IFNγ, to potently stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα may be a consequence of the much greater ability of GH to stimulate JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation (Fig. 5 and Refs. 45Argetsinger L.S.

Meyer D.J. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 519-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Alternatively, tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα may require a factor(s) in addition to JAK2 that is recruited by GHR but not the receptors for LIF or IFNγ. In this paper we demonstrate that GH stimulates SHP-2 association with SIRPα, coincident with GH-induced SIRPα tyrosyl phosphorylation. SIRPα contains four potential binding sites of the SH2 domains of SHP-2, based upon the phosphotyrosine-containing motif tyrosine-hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic defined for the N-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 (47Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Because mutation of these cytoplasmic tyrosines in SIRPα abolishes SIRPα-SHP-2 association in response to insulin or EGF (34Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), it is likely that SIRPα-SHP-2 association in response to GH is mediated by phosphotyrosines in SIRPα and SH2 domains in SHP-2. GHR also contains three potential SHP-2 binding motifs, and JAK2 contains three potential SHP-2 binding motifs. The presence of a small amount of tyrosyl phosphorylated GHR (Fig. 2) and JAK2 (Fig. 3 A) in αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates suggests that some SHP-2 also binds to GHR-JAK2 complexes in response to GH. Although JAK2 contains a consensus binding site for SHP-2 SH2 domains, the interaction of the SH2-domains of SHP-2 with GHR-JAK2 is thought to be mediated primarily via GHR because JAK2 binds to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the SH2 domains of SHP-2 only when JAK2 is co-expressed with GHR. 3M. R. Stofega and C. Carter-Su, unpublished data. Similarly, the GH-dependent increase in the amount of SHP-2 co-precipitated with αIRS-2 suggests that a small amount of SHP-2 also binds to IRS proteins (48Argetsinger L.S. Norstedt G. Billestrup N. White M.F. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29415-29421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The amount of SHP-2 associated with IRS-2 is probably a small subset of total SHP-2 because we did not observe IRS-2 in αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates. As expected from the inability of LIF or IFNγ to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα, SHP-2 does not seem to associate with tyrosyl phosphorylated SIRPα in response to these ligands. Instead, LIF stimulates association of SHP-2 with tyrosyl phosphorylated gp130-LIFRβ complexes, presumably via the SH2 domains of SHP-2. In support of this, IL-11 has been shown to stimulate association of SHP-2 with gp130 via a YSTV motif in gp130 and association of the SH2 domains of SHP-2 with a phosphoprotein of the appropriate size for gp130 (16Fuhrer D.K. Feng G.-S. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24826-24830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). LIFRβ also contains an SHP-2 binding motif, but whether LIFRβ also binds SHP-2 remains to be determined. In contrast to LIF and GH, IFNγ did not stimulate association of SHP-2 with tyrosyl phosphorylated signaling proteins in 3T3-F442A cells even though IFNγ receptor α contains a YSLV motif that could be a potential binding site for the SH2 domain of SHP-2. This suggests that SHP-2 may not play a major role in IFNγ signaling. However, our data do not exclude the alternative possibilities that SHP-2 does associate with IFNγ receptor signaling molecules but that the interaction is so rapid and transient that we do not detect it in our assays or that SHP-2 binds to non-tyrosyl phosphorylated signaling molecules in response to IFNγ. GH and LIF, but not IFNγ, stimulate the tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2, with LIF being more effective than GH. Thus, the levels of tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 induced by GH, LIF, or IFNγ do not correspond to the relative levels of JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation induced by these ligands. One explanation of this apparent discrepancy is that the levels of SHP-2 tyrosyl phosphorylation may reflect the differential abilities of the ligands to recruit SHP-2 to cytokine receptor-JAK signaling complexes, where SHP-2 can be tyrosyl phosphorylated by JAKs. For example, in response to LIF, SHP-2 appears to be primarily recruited into the gp130-LIFRβ-JAK signaling complex where it is likely to be in sufficiently close proximity to LIFRβ-gp130-associated JAKs to be highly phosphorylated. Consistent with this model, mutation of the SHP-2 binding site in gp130 abolishes neurotrophin-3-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 by JAKs in cells overexpressing TrkC-gp130 chimeric proteins (49Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). In the case of GH, the majority of SHP-2 appears to be recruited to tyrosyl phosphorylated SIRPα. This subset of SHP-2 may not be in close enough proximity to JAK2 to be phosphorylated. The SHP-2 that is phosphorylated may reflect the smaller amount of SHP-2 that is recruited to GHR-JAK2 complexes. The greater binding of SHP-2 to SIRPα compared with GHR-JAK2 may reflect a higher affinity of SHP-2 for SIRPα than for GHR or a greater degree of phosphorylation of SHP-2 binding motifs within SIRPα compared with GHR. Consistent with the lack of association of SHP-2 with tyrosyl phosphorylated IFNγ receptor-JAK signaling complexes, IFNγ does not induce SHP-2 tyrosyl phosphorylation in 3T3-F442A cells. Our findings that GH stimulates SIRPα tyrosyl phosphorylation and the association of SHP-2 with SIRPα suggests that SIRPα plays a role in signaling by GH and potentially other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Overexpression of SIRPα1, but not mutant SIRPα1, which cannot bind SHP-2, inhibits insulin and EGF-induced DNA synthesis and MAPK activation (34Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), suggesting that SIRPα may be a negative regulator of these cellular functions. These effects are mimicked by overexpression of catalytically inactive SHP-2. The observation that overexpression of inactive SHP-2 results in a dramatic accumulation of SHP-2 at the cell membrane (32Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fujioka Y. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27652-27658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), coincident with enhanced SIRPα tyrosyl phosphorylation, raises the possibility that a major function of SIRPα is to recruit SHP-2 to the cell membrane, where it dephosphorylates SIRPα and other membrane-associated proteins. Binding of the SH2 domains of SHP-2 to phosphorylated tyrosine-containing motifs has been shown to stimulate SHP-2 phosphatase activity (13Lechleider R.J. Sugimoto S. Bennett A.M. Kashishian A.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2897-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In support of SHP-2 being activated by binding to SIRPα, SHP-2 associated with SIRPα via SHP-2 SH2 domains dephosphorylates SIRPα (32Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fujioka Y. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27652-27658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The differential abilities of GH, LIF, and IFNγ to induce tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2 and SIRPα may contribute to the distinct biological effects induced by these ligands. For example, because SHP-2 is so highly tyrosyl phosphorylated in response to LIF as compared with GH or IFNγ, a major function of SHP-2 in LIF signaling may be to bind SH2 domain-containing proteins such as Grb2. In a COS cell overexpression system, JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylates SHP-2 on tyrosine 304, a consensus binding site for Grb2 (21Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.-S. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T.R., R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Therefore, SHP-2 tyrosyl phosphorylation may link LIFR and to a lesser extent GHR to the Grb2-Ras-MAPK pathway. In contrast to LIF, GH stimulates robust tyrosyl phosphorylation of SIRPα and weaker tyrosyl phosphorylation of SHP-2. Because SIRPα appears to be the major tyrosyl phosphorylated protein that binds SHP-2 in response to GH, a major function of SHP-2 in GH signaling may be to bind and dephosphorylate SIRPα. Because SIRPα proteins contain an extracellular domain with three immunoglobulin-like repeats, it is possible that SIRPα is recruited into GHR signaling pathways in response to binding an as yet unidentified ligand or that GH highly regulates the cellular response to that ligand. The effects of SIRPs on GH signal transduction have yet to be determined but should offer new insights into signaling pathways utilized by GHR and potentially other cytokine receptors that activate Janus tyrosine kinases.

PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major phospholipid of membranes, to phosphatidic acid and choline in response to a variety of hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, and cytokines (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Phosphatidic acid (PA), the direct product of PLD action, has been implicated in increased DNA synthesis, activation of protein kinases and a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, stimulation of the respiratory burst in neutrophils, stimulation of c-fos and c-myc transcription, activation of certain enzymes of inositol phospholipid metabolism, and effects on actin polymerization and the GTPase-activating proteins of small G proteins (1Exton J.H.

Jaffer F.E. Abboud H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14457-14463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PA can be further metabolized by PA phosphohydrolase to yield diacylglycerol and by phospholipase A2 to form the intercellular messenger lysophosphatidic acid. Diacylglycerol derived from PC via PA can result in prolonged activation of certain PKC isozymes (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 5Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Thus, agonist-induced stimulation of PLD through its activation of PKC could play a role in long term cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation. Regulation of PLD activity is not fully understood. PLD is known to be activated via multiple pathways involving PKC, heterotrimeric and small G proteins, protein-tyrosine kinases, Ca2+, and unsaturated fatty acids (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 5Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). However, there is little information on the biochemical and molecular properties of mammalian PLDs because homogenous preparations of the enzyme have not been available until very recently. Much attention has focused on the role of PKC in the regulation of PLD. Studies using down-regulation of PKC and PKC inhibitors suggest the involvement of PKC-dependent mechanisms in the activation of PLD by many agonists (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 5Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the stimulation of PLD by PKC in membranes from Chinese hamster lung (CCL39) fibroblasts (6Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in a partially purified preparation of PLD from brain (7Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) has been shown to occur in an ATP-independent manner, suggesting that PKC may interact directly with PLD and activate it by a nonphosphorylation mechanism. PKC-α and PKC-β isozymes have also been found to activate HL-60 cell membrane-bound PLD in an ATP-independent manner (8Ohguchi K. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4366-4372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, Lopez et al. (9Lopez I. Burns D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19465-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) reported that conventional isoform(s) of PKC activated neutrophil PLD by phosphorylating a target protein located in the plasma membrane. Although there are many reports indicating PKC involvement in PLD activation, there is evidence that PKC is not required by some agonists, suggesting an alternate pathway(s) (1Exton J.H. J. Biol.

It has been obtained in a variety of biochemical studies, which indicate differences in the subcellular localization of PLD activity and in its responses to Ca2+, small G proteins, fatty acids, detergents, and pH, and differences in substrate specificities and chromatographic properties of partially purified PLD enzymes. Recently, Hammond et al. (29Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engerbrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

The enzymes were purified to homogeneity using immunoaffinity chromatography and shown to be activated by ARF, Rho family proteins, PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-P3 (PIP3), and PKC-α (30Hammond S.M.

The present studies were undertaken to investigate the properties and regulation of this rat brain PLD (rPLD1) using the enzyme expressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified to homogeneity. The results show that the enzyme has some properties that are very similar and some that are different from those of hPLD1. In addition, the enzyme is shown to be a glycoprotein and to be phosphorylated and negatively regulated by PKC. All reagents were analytical grade unless otherwise indicated. Dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, dipalmitoyl-PC, PIP2, and other unlabeled phospholipids were obtained from Sigma. Dipalmitoyl-C16-PIP3 and dipalmitoyl-C16-phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate were kind gifts from Dr. Ching-Shih Chen (University of Kentucky). β-Octylglucopyranoside, GTPγS, and tunicamycin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and concanavalin A-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All radioactive reagents were from NEN Life Science Products except for 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl PC and 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl PE, which were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. LK60 silica gel thin layer plates were purchased from Whatman. Nickel-agarose resin was from Qiagen, and anti-X press antibody was from Invitrogen. Affinity-purified anti-C-terminal dodecapeptide of hPLD antibody was a kind gift of Dr. S. H. Ryu (POSTECH, Pohang, Korea). Purified recombinant PKC isoforms expressed in Sf9 cells were from Panvera Corp. The cDNAs for RhoA, ARF3, and myristoyl transferase were kind gifts of Drs. R. A. Cerione (Cornell University), J. Moss (National Institutes of Health), and J. I. Gordon (Washington University), respectively. The rPLD1 cDNA was inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBacHis2B (Invitrogen) such that the PLD coding sequence was in frame with the sequences encoding the hexahistidine tag. This transfer plasmid and linearized AcMNPV viral DNA (Invitrogen) were cotransfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells by lipofection (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Putative recombinant viral plaques were identified by color screening. Virus from several putative recombinant plaques was tested for the ability to induce expression of (His6)-rPLD1 in infected Sf9 cells using Western blots of cell lysates with affinity-purified antibodies to the C terminus of hPLD1 (data not shown). The positive plaques were purified, and the pure viruses were amplified by infection of spinner cultures of Sf9 cells, which were stirred at 70 rpm and incubated at 27 °C. Growth of Sf9 (High Five) cells (Invitrogen) was maintained at 27 °C in SF 900 II SFM media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum containing antibiotic and antimycotic agents. Production of high titer viral stocks was performed in spinner flasks with 2 × 106 Sf9 cells/ml. The high titer virus stocks were stored at 4 °C and protected from light to ensure maintenance of titer. Monolayers of Sf9 cells (5 × 106 cells in a 100-mm dish) were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding (His6)-rPLD at a multiplicity of 10 and cultured at 27 °C for various times. The cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into lysis buffer (200 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol), and lysed by five passages through a 25-gauge needle. Trypan blue staining of the lysate indicated >95% disruption of the cells. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h to prepare cytosolic and particulate (membrane) fractions. Membranes were washed once by suspension in buffer and repeated centrifugation. PLD activity was higher in the soluble fraction than in the particulate fraction, and activity was detectable at 12 h, reached a maximum after 40 h of infection, and then declined slightly (data not shown). Western blotting using affinity-purified antibodies to the C-terminal dodecapeptide of hPLD also showed higher expression of rPLD1 in the soluble fraction, and the time course of enzyme expression measured by immunoblotting was similar to that measured by enzyme activity (data not shown). Monolayers of Sf9 cells (3 × 107 cells/150-mm dish; 10 dishes of cells) were used for each purification. They were infected at a multiplicity of 10 for 48 h with recombinant baculovirus encoding (His6)-rPLD1. The medium was removed, and the cells were lysed by incubation with 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1% β-octylglucopyranoside, 0.6m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% glycerol for 30 min at 4 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (10 ml) was incubated with 0.5 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C overnight with constant agitation. The incubation mixture was placed in a Bio-Rad chromatography column, and the resin was washed with 50 column volumes of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1% β-octylglucopyranoside, 1 m NaCl, 50 mmimidazole, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol. Bound protein was eluted in four fractions with an eluant containing 80 mm imidazole in 0.6 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20% glycerol. The fractions were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protein was assayed by the Bio-Rad microassay. RhoA cDNA was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector, pBlueBacHis (Invitrogen) encoding a hexahistidine tag. The protein was expressed in Sf9 cells by cotransfection of transfer plasmid and linearized AcMNPV viral DNA, and purified by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-NTA-agarose as described. Human ARF3 was coexpressed with myristoyltransferase in Escherichia coli and purified using DEAE-Sephacel and Superdex 75 column chromatography as described by Weiss et al. (32Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both preparations of small G proteins were shown by SDS-PAGE and silver staining to be near homogeneous and were stored in aliquots at −70 °C. PLD activity was measured by the formation of phosphatidylbutanol in the presence of 1% butanol using phospholipid vesicles comprised PE, PIP2, and PC in a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1, as described by Brown et al. (13Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). In some assays, the lipid composition of the vesicles was altered as indicated. The lipid reconstitution buffer was 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 80 mm KC1. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:50:0.3) and 0.35 ml of 1 n HCl in 5 mmEGTA. The incubation time was 30 min unless otherwise noted. The mixture was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the lower phase was dried under N2, resuspended in 300 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and spotted onto silica gel 60 A thin layer chromatography plates (Whatman). The plates were developed in the upper phase of a solvent system of ethyl acetate/isooctane/H2O/acetic acid (55:25:50:10) and then stained with iodine. A phosphatidylbutanol standard (Avanti) was used to locate the bands, which were scraped into scintillation vials containing 500 μl of methanol and 7.5 ml of Ready Organic scintillation mixture (Beckman). Phosphorylation reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 μl containing kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.32 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 1.25 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (100 nm), phosphatidylserine (100 μg/ml), 50 μmATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 50 ng of purified PKC-α or -β, in the presence or absence of purified PLD for 20 min at 30 °C. Incubations were stopped in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels followed by autoradiography. For the time course studies, the incubations were performed with or without 10 μmRo-31-8220 for the indicated times. An assay of PLD activity was performed as described above. For the phosphorylation reaction, incubations were stopped in Laemmli sample buffer, PLD was separated from PKC-α by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels, and the gel was dried. To quantitate the amount of 32P incorporated into PLD, the dried gel was exposed to film, and the autoradiograph was used as a template for excising radioactive PLD bands, which were added into scintillation vials containing 10 ml of Ready Organic scintillation mixture. The stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation was determined from the specific radioactivity of the [γ-32P]ATP (counted under the same conditions) and the amount of PLD protein applied to the gels (determined by Bio-Rad protein microassay). Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of 10 for 60 h with recombinant baculovirus encoding rPLD1 in the presence of various concentrations of tunicamycin (Boehringer Mannheim Corp.) and lysed by incubation with a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with Sepharose beads coupled to Concanavalin A (ConA) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed five times with a washing buffer, followed by the addition of SDS-sample buffer, and boiling. The recovered protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were probed with anti-PLD antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified rPLD1 (200 ng) was denatured in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 100 °C and then incubated for 5 h at 37 °C with 1000 units of endoglycosidase F (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and heating for 4 min at 100 °C, followed by Western blotting with anti-PLD antibody. To produce amounts of enzymatically active rPLD1 sufficient for in vitro characterization, we expressed the enzyme using the baculovirus expression system and the transfer vector pBlueBacHis, which contains an epitope for the Anti-Xpress antibody to allow affinity purification of the recombinant enzyme. We compared the (His6)-rPLD1 expression level in two different insect cell lines, the S. frugiperda cell line Sf9 and the Trichoplusiani cell line High Five, respectively. Although it is reported that High Five cells offer up to 25-fold higher expression of secreted proteins than Sf9 cells, the Sf9 line was used, since infection of these cells yielded approximately 10-fold more fusion protein than High Five cells (data not shown). Four different detergents (β-octyl glucoside, Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, sodium cholate) were tested for solubilization of the expressed PLD, and octyl glucoside was found to be most suitable (data not shown). Membrane-bound PLD could also be extracted with 0.6m NaCl. The 10 × 150-mm dishes of Sf9 cells each containing 2 × 107 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 with recombinant baculovirus for expression of the PLD. At 48 h postinfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with buffer containing 1% β-octyl glucoside and 0.6 m NaCl. After centrifugation, supernatants were adsorbed to 0.4 ml of Ni2+-NTA resin overnight at 4 °C. The resin was then washed with buffer containing 50 mm imidazole and 800 mm NaCl. (His6)-rPLD1 was eluted in 80 mm imidazole-containing fractions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The molecular mass of rPLD1 was estimated to be 120 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity as shown by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1 A), and approximately 50 μg of pure rPLD1 protein was obtained. The purified protein was recognized by an antibody to the C-terminal dodecapeptide of hPLD1 (Fig. 1 B) as well as the Anti-Xpress antibody (Fig.1 C). We studied the effects of acidic phospholipids on the activity of purified rPLD1 using substrate vesicles containing 5 μm test phospholipid in the presence of PE and PC. The assays also contained 50 μmGTPγS and the small G protein ARF, since this greatly enhances the activity of PLD (13Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 14Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). PIP2 and PIP3stimulated the activity of rPLD1 significantly, and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate were largely ineffective (Fig.2 A). The activation of PLD by PIP2 and PIP3 was dependent on the molar fraction of polyphosphoinositide in the vesicles (Fig. 2 B). Significant activation was observed with 1 μm and maximal activation occurred at 5 μm. The effect of pH on rPLD1 activity was investigated using pH values ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 in the presence of 1 mm free Mg2+. The activity was assayed in the presence of GTPγS and ARF. PLD activity showed a broad dependence on pH, with optimum activity at pH 6.5–7.5 (data not shown). Since previous reports have shown divergent effects of oleate on PLD (1Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of this fatty acid on rPLD1 in the presence of GTPγS and ARF. Oleate had a strong inhibitory effect on the enzyme, whereas other fatty acids (palmitate, stearate, arachidonate) were ineffective (data not shown). The effect of oleate was concentration-dependent, with about 70% inhibition occurring at 0.01 μm. We examined the substrate selectivity of purified rPLD1 toward different phospholipids. The enzyme was incubated with 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]linoleoyl PE and 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl phosphatidylinositol under standard assay conditions. [14C]phosphatidylbutanol was produced only from PC (data not shown), thus demonstrating that rPLD1 is PC-specific. Ca2+ and Mg2+ have been implicated in the activation of PLD"

In neuronal cells such as PC12, Shc was demonstrated to be involved in vitro in Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation following nerve growth factor stimulation and Ca2+ entry. However, Shc mRNA was hardly detectable in the brain, and therefore, Shc is unlikely to participate in phosphotyrosine signaling in the central nervous system. Two recently isolated Shc homologs, N-Shc and Sck, have been shown to be expressed in the brain and are expected to function as neuronal adapters instead of Shc. In this study, the neuronal distribution and function of these novel Shc members were investigated. In human and rat central nervous systems, the expression profiles of N-Shc and Sck mRNAs considerably overlapped, although some distinct localization between them was observed: in the adult rat brain, the level of N-Shc mRNA was the highest in the thalamus, whereas that of Sck mRNA was the highest in the hippocampus. In the peripheral nervous system, transcripts of Shc and Sck, but not of N-Shc, were detected. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated functional differences between N-Shc and Sck: (i) N-Shc was a higher affinity adapter molecule than Sck in nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling; and (ii) N-Shc, but not Sck, was efficiently phosphorylated by activated Src tyrosine kinase, whereas Sck, but not N-Shc, formed a complex with pp135, a protein highly phosphorylated by v-Src.

Shc can thereby associate with a wide variety of tyrosine kinase receptors, which phosphorylate Shc at its tyrosine residues. In addition, Shc can be phosphorylated by cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases such as Src family kinases and PYK2 kinase that mediate signaling following Ca2+ elevation and G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation (4McGlade J.

Shc phosphorylation therefore induces the formation of a complex containing Shc, Grb2, and SOS, which may activate the Ras pathway (2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). In neuronal cell lines such as PC12, Shc has been shown to play a pivotal role in Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation following Trk receptor stimulation with nerve growth factor (NGF) (11Obermeier A.

Recently, two Shc homologs (N-Shc/ShcC/Rai and Sck/ShcB/Sli) were isolated and shown to be expressed in the brain, and they were proposed to exert neuronal adapter functions instead of Shc (13Kavanaugh W.M.

The importance of phosphotyrosine signaling in the development and maintenance of the nervous system is widely accepted (17Wagner K.R. Mei L. Huganir R.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Heumann R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 668-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas the neuronal distribution of Shc family members has been largely unknown. Previously, we showed that N-Shc expression was brain-specific; its mRNA was detected throughout the central nervous system of the rat embryo (16Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). N-Shc expression in the human adult brain exhibited regional differences, and the highest levels were found in the cortex and hippocampus (16Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we obtained Sck cDNA and compared its expression with that of Shc and N-Shc in neural tissues. Shc was not expressed in the brain, and some distinct localization between N-Shc and Sck was observed in the central nervous system. In contrast, only Shc and Sck mRNAs were detected in the peripheral nervous system; thus, Sck was expressed in both central and peripheral neurons, and N-Shc was confirmed to be a central nervous system-specific member of the Shc family. In light of the distinct expression profiles of N-Shc and Sck in the brain and other neural tissues, questions arise about the possibility of their functional divergence. Shc (and other Shc members) has been implicated to provide a convergence point for neuronal signaling pathways (19Bourne H.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); signalings through Shc family members are not simply linear, but may branch and overlap extensively. If N-Shc and Sck have different abilities as adapter molecules, such as different levels of affinities for phosphotyrosine-containing proteins or different substrate specificities for tyrosine kinases, various neuronal signalings mediated by these Shc members might crosstalk over a wide range and in specific combinations. To assess this possibility, we compared the responses of N-Shc and Sck with epidermal growth factor (EGF), neurotrophin, and activated Src tyrosine kinase. COS-1, NIH3T3, and SR-3Y1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. EGF and NGF were purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) came from PeproTech Inc. (London). T7·Tag monoclonal antibody was obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI); anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); and anti-pan-Trk antibody (C-14) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) and anti-Grb2 antibodies were procured from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Several human expressed sequence tag sequences in the GenBank™ Data Bank were found to encode part of the amino acid sequence of human Sck (13Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Among these expressed sequence tag sequences, 5′-CACCACATGCCGTCCATCTCCTTC-3′ in HEEB09 and 5′-TGGTGACGCTGTCTCGCACAAGGA-3′ in T05885 were selected as primers to produce an 810-bp Sck probe by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with poly(A)-containing RNA isolated from human brain. A human frontal cortex-derived cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with this Sck probe. Eight overlapping cDNAs were obtained, and their sequences were determined. Thereafter, a 470-bp HindIII-HindIII fragment of the clone located closest to the 5′-end of Sck mRNA was isolated and used as a probe for further screening. Six additional clones were obtained, and their composite nucleotide sequence was determined. The rat homolog of human Sck was isolated by screening a rat brain cDNA library (Stratagene) with the human 810-bp Sck cDNA fragment as a probe. Four overlapping clones were obtained, and their composite nucleotide sequence was determined. Human multiple tissue blots I and II and brain tissue blots II and III (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized as described before (16Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar) with DNA probes: Shc (nucleotides 984–2075) (20Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F.

The human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control probe (nucleotide 586–1037) (21Arcari P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9179-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) was used for verifying equal loading of poly(A)+ RNAs from different tissues and brain regions. Brains of mature adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were frozen in 2-methylbutane at −25 °C. Sections (13 μm) were cut on a cryostat, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and stored at −80 °C until used. Frozen sections were brought to room temperature, post-fixed, acetylated, and dehydrated. In situ hybridization with 35S-labeled (see Fig.3) or digoxigenin-labeled (see Fig. 4) cRNA probes was carried out as described previously (16Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M.

Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) was used for the expression of the human TrkA receptor. The human Sck cDNA containing PTB, CH, and SH2 domains (nucleotides 250–2396; GenBank™ accession number AB001451) with the T7 peptide (ASMTGGQQMGR) tag at the amino terminus was subcloned into the BglII and XbaI sites of mammalian expression vector pCMV1 (24Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvail H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pCMV1-T7SCK. COS-1, NIH3T3, or SR-3Y1 cells were transfected with the following plasmids by use of 60 μg of LipofectAmine (Life Technologies, Inc.): for COS-1 (see Fig. 5) or SR-3Y1 cells, a combination of 4.8 μg of pCMV1-T7NSHC and 7.2 μg of pCMV1 or 12 μg of pCMV1-T7SCK only; for NIH3T3 or COS-1 (see Fig. 6, K–M) cells, a combination of 4 μg of pCMV1-T7NSHC, 0.6 μg of Trk-expressing plasmid, and 7.4 μg of pCMV1 or a combination of 10 μg of pCMV1-T7NSHC, 0.6 μg of Trk-expressing plasmid, and 1.4 μg of pCMV1. As a negative control, the Trk-expressing plasmid was substituted with an equal amount of pCMV1 (see Fig. 6, A–J, first and fourth lanes). At this ratio, equal levels of N-Shc and Sck proteins were expressed in transfected cells. The transfected COS-1 and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 h; serum-starved (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum) for 18 h; and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF (COS-1 cells in Fig. 5), 200 ng/ml NGF or BDNF (NIH3T3 cells), or 200 ng/ml NGF (COS-1 cells in Fig. 6, K–M) for 5 min. The transfected SR-3Y1 cells were directly lysed for immunoprecipitation following serum starvation.Figure 6Comparison of the responses of N-Shc and Sck to NGF or BDNF stimulation. A–D, NIH3T3 cells transfected with T7 peptide-tagged N-Shc (first lane) or Sck (fourth lane) cDNA only or cotransfected with T7 peptide-tagged N-Shc (second and third lanes) or Sck (fifth and sixth lanes) cDNA together with TrkA cDNA were mock-treated (−) or treated with NGF (+) and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-T7 peptide antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies: anti-pan-Trk antiserum (A), anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PTyr) antibody (B), anti-Grb2 antibody (C), and anti-T7 peptide antibody (D). E, the whole lysates of the transfected NIH3T3 cells were immunoblotted with anti-pan-Trk antiserum. F–J, a similar immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiment was done as described above with TrkB cDNA and BDNF used instead of TrkA cDNA and NGF, respectively. K and L, COS-1 cells cotransfected with T7 peptide-tagged N-Shc (first and second lanes) or Sck (third and fourth lanes) cDNA together with TrkA cDNA were incubated or not with NGF and immunoprecipitated with anti-Trk antiserum.

M, the whole lysates of the transfected COS-1 cells were immunoblotted with anti-T7 peptide antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (16Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, either specific immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were electrophoresed and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked and probed with specific antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 buffer containing 1% nonfat skim milk (Difco). After having been washed, immunocomplexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated species-specific secondary antibody (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and an ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham International). To elucidate the regional distribution of Shc family members in the nervous system, we sought to obtain Sck cDNA in addition to the previously isolated Shc and N-Shc cDNAs (16Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). Since the nucleotide sequence of Sck was not reported, we amplified an 810-bp Sck fragment by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction based on expressed sequence tag sequences encoding partial amino acid sequences of human Sck protein (13Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). By screening a human frontal cortex-derived cDNA library with this probe, we obtained 14 overlapping clones. The determined nucleotide sequence of human Sck cDNA is 2390 bp in length and has an open reading frame of at least 1470 nucleotides and a poly(A) tail at its 3′-end. The deduced Sck amino acid sequence includes complete PTB, CH, and SH2 domains, although the N terminus of the encoded protein could have been slightly deleted (Fig.1). By Northern blot analysis, the major transcript of human Sck was estimated to be ∼2.7 kilobases (Fig.2), suggesting that ∼300 bp or so of the 5′-end were missing from these clones. Fig. 2 also shows the existence of minor isoforms of Sck transcripts. Some differences at the N terminus were found between this human Sck sequence and that previously reported by Pelicci et al. (15Pelicci G. Dente L. Giuseppe A.D. Verducci-Galletti B. Giuli S. Mele S. Vetriani C. Giorgio M. Pandolfi P.P. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 633-641PubMed Google Scholar). The human Sck sequence in Fig. 1 and that reported by Kavanaugh and Williams (13Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) were the same in the range that we can compare, whereas the sequence reported by Pelicci et al. was different from that reported by Kavanaugh and Williams as well as from our sequence at the N terminus. Thus, we believe that our sequence is correct. The discrepancy of the reported N-terminal sequences of Sck protein may come from the alternatively spliced transcripts described above. We also isolated rat Sck cDNA, which had a complete encoding capacity for PTB, CH, and SH2 domains.Figure 2Tissue and neuronal distribution of human Shc family members.

In contrast, the internal CH domain of Sck diverges from the others, although there are several conserved residues that are functionally important, e.g. (i) YVN(T/V) (residues 321–324 in human Sck and residues 299–302 in rat Sck), the Grb2-binding site (7Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22293-22299Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and to mediate survival signals in the case of Shc (25Gotoh N. Tojo A. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); and (iii) (K/R)DLFDM(K/R)FPE (residues 338–347 in human Sck and residues 326–335 in rat Sck), which was required in Shc for adaptin binding (26Okabayashi Y. Sugimoto Y. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Kido Y. Sakaguchi K. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5265-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to the fully conserved sites among the Shc members, there were several proline-rich motifs that were unique to each Shc member (Fig. 1). These proline-rich motifs are considered to be the recognition sites of SH3-containing proteins (27Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). A comparison of human and rodent Sck, N-Shc, and Shc revealed that each Shc member has unique potential SH3-binding site(s), thus leading to differential downstream signalings. We compared Sck expression with that of Shc and N-Shc using the same blot of human adult tissues (Fig. 2 A). As previously reported, Shc was broadly expressed in most human tissues except brain. In marked contrast, N-Shc mRNA was specifically expressed in brain tissue and was hardly detectable in other tissues except pancreas. Similar to Shc mRNA, the Sck message was distributed rather broadly. Notably, the brain showed a moderate level of Sck mRNA expression. Thus, Sck is the second major member of the Shc family that is expressed in the human brain. We next compared the expression of the Shc, N-Shc, and Sck mRNAs in various brain regions and spinal cord in human by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). The distribution of N-Shc and Sck mRNAs in the human brain was rather complex. N-Shc mRNA was detected in abundance in the cerebral cortex, frontal and temporal lobes, occipital pole, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and amygdala, but its level was very low or undetectable in the cerebellum, medulla, and spinal cord. Expression of Sck mRNA overlapped partially with that of N-Shc mRNA, with notable differences: N-Shc mRNA was highly expressed in the caudate nucleus and was very low in the hypothalamus, whereas Sck mRNA was abundantly expressed in the hypothalamus and was nearly undetectable in the caudate nucleus (Fig.2 B). To further examine the regional expression of N-Shc and Sck transcripts in the brain, we compared the mRNA expression of the Shc members in rat brain tissues by in situ hybridization. In our previous experiments, N-Shc mRNA was found to be rather broadly expressed in the embryonic nervous system and postnatal brain (16Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, in the mature brain, it became evident that the N-Shc message was particularly abundant in the thalamus (Fig.3 B). In contrast, Sck mRNA was widely distributed throughout the whole brain, with the highest levels found in the hippocampus (Fig. 3 C). In a high-power view of the hippocampal area, both N-Shc and Sck mRNAs were detected in both pyramidal neurons and granule cells in the CA1 through CA3 regions and dentate gyrus, respectively; cells in the hilus also showed high expression of N-Shc and Sck messages (data not shown). Although only N-Shc and Sck were detected in the brain, this was not true for the peripheral nervous system, where a considerable level of Shc mRNA expression was observed (Fig.4). Shc transcripts were predominantly observed in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) areas (Fig.4 A). Shc-positive cells were only sparsely distributed in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Shc mRNA expression in the spinal cord was restricted to part of the motor neurons (Fig. 4 A, small arrow). Sck mRNA expression in the peripheral nervous system (DRG and SCG) was much higher than in the brain (Fig.4 C). Although the Sck message was broadly detected in the spinal cord, high-level expression was restricted to the motor neurons. In contrast, N-Shc expression in DRG and SCG was very low or undetectable (Fig. 4 B). In the spinal cord, an overall expression of N-Shc mRNA was observed. The regional expression profile of N-Shc and Sck mRNAs in the adult rat brain (Fig. 3) was considerably different from that observed when RNA samples extracted from post-mortem human brain were analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with in situ data, semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments using RNA samples from various rat brain regions demonstrated that the thalamus was the highest source of N-Shc mRNA. The striatum and cerebral cortex showed moderate levels of N-Shc mRNA expression, and the cerebellum showed a low level of N-Shc mRNA expression (data not shown). Thus, the apparent difference in the expression profiles of N-Shc and Sck mRNAs may reflect a species variation. Given the structural similarity and differential expression profile, questions arise as to how N-Shc and Sck share or differentiate neuronal signaling pathways. Also, do their adapter functions overlap with each other, or do they have certain distinct roles? We sought to answer these questions by examining the binding affinities of N-Shc and Sck for EGF and neurotrophin receptors as well as by investigating the response of N-Shc and Sck to the action of Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. We previously demonstrated that activated EGFR was able to bind N-Shc and to induce N-Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent association with Grb2 (16Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). Since we obtained a nearly full-length Sck cDNA that encoded complete PTB, CH, and SH2 domains, we asked the question of whether Sck is similarly responsive to EGF signaling compared with Shc and N-Shc. We performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using T7 peptide-tagged N-Shc or Sck and compared their responses to EGF stimulation. Even though the T7 peptide-tagged Sck cDNA used here lacked the most 5′-end of the open reading frame, the deduced Sck amino acid sequences contained complete PTB, CH, and SH2 domains. Therefore, we believe that the expressed Sck retains full activity concerning phosphotyrosine signaling pathways, as has been demo"

Since the extracellular bacteria are metabolically inert and there are no cell-free systems for characterizing Chlamydia metabolism, we studied metabolic changes related to ATP synthesis and glycolysis in HeLa cells infected with Chlamydia psittaci during the course of the 2-day infection cycle using noninvasive 31P and 13C NMR methods. We find that the infection stimulates ATP synthesis in the infected cell, with a peak of ATP levels occurring midway through the infection cycle, when most of the metabolically active bacteria are proliferating. The infection also stimulates synthesis of glutamate with a similar time course as for ATP. The stimulation is apparently due to an enhancement in glucose consumption by the infected cell, which also results in an increased rate of lactate production and glutamate synthesis as well as higher glycogen accumulation during the infection. Concurrently, infection leads to an increase in the expression of the glucose transporter, GLUT-1, on HeLa cells, which may account for the enhanced glucose consumption. The chlamydiae are thus able to stimulate glucose transport in the host cell sufficiently to compensate for the extra energy load on the cell represented by the infection.

Chlamydia species are causative agents of conjunctivitis and pneumonia, and they are recognized as the leading cause of bacterially acquired sexually transmitted infections. On repeated exposure, the consequences can be blinding trachoma or sequelae from sexually transmitted infection, such as epididymitis or pelvic inflammatory diseases, ectopic pregnancy, or tubal infertility (1Paavonen J. Wolner-Hanssen P. Hum. Reprod. 1989; 4: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 2Jackson L.A. Grayston J.T. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 9: 89-93Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Despite the clinical importance of these infections, the biology and biochemistry of Chlamydia infection remains poorly understood. The chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that proliferate only within the infected host cell. In line with its requirement for host cell metabolites for survival, Chlamydia exists in two developmental states, elementary bodies (EBs) 1The abbreviations used are: EB, elementary body; RB, reticulate body; UDPS, uridine diphosphate sugars; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection. and reticulate bodies (RBs). EBs represent the metabolically inactive, infectious form of the bacteria, and they are internalized into host cells within membrane-bound vacuoles that avoid fusion with host-cell lysosomes (3Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within 6–10 h after internalization, the EBs differentiate into the metabolically active RBs. This transformation triggers DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in the RBs, which proliferate in the growing vacuole and produce up to a thousand progeny. Lipids from the trans-Golgi network are transported to this membrane (4Hackstadt T. Scidmore M.A. Rockey D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4877-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and the bacteria contribute their own proteins to the inclusion membrane (5Rockey D.D. Heinzen R.A. Hackstadt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). An intimate association thus exists between the bacteria and the host, but the lack of molecular tools in the field has made further characterization of the association difficult. After approximately 2 days of infection, RBs differentiate back into EBs, and a new infection cycle can begin. Chlamydia trachomatis grows well in cytoplasts (enucleated cells) (6Perara E. Yen T.S. Ganem D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3816-3818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that active host cell nuclear function is not required for bacterial growth. In addition, bacteria grow in host cells treated with certain protein synthesis inhibitors, implying that de novo protein synthesis by the host cell is also not required (7Becker Y. Microbiol. Rev. 1978; 42: 274-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a cell-free system for Chlamydiahas never been obtained (3Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and host-free RBs have limited metabolic activity (8Hatch T.P. Al-Hossainy E. Silverman J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 662-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolism of the bacteria must therefore be studied in infected cells themselves. We have addressed metabolic changes in the infected cell using a non-invasive NMR technique that allowed us to measure the levels and rates of production of a number of metabolites related to energy metabolism, including ATP, glucose, lactate, and glutamate. We find a marked enhancement in the levels of the energy metabolites that correlates well with the infection cycle of Chlamydia. Concomitantly with this enhancement, glucose consumption, lactate production, glutamate synthesis via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glucose incorporation into glycogen increase, apparently due to increased surface expression of glucose transporters by the host cell. The chlamydiae thus fulfill their energy requirements by increasing the expression of host cell glucose transporters, which by itself could account for the other changes that we observe in energy-metabolite levels. The Chlamydia species used here, the guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis serovar of Chlamydia psittaci has been described elsewhere (9Bavoil P.M. Hsia R.-c. Rank R.G. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1996; 94: 5-54Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of GLUT-1 (AB1340) was from Chemicon (Euromedex, Strasbourg, France), and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-Chlamydia lipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody (clone C4) was from Argene (Varilhes, France). R-Phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Uridine 5′-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine, uridine 5′-diphosphoglucoronic acid, and uridine 5′-diphosphoglucose were from Sigma. The chlamydiae were grown in infected HeLa cell monolayer cultures essentially as described (10Batteiger B.E. Rank R.G. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, infected HeLa cells were cultured on 20 9-cm Petri culture dishes and harvested at 48 h postinfection. The cells and supernatant were combined and centrifuged for 60 min at 12,000 rpm in a Sorvall type GSA rotor. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold sucrose/phosphate/glucose buffer (SPG), and the cells were sonicated on ice for 30 s. The resulting suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor to remove unbroken cells, and the new supernatant was centrifuged again for 30 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C to collect the bacteria. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold SPG with a 21-gauge 2-ml syringe to dissociate aggregates, giving the final suspension of EBs used in subsequent infection experiments. This suspension was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until ready for use. HeLa cells cultivated in a standard manner were trypsinized and seeded on 150-μm biosylon microspheres (Nunc, Denmark) or 300-μm polyacrolein microspheres (11Neeman M. Rushkin E. Kadouri A. Degani H. Magn. Reson. Med. 1988; 7: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in small, sterile plastic vials (3 million cells per 0.5-ml beads in 4 ml of standard growth medium described above). The vials were placed in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, humidified) and agitated gently every 15 min for a duration of 3 h. The beads with cells were then transferred to 9-cm bacteriological Petri dishes and additional medium was added until 12 ml was reached. Medium was replaced every 2 days. Before the NMR experiment, the beads were collected (2- or 2.5-ml beads) and transferred to a sterile 10-mm NMR tube. The tube was then placed in the NMR spectrometer and perfused with oxygenated growth medium at 37 °C using a sterile perfusion system described in detail elsewhere (12Degani H. Ronen S.M. Furman-Haran E. Gillies R.J. NMR in Physiology and Biomedicine. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 329-351Crossref Google Scholar). For NMR experiments using Chlamydia-infected cells, biosylon beads preseeded 2 days before with HeLa cells were incubated with C. psittaci at (0.5-ml beads/2 ml of medium) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of approximately 0.3, and left on an agitator for 1 h before adding additional culture medium (12 to 0.5 ml beads). Two to 2.5 ml of infected HeLa cells on beads were transferred to a sterile NMR tube, and perfusion and data acquisition was performed as for the uninfected HeLa cells. For cell growth studies, HeLa cells were grown and infected on beads as for NMR experiments (m.o.i. = ∼0.3). Infected and uninfected cells were trypsinized at the indicated times and counted using the viability trypan blue exclusion method and light microscopy. In a separate experiment, uninfected cells and cells infected with an m.o.i. of ∼1.0 were harvested and viable cells were identified by their ability to exclude propidium iodide in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cells cultured on agarose-polyacrolein beads were infected with chlamydiae for 0, 24, or 45 h and were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 °C. The fixed cells were centrifuged twice for 20 min at 15,000 rpm in PBS, and the pellet was transferred in 2 ml of cacodylate buffer (5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2m cacodylate, pH 7) into an Eppendorf tube. The tube was centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 3% agar (Difco) in cacodylate buffer at 45 °C. The warm agar was centrifuged 1 min at 15,000 rpm and then allowed to solidify at 4 °C. One ml of 1% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer was added to the agar, and after leaving for 1 h at room temperature, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was incubated in a 1% uranyl acetate (Merck) solution in cacodylate buffer for another hour at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, the pellet was rinsed with water and then dehydrated by rinsing with increasing concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 100%) of acetone. The preparations were then embedded in Epon. Ultra-thin sections (60 μm) were prepared on an Ultra Cut 2 Reichert GUNG microtome and poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for examination on a Zeiss electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 50 kV. Approximately 2–2.5 ml of beads with about 1–2 × 107 cells were introduced to the NMR probe in each experiment and were perfused with 60–400 ml of medium, depending on the length and conditions of the experiment. NMR recording was performed with a Unity 400 spectrometer (Varian). The temperature in the probe was maintained constant at 37 °C (in the sample). 31P spectra were recorded at 161 MHz using 45° pulses, an acquisition time of 0.2 s, and a repetition time of 2 s without proton decoupling. Each spectrum consisted of 1800 transients accumulated in 60 min. The chemical shifts of the31P signals were assigned in reference to α-NTP at −10.03 ppm. Since the line widths of the signals did not alter throughout the course of the experiment, changes in signal intensity were directly proportional to changes in the concentrations of the metabolite. 13C spectra were recorded at 100 MHz by applying 45° pulses, with 1-s repetition time and composite pulse proton decoupling during acquisition of ∼2 watt. During the relaxation delay, the decoupling power was reduced 60-fold. Each spectrum was acquired for 30 min (1800 transients). These spectra were used to follow the energetics of the HeLa cells through glycolysis, as well as monitoring the rates of glucose consumption and lactate production and incorporation of the label into glycogen and glutamate. For these measurements, glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 11.2 or 16.8 mm [1-13C]glucose (99% enriched, from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) in 100–150 ml of re-circulating medium was used. The 13C signal of C1-β-glucose (96.8 ppm) served as a reference for chemical shift determination. The rate of glucose utilization was determined from the decrease in the [1-(13Cα + 13Cβ)]glucose intensity and the rate of lactate synthesis was measured from the increase in the [3-13C]lacetate signal at 21 ppm. The rates of labeling of C-4 glutamate and C-1 glucose moieties in glycogen were determined from the change in the corresponding signal intensities (at 32.4 and 101.4 ppm, respectively). Water-soluble metabolites from HeLa cells were extracted as described previously (13Tyagi R.K. Azrad A. Degani H. Salomon Y. Magn. Reson. Med. 1996; 35: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were extracted with methanol, chloroform, and water (1:1:1, v/v/v), and the contents of the chloroform and methanol/water phases were separated and recovered. 31P spectra of the water-soluble metabolites were obtained with a Unity 500 spectrometer (Varian) at a temperature of 25 °C. The spectra were recorded at 202 MHz using 45° pulses and a repetition time of 2.9 s with proton decoupling. Adherent HeLa cells growing at 50% confluence on 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Costar) were incubated with 2 ml of chlamydiae (m.o.i. = ∼0.3) or PBS for 2 h, agitating gently every 15 min, after which 10 ml of culture medium was added. After culture for 1 day, the cells were detached with EDTA, resuspended in 10 ml of PBS, and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was fixed by resuspending in 1 ml of 3.7% paraformaldehyde and neutralizing with 50 mm NH4Cl as described previously (14Ojcius D.M. Niedergang F. Subtil A. Hellio R. Dautry-Varsat A. Res. Immunol. 1996; 147: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Following two additional washes with PBS, the cells were incubated in 100 μl with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-Chlamydia monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) and the rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT-1 antibody (1:100 dilution) in PBS containing 0.05% saponin for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with 100 μl of the phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml) in PBS, 0.05% saponin for another 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the cells were washed twice in PBS without detergent, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS/bovine serum albumin, and transferred into 12 × 75-mm Falcon® 2052 FACS tubes (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data from 10,000 HeLa cells were collected on the FACScan flow cytometer with an argon-ion laser tuned to 488 nm, and the mean fluorescence intensity was obtained from the recorded data. Mammalian cells growing on biosylon and polyacrolein microspheres have previously been used for non-invasive NMR measurements (11Neeman M. Rushkin E. Kadouri A. Degani H. Magn. Reson. Med. 1988; 7: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and C. trachomatis has likewise been used to infect McCoy cells and HEC-1B cells growing on beads (15Raulston J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4539-4547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schachter J. Wyrick P.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore verified whether C. psittaci could infect bead-bound HeLa cells under the conditions of our NMR experiments. The density of uninfected HeLa cells was first evaluated by low magnification light microscopy, which revealed predominantly a monolayer of HeLa cells growing at near confluence under the conditions used for NMR (Fig.1 A). Electron microscopy showed that uninfected HeLa cells were bound to the beads (Fig.1 B). After a 45-h infection with chlamydiae, a large inclusion containing bacteria at both the EB and RB developmental stages is readily apparent (Fig. 1 C), while the host cell still remains firmly attached to the bead. The NMR signal for most of the metabolites measured below is derived only from living HeLa cells, which can retain these metabolites; dead cells are spectroscopically silent since the metabolites leaking from dead cells are diluted in the extracellular perfusion medium. To assess the viability and growth rate of cells on beads, we therefore studied the growth curves for HeLa cells growing on beads that have been infected with C. psittaci or incubated with control growth medium. The cell number on beads was also counted in parallel to the NMR experiments. An average of the growth curves for several NMR experiments (n = 4 for infected cells, n = 5 for control uninfected cells) is shown in Fig.2, which indicates that infection at the m.o.i. used here (∼0.3) may have a slight effect on the number of living cells. In a separate experiment, viability was also measured using the propidium iodide exclusion assay by cytofluorimetry, using an m.o.i. of ∼1.0. Under these conditions, about one-third of the cells were dead after a 2-day infection (not shown), suggesting that the small effect seen in Fig. 2 may be significant. Uninfected HeLa cells or HeLa cells infected with C. psittaci were transferred to a sterile NMR tube, and the tube was placed in the NMR spectrometer and perfused at 37 °C with oxygenated growth medium for periods up to 3 days. Sequential 31P spectra were acquired continuously and signal-averaged every hour. A full spectrum of uninfected HeLa cells on beads is shown in Fig.3 A. The most prominent peaks are due to phosphocholine, inorganic phosphate (Pi), the γ-phosphate of nucleoside triphosphate (γ-NTP) (which also includes β-NDP), α-NTP (which also includes α-NDP), β-NTP, and uridine diphosphate sugars (UDPS). The assignment of the peaks was based on known chemical shifts of phosphate metabolites from previous studies (17Evans F.E. Kaplan N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4909-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Navon G. Navon R. Shulman R.G. Yamane T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and by spiking the NMR spectra of uninfected HeLa cell extracts with uridine 5′-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine, uridine 5′-diphosphoglucoronic acid, and uridine 5′-diphosphoglucose. A typical extract spectrum is shown in Fig. 3 B, which reveals the presence of the same metabolites as in Fig. 3 A, but also resolves the γ-NTP peak into γ-NTP and β-ADP, and the α-NTP peak into α-NTP and α-NDP. Furthermore, the peak for UDPS is resolved into UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine, and UDP-glucoronic acid. However, due to the invasive nature of the extraction technique and difficulties in quantitating the energy metabolites in extracts, this technique was not used to study metabolism as a function of time during the infection. Previous studies have determined that most of the nucleoside triphosphates consist of ATP, which typically constitutes 60–70% of the total NTP population (19Gallis J.-L. Delmas-Beauvieux M.-C. Biran M. Rousse N. Durand T. Canioni P. NMR Biomed. 1991; 4: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Neeman M. Eldar H. Rushkin E. Degani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, the Pipeak, which is highly sensitive to the pH of the medium, is resolved in the living cells into two peaks, corresponding to the extracellular pH of the growth medium and the intracellular host cell pH (Fig.3 A). The peak due to the intracellular pH remains as a single peak during the entire course of infection (not shown), implying that the pH of the vacuole containing chlamydiae, from early internalization time points through the development of RB-laden inclusions, does not differ significantly from the cytosolic pH, or that the amount of Pi in the vacuole is too low to be detected by this technique. This agrees with previous immunofluorescence studies with pH-sensitive dyes showing that the pH of the Chlamydia vacuole is approximately neutral during the infection (21Heinzen R.A. Scidmore M.A. Rockey D.D. Hackstadt T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 769-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schramm N. Bagnell C.R. Wyrick P.B. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the levels of the different metabolites were determined as a function of time by measuring the intensity of each peak in spectra recorded sequentially. As the line width of each peak did not vary during the NMR recording, changes in peak intensity are directly proportional to changes in the metabolite content. Fig.4 shows the relative concentration for γ-ATP and β-ATP during 2 days, i.e. during one Chlamydia-infection cycle. As mentioned above, the γ-ATP peak includes a minor contribution from β-ADP, but the β-ATP peak is due solely to β-ATP. Compared with the levels in uninfected cells, which increase monotonously due to continuing cell growth in the NMR tube (see Fig. 2), there is an approximately 2-fold enhancement in the levels of γ-ATP and β-ATP in the infected cells. The signal for these metabolites was normalized at time 0 for the number of cells at the start of the NMR experiment. Since these values were not normalized for later time points, the increase in γ-ATP and β-ATP levels in infected cells may in fact be underestimated if there are fewer living cells among the infected cells than among the uninfected cells. With the exception of phosphocholine (not shown), which should not be affected appreciably by the energy requirements of the cell, all the metabolites associated with energy consumption are enhanced by infection. For poorly understood reasons, the UPDS levels are not directly proportional to the number of cells, but can also vary as a consequence of minor changes in cell culture conditions (23Shedd S.F. Lutz N.W. Hull W.E. NMR Biomed. 1993; 6: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, although we observed changes in UDPS levels in infected cells that paralleled the enhancement seen for ATP, we were unable to obtain reproducible changes in UDPS levels in different uninfected cell samples (not shown). To investigate the possible origin of the ATP concentration enhancement, we also measured changes in the metabolism of glucose. ATP is produced when glucose is metabolized via glycolysis to lactate, and through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. Besides glucose, the intermediates and end products observed by us are glycogen, lactate, and glutamate. For these experiments, HeLa cells were transferred into the NMR tube as above, but the growth medium in the perfusion system was replaced with a medium containing [1-13C]glucose at time 0. Fig.5 displays the 13C NMR spectra obtained immediately after adding the 13C-labeled glucose (0 h, spectrum A) and 25 h later (spectrum B). At 0 h, the main metabolites observed are the α- and β-stereoisomers of glucose, which are predominantly in the perfusion medium, with a small broad peak around 30 ppm corresponding to the natural abundance of13C, primarily intracellular membrane components. At 25 h, there is a significant decrease in the intensity of the [1-13C]glucose peaks, with a concomitant increase of other peaks, especially [3-13C]lactate, which is secreted and accumulated in the perfusion medium, the intracellular [4-13C]glutamate, and the [1-13C]glucose residue in glycogen. The rates for glucose consumption and lactate production were determined by plotting the intensities of the corresponding peaks and measuring the slopes from 10 consecutive spectra (equivalent to 5 h) at a time. The insets of Fig. 5 display representative intensity versus time data for glucose disappearance and lactate appearance, from which an acceleration in glucose consumption can be seen for the infected cell samples, since the glucose and lactate curves intersect sooner in the infected cell sample. Fig.6 shows the slopes calculated for both glucose consumption and lactate production. Invariably, the rate of glucose consumption after 1 day of infection was at least twice as high as in the uninfected controls. Glutamate and glycogen labeling could be followed in the same experiment. As opposed to glucose and lactate, which are present predominantly in the growth medium, glutamate and glycogen are present intracellularly. Similarly to the case for ATP, infection with C. psittaci leads to an enhancement in the rate of synthesis of glutamate, whose levels are highest mid-way through the infection cycle (Fig. 7 A), and to glucose incorporation into glycogen (Fig. 7 B). In both infected and control cells, glucose incorporation into glycogen occurs rapidly when the perfusion medium with 13C-labeled glucose is introduced, but in infected cells the accumulation of labeled glycogen is about twice as high as in the uninfected controls (Fig.7 B). The rate of glycolysis is limited by the concentration of the initial substrate, glucose, which is in turn regulated by the presence of glucose transporters on the cell surface (24Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bissell M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 89: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Dominguez J.H. Song B. Liu-Chen S. Qulali M. Howard R. Lee C.H. McAteer J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine if the enhanced glucose consumption and lactate production, and consequently increased ATP levels, may be due to Chlamydia-induced up-regulation of glucose transport, we evaluated whether the expression of the ubiquitous glucose transporter, GLUT-1 (27James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 607-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), changes during infection. HeLa cells were incubated with growth medium or infected with C. psittaci for 24 h, detached from the flasks, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized and incubated with monoclonal antibody against Chlamydia and polyclonal antibodies against GLUT-1. By cytofluorimetry, it was determined that the infection caused up-regulation of GLUT-1 in the infected HeLa cell sample by a factor of 1.93 ± 0.30 (n = 4), consistent with the enhancement of glucose consumption due to infection seen by NMR. The large number of chlamydiae that proliferate within host cells midway through infection raises the obvious question of whether the host cells and/or bacteria can synthesize an additional amount of ATP to compensate for the infection, or whether ATP levels in the host cell decrease during the infection due to the extra energetic demands of the bacteria. We find that not only is sufficient ATP synthesized in the infected cells to maintain normal metabolic levels, but that the ATP concentration increases above normal levels. A similar Chlamydia-induced 2–3-fold enhancement was observed for glycogen and glutamate, and their levels peaked halfway through the infection cycle (24 h), when the metabolic activity of the chlamydiae are also at their highest levels. The concentrations of the energy metabolites then decreased to near-normal levels by 48 h, when many of the RBs have begun to differentiate back to the metabolically inactive EBs. These unexpected changes were paralleled by an increase in the transport and consumption of glucose by the infected cell, which may thus account for most if not all of the extra energy metabolites. Consistent with this interpretation, it has been reported for both cell and animal studies that the availability of glucose is the rate-limiting step in glycolysis (24Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bissell M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1976; 89: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Dominguez J.H. Song B. Liu-Chen S. Qulali M. Howard R. Lee C.H. McAteer J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recent data from the Chlamydia Genome Sequencing Project (http://chlamydia-www.berkeley.edu/4231/) has revealed the presence of several putative genes in C. trachomatis encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism, including enzymes in the glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways. Assuming that the genes express functional proteins, the chlamydiae could also contribute to the enhanced ATP levels observed during the infection. As the NMR technique cannot distinguish between ATP produced by the host cell and the bacteria, the metabolic changes could be due to both host and bacteria. Nonetheless, the overall ATP levels in the cell could not increase unless higher glucose concentrations became available, and thus both bacteria and host cells may benefit from the higher expression of host cell glucose transporters. In agreement with previous studies demonstrating an ATP-ADP exchange activity in C. psittaci (8Hatch T.P. Al-Hossainy E. Silverman J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 662-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Chlamydia Genome Sequencing Project has also revealed the existence of a ChlamydiaADP/ATP translocase, which is homologous to the ADP/ATP translocase of another obligate intracellular bacterium, Rickettsia prowazekii (28Winkler H.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although host-free RBs have low, short-lived metabolic activity, it was previously shown that isolated C. psittaci RBs, unlike the EBs, can in fact take up external ATP through an ATP-ADP exchange mechanism (8Hatch T.P. Al-Hossainy E. Silverman J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 662-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Kmfor transport was approximately 5 μm, well below the eukaryotic ATP concentration of 1–5 mm. Thus, under the conditions of our in vivo measurements by NMR, all of the chlamydial transporters should have been functioning at Vmax, their maximal rate. The requirement for plentiful supplies of host-cell ATP was also demonstrated by studies showing that the incorporation of exogenous glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, isoleucine, and aspartate into chlamydial proteins (29Weiss E. Wilson N.N. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 719-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and bacterial synthesis of lipids and maintenance of the intrabacterial lysine pool (8Hatch T.P. Al-Hossainy E. Silverman J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 662-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Weiss E. Wilson N.N. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 97: 719-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also require exogenous ATP. In contrast to our results, a recent study based on experiments with acid-soluble extracts of host cells found that NTP levels decreased in cells infected with chlamydiae (30Tipples G. McClarty G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, although we have used soluble extracts to assign the peaks in our NMR spectra with known standards, we have not attempted to use this invasive technique for following metabolite concentrations during the infection because of the inherent instability of the high-energy metabolites in the extracts and difficulties in quantitating the relative changes in metabolite concentrations in different extract preparations. Moreover, our noninvasive NMR measurements on living cells revealed an increase in the rate of glucose consumption midway through the infection cycle that agreed well with the glucose concentration changes that had been previously measured in the extracellular medium by standard chemical assays, which showed that infection of cells with C. trachomatis or C. psittaci increases the rate of consumption and catabolism of glucose (31Gill S.D. Stewart R.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1970; 16: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 32Moulder J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 104: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mavrov I.I. Goncharenko M.S. Shchegoleva E.V. Chernobaeva I.A. Pustovoitova L.M. Mikrobiol. Zh. (Kiev). 1991; 53: 95-98PubMed Google Scholar). The enhanced levels of energy metabolites in infected cells coincide with an increase in glucose consumption, which is most likely due to a Chlamydia-induced increase in the expression of glucose transporters on the surface of the infected cell. We have in fact observed that the expression of GLUT-1 increases by a factor of 2 in HeLa cells infected with C. psittaci. GLUTs are a family of facilitated glucose transporters whose members have a high degree of sequence and structural homology among each other (27James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 607-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GLUT-1 has an ubiquitous tissue distribution and is responsible for basal transport of glucose. Some transporters such as GLUT-4 are distributed primarily in adipose tissue and muscle and are localized almost exclusively in vesicles within the cell, while a substantial proportion of GLUT-1 is found on the plasma membrane (34Hudson A.W. Ruiz M. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Haney P.M. Slot J.W. Piper R.C. James D.E. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The importance of GLUT-1 in energy metabolism in vivo has been shown by overexpressing the transporter in the muscle of transgenic mice, which led to enhanced glycolysis and increased levels of glycogen in the muscle (24Ren J.-M.

Insulin causes translocation of GLUT-4 from the internal vesicular pool to the plasma membrane, thus increasing cell surface levels of GLUT-4 by as much as 30-fold (27James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 607-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, GLUT-1 surface expression is increased only 2–3-fold by insulin (37Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the up-regulation induced by Chlamydia infection. Hence, the effects of Chlamydia infection on GLUT-1 levels in HeLa cells resembles the effects of insulin on GLUT-1 expression. It will now be worthwhile determining if other microbial infections representing an energy drain on the host also affect glucose transporter expression, and to elucidate the molecular basis for the increased expression. In conclusion, our studies indicate that chlamydiae compensate for the extra energy load they represent on the infected cell by inducing an increase in the expression of glucose transporters in the host cell, which results in enhanced levels of high-energy metabolites in the infected cell. Thus, the bacteria have succeeded in ensuring an adequate supply of energy metabolites for themselves and for the survival of the host cell, at least long enough for the bacteria to undergo one complete infection cycle.

Res. 269, C1–C7), we identified after deacylation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniaerough strain R20 (O1−:K20−) as a major fraction the oligosaccharide,where Kdo was 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid and Hep p was manno-heptopyranose. The presence of the threo-hex-4-enuronopyranosyl residue indicated a substituent at O-4 of the second GalA residue linked to O-3 of the second l,d-Hep residue, which had been eliminated by treatment with hot alkali. We now report the complete structure of lipopolysaccharide, which was elucidated by additional characterization of isolated core oligosaccharides and analysis of the lipid A. The substituent at O-4 of the second Gal pA isd-GlcpN, which in a fraction of the LPS is substituted at O-6 by three or four residues ofd-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose (d,d-Hepp). The complete carbohydrate backbone of the LPS is as follows,Graphical AbstractView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)(l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose;l,d-Hepp), where all hexoses possess the d-configuration. Sugars marked with an asterisk are present in nonstoichiometric amounts. The structure is unique with regard to the presence of an α1→2-linkedd-glycero-d-manno-heptoglycan (oligosaccharide), which has not been described to date, and does not contain phosphate substituents in the core region. Fatty acid analysis of lipid A identified (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid as sole amide-linked fatty acid and (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, small amounts of 2-hydroxytetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, and traces of dodecanoic acid as ester-linked fatty acids, substituting the carbohydrate backboned-GlcpN4Pβ1→6d-GlcpNα1P. The nonreducing GlcN carries four fatty acids, present as two 3-O-tetradecanoyltetradecanoic acid residues, one of which is amide-linked and the other ester-linked to O-3′. The reducing GlcN is substituted in a nature fraction of lipid A by two residues of (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid, one in amide and the other in ester linkage at O-3. Two minor fractions of lipid A were identified; in one, the amide-linked (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid at the reducing GlcN is esterified with hexadecanoic acid, resulting in 3-O-hexadecanoyltetradecanoic acid, and in the second, one of the 3-O-tetradecanoyltetradecanoic acid residues at the nonreducing GlcN is replaced by 3-O-dodecanoyltetradecanoic acid. Thus, the complete structure of LPS is as shown in Fig.1.After immunization of BALB/c mice, two monoclonal antibodies were obtained that were shown to be specific for the core of LPS from K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae, since they did not react with LPS or whole-cell lysates of a variety of other Gram-negative species. Both monoclonal antibodies could be inhibited by LPS but not by isolated oligosaccharides and are thus considered to recognize a conformational epitope in the core region.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium associated with nosocomial infections (1Montgomerie J.Z. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1979; 1: 736-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It represents a major cause of mortality in hospital-acquired infections (2Williams P. Tomàs J.M. Rev. Med. Microbiol. 1990; 1: 196-204Google Scholar) and is (following Escherichia coli) the second most frequent microorganism isolated from patients with Gram-negative septicemia. Capsular polysaccharides and LPS 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid;d,d-Hep,d-glycero-d-manno-heptose;l,d-Hep,l-glycero-d-manno-heptose; HPAE, high performance anion exchange chromatography; GLC, gas-liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LD, laser desorption; FAB, fast atom bombardment; MS, mass spectrometry; COSY, correlated spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; EIA, enzyme immunoassay. are important virulence factors of K. pneumoniae (1Montgomerie J.Z.

Res. 1995; 269: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar for references) from LPS have been investigated extensively. A structural investigation of the LPS core region began only recently (4Süsskind M. Müller-Loennies S. Nimmich W. Brade H. Holst O. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 269: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Severn W.B. Kelly R.F. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1731-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a preliminary investigation (4Süsskind M. Müller-Loennies S. Nimmich W. Brade H. Holst O. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 269: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) of LPS from the rough mutant K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae R20 (O1−:K20−), we isolated from deacylated LPS the major fraction of the carbohydrate backbone and characterized its structure. It possessed a terminal threo-hex-4-enuronic acid residue, which resulted from β-elimination under the alkaline conditions used, indicating a further substitution at position O-4 of a second GalA residue. In another investigation (5Severn W.B. Kelly R.F. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1731-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the structure of the core region of LPS from serotype O8 was found to be similar to that of LPS of serotype O1. In this case, the eliminated substituent was α-d-Glcp linked at O-4 of the second GalA residue. Both core regions lack phosphate residues, which is so far unique in enterobacterial LPS. Several attempts have been made to develop anti-LPS antibodies as therapeutic agents in septic patients. All three regions of LPS, i.e. the O-specific polysaccharide, the core region, and the lipid A, can act as immunogen; however, the O-antigen expresses high structural variability, even within one species, and lipid A antigenicity is cryptic in LPS and exposed as a neoantigen only after removal of the lipid A-distal saccharide moiety (6Brade L. Engel R. Christ W.J. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3961-3965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core region has been identified as a suitable target for the induction of antibodies with broad cross-reactivity among all E. colistrains. One antibody, named WN1 222–5 (7Di Padova F.E. Brade H. Barclay R. Poxton I.R. Liehl E. Schütze E. Kocher H.P. Ramsay G. Schreier M.H. McClelland D.B.L. Rietschel E.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Di Padova F.E.

The outer core oligosaccharide and phosphate substituents seem to stabilize a given conformation also required for binding. Since our preliminary investigation of the Klebsiella core had indicated a similar structure of the heptose-Kdo region as in E. coli, except for the absence of phosphate groups, we investigated details of the chemical structure and its relation to immunoreactivity in Klebsiella. K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae rough strain R20 (O1−:K20−) was obtained from W. Nimmich (Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Rostock, Germany). Its cultivation and the isolation of LPS from dried bacteria have been reported earlier (4Süsskind M. Müller-Loennies S. Nimmich W. Brade H. Holst O. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 269: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). LPS from E. coli with core types R1, R2, R3, R4, and K-12 strain W3100, and S. enterica sv. Minnesota R60 were obtained from our LPS collection. Clinical isolates of Enterobacter, Serratia, Hafnia, Citrobacter, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Neisseria sicca, S. enterica sv. Panama, Providencia alcaligenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella sonnei, Hemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were kindly provided by R. Podschun (Department of Medical Microbiology and Virology, University of Kiel, Germany). The LPS (208 mg) was hydrolyzed in 1% acetic acid (100 °C, 45 min), and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (2,500 × g, 1 h) and lyophilized to give lipid A (94 mg, 45% of LPS). The supernatant was evaporated to dryness, dissolved in water, centrifuged (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 2 h) and separated by gel permeation chromatography on TSK HW40 (S). The main fraction (52 mg, 25% of LPS) was separated by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAE), from which, after desalting by gel permeation chromatography, oligosaccharides 1–5 could be isolated in pure form: heptasaccharide 1 (3.7 mg, 1.8% of the LPS), octasaccharide 2 (13.4 mg, 6.4% of the LPS), decasaccharide 3 (4 mg, 1.9% of the LPS), undecasaccharide 4 (4.5 mg, 2.2% of the LPS), and dodecasaccharide 5 (1.8 mg, 0.9% of the LPS). The LPS was dephosphorylated (48% HF, 4 °C, 48 h; yield was 76% of the LPS) and hydrolyzed (1% acetic acid, 100 °C, 90 min), and the dephosphorylated lipid A was extracted with CH2Cl2, dried, and subjected to laser desorption mass spectrometry (LD-MS). Compositional analysis, gel permeation chromatography on TSK HW40 (S), and the determination of the absolute configuration of Glc and GlcN were performed as described (9Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the determination of the absolute configuration of GalA, LPS was methanolyzed (0.5 m methanolic HCl, 85 °C, 40 min) and centrifuged, and the supernatant was carboxyl-reduced (NaBH4, 4 °C, 24 h). The content of the resultingd-Gal was measured using d-galactose oxidase (Sigma) and a peroxidase assay (Boehringer Mannheim), according to the supplier's instructions. The absolute configuration of the hydroxy fatty acids was determined by GLC of the phenylethylamide derivatives (10Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Analyses for ester- and amide-linked fatty acids and ester-linked acyloxyacyl groups were performed as described (11Wollenweber H.-W. Rietschel E.T. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1990; 11: 195-211Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar), as was SDS-PAGE (10 and 18% acrylamide) (12Vinogradov E.V. Pantophlet R. Dijkshoorn L. Brade L. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 602-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), gels of which were stained with silver nitrate for the detection of LPS (13Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar) or with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for the detection of proteins. Analytical and semipreparative HPAE were performed as described (14Holst O. Bock K. Brade L. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), with the modification that in semipreparative HPAE the CarboPac PA1 column was eluted at 3 ml min−1, using a gradient program of isocratically 1% B (0–10 min), then linearly to 2% B over 20 min, linearly to 3% B over 10 min, linearly to 5% B over 10 min, and linearly to 7% over 10 min (A, deionized water; B, 1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0). Methylation of carboxyl-reduced oligosaccharide 1 (2 mg) was carried out according to Ciucanu and Kerek (15Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). The methylated sample was hydrolyzed (2 mtrifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C, 2 h), reduced (NaB2H4), acetylated, and analyzed using GLC-MS. Methylation analysis of the Kdo region was performed on dephosphorylated LPS (6 mg) as published (16Tacken A. Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 149: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GLC and GLC/MS were carried out as described (9Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The temperature program in GLC was as follows: 110 °C for 3 min and then 3 °C min−1 to 270 °C. LD-MS was performed on a laser microprobe mass analyzer 500 (Leibold-Heraeus, Cologne, Germany), equipped with a microprobe and a time-of-flight mass analyzer. The intensity of the laser beam was 1012 watts cm−1. Between 5 and 20 pg of the sample were analyzed per laser pulse. For fast atom bombardment (FAB)-MS, LPS preparations were dissolved in water at a final concentration of 10 mg ml−1. Positive and negative ion mode FAB-MS were carried out using the first two sectors of a Jeol JMS-SX/SX 102A tandem mass spectrometer (Department of Mass Spectrometry, Utrecht University, The Netherlands) operating at 10 kV (mass range, m/z 20–2400) accelerating voltage. The FAB gun was operated at an emission current of 10 mA with xenon as the bombarding gas. Spectra were scanned at a speed of 30 s for the full mass range specified by the accelerating voltage used and were recorded and processed on a Hewlett-Packard HP 9000 data system. In all experiments, the matrix used was thioglycerol (2–3 μl), and the probe was loaded with 1 μl of sample solution. For structural assignments, NMR spectra were recorded on solutions (0.5 ml) of oligosaccharides 1, 3, and 4 (2–3 mg each), 2 (13 mg), and 5 (1.5 mg) in2H2O with a Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer (1H NMR, 600.13 MHz, 13C NMR 125.77 MHz) at 27 °C. The resonances were measured relative to internal acetone ((CH3)2CO δH 2.225; δC 31.07). One-dimensional 1H,13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AM 360 L spectrometer (1H, 360 MHz; 13C, 90.6 MHz; 31P, 145.8 MHz) at 23 °C (CH3CN, δH 1.95 ppm; δC 1.70 ppm) to confirm purity. Coupling constants (±0.5 Hz) were determined on a first order basis. The phase-sensitive COSY experiments were performed using double quantum filtering (17Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G.

Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1887) Google Scholar) with the Bruker COSYPHDQ microprogram, using 1,024 t1 increments and a sweep width of 2.5 KHz and collecting 4,096 data points in the F2dimension. The data matrix was zero-filled in the F1 dimension to give a matrix of 4 × 2,048 points and was resolution-enhanced in both dimensions by a shifted sine-bell function before Fourier transformation. The total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) (19Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar) and the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) (20Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4838) Google Scholar) experiments were performed according to the method of States et al. (21States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) in the phase-sensitive mode. A decoupling in the presence of scalar interactions (DIPSI-2) (22Rucker S.P. Shaka A.J. Mol. Phys. 1989; 68: 509-517Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar) spin lock pulse sequence was used in the TOCSY experiment with a mixing time of 125 ms and a spin lock power of 7,300 Hz. The NOESY experiments were performed with a mixing time of 200 ms. The intensities of NOESY cross-peaks were classified as strong, medium, or weak, using cross-peaks from intraring proton-proton contacts for calibration. The13C,1H COSY spectra were measured in the1H detected mode via multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) (23Bax A. Morris G. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 42: 501-505Google Scholar), using a GARP sequence (24Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 67: 547-552Google Scholar) to decouple 13C couplings during acquisition. The experiments were carried out in the phase-sensitive mode by the States time-proportional phase incrementation phase-cycling method (25Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar) acquiring a total of 4,096 points over a sweep width of 4,545 Hz in F2 and 1,024 in F1 over 13,500 Hz. Processing was performed using standard Bruker software after zero-filling to 2,048 in F1. The COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and HMQC spectra were assigned using the computer program PRONTO (26Kjaer M. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 289: 288-307Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which allows the simultaneous display of different two-dimensional spectra and the individual labeling of cross-peaks. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared by conventional protocols after immunization of BALB/c mice with heat-killed bacteria (K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae rough strain R20) by intravenous injection on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 with 20, 20, 60, and 120 μg, respectively. On days 90, 91, and 92, mice received a booster injection of 200 μg each; the first injection was intravenous, and the last two were intraperitoneal. Fusion was performed on day 94. Cell culture, media, and the fusion protocol were described previously (27Fu Y. Baumann M. Kosma P. Brade L. Brade H. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1314-1321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary hybridomas were screened by Western blot with bacterial whole-cell lysates as antigen, and relevant hybridomas were cloned at least three times by limiting dilution, isotyped using an isotyper kit (Bio-Rad), and adapted to serum-free medium supplement with Ultroser (Life Technologies, Inc.). Culture supernatants were prepared in at least 100-ml quantities, and antibodies were purified on protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the supplier's instructions. Purification was ascertained by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). mAb WN1 222–5 (IgG2a) binding to the core region of all E. coli strains has been described earlier (7Di Padova F.E.

All serological methods such as enzyme immunoassay (EIA), using LPS as solid phase antigen, EIA inhibition, hemagglutination and inhibition of hemagglutination, and the Western blot technique were described previously (27Fu Y.

Compositional analysis of the LPS (structure shown in Fig.1) revealed the presence ofd-Glc; d-GlcN; d-GalA;l,d-Hep; d,d-Hep; Kdo; (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid; tetradecanoic acid; small amounts of 2-hydroxytetradecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, and dodecanoic acid; and phosphate. In an earlier report (4Süsskind M. Müller-Loennies S. Nimmich W. Brade H. Holst O. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 269: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) on the structure of the core region from LPS of K. pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae strain R20, we presented as a major product obtained from deacylated LPS one oligosaccharide representing the carbohydrate backbone of lipid A and part of the core region (Structure 1). This oligosaccharide possessed a terminal β-threo-hex-4-enuronopyranosyl residue, indicating the loss of at least one substituent at O-4 of a GalA residue by β-elimination due to treatment with hot KOH. To elucidate the complete structure of the core region, we treated the LPS with 1% acetic acid to cleave the ketosidic Kdo-lipid A linkage and isolated the resulting core oligosaccharides. In a first step, two fractions were obtained from gel permeation chromatography of the hydrolysate, the second of which contained mainly Kdo and was thus not further investigated. The major fraction was separated by HPAE at pH 6.0 (Fig.2), yielding oligosaccharides 1–5 (Fig.3). Monosaccharide analysis of the oligosaccharides revealed that they all contained d-Glc,l,d-Hep, Kdo, and d-GlcN. In oligosaccharides 3–5, d,d-Hep was additionally identified.Figure 3Structures of oligosaccharides M3, M4, and 1–5.

Except where indicated, hexoses are d-configured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The structures of the isolated oligosaccharides were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and are presented in Fig. 3. Chemical shifts of1H and 13C NMR spectra were assigned using COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and HMQC experiments and the computer program PRONTO (26Kjaer M. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 289: 288-307Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The data are given in Tables Table I, Table II, Table III. Nine signals were identified in the anomeric region of the 1H NMR spectrum of decasaccharide 3 (Figs. 4 and5, TableI), six of which (residues E, F, G, L, M, N, O; compare Fig. 1) were assigned to manno-configured heptose residues as established by small JH-1,H-2 coupling constants (≤2 Hz, except in the case of residue E, which possessed JH-1,H-22.5 Hz) and by the coupling constants of the other ring protons. Three other anomeric signals were attributed to two α- (residues H and K) and one β-linked (I) hexoses possessing an axial H-2, as characterized by the chemical shifts and JH-1, H-2 coupling constants (5.322 ppm (3.8 Hz), residue H; 5.127 ppm (4.0 Hz), residue K; 4.551 ppm (7.8 Hz), residue I). Characteristic high field signals of deoxy protons at 1.810 ppm (H-3ax) and 2.119 ppm (H-3eq) identified α-linked Kdo as the 10th residue. Residue K was established as α-linked GlcN by characteristic high field shifts of H-2 (3.233 ppm) and C-2 (54.5 ppm). The 13C NMR spectrum was assigned by an HMQC experiment (Fig. 6, TableII). It contained eight signals in the anomeric region, one of which (at 100.7 ppm) consisted of three nonresolved resonances. Low field shifted signals indicated the substitution at O-2 of residues L and M (C-2 at 78.8 ppm, nonresolved), at O-4 of H (C-4 at 79.6 ppm), at O-5 of C (C-5 at 74.6 ppm), at O-6 of K (C-6 at 65.2 ppm), at O-3 (C-3 at 75.8 ppm) and O-4 (C-4 at 74.1 ppm) of E, and at O-3 (C-3 at 79.6 ppm) and O-7 (C-7 at 69.9 ppm) of F. Residues G, I, and N are terminal residues.Figure 5TOCSY spectrum (anomeric region) of oligosaccharide 3. The spectrum was recorded at 600 MHz and 27 °C.

The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 272 amino acids with potential coiled-coil domains and a C-terminal hydrophobic tail.

A biochemical and biophysical understanding of vesicular transport at the molecular level has been facilitated by in vitroassays, which reconstitute transport processes in cell-free systems (1Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Thus, molecular components required for both vesicle budding (2Waters M.G. Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and vesicle docking/fusion processes (3Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 4Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E.

NSF works in conjunction with another soluble factor, the soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) in mediating vesicle docking (1Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Membrane components that are responsible for determining the specificity of the docking and fusion of the right vesicles to the right membranes are eventually identified based on the ability to interact with SNAP (4Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). These are known as SNAP receptors (SNARE). SNAREs can be broadly divided into two classes. Those present on transport vesicles are the v-SNAREs, and those present on the target membranes are the t-SNAREs. Thus, the SNARE hypothesis, a working hypothesis proposed by Rothman and co-workers (3Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar,4Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar), holds that a transport vesicle chooses its target for fusion when v-SNAREs pair with the cognate t-SNAREs at the target membrane. Genetic dissections of the yeast secretory pathway and the biochemical characterization of molecules involved in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion have resulted in the isolation and/or molecular cloning of putative SNARE molecules that are structurally related (5Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 6Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). However, isolation of SNAREs in the constitutive secretory and endocytotic pathway in mammalian cells remains difficult. This difficulty has been overcome in part by the availability of an expanding data base of expressed sequence tags (EST) and efficient data base search and sequence alignment programs (7Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar). The first member of the syntaxin family of proteins, syntaxin 1A, was first characterized as a neuronal-specific protein involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release (8Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Its localization to the plasma membrane and its interaction with the synaptic vesicle v-SNARE synaptobrevin point to its function as a t-SNARE. Subsequently, a family of syntaxin-related molecules that shares 23–84% amino acid identity has been identified (6Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D.

These syntaxins are more ubiquitous in their expressions in various tissues, which is indicative of their possible functions in other vesicular transport steps in the cell. These syntaxins also display a variety of cellular localizations within the secretory pathway. Whereas syntaxins 2, 3, and 4 are apparently cell surface proteins (6Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E.

The transport from the early endosome to the late endosome and lysosome is a major route of intracellular membrane trafficking. However, little is known at the molecular level about the mechanisms regulating membrane interactions in the endocytic pathway beyond early endosomes. Recently, it has been shown that COP1 coat components participate in endosomal transport (12Whitney J.A. Gomez M. Sheff D. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. Cell. 1995; 83: 703-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro transport assay to study the biochemical properties of endosome docking and fusion events, Robinson et al. (13Robinson L.J. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that NSF and SNAPs are required for several steps of endosomal membrane transport. Of the known SNAREs, only the v-SNARE cellubrevin has been shown to have an endosomal localization (14Link E. McMahon H. Fischer von Mollard G. Yamasaki S. Niemann H. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18423-18426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Should the mechanism of vesicular transport in the endosomes not differ too drastically from its exocytic counterpart, one might expect to find members of the syntaxin family functioning as t-SNAREs in the endosomal membranes. In this report, we present such a molecule. Cell lines were primarily from the American Type Culture Collection.

Data base searches were performed with the various BLAST algorithms available at the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) World Wide Web server. Library screening, cloning, and DNA sequencing were performed using standard methods as described (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, New York1993Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed using a rat multiple tissue Northern blot from CLONTECH. In vitro translation of various constructs was performed using in vitro translation kits from Promega according to the manufacturer's protocol. For in vitro binding assays (18Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 12 (amino acids 1–248) was generated by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the the plasmid pBSK (Stratagene). [35S]Methionine-labeled translation product was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with either glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-αSNAP, or GST-syndet in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 3% glycerol, 7 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Nonidet P40 at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed twice with the complete incubation buffer, twice in buffer without bovine serum albumin, and twice in buffer without bovine serum albumin and Nonidet P-40. SDS sample buffer was then added, and the SDS eluates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cytoplasmic domain of the protein is expressed either as hexahistidine-tagged or GST fusion proteins in bacteria. The fusion proteins were also used to immunize rabbits. Polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified from serum harvested after several booster injections by the fusion proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose strips. Cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (19Tang B.L. Low S.H. Hong W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells plated on coverslips and subjected to various treatments were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde followed by sequential incubation with the primary antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fluorescence labeling was visualized using an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with epifluorescence optics or MRC600 (Bio-Rad) confocal laser optics. Data base searches have allowed us to identified human ESTs (accession numbers R21569 and N99549) potentially coding for a syntaxin-like molecule. A complete cDNA was isolated from a rat brain cDNA library, and sequencing revealed a 272-amino acid open reading frame as shown in Fig.1 A. The predicted amino acid sequence has a stretch of 22 hydrophobic residues at the C terminus, as illustrated by a Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plot (Fig.1 B). This primary structure is characteristic of a hydrophobic tail anchor. The polypeptide has several potential regions that may form coiled-coil structures, as revealed by the Coils version 2.1 program (Fig. 1 C). A data base search using the NCBI BLAST program revealed that the coding sequence has the highest homology with members of the syntaxin family, particularly in the coiled-coil region preceding the C-terminal transmembrane domain (Fig.2 A). A multiple tissue Northern blot with the full-length cDNA showed that the transcript has a fairly ubiquitous expression, being more abundant in brain, lung, and kidney (Fig. 2 B). Based on ESTs identified by data base searches, a series of 10 novel syntaxins has been previously described (21Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A search of the GenBankTM dbest data base revealed several human ESTs that, in view of their sequence homology, represent the human homologs of our rat cDNA. Among these, three human ESTs (R29508, AA167677, andT08774) have been listed as syntaxin 12, syntaxin 13, and syntaxin 14, respectively (21Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 C is a schematic diagram of how the translated sequence of these ESTs match with the coding region of the rat cDNA. As shown, the limited and inaccurate sequence information of these ESTs only allowed each of them to be matched with a portion of the coding region. There is a short overlap between AA167677 andR29508. T08774 matches to the C-terminal portion of the rat protein. Apparently, these assumed syntaxins 12, 13, and 14 represent the human homolog of the rat protein. Based on the limited sequence data alone, these ESTs were assumed to represent individual syntaxin-like molecules. Our results therefore caution against the assignment of individual identity to an EST before full-length sequence information of each is available. To avoid any further confusion in the nomenclature of new members of the syntaxin family, we have retained the name syntaxin 12 for this protein. The predicted primary structure of syntaxin 12 and its homology to other syntaxins suggest that it is a SNARE molecule. We sought to confirm this by investigating if syntaxin 12 binds to α-SNAP in vitro. [35S]Methionine-labeled translation product of the soluble cytoplasmic domain of both syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 12 was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with either GST or GST-αSNAP. As shown in Fig.3, the binding of the syntaxin 1A cytodomain to GST-αSNAP is significantly higher than to GST itself. Such is also the case for syntaxin 12. On the other hand, mSEC13 (20Tang B.L. Peter F. Krijnse-Locker J. Low S.H. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a protein with multiple β-transducin or WD-40 repeats known to participate in protein-protein interactions, did not exhibit significant binding to GST-αSNAP. The ability of syntaxin 12 to bind αSNAP is in good agreement with its putative function as a SNARE. Syntaxin 1 is known to exist in complex with another neuronal-specific SNARE molecule, SNAP-25 (22Otto H. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 23Söllner T. Bennet M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). A novel nonneuronal molecule that binds syntaxin and synaptobrevin and is homologous to SNAP-25 has since been cloned from human B lymphocyte (18Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and based on its molecular size, is called SNAP-23. Recently, syndet, a ubiquitous mouse protein homologous to SNAP-25 has also been cloned (15Wang G. Witkin J.W. Hao G. Bankaitis V.A. Scherer P.E. Baldini G. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the sequence similarity, syndet appear to be the mouse homolog of human SNAP-23. We sought to determine if syntaxin 12 could also interact in vitro with syndet/SNAP-23. As shown in Fig. 3, both syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 12 binds to syndet/SNAP-23 with high specificity, whereas mSEC13 again exhibits no binding. The ability of syntaxin 12 to bind SNAP-23 is highly suggestive of its functional similarity with other members of the syntaxin family. That syntaxin 12 is indeed a membrane-anchored protein was confirmed by the fact that its full-length translated product could not be stripped off membranes by high salt (1 m KCl) or high pH (sodium bicarbonate, pH 11) treatment but could be solubilized with a detergent such as Triton X-100 (Fig.4 A).To further characterize the molecule, rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised using bacterially expressed fusion protein. The affinity-purified antibody detected a ∼39-kDa band by immunoblot analysis of the in vitro translated product of the full-length cDNA and NRK cell lysates (Fig. 4 B). Detection can be abolished by co- or preincubation of the antibody with excess amount of the fusion protein (not shown). As a first step toward functional characterization of syntaxin 12, we performed indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to localized the protein in several cell lines. As shown in Fig.5, the antibody-stained intracellular structures clustered at the perinuclear region of mouse (MEF), human (HeLa), and rat (NRK) cells. To confirm the membrane topology of syntaxin 12, cells were permeabilized with 20 μg/ml digitonin, which would selectively permeabilized the plasma membrane while leaving the internal membranes intact, or 1 mg/ml saponin, which would permeabilize all membranes. Cells were then double-labeled with syntaxin 12 polyclonal antibody and a monoclonal antibody against the lumenal domain of the Golgi protein mannosidase II. As shown in Fig. 5, digitonin-permeabilized cells were labeled for syntaxin 12 only and not mannosidase II. Permeabilization of the plasma membrane was indeed achieved because under the same conditions, cytoplasmic tubulin was also labeled (not shown). As expected, both syntaxin 12 and mannosidase II were labeled in saponin-permeabilized cells. Syntaxin 12 is thus membrane-anchored, with a large portion of its N terminus exposed in the cytoplasm, a topology characteristic of all syntaxins but not all SNAREs identified to date. All syntaxins discovered to date were localized to either the Golgi region or the cell surface, indicating that they function along the exocytic pathway. As shown in Fig. 6, the antibody labeled perinuclear structures in NRK cells. The labeling pattern in NRK cells resembles that of the the TGN marker, TGN38 (24Luzio J.P. Burke B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), double-labeled in the same cell although not completely colocalized. The fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) has varying effects on the morphology of subcellular organelles and on the distribution of various markers on these organelles (25Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The distribution of Golgi markers to the endoplasmic reticulum (25Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) and the collapse of TGN markers TGN38 (26Reaves B. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and furin proprotein convertase (27Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and endosomal markers (28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 29Wood S.A. Brown W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 119: 273-285Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) into the microtubule-organizing center upon BFA treatment had been extensively documented. The effect of BFA on the morphology of a particular protein is therefore often useful in determining its subcellular localization. Treatment of cells with 10 μg/ml BFA resulted in the collapse of the structure into a compact structure characteristic of the microtubule-organizing center, colocalizing well with that of TGN38. This result suggests that the perinuclear staining of syntaxin 12 is not that of the Golgi apparatus (which under this condition would have redistributed to the endoplasmic reticulum) but may be that of the TGN or the endosomes. BFA, however, also causes a fusion of the endosomes with the trans-Golgi network (28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), and endosomal markers behave quite like TGN markers at the end point of the BFA effect. To further determine the exact localization of the rat syntaxin and differentiate between the two possibilities, we treat cells with wortmannin, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (31Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). This drug has been shown to alter the morphology of endosomes but not the Golgi apparatus or the trans-Golgi network (32Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 33Reaves B.J. Bright N.A. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although wortmannin treatment did not alter the perinuclear Golgi staining marked by the TGN38 monoclonal antibody, the perinuclear structure marked by the rat syntaxin antibody in the same cells were converted into swollen vacuoles, characteristic of wortmannin-induced changes to the stainings of endosomal markers such as the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (32Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We observed this as well in another cell line, L2 (not shown). The above results strongly suggest that the rat syntaxin-like molecule is localized to a BFA and wortmannin-sensitive endosomal compartment. We have therefore cloned a novel member of the syntaxin family with a unique subcellular localization. None of the syntaxins 1–6 published to date are associated with the endosome. Exogenous expression of syntaxin 1A does result in intracellular localization in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, and exogenous expression of syntaxin 3 does have an intracellular component (10Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Weimbs T. Kömüves L.G. Bennett M.K. Mostov K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2007-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These intracellular stainings were, however, shown not to be endosomal in nature but rather colocalized with a lysosomal marker (10Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Weimbs T. Kömüves L.G. Bennett M.K. Mostov K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2007-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Another novel syntaxin, known as syntaxin 7, has recently been cloned in our laboratory (34Wong S.H. Xu Y. Zhang T. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 375-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as by Wang et al. (35Wang H. Frelin L. Pevsner J. Gene. 1997; 199: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on its homology to yeast and plant vacuolar syntaxins, Wang et al. proposed that syntaxin 7 may have a role in trafficking between the Golgi apparatus and the lysosomes. Our immunolocalization data, however, suggest that syntaxin 7 is localized to the endosomes (34Wong S.H. Xu Y. Zhang T. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 375-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In view of the localizations of syntaxin 7 and syntaxin 12, the transport machinery of the endocytic pathway, like its exocytic counterpart, also utilizes members of the syntaxin family. What may the function of syntaxin 12 be? There are several possibilities. Judging by its compact, perinuclear staining, syntaxin 12 may well reside in a late endosomal compartment. Indeed it does not colocalize with transiently internalized transferin (not shown). However, we could not rule out that small amounts of syntaxin 12 may reside in the early endosomes. If solely localize to a late endosomal compartment, syntaxin 12 may function to receive vesicles either from the TGN or the early endosome or participate in the recycling of surface receptors. Elucidation of its exact role in transport awaits experiments involving effective functional disruption either by the introduction of negative dominant mutants, inhibitory antibodies, or targeted disruption of the gene.

https://openalex.org/W1975592746,"The Tal1 oncogene is a class II basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, overexpressed in as much as 60% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. Like other class II bHLH proteins, Tal1 can heterodimerize with the class I bHLH proteins, such as E47, and bind to a DNA recognition sequence termed E box. Therefore, it is believed that the oncogenic capacity of Tal1 lies in its ability, as a heterodimer with E47, to activate aberrantly a set of “leukemogenic” genes in T cells. However, compared with E47 homodimers, Tal1/E47 heterodimers are very poor transactivators. Thus the effect of Tal1 is actually to inhibit E47 homodimer activity. Here we propose that the transforming properties of Tal1 are the result of its ability to inhibit E47 activity. We address the mechanism of Tal1 inhibition and demonstrate that Tal1/E47 heterodimers cannot activate transcription because their respective activation domains are incompatible. Furthermore, we present data showing that Tal1 can inhibit E47-mediated activation of the CIP1 gene. Finally, we demonstrate that Tal1 inhibits E47 activity in leukemic T cells.

Members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; LUC, luciferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. family of transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in cell type determination and differentiation (1Kadesch T.

Hollenberg S. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). They have been grouped into two classes depending on their expression pattern as either ubiquitous or tissue-specific (3Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Class I ubiquitous bHLH proteins can form either homodimers or heterodimers with other class I proteins and with the class II tissue-specific bHLH proteins. Both homodimers and heterodimers have been shown to bind to a canonical DNA sequence, termed E box, located in the regulatory elements of various cell type-specific genes, and concomitantly activate gene transcription. In addition to their roles in cell development, four members of this family, E2A, Lyl1, Tal1, and Tal2, have also been implicated in oncogenesis (4Begley C.G. Aplan P.D. Denning S.M. Haynes B.F.

Tal1, encoding a class II bHLH protein, was originally identified by virtue of its translocation and overexpression in 3% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases (4Begley C.G. Aplan P.D.

Buchanan G. Carroll A. Crist W. Ozanne B. Siciliano M.J. Baer R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses have shown that Tal1 is overexpressed in as much as 60% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases through either a specific, interstitial chromosomal deletion event or through other undetectable alterations in DNA (9Bash R.O. Hall S. Timmons C.F. Crist W.M. Amylon M. Smith R.G. Baer R. Blood. 1995; 86: 666-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Brown L. Cheng J.T. Chen Q. Siciliano M.J. Crist W. Buchanan G. Baer R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3343-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, Tal1 is not normally expressed in T cells; rather it is expressed in the developing hematopoietic system, endothelial cells, and the developing brain (11Pulford K. Lecointe N. Leroy-Viard K. Jones M. Mathieu-Mahul D. Mason D.Y. Blood. 1995; 85: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kallianpur A.R. Jordan J.E. Brandt S.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene knockout experiments in mice have shown that Tal1 plays a crucial role in primitive erythropoiesis (13Shivdasani R.A. Mayer E.L. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Subsequent rescue experiments with chimeras have demonstrated that Tal1 is required for the development of all hematopoietic lineages (14Porcher C. Swat W. Rockwell K. Fujiwara Y. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1996; 86: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In conjunction, cell culture experiments have suggested that Tal1 may also play a role in terminal erythroid differentiation, possibly in cooperation with the zinc finger proteins LMO2 and GATA-1 (15Green A.R. DeLuca E. Begley C.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4153-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbits T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Recent experiments in transgenic mice have demonstrated the oncogenic potential of Tal1, for when Tal1 expression is directed to the T cell compartment through the promoter of the lymphoid cell kinase gene, these mice develop T cell lymphoma (17Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 18Condorelli G.L. Facchiano F. Valtieri M. Proietti E. Vitelli L. Lulli V. Huebner K. Peschle C. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5113-5119PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of Tal1-mediated leukemogenesis remains unknown. Because Tal1 is capable of heterodimerizing with the ubiquitous bHLH E proteins (E12, E47, E2-2, HEB) and binding to DNA, it is thought that Tal1 aberrantly activates genes in T cells, whose expression then leads ultimately to leukemogenesis (19Hsu H.L. Huang L. Tsan J.T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Rabbits T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). However, Tal1/E47 heterodimers are less than 10% as active as E47 homodimers in their ability to activate a reporter gene driven by E box elements (21Hsu H.L. Wadman I. Tsan J.T. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of Tal1 is actually to inhibit the transactivation potential of E47 homodimers. Therefore, an alternative mechanism may be that Tal1, instead of acting as a transcriptional activator, promotes oncogenesis by acting as an inhibitor of E47 activity. The purpose of this study was to address mechanistically the following question: If Tal1/E47 heterodimers can bind to DNA with the same or higher affinities than those of E47 homodimers (19Hsu H.L. Huang L. Tsan J.T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), why do they activate transcription so poorly? To address this question, fusion proteins of Tal1 and E47 were constructed. Specifically, we asked which regions of E47 can turn Tal1 into an activator, and which regions of Tal1 can turn E47 into an inhibitor. Furthermore, in addition to artificial reporters, we also tested the effect of Tal1 on the native promoter of an E47-activated gene, which could potentially be a target for Tal1 inhibition. Thus far, E47 has been shown to regulate the expression of B cell-specific genes, such as the immunoglobulin and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase genes (22Kim J.K. Shen C. Radomska H.S. Eckhardt L.A. Kadesch T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5014-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1156-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Obviously in the context of T cell leukemia, these are not relevant targets for Tal1. Recent experiments have shown that E47 plays a general role in negatively regulating the proliferation of cells (24Peverali F.A. Ramqvist T. Saffrich R. Pepperkik R. Barone M.V. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and that this effect may be mediated by the ability of E47 to activate expression of the gene for CIP1 (p21, WAF1, Sdi1), an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (25Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar, 26Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To determine if CIP1 may be a potential target for negative regulation by Tal1, we therefore asked if Tal1 can inhibit the ability of E47 to transactivate the CIP1 gene. The pTal1-myc (hereafter called pTal1), TalM1/pBS, and pfLUC constructs were as described (29Cheng J.T. Hsu H.L. Hwang L.Y. Baer R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mahajan M.A. Park S.T. Sun X.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2343-2350PubMed Google Scholar, 31Saisanit S. Sun X.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p21-LUC construct (a gift from X.-F. Wang, Duke University) contains the 2.4- kilobase HindIII fragment of the p21 promoter inserted into the pGL2-basic vector (Promega) (32Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The pCMV-LacZ construct was made by inserting an HindIII-XbaI fragment from LacZ/pcDNAI (gift from D. Levy, New York University Medical Center) into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The CIP1/pBKS plasmid was a gift from M. Garabedian (New York University Medical Center). E47/pcDNA3 was constructed by a two-step cloning procedure. an EcoRI-XhoI fragment, spanning amino acid residues 1–372 from a full-length E47 cDNA clone, was first ligated into pcDNA3. The remaining 3′-end of the cDNA was then added as an XhoI fragment. The pEbox-LUC construct, containing five copies of the optimal binding site for Tal1/E47 heterodimers, was generated by annealing and ligating the two phosphorylated oligonucleotides: 5′-TCGACGAACAGATGGTGTC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGACACCATCTGTTCG-3′. After digesting the ligated oligonucleotides with SalI, concatemers of 60–150 base pairs containing direct repeats of the E boxes were purified by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and subsequently cloned into the SalI site of pfLUC. A clone containing five copies of the E box was selected by restriction analysis. To generate the pE-T/1 construct, a PCR product was made using the fusion primer (E-T/1, 5′-AAGCTGCTCAATGAGCGGAACCTG-3′; Tal1 and E47 sequences are in bold and plain text, respectively) and the SP6 sequencing primer together with E47/pcDNA3 as a template. This product was then allowed to anneal to the TalM1/pBS plasmid and amplified using a Tal1 primer, binding to a region upstream of the internal SacI site (5′-GTGAACGGGGCCTTTGCC-3′) and the SP6 sequencing primer. The resulting PCR product was digested with SacI and XbaI and used for a three-part ligation into pcDNA3 along with an HindIII-SacI fragment from pTal1. E47-Tal1 fusion constructs, pE-T/2, pE-T/4, pE-T/5, and pE-T/3bm, were made by a two-step PCR method essentially as described by Vitola et al. (33Vitola S.J. Wang A. Sun X.-H.

As shown in SchemeFS1, complementary primers were designed spanning the fusion region such that each fusion primer was comprised of sequences one half from E47 and the other half from Tal1. These fusion primers in conjunction with various 5′- and 3′-primers were employed to generate the first two PCR products using either E47/pcDNA3 or TalM1/pBS as template. The two products were then denatured, annealed, and used as a template for the final PCR (PCR3) using the previous 5′- and 3′-primers. This final PCR product was then subcloned into the appropriate vector. PCR fusion primers were as follows: E-T/2, 5′-ACGCCGCACAACGTCCCTCAGGTC-3′; E-T/4, 5′-GATGGAGATTACTGAGAAAGACCTGA-3′; and E-T/5, 5′-GCAGCAGGTGCGAGACCAGGAGGAGG-3′. For the pE-T/2 construct, the NOT primer (5′-TGGGCTAGGGCGAGCAGG-3′, nucleotides 1359–1376 (6Kamps M.P. Murre C. Sun X.-H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 60: 547-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), upstream of the internal NotI site of E47) and the T3 sequencing primer (Promega) were used as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively, along with the fusion primers, in the two-step PCRs with E47/pcDNA3 (5′ reaction) and TalM1/pBS (3′ reaction) plasmids as initial templates. The final PCR product was first subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega), subsequently digested with NotI and SpeI, and inserted into the NotI and XbaI sites of E47/pcDNA3. For pE-T/4, the T7 and SP6 sequencing primers (Promega) were used as the 5′- and 3′-primers in conjunction with the appropriate fusion primers in the two-step PCRs using TalM1/pBS (5′ reaction) and E47/pcDNA3 (3′ reaction) as initial templates. The final PCR product was digested with NotI and XbaI and inserted into the NotI and XbaI sites of pTal1. For the pE-T/5 construct, the 5′- and 3′-primers were the NOT primer and the T3 sequencing primer, and the templates were E47/pcDNA3 and TalM1/pBS, respectively. The final PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T, digested with NotI and SpeI, and inserted into the NotI and XbaI sites of E47/pcDNA3. To generate pE-T/3, a three-part ligation was performed by inserting the NotI-SacI fragment from pE-T/2 and the SacI-XbaI fragment from pE-T/1 into the NotI and XbaI sites of E47/pcDNA3. pE-T/6 was generated through a three-part ligation by inserting the HindIII-PstI fragment from pE-T/4 and the PstI-ApaI fragment from pE-T/5 into the HindIII and ApaI sites of pcDNA3. pE-T/3bm was constructed also using the two-step PCR method. Oligonucleotides to the basic region of Tal1 containing the appropriate mutations (5′-AAAGTTGTGGGTGGTATCTTCACC-3′; mutated codons are underlined) were used together with the NOT and SP6 oligonucleotides as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively, together with pE-T/3 as the template. The final PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T, digested with NotI and XbaI, and inserted into NotI and XbaI sites of E47/pcDNA3. pE-T/2bm was generated through a three-part ligation by inserting the SacI-XbaI fragment from pTal1 and the NotI-SacI fragment from pE-T/3bm into the NotI and XbaI sites of E47/pcDNA3. The pE-T/2ADm plasmid was created by replacing the EcoRI-NotI fragment of pE-T/2 with an EcoRI-NotI fragment from an E47 mutant construct that had activation domains I and II deleted. 2S. Prabhu and X.-H. Sun, in preparation. To generate the pdE-T/4 construct, PCR was carried out using a Tal1 primer (5′-GTCAGGTGATGGAGATTACTGAG-3′) and the SP6 sequencing primer, together with pE-T/4 as the template. The PCR product was digested with PvuII and XbaI and inserted into pcDNA3 along with the HindIII-PvuII fragment from pTal1. 293T and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. 293T and HeLa cells were transfected by the CaPO4 precipitation method (34Ausubal F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1994Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation essentially as described by Hsu et al. (35Hsu H. Wadman I. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3181-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were lysed and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the Galacton kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Tropix). The same cell lysates were used to measure luciferase activity using the luciferin substrate (Promega). For both assays, luminescence was determined on a luminometer (Berthoid). Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies), and 20 μg of each sample was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 1 × MOPS and 0.68m formaldehyde. After electrophoresis at 5 V/cm, the gel was rinsed for 45 min in 20 × SSC at room temperature and transferred to a nylon membrane (Zetabind) overnight in 20 × SSC. The blot was hybridized using QUIKHYB (Stratagene) with a CIP1cDNA probe. The DNA used for the probe was prepared by digesting CIP1/pBKS with XhoI to generate a full-length CIP1 cDNA fragment that was subsequently gel purified. The DNA was labeled using a kit from Boehringer Mannheim. The same membrane was then stripped and probed with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. Membranes were exposed to a PhosphorImager and quantitated. The anti-Tal1 immune serum was as described (30Mahajan M.A. Park S.T. Sun X.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2343-2350PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-CIP1 and anti-E47 immune sera were from Transduction Laboratories and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Monoclonal antibody 9E10 was a gift from P. Cowin (New York University Medical Center). Transfected 293T or HeLa cells were harvested and lysed in 10 times the volume of the cell pellet with SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. Samples were boiled and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was electroblotted overnight in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 20% methanol) onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran). The membrane was blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TBST (10 mmTris 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for at least 2 h and blotted subsequently with primary antibody for at least 1 h. The blot was then washed three times with TBST and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Promega) for 1 h. The membrane was washed with TBST three times and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Although Tal1/E47 heterodimers can bind to DNA with equal or higher affinities than E47 homodimers in vitro, they activate transcription much poorly relative to E47 homodimers. Consequently, Tal1 acts as an inhibitor of E47-activated gene expression. To understand why Tal1 has such an inhibitory effect, fusion proteins containing various regions of Tal1 and E47 were constructed. We asked which domains can be interchanged between Tal1 and E47 so that the effect of Tal1 on E47 activation is not inhibition but activation. As a corollary, we asked which portions of Tal1 can confer inhibitory properties on E47. The schematic of the fusion proteins constructed is shown in Fig.1 A. The E47 and Tal1 proteins were divided into three domains: the NH2 terminus, the bHLH region, and the COOH terminus. The NH2 terminus of E47 has been shown to contain two activation domains (36Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 37Aronheim A. Shiran R. Rosen A. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas the NH2 terminus of Tal1 contains one such domain (39Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7869-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In both proteins these domains have been identified in the context of fusion proteins with the DNA binding domain of the GAL4 protein. The bHLH region is responsible for the dimerization and DNA binding properties of E47 and Tal1 (3Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D.

Biol. 1991; 11: 3037-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The function of the COOH terminus is less well defined.Figure 1Panel A, schematic of E47-Tal1 fusion proteins. E47 and Tal1 proteins are represented by shaded and hatched bars, respectively. Each protein was divided into three domains: the NH2 terminus, the bHLH region, and the COOH terminus. The E-T/2ADm construct contains deletions of amino acids 17–227 and 309–367 as indicated by gaps, which correspond to activation domains I and II of E47. E-T/2bm and E-T/3bm have arginines at amino acid positions 188 and 189 of the bHLH region of Tal1 mutated to glycines as labeled. The dE-T/4 construct has amino acids 122–175 deleted from the NH2 terminus of Tal1. Panel B, Western analyses of E47-Tal1 fusion proteins. The three blots shown were loaded identically with whole cell extracts prepared from HeLa cells transfected with 5 μg of each construct as marked on the lanes of the top blot. Western analyses were carried out using antibodies as indicated next to each blot. The anti-Tal1 immune serum was directed against the COOH terminus of Tal1. Monoclonal antibody 9E10 recognizes the myc epitope, which was fused to the NH2 terminus of Tal1. The anti-E47 immune serum reacts to the NH2 terminus of E47. The relevant protein in each lane is indicated with an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the expression levels of the fusion proteins, the constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, and cell lysates were analyzed using Western blots. Because no single antibody could detect all of the fusion proteins, Western analyses were performed using the same blot or cell lysates with antibodies against Tal1, the myc tag (9E10), or E47 (Fig. 1 B). Because E-T/2 and E-T/5 contain epitopes reacting to both anti-Tal1 and anti-E47 antibodies and because Tal1 reacts to both the anti-Tal1 and 9E10 antibodies, it was possible to estimate roughly the levels of the fusion proteins expressed. All of the fusion proteins appeared to be expressed at comparable levels, except for E-T/1, which seemed to be expressed at a lower level. To test first whether the fusion proteins could activate transcription on their own, the constructs were examined for their ability to activate a luciferase reporter construct, driven by five copies of the E box sequence optimal for binding to Tal1/E47 heterodimers. The plasmids expressing the fusion proteins were cotransfected into HeLa cells along with the reporter plasmid, and luciferase activity was measured 2 days later. Fig.2 A shows the activities of the constructs relative to E47 homodimers. E47 homodimers routinely gave 200–400 fold-activation over reporter alone. As expected, those constructs containing the bHLH domain of Tal1 could not activate by themselves because the bHLH region of Tal1 cannot mediate homodimer formation (40Hsu H.L. Cheng J.T. Chen Q. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3037-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which is a prerequisite for DNA binding. However, constructs containing the bHLH domain of E47, such as E-T/4 and E-T/6, were able to activate transcription. Because E-T/4 contains the NH2 terminus of Tal1 fused with the bHLH domain and COOH terminus of E47 and because these two domains do not appear to have any transactivating function, the ability of E-T/4 to activate transcription may be attributed to the NH2 terminus of Tal1. This result is in accordance with previous findings that the NH2 terminus of Tal1, when fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4, can act as a transcriptional activator (39Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7869-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, the putative activation domain defined by Sanchez-Garcia and Rabbitts (39Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7869-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was deleted in our construct dE-T/4. The transactivating activity of dE-T/4 was reduced by about 60% compared with E-T/4, suggesting that the NH2 terminus of Tal1 is indeed able to activate transcription. However, whether this transactivating function of Tal1 is of physiological significance remains to be determined. It is also interesting to note that construct E-T/5, which differs from wild type E47 only at the COOH terminus, possesses only 30% of the transcriptional activity of wild type E47 homodimers. As this construct is expressed as well as the wild type E47, this result would suggest that the COOH terminus of Tal1 may inhibit the transactivating potential of E47. A similar phenomenon was also observed by Hofmann and Cole (41Hofmann T.J. Cole M.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 617-624PubMed Google Scholar). We next asked what effect these fusion proteins had on transcriptional activation by E47. Equal amounts of E47 and the various fusion constructs were cotransfected with the E box reporter construct into HeLa cells. The luciferase activities in the transfected cells are shown in Fig. 2 B. Compared with wild type E47, cotransfection of Tal1 led to a 14-fold reduction of activity as observed previously (21Hsu H.L. Wadman I. Tsan J.T. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similarly, the E-T/1 construct inhibited reporter activation by 3-fold. Although the reduced level of E-T/1 expression relative to wild type Tal1 may explain this weaker inhibition, it may also be because of the lack of the COOH terminus of Tal1. When the NH2 terminus of Tal1 was replaced with that of E47 as in constructs E-T/2 and E-T/3, the resulting fusion proteins activated transcription even more effectively than wild type E47. The higher transcriptional activities of E-T/2 and E-T/3 may result from the presence of the bHLH domain of Tal1 because the interaction between Tal1/E47 heterodimers is tighter than between E47 homodimers (21Hsu H.L. Wadman I. Tsan J.T. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 3S. T. Park and X.-H. Sun, unpublished observations. In addition, Tal1/E47 heterodimers may possess higher affinities to the E box sequence than E47 homodimers, thus leading to greater activation. Activation by E-T/2 and E-T/3 was dependent on their ability to bind DNA because mutations in the basic amino acids critical for DNA binding (21Hsu H.L. Wadman I. Tsan J.T. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (arginines at amino acid positions 188 and 189 were changed to glycines) completely abolished their activities, as demonstrated using constructs E-T/2bm and E-T/3bm. Furthermore, this activation was also dependent on the NH2-terminal activation domains from E47, since deletion of the two activation domains in construct E-T/2ADm abrogated the transcriptional activation. Most importantly, these results suggest that Tal1/E47 heterodimers are capable of activating transcription if Tal1 is provided with suitable transactivation domains such as those from E47. In contrast, fusion proteins E-T/4 and E-T/6, when complexed with E47, inhibited activation by about 6.5-fold compared with E47 homodimers (Fig. 2 B), even though the NH2 terminus of Tal1 contains a potential activation domain (Fig. 2 A). Thus it appears that the activation domain of Tal1 is not compatible with those of E47. As expected, construct E-T/5, which is similar to E-T/6 except that it contains the NH2 terminus of E47, results in a 4-fold higher transcriptional activity than E-T/6 when both are complexed with E47, again suggesting that the activation domain of Tal1 is not compatible with those of E47. However, it should be noted that this act"

Two overlapping peptides corresponding to Asn-564–Lys-583 (N20K) and Glu-574–Lys-593 (E20K) inhibited the activation of PLC β2 by βγ subunits (IC50 50 and 150 μm, respectively), whereas two control peptides did not. N20K and E20K, but not the control peptides, inhibited βγ-dependent ADP-ribosylation of Gαi1 by pertussis toxin and βγ-dependent activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. To demonstrate direct binding of the peptides to βγ subunits, the peptides were chemically cross-linked to purified β1γ2. N20K and E20K cross-linked to both β1 and γ2 subunits, whereas the control peptides did not. Cross-linking to β and γ was inhibited by incubation with excess PLC β2 or PLC β3, whereas cross-linking to γ but not β was inhibited by r-myr-αi1. These data together demonstrate specificity of N20K and E20K for G βγ binding and inhibition of effector activation by βγ subunits. The results suggest that an overlapping region of the two active peptides, Glu-574–Lys-583, mimics a region of PLC β2 that is involved in binding to βγ subunits. Changing a tyrosine to a glutamine in this overlapping region of the peptides inhibited binding of the peptide to βγ subunits. Alignment of these peptides with the three-dimensional structure from PLC δ1 identifies a putative α helical region on the surface of the catalytic domain of PLC β2 that could interact with βγ subunits.

Many transmembrane receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins can initiate the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PLC phospholipase C; G protein, GTP-binding protein; PTX, pertussis toxin; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; SMCC, succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1- carboxylate. to produce inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. Multiple experimental paradigms provide convincing evidence that increased PIP2 hydrolysis occurs as a result of enzymatic activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) due to direct interactions of PLC with activated G protein α or βγ subunits (1Sternweis P.C.

G protein α subunits of the Gq class are thought to be responsible for receptor-mediated activation of PLC that is not inhibited by treatment with the toxin from Bordatella pertussis (PTX). βγ subunits released during activation of Gi/o proteins are thought to activate PLC in a manner that is inhibited by PTX, since this toxin blocks interaction of the Gi/o heterotrimer with receptors. PLC enzymes consist of at least nine different isoforms that have been classified into three groups; β, γ, and δ (2Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 4Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these enzymes require Ca2+ for activity. PLC β isoforms are the primary enzymes that hydrolyze PIP2 in response to activation by G proteins. Four isozymes of the PLC β class have been identified and designated PLCβ1, β2, β3, and β4. Each isoform is regulated differently by G protein βγ or α subunits. in in vitro enzyme assays and in co-transfection assays there are some conflicting results, but in general PLC β1 and β4 are regulated primarily by Gαq, PLC β2 is regulated primarily by βγ subunits, and PLC β3 is regulated by both βγ and αq subunits. Based on sequence alignments between PLC isoforms and other proteins, some domain structure has been predicted. The first 100 amino acids are predicted to form a pleckstrin homology domain (5Parker P.J. Hemmings B.A. Gierschik P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 54-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This domain in PLC δ1, when expressed in isolation, binds to PIP2 and IP3 and when removed from PLC δ1, inhibits anchoring to PIP2-containing membranes but does not inhibit catalysis (6Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

J. 1995; 312: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The role of the pleckstrin homology domain in the other PLC isoforms is unclear but is likely to be distinct from PLC δ1, since PLC β2 membrane binding is unaffected by IP3 (9Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two highly conserved regions have been identified in all mammalian PLCs and designated X and Y. In PLC β and δ isoforms, these regions are adjacent in the primary sequence, whereas in PLC γ, the X and Y are separated by intervening src-homology SH2 and SH3 domains. PLC β isoforms are unique in that there is an extended (40 kDa) C-terminal domain that extends beyond the Y domain (4Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A three-dimensional crystal structure has been solved for PLC δ1 that contains the X and Y domains but is missing the N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (10Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The structure shows that the N-terminal region between the pleckstrin homology domain and the X domain has a structural fold that is very similar to the EF-hand domain found in Ca2+-binding proteins, including calmodulin. The entire X domain and two-thirds of the N terminus of the Y domain fold to form a catalytic core similar in structure to the β barrel found in triose phosphate isomerase (TIM barrel). The C-terminal one-third of the Y domain forms a domain similar to the C2 domains found in PKC and PLA2 where they function as calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domains. In PLC δ1, the C2 domain primarily interacts with the N-terminal EF-hand domain, and its function is unclear. Some progress has been made mapping the regions in the overall sequences of the PLCs that are involved in interaction with G proteins. Removal of the C-terminal third of PLC β1 abolishes activation by Gαq, but Ca2+-dependent activity remains intact (11Wu D. Jiang H. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3704-3709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Park D. Jhon D.-Y. Lee C.-W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of this region has served to define important regions for interaction with α subunits (13Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Removal of the C-terminal third of PLC β2 does not affect its ability to be stimulated by βγ subunits (14Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), segments of the PLC β2 X and Y domains when coexpressed with PLC β2 in COS-7 cells blocked activation by βγ subunits. When expressed as GST fusion proteins, a 116-amino acid polypeptide from this region bound tightly to G protein βγ subunits, whereas a 60-amino acid sequence of this same region bound weakly to βγ subunits (16Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this paper we further define the regions of PLC β2 that interact with G protein βγ subunits. Synthetic peptides corresponding to sections of the 116-amino acid region previously identified (16Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were tested for their ability to inhibit activation of PLC β2 by βγ subunits in a reconstituted, purified system. The peptides were designed based on sequence alignment of PLC β2 and PLC δ1 and referral to the crystal structure of PLC δ1. This allowed us to identify regions within Gln-526-Val-641 that were on the surface and potentially accessible to βγ subunit binding. Based on these studies we propose a model for the structural features of PLC β2 involved in βγ-PLC interactions. Peptides were purchased from Coast Scientific or from Biosynthesis and had a purity of greater than 90% based on high performance liquid chromatography analysis and mass spectrometry. Phosphatidylethanolamine (bovine liver) and phosphatidylinositol (bovine liver) (PI) were from Avanti Polar Lipids. PIP2 was prepared from bovine brain lipids (Sigma) according to the method of Schacht (17Schacht J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or obtained from Sigma. Pertussis toxin was obtained from List Biologicals. Succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) was from Pierce. Baculovirus for expression of the PI 3-kinase γ 110-kDa subunit and 101-kDa subunit were kindly provided by Len Stephens and Phil Hawkins (Inositide Laboratory, The Babraham Institute, Babraham, Cambridge, UK). A cDNA encoding full-length PLC β3 was provided by Dr. Gunther Weber (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). Purified, recombinant PLC β2, β3, and PI 3-kinase proteins were prepared using a baculovirus expression system. Construction of baculovirus for expression of PLC β2 has been previously described (9Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 6-His-tagged PLC β3 was prepared as follows. The cDNA for PLC β3 in bluescript SK− was cut with BamHI at base pairs 636 and 2556, and the remaining sequence of PLC β3 was religated. This removed multiple NcoI sites from the coding region of PLC β3. Oligonucleotides encoding an EcoRI site (at the 5′-end) followed by the coding sequence for an initiator methionine, an alanine, a histidine tag (6 histidines), and an NcoI site were ligated at the 5′ end of the PLC β3 sequence at the NcoI site at base pair 1 of the cDNA coding sequence and EcoRI of bluescript. A 250-base pair fragment was excised from this construct with EcoRI and BstEII and ligated with the original PLC β3 cDNA cut with BstEII and EcoRI after removal of the insert. This fragment was then excised with EcoRI and HindIII and inserted into the EcoRI-HindIII site of Fastbac (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant, clonal baculoviruses were generated according to the protocol described by Life Technologies, Inc. Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in IPL-41 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% pluronic acid, and 50 mg/ml gentamycin. For large scale cultures (1 liter and above), the cells were switched into medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 1% lipid concentrate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Baculoviruses directing expression of recombinant 6-His PLC β2 and 6-His PLC β3 were used to infect 1 liter of Sf9 cells at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml. The proteins were purified according to (9Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For PI 3-kinase, the Sf9 cells were coinfected with viruses coding for expression of 6-His-tagged p110γ with EE-tagged p101, and the protein was purified on a column containing immobilized anti-EE antibody (18Stephens L.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.V. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The protein prepared in this way is predominantly heterodimeric p110γ and p101. For purification of β1γ2, baculoviruses encoding β1, γ2, and 6 × His-tagged αi1 were obtained from Alfred Gilman's laboratory. 1 liter of Sf9 cells at 1 × 106 cells/ml was simultaneously infected with the three baculovirus constructs, and the βγ subunits were purified according to the published procedures (19Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), which were modified as in Romoser et al. (9Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recombinant myristoylated αi1 was purified from Escherichia coli coexpressing αi1 and N-myristoyl transferase according to published procedures (20Taussig R. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Gilman A.G. Science. 1993; 261: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with an amido black protein assay (21Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C assays were conducted as described previously (9Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in the figure legends. PI 3-kinase activity was assayed using sonicated micelles containing 600 μm phosphatidylethanolamine and 300 μm bovine liver PI as in Parish et al.(22Parish C.A. Smrcka A.V. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7722-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation assays were performed as described by Casey et al. (23Casey P.J. Pang I. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.4 pmol of β1γ2 was mixed with 20 pmol of αi1 followed by the addition of various concentrations of peptide. Reactions were initiated by the addition of pertussis toxin (5 μg/ml final concentration), NAD (2.5 μm final concentration), and [32P]NAD (750,000 cpm/assay) in a total reaction volume of 40 μl. No phospholipids were used in the reaction. Reactions were terminated after 20 min, and proteins were precipitated in 15% trichloroacetic acid and collected on nitrocellulose filters. After extensive washing with 6% trichloroacetic acid, the filters were dried and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Peptides (30 or 150 μm) were added to β1γ2 (100 nm) at room temperature in a solution containing 1 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% C12E10(decaethylene glycol dodecyl ether) in a total volume of 100 μl. The cross-linker, SMCC, was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted to 2 mm in 50 mm Pi buffer, pH 5.0, before dilution into the reaction buffer (final concentration 200 μm). The cross-linking reaction was carried out as described in the figure legends and quenched with 10 mmTris, pH 8.6, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. When PLC β2, PLCβ3, or αi1 (250 or 500 nm) were added, they were incubated with βγ subunits at room temperature for 10 min before the addition of peptides and cross-linker. The cross-linked proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-acrylamide gel or a 17% SDS-acrylamide gel containing 4 m urea. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against β1 or γ2. γ subunit antibody X-263 has been previously described and recognize γ2, γ3, and γ7 (24Ueda N. Iñiguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β subunit antibody B600 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of β1, β2, and β3 (MAVATGSWDSFLKIWN) and could recognize β4 as well. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used to visualize the proteins. There is significant homology between PLC β2 and PLC δ1 in the 116-amino acid region of PLC β2 that was found to bind to βγ subunits (16Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar): 33% identity and 47% similarity overall with a 70-amino acid region having 54% identity and 67% similarity (Fig. 1). Based on this high level of homology, we predicted that PLC β2 might have a very similar fold as PLC δl in this region. Using this assumption, we examined the structure of PLC δ1 to determine which regions of PLC β2 would be likely to be on the surface of the protein and accessible to G protein βγ subunits. Three peptides were chosen for our initial studies, corresponding to amino acids 564–583 (N20K), 584–609 (A20G), and 575–594 (E20K) of PLC β2 shown in (Fig. 1 B). Also tested as a control was a peptide composed of the same amino acids as N20K, except the primary sequence was randomized (YVLSKNRSDLFTKAYISSEL). The peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit the stimulation of PLC β2 activity by βγ subunits (Fig.2). In the absence of peptide, βγ subunits stimulated PLC β2 approximately 10-fold over basal, Ca2+-dependent activity. The addition of N20K inhibited βγ-stimulated activity with an IC50 of 50 μm with 95% inhibition of activity occurring at 200 μm. The adjacent peptide, A20G, and the scrambled peptide had no effect on stimulation of PLC activity by βγ subunits at concentrations up to 300 μm. The peptide that overlaps the C terminus of N20K and the N terminus of A20G–E20K (E20K) inhibited βγ-stimulated activity with an IC50 of 150 μm. Both peptides inhibited the basal Ca2+-stimulated activity of PLC β2, with N20K inhibiting activity by 58 ± 10% and E20K inhibiting activity by 43 ± 10% (n = 4 experiments). Importantly, βγ-stimulated activity was inhibited to a greater extent than was basal activity. To quantitate this effect, data were normalized by determining the fold stimulation of activity over basal activity by βγ subunits (activity with βγ divided by activity without βγ). The percent inhibition of the fold stimulation by βγ subunits in the presence of 200 μm peptides was then calculated. N20K inhibited fold stimulation over basal by 67 ± 2%, whereas E20K inhibited fold stimulation by 42 ± 4%. We also tested a peptide corresponding to N20K where Tyr-15 in the region that overlaps with E20K was changed to Gln (N20K(Y15Q)). This peptide stimulated PLC β2 activity in the absence of βγ subunits (data not shown). The significance of this is unclear, but it did not allow us to measure effects of N20K(Y15Q) peptide on βγ-stimulated PLC β2 activity. To prove that the inhibition of βγ-stimulated PLC activity was attributable, at least in part, to binding of the peptides to βγ subunits, several other assays were performed to demonstrate binding of the peptides to βγ subunits. G protein α subunits block the ability of βγ subunits to activate PLC by sequestering the βγ subunits in the heterotrimeric form. This is thought to work because the α subunits sterically hinder interaction between the βγ subunits and the PLC. This predicts that peptides mimicking PLC β2 binding to βγ subunits could block interaction between α and βγ subunits. One way to measure this is to measure the βγ-dependent enhancement of ADP-ribosylation of α subunits by pertussis toxin. Since βγ binding to α subunits is required for ADP-ribosylation of α, peptides that block interaction between α and βγ subunits will inhibit ADP-ribosylation. N20K or E20K inhibited incorporation of ADP-ribose into purified recombinant myristoylated αi1 in the presence of βγ subunits. βγ-stimulated ADP-ribosylation was inhibited by close to 100% by 100 μm N20K or E20K with an IC50 of 8 μm (Fig. 3 A). Neither A20G nor the scrambled peptide (100 μm each) had an effect on ADP-ribosylation. This indicates that N20K and E20K are binding to the βγ subunits at a site that may overlap the binding sites for αi1 or that the peptides are binding at a site on βγ that prevents binding of PTX. We also tested the N20K(Y15Q) peptide. This peptide was much less potent in inhibiting βγ-dependent ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 3 B), indicating that this tyrosine 15 in the peptide is important for βγ binding. To further confirm that these peptides inhibit various effectors by binding to βγ subunits, we tested the effects of these peptides on the stimulation of PI 3-kinase by βγ subunits. We utilized a p110γ/p101 heterodimer purified from sf9 cells as described by Stephens et al. (18Stephens L.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.V. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The activity of the p110/p101 heterodimer was increased 5-fold by 150 nm βγ subunits. N20K or E20K inhibited the stimulation of this enzyme by 150 nm βγ subunits, with an IC50 of 50–100 μm (Fig. 4). A20G and scrambled peptide had no effect. The peptides did not have a significant effect on basal PI 3-kinase activity. PLC β3 is activated by G protein βγ subunits at a similar potency as PLC β2 (25Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PLC β3 by βγ subunits and Ca2+ was measured in the presence of E20K and N20K. Surprisingly, E20K had little effect on the activation of PLC β3 by G protein βγ subunits, whereas N20K inhibited activity but not to the same extent as for PLC β2 (Fig.5). Basal, Ca2+-dependent activity of PLC β3 was not measurable in these assays. We have reported previously that basal activity of PLC β3 is much lower that for PLC β2 under these assay conditions (25Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate that these peptides bind to βγ subunits, we developed a cross-linking assay that uses a heterobifunctional cross-linker to covalently link the peptides to purified βγ subunits. The cross-linker (SMCC) has a succinimide ester group that reacts with primary amines and a maleimido group that reacts with SH moieties. Since the peptides have no cysteine residues, the only way to cross-link the peptides to β or γ is via a primary amine on the peptide and SH groups on either β or γ subunits. Peptide cross-linking was monitored by immunoblotting for β or γ subunits after electrophoresis to resolve cross-linked subunits from the unmodified subunits. The specificity for peptide cross-linking to βγ was tested by incubating purified βγ subunits with N20K, E20K, N20K(Y15Q), A20G, or scrambled peptides and cross-linker. Only in the presence of N20K or E20K (30 or 150 μm each) was there an increase in the apparent molecular weight of γ after incubating with cross-linker (Fig. 6 A). Some cross-linking of N20K(Y15Q) to γ is observed at 150 μm peptide, consistent with the data demonstrating that N20K(Y15Q) is less potent in inhibiting ADP-ribosylation of αi1. N20K and E20K also cross-linked to the β subunit (Fig.7 A). Only in the presence of N20K or E20K and cross-linker does a prominent cross-linked species appear. A number of minor higher molecular weight species are also seen only in the presence of cross-linker and peptide. It is unclear what the higher molecular weight bands correspond to, although all can be visualized with β subunit antibodies, and some are visualized with γ subunit antibodies. These could represent more than one peptide cross-linked to each β subunit or peptide cross-linked to β that is cross-linked to γ. The higher molecular weight band observed in the absence of peptides (Fig. 7 B, lane 1) corresponds to β cross-linked to γ, because the upper band could be visualized with a γ subunit antibody (data not shown). To further demonstrate the relevance of the cross-linking, the βγ subunits were incubated with excess PLC β2, PLC β3, or αi1 before incubation with peptide and cross-linker to determine if they could compete for peptide cross-linking. PLC β2, PLC β3, and αi1 all inhibited cross-linking of N20K and E20K to the γ subunit, although PLC β3 was less effective than PLC β2 (Fig. 6 B). PLC β2 and PLC β3 both inhibited cross-linking of the peptides to the β subunit, although PLC β3 was again consistently less effective than PLC β2 (Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, GDP-liganded αi1 was unable to inhibit cross-linking of peptides to the β subunit. Two synthetic 20-amino acid overlapping peptides that mimic a region of PLC β2 bind specifically to G protein βγ subunits and prevent interaction with different biochemical partners. An adjacent peptide and scrambled N20K had no effect in any of the assays we have examined. All the peptides are very similar with respect to amino acid chemistry. Although the peptides have some effect on the basal activities of PLC β2, this cannot explain the extent of the inhibition of βγ stimulation of PLC β2 activity. It is clear based on the other assays involving βγ subunits that these peptides bind to the βγ subunits and that this is responsible, at least in part, for the observed inhibition of βγ stimulated PLC β2. The N20K and E20K peptides inhibit the βγ-dependent activation of PLC β2 with IC50s of 50 and 150 μm, respectively. These IC50s are similar to what has been reported for a 27-amino acid peptide derived from adenylyl cyclase type II (QEHA peptide) for inhibiting a number of βγ subunit-regulated effectors (26Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). N20K and E20K do not contain the βγ binding consensus sequence identified in the QEHA peptide. However, in the common 10 amino acids of the N20K and E20K there is a short stretch of seven amino acids where 4 amino acids are identical to a sequence at the C terminus of QEHA and a 5th amino acid is conservatively substituted. When we changed one of these amino acids in N20K, binding to βγ subunits was dramatically inhibited (Figs.3 B, 6 A, and 7 A). The N20K and E20K peptides are more potent in inhibiting βγ-dependent ADP-ribosylation of αi1(IC50 8 μm) than for inhibition of PLC β2. This is surprising if we assume that the peptides block ADP-ribosylation of αi1 by blocking αi1interactions with βγ because the affinity of βγ for αi1 (Kd ∼ 1 nm) is much greater than the affinity for PLC β2 (Kd ∼ 100 nm). The exact mechanism for how βγ subunits stimulate ADP-ribosylation of α subunits is unclear but is known to involve a process where βγ subunits must cycle catalytically among a stoichiometric excess of α subunits. Since the mechanism is not entirely understood, it is possible that the peptides interfere with this catalytic ADP-ribosylation in a way that is not directly related to the known high affinity of βγ subunits for α subunits. One possibility is that the peptides are not blocking α binding to βγ but are occupying a binding site on βγ required for PTX interaction. This possibility is supported by the cross-linking data that shows that cross-linking of the peptides to the β subunit is not blocked by αi1-GDP. Both N20K and E20K must cross-link directly to cysteine residues in either the β and γ subunits due to the nature of the cross-linker. The site of γ cross-linking is clearly cysteine 41, since this is the only cysteine in γ2. The site(s) of cross-linking of the peptide to the β subunit is unclear, but there are 14 cysteine residues in the β subunit where cross-linking could have occurred. Cross-linking of E20K and N20K to both β and γ was prevented by incubation with PLC β2. PLC β3 also prevented cross-linking of N20K and E20K but was not as effective as PLC β2, suggesting that the binding sites for these two enzymes on βγ subunits do not entirely overlap. This is consistent with the observation that the peptides were not as effective or as potent at inhibiting PLC β3 activation by βγ subunits. The cross-linking of the peptides to the β subunit was not prevented by preincubation of the α subunit with the β subunit. This suggests that the peptide binding site on βγ does not entirely overlap with the α subunit. Although it is known that α-GDP blocks activation of PLC β by βγ subunits, it is probable that the binding sites for PLC β and α subunits overlap but do not match. Thus the binding site represented by the peptide may lie outside the overlap region. This idea is supported by a recent study by Bluml et al.(27Bluml K. Schnepp W. Schroder S. Beyermann M. Macias M. Oschkinat H. Lohse M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4908-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) where it was demonstrated that a peptide from phosducin binds to βγ subunits. Visualization of the location of this peptide in the crystal structure of βγ complexed with phosducin (28Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) shows that this peptide would bind at a region on the β subunit that does not overlap the α subunit binding site, whereas the N-terminal domain of phosducin does overlap the α subunit binding site. That α-GDP inhibits cross-linking to the γ subunit may result from steric interference with the cross-linking reaction without interfering directly with peptide binding. The data we have presented allows us to narrow down in the primary sequence of PLC β2 a region of 20 amino acids that may be involved in βγ subunit binding. The N terminus of the E20K peptide overlaps the C terminus of N20K peptide by 10 amino acids. The C-terminal 10 amino acids of E20K overlaps with the N-terminal 10 amino acids of A20G, which does not inhibit βγ activation in any assay. This suggests that the potential region that is binding to βγ subunits can be narrowed down to 10 amino acids, Glu-574–Lys-583. We have tested a 10-amino acid peptide corresponding to this region and found no evidence for inhibition. A possible explanation is that this 10-amino acid peptide may be too short to adopt the appropriate secondary structure. This has been seen for other peptides including the peptide from adenylyl cyclase type II (26Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Visualization of the regions homologous to our peptides in the PLC δ1 structure supports the idea that the 10-amino acid overlap region is the critical region of the peptides involved in binding to βγ subunits. The catalytic domain of PLC δ is composed of parts of the conserved X and Y domains that form a TIM barrel constructed from of a series of β sheet α helix repeats. The β strands line the inside of the barrel, and side chains from these strands project into the core of the structure to provide the chemistry for substrate binding and catalysis. The α helices are on the outside of this barrel structure and in some cases are exposed to solvent. When the sequence of the N20K is aligned with the PLC δ1 sequence, the N-terminal 10 amino acids align with a small amount of linker sequence and the Tβ6 strand of the barrel (nomenclature of Essen et al. (10Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar)). The sequence in Tβ6 is very conserved between the various PLC isoforms with two amino acids, serine 571 and phenylalanine 572 (β2 sequence), being conserved in all known PLC isoforms. For this reason we predict that this sequence in PLC β2 will occupy a similar position to that observed in the PLC δ sequence. Since this region is on the inside of the TIM barrel in PLC δ and is directly involved in substrate binding, it would be unlikely to be accessible to interaction with βγ subunits. The region homologous to Glu-574–Lys-583 of PLC β2 (overlap region between N20K and E20K) forms an α helix on the surface of PLC δ1, and because of the significant sequence homology in this region, would likely form the same type of structure on PLC β2. The surface exposure of just this 10-amino acid region of N20K further suggests that this overlap region corresponds to a portion of PLC β2 that is important for interaction with and regulation by G protein βγ subunits. The location of this binding site directly adjacent to structures that contribute amino acids to substrate binding and catalysis suggests a mechanism by which βγ subunits could activate PLC β. If the binding of βγ subunits to the helix on the surface caused movement of the adjacent β strands, this could position amino acids so they are more favorable for catalysis there by increasing enzymatic activity. The region we have defined only overlaps the portion of PLC β2 (Leu-580–Val-641) originally defined by Kuang et al. (16Kuang Y. Wu Y. Smrcka A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2964-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as a βγ binding domain by 4 amino acids (580–583). Using two-hybrid analysis, Yan and Gautam (29Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2056-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) used the N-terminal 100-amino acid region of the β subunit to demonstrate interactions with this 62-amino acid domain. One peptide (A584-G604) overlaps extensively with this domain yet had no effect in any of our assays for βγ subunit interactions. This suggests that either only a very short 4-amino acid region is necessary for some βγ binding or that other regions within a 62-amino acid region are also involved in PLC β2-βγ interactions. We would like to thank Monica Schertler for technical assistance. We would also like to thank Dr. Roger Williams for providing the coordinates for PLC δ1."
https://openalex.org/W2101090405,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates protein kinase D (PKD) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We have used a series of PDGF receptor mutants that display a selective impairment of the binding of SH2-containing proteins (GTPase-activating protein, SHP-2, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), or phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)) to show that Tyr-1021, the PLCγ-binding site, is essential for PKD stimulation by PDGF in A431 cells. We next investigated whether any one of these four binding sites could mediate PKD activation in the absence of the other three sites. F5, a receptor mutant that lacks all four binding sites for GTPase-activating protein, PLCγ, PI3K, and SHP-2, fails to activate PKD. A panel of single add-back mutants was used to investigate if any one of these four sites could restore signaling to PKD. Of the four sites, only the PLCγ+ single add-back receptor restored PDGF-mediated activation of PKD, and only this add-back receptor produced diacylglycerol (DAG) in a PDGF-dependent manner. 1,2-Dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, a membrane-permeant DAG analog, was found to be sufficient for activation of PKD. Taken together, these data indicate that PLCγ activation is not only necessary, but also sufficient to mediate PDGF-induced PKD activation. Although the presence of a pleckstrin homology domain makes PKD a potential PI3K target, PKD was not stimulated by selective PI3K activation, and wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, did not inhibit PDGF signaling to PKD. The activation of PKD by DAG or by the wild-type and PLCγ+ add-back PDGF receptors was inhibited by GF109203X, suggesting a role for protein kinase C in the stimulation of PKD by PDGF. PDGF induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of PKD that closely correlated with activation. The PDGF-induced activation and phosphorylation of PKD were reversed by in vitroincubation of PKD with protein phosphatase 1 or 2A, indicating that PDGF signaling to PKD involves the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of PKD. Taken together, these results conclusively show that PDGF activates PKD through a pathway that involves activation of PLCγ and, subsequently, protein kinase C. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates protein kinase D (PKD) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We have used a series of PDGF receptor mutants that display a selective impairment of the binding of SH2-containing proteins (GTPase-activating protein, SHP-2, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), or phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)) to show that Tyr-1021, the PLCγ-binding site, is essential for PKD stimulation by PDGF in A431 cells.

PDGF induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of PKD that closely correlated with activation. The PDGF-induced activation and phosphorylation of PKD were reversed by in vitroincubation of PKD with protein phosphatase 1 or 2A, indicating that PDGF signaling to PKD involves the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of PKD. Taken together, these results conclusively show that PDGF activates PKD through a pathway that involves activation of PLCγ and, subsequently, protein kinase C. The production of lipid second messengers is a common theme in the signal transduction of growth factors (1Toker A. Cantley L.C.

An important task of current signal transduction research is to link these messengers to their targets or, vice versa, to find lipid messengers for proteins whose structure predicts potential lipid-binding sites. Recently, two protein kinases were cloned (PKD 1The abbreviations used are: PKD, protein kinase D; PKC, protein kinase C; PDB, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; DAG, diacylglycerol; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; β-PDGFR, β-platelet-derived growth factor receptor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; GAP, Ras GTPase-activating protein; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; diC8, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol; PP1C/PP2AC, catalytic subunits of the type 1/type 2A protein phosphatases. from mouse and its human homolog, PKCμ) (6Valverde A.M.

We have demonstrated before that PKD is activated by diacylglycerol and by the tumor promotor PDB (8Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The cysteine-rich zinc fingers of the classical and novel PKC isoforms have been shown to bind DAG and phorbol esters (10Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). However, zinc fingers are also important for protein-protein interactions of PKCλ and PKCι with stimulatory proteins (11Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Izumi Y. Hirai S. Tamai Y. Fujise-Matsuoka A. Nishimura Y. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7381-7389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and it is noteworthy that the presence of a zinc finger in a kinase is not predictive for the DAG/PDB stimulation of its kinase activity. The c-Raf zinc finger mediates the interaction with phosphatidylserine-containing micelles and 14-3-3 proteins and is required for optimal binding to Ras GTP, but it cannot mediate PDB stimulation of Raf kinase activity (13Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F.G. Mabrouk G.M. Sturm J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Morrison D.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Some lipid-stimulated kinases can be activated by multiple lipids: PKCδ and PKCε are activated not only by DAG, but also by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (10Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 15Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Akt/PKB is stimulated by the lipid PtdIns(3,4)P2, which involves binding to the PH domain (16Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of a PH domain and zinc fingers in the N-terminal region of PKD would suggest several possibilities for regulation of its kinase activity through interaction with lipids or proteins. Given the large range of signaling mechanisms that can possibly impinge upon the different domains of PKD (based on the above-mentioned analogies), we decided to investigate which of several growth factor signaling pathways can induce activation of PKD. We have chosen the β-platelet-derived growth factor receptor (β-PDGFR) as a paradigm for our studies. Binding of PDGF induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of the β-PDGFR at specific tyrosine residues. Through these specific phosphotyrosine motifs, the phosphorylated PDGF receptor binds a large variety of SH2 proteins (for a review, see Refs. 18Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 19Kazlauskas A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) binds to tyrosines 740 and 751; the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 associates with tyrosine 1009; phospholipase Cγ1 binds to tyrosine 1021; and the Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) associates with tyrosine 771. Furthermore, three members of the Src kinase family (Src, Yes, and Fyn), Nck, Shc, and several as yet unidentified proteins are known to associate with the β-PDGFR (18Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Kazlauskas A. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Using a panel of β-PDGFR mutants that are defective in the binding of certain SH2 domain-containing proteins, it is possible to selectively knock out or turn on specific signaling pathways so that the functional role of a particular pathway to downstream responses can be elucidated (20Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 24Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Valius M. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 133-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the large range of signaling proteins that can bind to the β-PDGFR, this β-PDGFR mutant system is well suited to investigate the variety of pathways that may activate newly identified components of the cellular signaling apparatus (e.g. PKD). This report shows that in A431 cells, PDGF activates PKD through the subsequential activation of PLCγ and PKC. PDGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. GF109203X was obtained from Calbiochem, and G418, Lipofectin, Glutamax, and Opti-MEM from were from Life Technologies, Inc. The Biotrak DAG detection kit was from Amersham Corp. Antihemagglutinin antibodies were from Boehringer Mannheim. Protein A-TSK gel was from Affiland (Sart-Tilman, Belgium). All other materials were from Sigma. Swiss 3T3 cells were grown in DMEM (1 g/liter of glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm Glutamax. Cells were used 6–8 days after plating, when they were confluent and quiescent. A431 cells were grown in DMEM (4.5 g/liter of glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm Glutamax, and 1 mg/ml G418. Before experiments, 80% confluent A431 cells were starved for 48 h in serum-free DMEM. The A431 cell line (ATCC CRL 1555), devoid of endogenous β-PDGFRs, was used to create cell lines that express different β-PDGFR mutants. For this purpose, a retroviral infection system was used as described by Miller et al. (23Miller A.D. Miller D.G. Garcia J.V. Lynch C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 581-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Retroviruses carrying mutant β-PDGFR genes were generated as follows. Plasmids containing β-PDGFR mutants (in the pLXSN vector, carrying a neomycin resistance gene) were introduced using Lipofectin into an NIH3T3 packaging cell line (Ψ2). After 48 h, a second NIH3T3 packaging cell line (PA317) was infected with the ecotropic virus produced by the Ψ2 cells. The PA317 cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 from 24 h post-infection. Drug-resistant cells were pooled and propagated for several passages. Amphotropic virus was collected from subconfluent cultures of PA317 cells, and proliferating A431 cells on a 10-cm dish were infected with 5 ml of a viral supernatant supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene. After 5 h, 5 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS and 4 μg/ml Polybrene was added, and cells were allowed to grow for another 24 h. After 24 h, the viral supernatant was replaced by DMEM containing 10% FBS, and cells were allowed to grow for another 24 h. Infected cells were then selected for a 2-week period in 1 mg/ml G418. Clones were propagated and screened for β-PDGFR expression. The nature of the different β-PDGFR mutants has been extensively described and characterized previously (20Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 24Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Valius M. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 133-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, WT is an A431 cell line expressing the wild-type PDGF receptor. pLXSN has been infected with the empty retroviral vector pLXSN. F5 expresses a β-PDGFR mutant in which all the tyrosines that bind the SH2 domains of GAP, SHP-2, PLCγ, and PI3K have been mutated to phenylalanine. Starting with the F5 mutant, several binding sites were selectively restored (add-back mutants): GAP+ for binding of GAP (Tyr-771), PLCγ+ for binding of PLCγ (Tyr-1021), PI3K+ for binding of PI3K (Tyr-740 and Tyr-751), and SHP-2+ for binding of SHP-2 (Tyr-1009). Another series of mutants (single minus mutants) harbors mutations of one specific binding site in the β-PDGFR (the sites mentioned above) with all others left intact: GAP−, PLCγ−, PI3K−, and SHP-2− do not bind GAP, PLCγ, PI3K, and SHP-2, respectively. For assays involving PKB measurements, A431 cells were transfected with hemagglutinin-tagged PKB-pcDNA3 using Lipofectin as a transfection agent according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, 6 μg of DNA and 12 μl of Lipofectin were each diluted in 1 ml of Opti-MEM. After 45 min, DNA and Lipofectin were mixed and incubated for 15 min. A431 cells were washed once with Opti-MEM and then incubated with the DNA/Lipofectin mixture in 5 ml of Opti-MEM for 5 h. The medium was then changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and cells were further grown for 72 h and then incubated in serum-free DMEM overnight. After incubation with PDGF, diC8, or PDB, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)bezenesulfonyl fluoride, 25 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 200 nm microcystin. After 10 min of lysis, cells were vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Lysates were incubated for 2 h with an antibody against the C-terminal 15 amino acids of PKD or with hemagglutinin antibodies (for hemagglutinin-tagged PKB). Immunocomplexes were captured with 15 μl of protein A-TSK gel for 1 h. PKD immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer A, and PKD was eluted by incubating the immunoprecipitates with lysis buffer containing a 0.5 mg/ml concentration of the immunizing peptide. 15 μl of PKD eluate was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with 25 μl of a kinase assay mixture, resulting in a final concentration of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 μm ATP (specific activity of 1000 cpm/pmol), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml syntide-2. Akt/PKB immunoprecipitates were washed once with lysis buffer, once with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m LiCl2, and twice with kinase assay buffer. The PKB immunoprecipitation pellet was incubated for 15 min with the same phosphorylation mixture as described above, except that syntide-2 was replaced by the RGRPRTTSFAE peptide corresponding to the site in glycogen synthase kinase 3-β that is phosphorylated by Akt/PKB in vivo (26Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings H. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). All reactions were terminated by spotting 30 μl of the reaction mixture on P-81 phosphocellulose paper washed in 75 mmphosphoric acid. The radioactivity incorporated in the respective peptides was measured by liquid scintillation counting. DAG production was measured using the Biotrak DAG detection kit, which uses [32P]phosphatidic acid yield by DAG kinase as a measure of DAG production, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.A. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43117) Google Scholar) and incubated in a DAG kinase reaction mixture containing 0.05 m imidazole (pH 6.6), 0.05 m NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 500 μm ATP (specific activity of 50 cpm/pmol). Confluent cultures of A431 cells were washed twice with DMEM (phosphate-free) and incubated in this medium containing 500 μCi/ml carrier-free 32Piovernight (12 h). Cells were then stimulated for the indicated times with PDGF (30 ng/ml) and lysed in buffer A. Lysates were subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-PKD antibody and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. PKD eluates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 50 units/ml PP1C or PP2AC in the presence or absence of 1 μmmicrocystin. After this incubation, a PKD kinase assay was performed as indicated above in the presence of 1 μm microcystin. For visualization of the dephosphorylation of PKD by serine/threonine protein phosphatases, PKD was immunoprecipitated from lysates of32Pi-labeled cells that were stimulated with PDGF. Immunoprecipitated PKD was then eluted from the immunocomplexes and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 50 units/ml PP1Cor PP2AC in the presence or absence of 1 μmmicrocystin. This work is the first report of a dissection of specific growth factor signaling pathways that activate PKD. PDGF stimulates PKD in a time- and dose-dependent manner, both in Swiss 3T3 cells expressing endogenous PDGF receptor and in A431 cells stably overexpressing a retrovirally introduced PDGF receptor. PKD is stimulated by PDGF doses as low as 5 ng/ml, with a maximum at 30 ng/ml (Fig. 1, A and B), which correlates well with the concentration of PDGF required for a variety of cellular responses such as PLCγ, PI3K, and GAP tyrosine phosphorylation (28Abedi H. Dawes K.E. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11367-11376Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PKD activity reached a maximum after 10 min, but remained elevated even at 90 min after addition of PDGF (Fig. 1, C and D). Equal amounts of PKD were present in immunoprecipitates from Swiss 3T3 cells or A431 cells stimulated for various times with PDGF, as evidenced by Western blotting followed by immunostaining with anti-PKD antibodies (Fig. 1, E and F). Selective mutation of the PLCγ-binding site of the β-PDGFR into phenylalanine completely abolished the β-PDGFR-induced activation of PKD. Full activation was retained when binding sites for SHP-2, GAP, and PI3K were selectively mutated into phenylalanine. These results suggest that the binding of PLCγ to the β-PDGFR is essential for activation of PKD (TableI, Minus mutants).Table IActivation of PKD kinase activity and DAG production by β-PDGFR mutantsPKD activityDAG productionControl antiserumPKD antiserum−PDGF+PDGF−PDGF+PDGF−PDGF+PDGF% maximum% maximumWild type331295878pLXSN328101113F53255810Minus mutants PLCγ−2312151212 GAP−4514919100 SHP-2−2213871185 PI3K−23181001593Add-back mutants PLCγ+4391001290 GAP+23691014 SHP-2+23131496 PI3K+3471199 Open table in a new tab We used the single add-back mutants to explore specific pathways that can activate PKD. The F5 mutant, which lacks binding sites for SHP-2, GAP, PI3K, and PLCγ, fails to activate PKD. The PLCγ+mutant, which binds PLCγ but not PI3K, GAP, or SHP-2, is the only add-back receptor mutant that can mediate full PKD activation by PDGF (Table I, Add-back mutants). These results strongly suggest that PLCγ activation by PDGF is both necessary and sufficient for activation of PKD. To further strengthen this hypothesis, we investigated whether DAG production was sufficient to cause full activation of PKD. If PLCγ activation is sufficient to activate PKD, then addition of DAG, the reaction product of its catalytic activity, should have an identical effect. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2, the addition of the membrane-permeant DAG analog diC8 caused a full activation of PKD. Moreover, of all add-back mutants, only the PLCγ+ add-back mutant was able to mediate PDGF-induced DAG production (Table I, Add-back mutants, DAG production). The activation of PLCγ represents a very important branch of the β-PDGFR signal transduction mechanism. It has previously been shown that PLCγ and PI3K are two independent mediators of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis (20Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and that PLCγ is essential for growth and development (21Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). PDGF-induced activation of phospholipase D (29Yeo E.J. Kazlauskas A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27823-27826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), translocation of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate to the membrane (30Herget T. Rozengurt E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and activation of the Na+/H+exchanger (31Ma Y.H. Reusch H.P. Wilson E. Escobedo J.A. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30734-30739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) all occur through a PLCγ-dependent pathway. Hence, it remains an important task to identify the key enzymes that act in pathways downstream of PLCγ. In this report, we clearly identify PKD as an enzyme acting downstream of PLCγ in PDGF signaling. The multidomain structure of PKD prompted us to thoroughly investigate a variety of pathways that may impinge on this enzyme. The presence of a pleckstrin homology domain in PKD may represent a target for modulating enzymatic activity. It has been shown that the PH domain of Akt/PKB is crucial for the PI3K-mediated activation of the enzyme (16Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 32Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether PKD could be activated by selective PI3K activation (Table II). The PI3K+ add-back receptor, which activates PI3K without PLCγ activation, failed to activate PKD, whereas it activated Akt/PKB. Moreover, the activation of PKD by PDGF is not inhibited by wortmannin, a known inhibitor of PI3K (33Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data clearly show that PKD is not a target for PI3K signaling.Table IIActivation of Akt/PKB (but not PKD) by PI3KPKD activityAkt/PKB activity−PDGF+PDGF−PDGF+PDGF−W2-a−W, without wortmannin (with solvent); +W, with wortmannin.+W−W+W−W+W−W+W% maximum% maximumWild type152095100192510035PI3K+1815192218208717PLCγ+17149283202726192-a −W, without wortmannin (with solvent); +W, with wortmannin. Open table in a new tab This in vivo approach is particularly useful since in vitro experiments have demonstrated several problems intrinsic to the presence of inositol lipids in kinase assays (see Ref. 34Palmer R.H. Dekker L.V. Woscholski R. Le Good J.A. Gigg R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22412-22416Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar for a thorough discussion). In vitro assays often show an equal extent of activation by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(4,5)P2, so it is difficult to assess what would be the result of an in vivo increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on a particular kinase (in the presence of a high background level of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the membrane) (34Palmer R.H. Dekker L.V. Woscholski R. Le Good J.A. Gigg R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22412-22416Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, the in vitro kinase activation by these lipids is inhibited by 10 mm MgCl2 and is mimicked by high concentrations of inositol hexaphosphate and inositol hexasulfate (34Palmer R.H. Dekker L.V. Woscholski R. Le Good J.A. Gigg R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22412-22416Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, in vitro assays of kinase activation through these lipids seem to be misleading due to the ionic charge effects that these compounds may have. In vitroeffects of phosphatidylinositol lipids are likely to be valid only when they are corroborated by in vivo data (combined analysis of wortmannin inhibition and effects of PI3K mutants), as is the case for Akt/PKB (22Franke T.F.

Preincubation of A431 cells with GF109203X, a very potent inhibitor of PKC (35Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), completely abolished activation of PKD by PDGF in the WT and the PLCγ+ mutant cell lines (TableIII). The activation of PKD by PDB or the DAG analog diC8 was also completely abolished by preincubation with GF109203X (Table III). These results indicate that PDGF causes activation of PKD through the activation of PKC.Table IIIInhibition of PKD activation by the kinase inhibitor GF109203XAdditionPKD activityWild typePLCγ+−GFI3-a−GFI, without GF109203X (with solvent); +GFI, with GF109203X.+GFI−GFI+GFI% maximum responseControl buffer10121418PDGF55167015PDB100149019diC8731270103-a −GFI, without GF109203X (with solvent); +GFI, with GF109203X. Open table in a new tab The presence of zinc fingers in the N-terminal region of PKD (highly homologous to the zinc fingers of PKC) and the fact that PKD can be stimulated in vitro by phosphatidylserine/diC8 (8Van Lint J. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) would suggest that a direct interaction of these lipid molecules with the zinc fingers of PKD is sufficient for in vivo stimulation of the enzyme by the β-PDGFR. However, we have now clearly demonstrated that in vivo, the activation of PKD by PDGF or diC8 requires activation of PKC (Table III). The precise reason for this discrepancy still remains to be elucidated, but it could be that prior phosphorylation of PKD by a PKC-dependent mechanism is required in vivo to bring PKD in contact with DAG in the plasma membrane of the cell. This phosphorylation could induce a conformational change in the enzyme, cause its translocation, or promote the dissociation of a binding inhibitor. Hence, the enzyme may need a phosphorylation-induced translocation step to become activated. A similar type of regulation exists for β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1, which is also a PH domain-containing protein kinase. After phorbol ester stimulation, β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 is phosphorylated by PKC and translocates from the cytosol to the membrane (39Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that interaction of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 PH domain with membrane lipids and G protein βγ-subunits coordinately stimulates β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 activity (17Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Hence, one could envision a tight regulation of PKD whereby, under resting conditions, PKD is sequestered in a pool away from the plasma membrane. When PLCγ is activated, PKC is stimulated and promotes the phosphorylation of PKD (directly or through an intermediary kinase). This phosphorylation could then allow a PH domain-mediated interaction of PKD with the plasma membrane and the subsequent activation of the enzyme. Further work will be needed to test this hypothesis. Several PDGF-induced responses have been reported to be mediated by PKC: expression of immediate-early genes such as c-myc, c-fos, egr-1, junB, and fra-1 (38Hall D.J. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15302-15308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Rothman A. Wolner B. Button D. Taylor P. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30734-30739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and mitogenic signaling in human mesangial cells (42Choudhury G.G. Biswas P. Grandaliano G. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F634-F642PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments have shown that PKD acts downstream of PKC in β-PDGFR signaling. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that some of the so-called PKC-mediated PDGF responses may be mediated ultimately through PKD. PDGF induces phosphorylation of PKD, as evidenced by the incorporation of 32P in PKD immunoprecipitated from32Pi-labeled cells that were stimulated for various times with PDGF (Fig.3 B). When comparing Fig.1 D and Fig. 3 B, it is clear that the time course of incorporation of phosphate in PKD closely parallels the time course of activation of the enzyme. To show that PDGF-induced phosphorylation of PKD is required for activation of PKD, we incubated the activated PKD with the Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatase PP1C or PP2AC. Each phosphatase was able to fully reverse the PKD activation, and this inactivation was blocked by the specific phosphatase inhibitor microcystin (Fig. 3 A). To further demonstrate the effect of each of these phosphatases on the phosphorylation status of PKD, we incubated the32Pi-labeled PKD from PDGF-stimulated cells with PP1C and PP2AC. As shown in Fig.3 A (insets), both Ser/Thr-specific phosphatases caused dephosphorylation of PKD. These data strongly suggest that a Ser/Thr phosphorylation event is involved in the activation of PKD by PDGF. Similar effects of phosphatases have been reported for other kinases such as extracellular signal-related kinase and PKB, which are also stimulated in kinase cascades (43Van Lint J. Agostinis P.

The existence of multiple levels of control in kinase activation mechanisms is not without precedence. Akt/PKB, another PH domain-containing kinase, is activated by both protein phosphorylation (44Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this respect, a particularly interesting similarity between PKD and Akt/PKB regulation emerges. Both enzymes can be directly stimulated in vitro by a lipid mediator (DAG and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, respectively), and both enzymes can be stimulated in vivo by another upstream kinase (PKC and 3-phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase 1, respectively) (16Klippel A.

Hence, the dual regulation of protein kinases by lipid ligands and protein phosphorylation emerges as a new regulatory theme in signal transduction. This report presents a signaling model for future in vivostudies on PKD regulation. Further research will be required to elucidate the precise mechanistic details of the activation of PKD by PDGF. In particular, the contribution of each of the domains of PKD to the mechanism of PKD activation and function will have to be investigated using PKD mutants. We thank Dr. A. Kazlauskas (Harvard Medical School, Boston) for the generous gift of A431 cell lines expressing β-PDGFR mutants; Dr. J.

Recent evidence indicates that the transforming tyrosine kinases encoded by the v-Src, v-Abl, and v-Fps oncogenes can induce STAT activation, suggesting that their normal cellular homologs may contribute to STAT activation under physiological conditions. In this report, we provide direct evidence that c-Fes, the normal human homolog of v-Fps, potently activates STAT3. Transient transfection of human 293T cells with STAT3 and Fes resulted in strong stimulation of STAT3 DNA binding activity. In contrast, only modest activation of STAT5 by Fes was observed in this system, indicative of possible selectivity. To determine whether Fes-induced STAT3 activation is dependent upon endogenous mammalian kinases, co-expression studies were also performed in Sf-9 insect cells. Fes also induced a dramatic increase in STAT3 DNA binding activity in this system, whereas no activation of STAT5 was observed. As a positive control, both STAT3 and STAT5 were shown to be activated by the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in Sf-9 cells. Fes induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in both expression systems, consistent with the gel-shift results. Fes and STAT3 have been independently linked to myeloid differentiation. Results presented here suggest that these proteins may cooperate to promote differentiation signaling in response to hematopoietic cytokines.

STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are a class of transcription factors with SH2 domains that are activated in response to tyrosine phosphorylation. STATs are often activated by members of the JAK family of protein-tyrosine kinases in response to cytokine stimulation. The activation mechanism involves SH2-dependent recruitment of the STATs to tyrosine-phosphorylated cytokine receptors. The STATs are then phosphorylated by receptor-associated JAKs, which induces dimerization via reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction. The STAT dimers then enter the nucleus and bind specific DNA elements, leading to transcriptional activation. The JAK-STAT pathway is the subject of many recent comprehensive reviews (1Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 2Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev.

In addition to JAKs, other classes of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases have recently been shown to induce STAT activation. For example, STAT3 is constitutively activated in fibroblasts transformed with v-Src (6Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 7Cao X.M. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Src forms a stable complex with STAT3, suggesting that STAT3 activation may be direct (7Cao X.M. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, more recent work shows that JAK1 and to some extent JAK2 are activated in Src-transformed cells, suggesting that JAKs may contribute to STAT activation by Src kinases (8Campbell G.S. Yu C.-L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Another study has shown that STATs 1 and 5 are activated in fibroblasts transformed by v-Abl (9Danial N.N. Pernis A. Rothman P.B. Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In this case, v-Abl was shown to form stable complexes with endogenous JAK kinases, suggesting that STAT activation by v-Abl may involve JAKs as well. Related studies with chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines transformed by Bcr-Abl show a similar pattern of STAT activation, with some evidence for JAK involvement (10Shuai K. Halpern J. ten Hoeve J. Rao X.P. Sawyers C.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar, 11Carlesso N. Frank D.A. Griffin J.D. J. Exp.

Recently, we observed that fibroblast transformation by v-Fps correlates with potent activation of endogenous STAT3 (13Garcia R. Yu C.-L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K. Smithgall T.E. Fujita D.J. Ethier S. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 8: 1267-1276Google Scholar). This finding suggested that STAT3 may also be a substrate and effector protein for c-Fes, the normal human homolog of v-Fps (14Smithgall T.E. Yu G. Glazer R.I. J. Biol.

Recent studies have shown that activation of STAT3 is necessary for induction of myeloid differentiation in response to IL-6 (23Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N.

Taken together, these previous studies suggest that c-Fes may contribute to STAT activation under physiological conditions. In this study, we provide evidence for the activation of STAT3 by Fes in human cells as well as Sf-9 insect cells. Fes potently activated STAT3 in both systems, suggesting that STAT3 may be a direct substrate for Fes and may mediate Fes differentiation signaling in myeloid cells. 293T cells (25Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sf-9 cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in Grace's insect cell medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The cDNAs encoding murine STAT3 and STAT5A were subcloned into the respective expression vectors pCDNA3 and pCDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). Construction of expression vectors for Fes and the kinase-inactive Fes mutant K590E with C-terminal FLAG epitope tags and calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of 293T cells is described elsewhere (26Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). STAT3 and STAT5A cDNAs were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vectors pVL1392 and pVL1393, respectively. The resulting constructs were used to make recombinant baculoviruses by co-transfection with BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) using the manufacturer's protocol. A cDNA encoding the p210 form of Bcr-Abl (generous gift of Dr. Owen Witte, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, UCLA) was used to make a recombinant baculovirus by the same procedure. Construction of baculoviruses for the expression of wild-type and kinase-defective Fes has been described elsewhere (26Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-expressed Fes proteins carry a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag to allow for detection with the M2 monoclonal antibody. For protein expression, Sf-9 cells were grown to 50% confluence on 60-mm tissue culture plates and infected with recombinant baculoviruses for 1 h at 27 °C. The virus was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were incubated for 48 h prior to preparation of cytosolic extracts. Cytosolic extracts were made following a previously published protocol (6Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture plates of 293T or Sf-9 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 5 mm sodium fluoride. The cells were rinsed with hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were then lysed in hypotonic buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and clarified by microcentrifugation. The protein concentration of the extract was determined using the Coomassie-plus reagent (Pierce) and stored at −80 °C. The probes used for STAT DNA binding included the sis-inducible element (SIE) (6Yu C.-L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) and the mammary gland factor element (MGFE) (27Pallard C. Gouilleux F. Charon M. Groner B. Gisselbrecht S. Dusanter-Fourt I. J.

The sequences of the SIE oligonucleotides are 5′-CTTCATTTCCCGTAAATCCCTAAAGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTAGGGATTTACGGGAAATGA-3′. The sequences of the MGFE oligonucleotides are 5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAA-3′ and 5′-GATTTGAATTCCTAGAAA-3′. Oligonucleotides (20 pmol) were annealed in 10 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) by heating to 70 °C and slowly cooling to room temperature. The probes were labeled by combining 1 μl of annealed oligonucleotide with 2 μl of Labeling Mix-dATP (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 2 μl of [α-32P]dATP (10 mCi/ml; Amersham Life Science, Inc.), and 1 μl of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc., 3.7 units/μl). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. and the unincorporated nucleotides were removed by spermine precipitation (28Nelson K.L. Becker N.A. Pahwa G.S. Hollingsworth M.A. Maher III, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18061-18067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions contained 40,000 cpm of labeled probe in a final volume of 20 μl and 2–6 μg of cytosolic protein extract. In the case of the cytosolic extract from Sf-9 cells, 0.5 μl of a 1.0 ml cytosolic extract from 6 × 106 cells was used in each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and run on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol, rinsed with water, dried, and exposed to a storage phosphor screen. Images were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. For immunoprecipitation, clarified cytosolic extracts were incubated with 1 μg of anti-STAT3 or anti-STAT5 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry; Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (26Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) followed by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For immunoblotting, cytosolic extracts or immunoprecipitated proteins were run on 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated for 1 hour with antibodies to Fes (M2 anti-FLAG antibody; Eastman-Kodak Co.), phosphotyrosine (PY20; Transduction Laboratories), STAT3 (Santa Cruz) or STAT5 (Transduction Laboratories) at 1 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) 1The abbreviations used are: TBST, Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20; SIE, sis-inducible element; MGFE, mammary gland factor element. and 1.5% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then washed in TBST and probed with a secondary antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate in TBST-bovine serum albumin at the dilution recommended by the manufacturer (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Following further washing with TBST, the immunoreactive proteins were visualized colorimetrically using the alkaline phosphatase substrate NBT/BCIP. Recently we observed that endogenous STAT3 is constitutively activated in fibroblasts transformed by v-Fps, a retroviral homolog of c-Fes (13Garcia R. Yu C.-L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K. Smithgall T.E. Fujita D.J. Ethier S. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 8: 1267-1276Google Scholar). Given the relationships of c-Fes and STAT3 to myeloid differentiation (21Yu G. Smithgall T.E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether STAT3 or other STAT factors represent possible Fes substrates and effector molecules. To determine whether STAT3 is activated by Fes, the two proteins were expressed either alone or together in human 293T cells. Cytosolic extracts were prepared and tested for the presence of active STAT3 in a gel-shift assay with an SIE probe. As shown in Fig.1, extracts from cells co-transfected with both Fes and STAT3 produced a dramatic shift in SIE mobility, indicative of STAT3 activation. Addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled SIE completely blocked complex formation, providing evidence of probe specificity. To demonstrate that the activation of STAT3 requires the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Fes, 293T cells were co-transfected with STAT3 and a kinase-defective Fes mutant (Fes-K590E) (30Hjermstad S. Peters K.L. Briggs S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, co-expression with the kinase-defective protein produced only low background levels of STAT3·SIE complexes equivalent to those observed when STAT3 was expressed alone. This result shows that stimulation of STAT3 DNA binding activity requires an active Fes kinase domain and is consistent with STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation data shown below. We also investigated the requirements for other structural features of c-Fes in STAT3 activation using a series of Fes deletion and autophosphorylation site mutants. Co-expression of STAT3 with a Fes mutant lacking the unique N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–450) (26Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) activated STAT3 to the same extent as wild-type c-Fes (data not shown). This result suggests that the Fes N-terminal region, while involved in the recruitment of some Fes substrates (31Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar), greatly diminished STAT3 activation (data not shown). The latter two mutations reduce Fes tyrosine kinase activity in vitro(30Hjermstad S. Peters K.L. Briggs S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar), which may account for their reduced efficiency of STAT3 activation. To determine whether Fes exhibits a preference for STAT3, Fes was co-expressed with STAT5 in 293T cells. Cell lysates were tested for the presence of activated STAT5 using the MGFE as a probe. As shown in Fig.2, Fes stimulated STAT5 DNA binding activity. However, activation of STAT5 by Fes was modest in comparison to STAT3 (3-fold for STAT5 versus 35-fold for STAT3 relative to background levels observed with the kinase-inactive Fes mutant). These results suggest that Fes preferentially activates STAT3 over STAT5 in this system. In addition, work with Sf-9 insect cells described below suggests that STAT5 activation by Fes in mammalian cells may be indirect, possibly involving an intermediate tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine phosphorylation is required to induce STAT factor dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding (1Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 2Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 5Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). To determine whether stimulation of STAT3 DNA binding activity by Fes correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT3 was immunoprecipitated from transfected 293T cell lysates and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY20. As shown in Fig.3, STAT3 was strongly phosphorylated on tyrosine following co-expression with Fes, consistent with the positive gel-shift result. In contrast, control STAT3 immunoprecipitates from cells expressing STAT3 alone or in the presence of the kinase-inactive Fes mutant were devoid of tyrosine phosphorylation. Control immunoblots show that equivalent amounts of STAT3 were immunoprecipitated in each case and that equivalent levels of the wild-type and kinase-inactive Fes proteins were expressed (Fig. 3). These results suggest that STAT3 is either a direct substrate for Fes, that Fes activates an endogenous tyrosine kinase that in turn phosphorylates STAT3, or both. Data described below with Sf-9 insect cells strongly support the hypothesis that STAT3 is a direct substrate for Fes. However, the contribution of an endogenous tyrosine kinase in mammalian cells cannot be ruled out. Whatever the specific mechanism, these results demonstrate that c-Fes can strongly activate STAT3 in a human cell context. This finding is particularly interesting in light of recent data directly implicating STAT3 in myeloid differentiation. We also investigated whether Fes could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 in 293T cells using the same approach. As shown in Fig. 3, STAT5 immunoprecipitates from 293T cells co-transfected with STAT5 and Fes showed evidence of tyrosine phosphorylation. This finding is in good agreement with the positive gel-shift result shown in Fig. 2. As with STAT3, tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed when STAT5 was expressed alone or in the presence of the kinase-inactive Fes mutant, K590E. Control blots show equivalent levels of STAT5 in the immunoprecipitates and equal levels of wild-type and kinase-defective Fes in the cell lysates (Fig. 3). These results show that Fes can induce the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT5 in mammalian cells. Recent studies suggest that STAT5, like STAT3, may contribute to hematopoietic differentiation (see Discussion). Experiments conducted in 293T cells clearly demonstrate the ability of Fes to induce STAT3 DNA binding activity (Fig. 1). One possible mechanism of activation involves direct phosphorylation of STAT3 by Fes, leading to dimerization and DNA binding. Alternatively, it is possible that Fes may mediate its effects on STAT3 indirectly by activating endogenous JAKs or other tyrosine kinases, which in turn mediate STAT activation. The latter mechanism may contribute to STAT activation by both v-Abl and v-Src (8Campbell G.S. Yu C.-L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Danial N.N. Pernis A. Rothman P.B. Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To address the issue of STAT activation by Fes more directly, we utilized the baculovirus/Sf-9 cell system to circumvent the issue of endogenous mammalian tyrosine kinases. For these experiments, Sf-9 insect cells were infected with a recombinant STAT3 baculovirus either alone or in combination with wild-type or kinase-inactive Fes baculoviruses. Cytosolic extracts were examined for the presence of activated STAT3 by gel-shift assay with the SIE probe. As shown in Fig. 4, co-expression with Fes induced potent activation of STAT3 in Sf-9 cells, consistent with the result observed in 293T cells (Fig. 1). The Fes-induced SIE·STAT3 complex was fully competed with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled SIE, indicative of binding specificity. In contrast, the kinase-inactive mutant of Fes produced no detectable increase in STAT3 activation above background. These results strongly suggest that Fes is capable of directly activating STAT3 without the requirement for a member of the JAK family or another intermediate tyrosine kinase. The effect of Fes on STAT5 activation was also investigated in Sf-9 insect cells using the gel-shift assay and MGFE probe. As shown in Fig.5, no detectable STAT5 DNA binding activity was observed in the presence of Fes. This result is in contrast to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT5 by Fes observed in 293T cells (Figs. 2 and 3). Taken together, these results suggest that activation of STAT5 by Fes in 293T cells is indirect, possibly involving activation of an endogenous tyrosine kinase by Fes which in turn activates STAT5. To control for the expression of Fes and STAT proteins in the Sf-9 cell experiments, immunoblots were performed on the cell extracts used for the gel-shift assays. As shown in Fig. 6, Fes and STAT proteins were all strongly expressed in the infected cells. In addition, immunoblots of the same extracts with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed potent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in the presence of Fes, consistent with the strong signal observed in the gel-shift assay (Fig. 4). Also visible in this experiment is autophosphorylated Fes. On the other hand, no tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was detected, despite the presence of active Fes. This result is consistent with the negative gel-shift result with extracts from cells co-infected with Fes and STAT5 (Fig. 5). An alternative explanation for the negative gel-shift result with Fes and STAT5 in Sf-9 cells is that the baculovirus-expressed STAT5 protein may be resistant to activation in the insect cell context. To rule out this possibility, STAT5 was co-expressed with the p210 form of Bcr-Abl, the constitutively activated protein-tyrosine kinase associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (33Sawyers C.L. Cancer Surv. 1992; 15: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar). Several recent reports have shown that Bcr-Abl induces the activation of STAT5 as well as STATs 1 and 3 (10Shuai K. Halpern J. ten Hoeve J. Rao X.P. Sawyers C.L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar, 11Carlesso N. Frank D.A. Griffin J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 12Ilaria Jr., R.L. Van Etten R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31704-31710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Using the gel-shift assay with the MGFE probe, we observed that STAT5 was readily activated by Bcr-Abl in Sf-9 cells, whereas no detectable activation occurred with Fes (Fig.7). This result indicates that baculovirus-expressed STAT5 can bind to DNA following phosphorylation by the appropriate tyrosine kinase. We also observed potent activation of STAT3 by Bcr-Abl in Sf-9 cells (Fig. 7). Our observation of Bcr-Abl-induced STAT activation in Sf-9 cells is consistent with previous work by Ilaria and Van Etten (12Ilaria Jr., R.L. Van Etten R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31704-31710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), which suggests that STATs are directly activated by Bcr-Abl and do not require JAKs or other endogenous kinases. Data presented in this report demonstrate for the first time that STAT3 can be activated by the c-Fes tyrosine kinase. Our approach was to compare STAT activation in human versus insect cell backgrounds to address the issue of whether endogenous mammalian tyrosine kinases play a role in the activation mechanism. Our observations that Fes strongly activates STAT3 in both human and insect cells suggest that Fes is sufficient to activate STAT3 without a requirement for JAKs or other tyrosine kinase intermediates. However, the possible contribution of other tyrosine kinases to the activation mechanism in mammalian cells cannot be formally ruled out. These findings with STAT3 are consistent with our recent work showing that endogenous STAT3 activation occurs in fibroblasts transformed by v-Fps, the retroviral homolog of c-Fes (13Garcia R. Yu C.-L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K. Smithgall T.E. Fujita D.J. Ethier S. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 8: 1267-1276Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that v-Fps may directly induce endogenous STAT3 activation as well. In contrast to STAT3, however, we observed that Fes was unable to activate STAT5 in insect cells, despite some degree of activation in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that Fes activates STAT5 via an indirect mechanism, possibly via endogenous tyrosine kinases. Such a phenomenon has been reported previously for the activation of STATs by both v-Abl and Src kinases (8Campbell G.S. Yu C.-L. Jove R. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2591-2594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Danial N.N. Pernis A. Rothman P.B. Science. 1995; 269: 1875-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Potent activation of STAT3 by Fes in transfected human cells suggests that such an event may also be induced by Fes in hematopoietic cells, an important site of Fes expression (14Smithgall T.E. Yu G. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15050-15055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Feldman R.A. Gabrilove J.L. Tam J.P. Moore M.A.S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fes has been linked to the induction of myeloid differentiation in both normal and leukemic cell lines (21Yu G. Smithgall T.E. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10276-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Carmier J.F. Samarut J. Cell. 1986; 44: 159-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Manfredini R.

Two recent studies have strongly implicated STAT3 as a key component of myeloid differentiation as well. Both of these studies utilized dominant-negative mutants of STAT3 (23Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 24Minami M. Inoue M. Wei S. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3963-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These mutants were produced by substitution of the STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation site with phenylalanine or by mutation of residues critical for DNA binding. When these mutants were introduced into M1 myeloid leukemia cells, the cells no longer responded to IL-6 with growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Interestingly, IL-6 is one of the cytokines reported to activate Fes (19Matsuda T. Fukada T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Okuyama Y. Fujitani Y. Hanazono Y. Hirai H. Hirano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11037-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Fes may contribute to the IL-6-mediated activation of STAT3 and the subsequent differentiation response. Recent studies of GM-CSF-treated neutrophils also suggest a connection between Fes and STAT3 activation (35Brizzi M.F. Aronica M.G. Rosso A. Bagnara G.P. Yarden Y. Pegoraro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3562-3567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In these experiments, GM-CSF was shown to induce the formation of a multiprotein complex consisting of Fes, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, and the β-subunit of the GM-CSF receptor. However, this previous study did not address the possible contribution of Fes to STAT activation. Data presented here clearly demonstrate the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 by Fes and induction of its DNA binding activity, strongly suggesting that this activation mechanism may be direct. The GM-CSF receptor may serve as a docking site to bring Fes and STAT3 into close proximity to allow the phosphorylation event to occur. Such an interaction may be initiated by JAK2, which could create binding sites for the SH2 domains of Fes and STAT3 on the receptor β-subunit. Further experiments will be required to address the possible contribution of Fes to STAT activation in response to cytokine treatment. However, a definitive demonstration that Fes is involved in endogenous STAT3 activation by GM-CSF, IL-6, or other cytokines may be difficult because of the multiple non-receptor tyrosine kinases activated in response to cytokine treatment. Although our results in Sf-9 insect cells indicate that STAT5 is not a direct substrate for Fes, co-expression of these two proteins in human cells induced both STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity. These results suggest that Fes may indirectly induce STAT5 activation under physiological conditions. Like STAT3, STAT5 may also contribute to hematopoietic differentiation in some cases. Recent studies have established a strong correlation between STAT5 activation and differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines (36Woldman I. Mellitzer G. Kieslinger M. Buchhart D. Meinke A. Beug H. Decker T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, induction of monocytic differentiation in human U937 cells with phorbol ester, retinoic acid, or 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 induced strong DNA binding activity of STAT5. Similar results were observed following chemically induced differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. In the same study, STAT5 activation was observed in primary cultures of chicken myeloblasts following differentiation to macrophages with chicken myelomonocytic growth factor. Another recent study has shown that induction of megakaryocytic differentiation by thrombopoietin correlates with activation of STAT5. This study also identified the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 as a possible target gene for STAT5 in the differentiation response (37Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J.I. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Further work will be required to determine whether Fes can stimulate similar STAT5 responses as part of a differentiation signaling pathway in hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2031258536,"Sucrose-density flotation analysis of Triton-insoluble membrane domains isolated from highly purified sheep ventricular sarcolemma revealed the presence of two major 120- and 100-kDa proteins. Both species migrated in two-dimensional isoelectric focussing/SDS gels with an apparent pI of ∼4.3, suggesting that they might be related. Microsequence analysis of peptides derived from the 100-kDa protein yielded amino acid sequences with high homology to T-cadherin, a truncated cadherin lacking a cytoplasmic domain. The similarity was confirmed using antibodies to chicken T-cadherin that reacted with both proteins on immunoblots. T-cadherin was released from the detergent-insoluble sarcolemmal fraction by phospholipase C treatment indicating that it is linked to the membrane by a glycophosphoinositol anchor. T-cadherin could be ADP-ribosylated by a transferase that was also present in the caveolin-enriched Triton-insoluble fraction. T-cadherin-containing membrane fragments cofractionated on sucrose gradients with caveolin-3, a marker protein for myocyte caveolae. However, immunopurified caveolin-3-containing membranes contained no associated T-cadherin. Immunocytochemical analysis of cultured rat atrial myocytes revealed that T-cadherin and caveolin have related but nonoverlapping staining patterns. These results suggest that T-cadherin is a major glycophosphoinositol-linked protein in cardiac myocytes and that it may be located in plasma membrane “rafts” distinct from but possibly adjacent to caveolae.

Diverse membrane proteins are anchored to the external surface of the plasma membrane by a covalently attached glycolipid tail, frequently a glycophosphoinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycophosphoinositol; PI·PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; M, crude microsomes; SL, sarcolemma; T-CAV, Triton-insoluble caveolin-rich membranes; TIFF, Triton-insoluble floatable fraction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IEF, isoelectric focussing. moiety (1Ferguson M.J.A. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Although more than a hundred such proteins have been described including enzymes, adhesion molecules, and receptors, the function of the GPI anchor is uncertain. Whereas enhanced mobility of GPI-anchored proteins might be expected on the basis of the lipid component, a significant fraction of GPI-linked proteins seem paradoxically to exhibit severely restricted mobility within the plasma membrane (1Ferguson M.J.A. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become apparent that some GPI-modified proteins reside in specific subcompartments (“rafts”) of the plasma membrane that are insoluble in nonionic detergents (2Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 3Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 4Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Detergent insolubility is conferred by the presence of high levels of glycosphingolipids and cholesterol in such rafts, characteristics that may also apply to caveolae (4Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 5Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Caveolae are flask-shaped nonclathrin-coated 50–100-nm vesicles associated with the inner surface of the plasma membrane. First described by Palade (6Palade G. J. Appl. Physics. 1953; 24 (abstr.): 1424Google Scholar), they have been subsequently found in many mammalian cell types with fat, endothelial, epithelial, and muscle cells exhibiting the greatest abundance (4Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The functions of caveolae are not known with certainty, but they have been proposed to comprise a novel endocytic compartment involved in such functions as “potocytosis” (internalization of small ligands; Ref. 7Anderson R.G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) as well as transcytosis (movement of material between the apical and basolateral membranes in epithelia; Refs. 3Parton R.G.

In addition, biochemical studies of putative caveolae isolated from epithelial, endothelial and fibroblastic cell types have suggested an important function for these organelles in signal transduction. Numerous signaling elements appear concentrated in “caveolae” isolated by various methods from different tissues (8Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M.

However, whether the “Triton-insoluble floatable fraction” (TIFF) prepared from a variety of cells consists principally of caveolae or contains a heterogeneous mixture of membranes is controversial (12Kurzchalia T.V. Hartmann E. Dupree P. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 187-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Stan R.-V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The relationship between GPI-anchored proteins and caveolae has been extensively debated; whereas there may be bona fide physical linkage in some cases, it seems that detergent treatment may artifactually promote association in others (14Mayor S. Rothberg K.G. Maxfield F.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1948-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 15Mayor S. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Biol.

Microscopic examination of cardiac muscle reveals numerous caveolae associated with the myocyte plasma membrane comprising 25% or more of the total cell surface area (17Levin E.R. Page E. Circ. Res. 1980; 46: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Kordylewski L. Goings G. Page E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Only limited information is available on the biochemical characteristics of cardiac myocyte caveolae or other detergent-insoluble domains of the sarcolemma. We previously showed that it is possible to purify large amounts of sarcolemma from sheep heart using stringent extraction procedures and density gradient centrifugation (19Doyle D.D. Kamp T.J. Palfrey H.C. Miller R.J. Page E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6556-6563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These membranes are 20–40-fold enriched in the tetrodotoxin-insensitive Na+ channel, a specific marker for cardiac plasma membrane, and are therefore useful as a starting material for further fractionation. Here we use nonionic detergent treatment, density-gradient flotation, and immunoprecipitation to investigate caveolae and other detergent-insoluble domains of the cardiac sarcolemma. We find that T-cadherin, a truncated member of the cadherin family of extracellular Ca2+-dependent adhesion proteins (20Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), is the major GPI-linked species in the detergent-resistant fraction. This fraction is characterized by morphological entities that resemble caveolae and are enriched in the caveolar-marker protein caveolin. However, immunochemical studies suggest that T-cadherin and caveolin do not copurify and are not colocalized on the surface of cardiac myocytes, indicating that this GPI-linked protein is probably present in noncaveolar rafts at the cell surface. Polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 and -3 antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A polyclonal antibody to caveolin-3 was produced in rabbits to residues 3–19 of the rat caveolin-3 sequence (21Way M. Parton R.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Production of antibody and affinity purification of IgG were carried out by QCB (Hopkinton, MA). The production and characterization of T-cadherin antibodies are described elsewhere (22Sacristan M.P. Vestal D.J. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Ranscht B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 664-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]NAD were from NEN Life Science Products. Bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI·PLC) was obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim. Sarcolemma was purified from adult sheep ventricle as described previously (19Doyle D.D. Kamp T.J. Palfrey H.C. Miller R.J. Page E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6556-6563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, defatted tissue was subjected to homogenization in a high salt (0.6 m KCl) buffer with a Tekmar T185 shaft followed by low-speed (600 × g, 10 min) centrifugation to produce a crude pellet. The pellet was then subjected to further homogenization in the same high salt buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to produce a medium-speed pellet. This step was repeated twice (except that a low salt buffer was employed) and, in the second round, 10, 000 ×g for 10 min sufficed to precipitate the crude microsomes (designated the M fraction). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES-Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 42% sucrose, 0.4m KCl, 20 mm Na pyrophosphate, 1 mmMgCl2, and layered under a discontinuous sucrose gradient with steps of 0, 10, and 25% sucrose made in the same buffer. After overnight centrifugation at 140,000 × g the fraction above the 25% sucrose layer was collected, diluted 4-fold with water, and pelleted onto a 42% sucrose cushion by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Collected material, designated the SL fraction and equivalent in properties to the sarcolemma-enriched fraction described previously (19Doyle D.D. Kamp T.J. Palfrey H.C. Miller R.J. Page E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6556-6563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. All solutions contained aprotinin (1 μg/ml), benzamidine (0.5 mm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), o-phenanthroline (1.25 mm), pepstatin (0.1 μg/ml), EDTA (2 mm), and EGTA (1 mm) as protease inhibitors. A detergent-insoluble fraction was prepared from the SL as follows. The SL fraction was diluted 1:1 with 50 mm MES (pH 6.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl plus 1% Triton X-100 and the protease inhibitors indicated above (MBS); the mixture was incubated with gentle shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. The preparation was then made 40% with respect to sucrose and layered under an 8–30% sucrose gradient (in MBS) that was then centrifuged at 140,000 ×g for 16 h in a Type 641 rotor (Sorvall) at 4 °C. The gradient was fractionated into 1-ml fractions, and the peak of detergent-insoluble membrane fragments (centered around 15% sucrose) pooled, diluted with MBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min or directly precipitated with 5% (final) trichloroacetic acid. We refer to this fraction as Triton-insoluble caveolin-rich membranes (T-CAV). The TIFF fraction was prepared from cultured primary endothelial cells (either bovine or rat aorta; kindly provided by Dr. M. E. O'Donnell, University of California, Davis) by a procedure very similar to that previously described (23Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hemanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Tosylated polystyrene magnetic beads (Dynal, Lake Success, NY) were coated with antibody according to manufacturers instructions. Briefly, beads were incubated at 37 °C overnight on a rotator with goat anti-rabbit (FC chain specific) secondary antibody in 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 9.5). After washing, the coated beads were further incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-caveolin-3 antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cardiac SL (0.5 ml), prepared as described above, was taken from the 25% layer of the sucrose gradient and diluted 1:2 with 0.75% Triton X-100 in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitors. Half the sample was reserved as starting material and to the other half was added 100 μl of antibody-coated magnetic beads and 80 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin. Following overnight rotation at 4 °C, the beads were washed 4 times with phosphate-buffered saline, bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl (10 min/wash) to separate bound from nonbound material. Pelletable nonbound material was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were raised in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and the proteins in the starting material, and nonbound pellets were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, followed by solubilization of the washed pellet in gel sample buffer and analysis by immunoblotting. Standard immunoblotting procedures were used. Following electrophoretic transfer nitrocelluose sheets were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.5% Tween-20 then incubated overnight at 4 °C in rabbit anti-T-cadherin antiserum (1:500). Secondary development was with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Similar procedures were used with other antibodies. For immunocytochemistry, primary cultures of rat atrial myocytes were prepared by procedures described elsewhere (24Doyle D.D. Ambler S.K. Upshaw-Early J. Bastawrous A. Goings G.E. Page E. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After 6–9 days in culture, cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin. They were then exposed to polyclonal anti-T-cadherin and monoclonal anti-caveolin-3 antibodies followed by development with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-coupled secondary antibodies. Cells were visualized in a confocal fluorescence microscope (Noran Instruments, Middleton, WI) and images from the same plane were digitized and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). T-CAV membranes were pelleted in a microfuge (18,000 × g for 1 h) and were resuspended by trituration in 50 mm NaPO4buffer (pH 7.2); some aliquots were then treated with 60 mmoctylglucoside. The suspension was made 3% with respect to paraformaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After washing in NaPO4 buffer, some grids were incubated in 0.01% saponin on ice for 10 min to promote antibody accessibility. Then 2 μl of these suspensions were deposited on formvar carbon-coated 400-mesh nickel grids and allowed to air dry. Immunolabeling was carried out with anti-caveolin antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 5 nm colloidal gold particles. The grids were then applied to droplets of aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 min at room temperature, washed for 30 min with a stream of distilled water, air dried, and viewed with a Hitachi 600 electron microscope. Two-dimensional isoelectric-focussing (IEF)/SDS-PAGE was conducted in a standard manner (25Palfrey H.C. Nairn A.C. Muldoon L.L. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9785-9792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pI gradient was determined by pH measurement of segments cut from blank gels run in parallel with samples. For microsequence analysis, after completion of the second dimension proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a CAPS buffer (pH 11). The position of bands of interest was determined by India ink staining; these were excised, washed in methanol, dried, and then subjected to both N-terminal and internal microsequencing after proteolytic cleavage and HPLC (J. Fernandez and S. Mische, Protein Sequencing Facility, Rockefeller University). Data base searches were performed at the National Library of Medicine using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm. ADP-ribosylation of membranes was carried out by incubating T-CAV membranes (40 μg) in the presence of [32P]NAD (5 μm; 1000 cpm/pmol) for 15 min at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA plus 0.5 mm dithioerythritol. At completion of the reaction, the membranes were repelleted to remove free label; proteins were then resolved by IEF/SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. To label T-cadherin, 20 μg T-CAV membranes were isolated as described above and phosphorylated in the presence of cAMP (10 μm) and [γ-32P]ATP (20 μm; 2000 cpm/pmol) for 5 min at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mm dithioerythritol. The membranes were repelleted to remove free label then subjected to PI·PLC treatment using a bacterial enzyme (Bacillus cereus; 10 units/ml, 37 °C, 30 min). Bound and free material was separated by centrifugation (30,000 × g for 30 min) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and scintillation counting. When purified sheep sarcolemma was solubilized with Triton X-100 (0.5%) and fractionated by flotation in a 10–30% sucrose gradient, a minor protein peak centered around 15% sucrose (fraction 4) was obtained. Only ∼3–8% of the total sarcolemmal protein appeared in these lighter fractions; the remainder of the protein was either solubilized (fractions 10–12) or pelleted to the bottom of the tube (presumptive cytoskeleton) (Fig.1 A). The floatable fractions (called T-CAV) were pooled and analyzed by SDS-PAGE alongside samples from the M and SL fractions (Fig. 1 B). Several differences in protein composition were noted; some proteins that were prominent in the SL were depleted in T-CAV membranes (Fig. 1 B, arrowheads). On the other hand, two proteins of ∼120 and ∼100 kDa were enriched in T-CAV (Fig. 1 B, open arrows). Comparison of the same fractions by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 and -3 antibodies revealed that both proteins were enriched in the T-CAV fraction (Fig. 1 C; see also Fig. 1 A). The two isoforms of caveolin with apparent sizes of 24 and 20 kDa, respectively, exhibited ∼9-fold enrichment in T-CAV membranes over the SL fraction. Elsewhere, we confirm that the caveolin-1 isoform resides in nonmuscle cells of the heart, whereas caveolin-3 resides only in myocytes (24Doyle D.D. Ambler S.K. Upshaw-Early J. Bastawrous A. Goings G.E. Page E. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that the sheep heart T-CAV fraction is derived from both myocyte and nonmyocyte (predominantly endothelial; cf. Ref. 28Fujimoto T. Nakade S. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Ogawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) sources in the myocardium. Electron microscopy analysis of the negatively stained T-CAV fraction revealed numerous vesicular structures as well as associated membraneous material (Fig.1 D). The mean diameter of a substantial proportion of the vesicles was consistent with the size of caveolae in cardiac myocytes (17Levin E.R. Page E. Circ. Res. 1980; 46: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Kordylewski L. Goings G. Page E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Treatment of these membranes with octylglucoside and saponin revealed numerous lattice-like structures with a vesicular geometry, the lattice contains caveolin as these structures became labeled when incubated with anti-caveolin antibodies (Fig. 1 D). When T-CAV proteins were subjected to two-dimensional IEF/SDS-7.5% PAGE the 120-/100-kDa protein doublet stained prominently with Coomassie Blue; both species migrated with a pI ∼4.3 suggesting that they might be related (Fig.2 A). Gel-separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the 100-kDa protein (located by India ink staining) was cut out and subjected to proteolysis, reverse phase-HPLC, and gas-phase microsequencing of major peaks. A search of protein data bases using the BLAST algorithm revealed that the sequence of two internal peptides was very similar to chick T-cadherin-2 (Ref. 22Sacristan M.P. Vestal D.J. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Ranscht B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 664-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and Fig. 2 B). In neurons, T-cadherin is comprised of 120-kDa (precursor) and mature 100-kDa forms (20Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To assess whether the 120- and 100-kDa proteins of sheep sarcolemma are immunologically similar to T-cadherin and are enriched in T-CAV, we subjected fractions from sucrose gradients of detergent-treated sarcolemma to immunoblot analysis (Fig.3). Antibodies to chicken T-cadherin recognized proteins of 120 and 100 kDa in the M, SL, and T-CAV fractions with a substantial enrichment (5.6-fold) in the T-CAV fraction over SL. In an attempt to determine if T-cadherin- and caveolin-containing membranes can be distinguished on the basis of density, the T-CAV fraction was pooled and run on a second sucrose gradient of slightly different composition (5–30%). T-cadherin and caveolin immunoreactivity again comigrated, suggesting either that both proteins were associated with the same membrane fragments or that different membrane fragments had similar densities (see below). Because of the cell type heterogeneity of the myocardium, and the likelihood that T-CAV contains membrane material from myocyte and nonmyocyte sources, we wished to determine if T-cadherin is present in endothelial cells. However, immunoblotting of crude particulate fractions or gradient-purified TIFF from cultured primary bovine or rat aortic endothelial cells with anti-T-cadherin antibodies proved negative (data not shown). Thus T-cadherin is probably derived from cardiac sarcolemma not from contaminating endothelial membranes. As indicated above, the T-CAV fraction is likely a mixture of detergent-resistant membranes. To assess whether T-cadherin was associated with presumptive cardiac caveolae, we subjected this fraction to further purification using anti-caveolin-3 N-terminal antibodies. Using a procedure analogous to that of Stan et al. (13Stan R.-V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we coated magnetic beads with anti-caveolin-3 IgG then incubated them with the T-CAV fraction overnight at 4 °C. Bound membranes were separated magnetically from nonbound material and the latter collected by centrifugation. Equal aliquots of these fractions were then analyzed for caveolin-3 and T-cadherin expression. As shown in Fig.4, a substantial amount of caveolin-3 was precipitated by this procedure, whereas all of the T-cadherin remained in the nonbound (but pelletable) fraction. This procedure was specific as no caveolin-1 was associated with the anti-caveolin-3 beads. In addition, vesicular structures could be visualized when the beads were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (data not shown). These results were corroborated by immunocytochemical localization of T-cadherin and caveolin-3 on the surface of cultured adult rat atrial myocytes (Fig. 5). Both antibodies abundantly stained the cell surface of these cells. Image analysis of double-labeled cells revealed a similar pattern of labeling, but little colocalization was apparent when pixel counts were compared by image analysis (e.g. in Fig. 5 the overlap is ∼13%). These results suggest that T-cadherin and caveolin-3 are not colocalized at the cell surface but may occupy adjacent regions of the plasma membrane. The same images also revealed a significant amount of perinuclear staining with both antibodies that may reflect a pool of these proteins at or near the Golgi apparatus. Since T-cadherin is a GPI-linked protein in neurons (20Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,29Vestal D.J. Ranscht B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) we tested whether the same can be said of the cardiac sarcolemmal protein. To provide a convenient label for T-cadherin quantitation we phosphorylated T-CAV preparations in the presence of cAMP; an endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase was found in the T-CAV fraction that efficiently phosphorylated several proteins including T-cadherin (data not shown). 32P-labeled membranes were then incubated with bacterial PI·PLC, which specifically cleaves the GPI anchor between the glycerol backbone and the phosphate group (1Ferguson M.J.A. Williams A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Protein staining and autoradiography showed that a substantial amount of both T-cadherin isoforms was released by this treatment, indicating that these proteins are linked to the membrane by a GPI anchor (Fig. 6). An ADP-monoribosyltransferase has been identified in skeletal muscle sarcolemma (30Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11352-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 31Klebl B.M. Matsushita S. Pette D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to be GPI-linked and to ribosylate the adhesion protein integrin-α7 in this tissue (32Zolkiewska A. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25273-25276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA hybridization analysis indicated that an mRNA with a similar molecular size is present in heart (30Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11352-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore searched for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in cardiac sarcolemma by analysis of labeling patterns after addition of [32P]NAD to membrane fractions. Reactions carried out in the isolated cardiac SL fraction gave rise to insignificant incorporation. When the T-CAV fraction was analyzed under similar conditions several proteins became labeled, of which T-cadherin appeared to be the major substrate as determined by IEF/SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7); other proteins of 50 and 35 kDa also became radiolabeled under these conditions. These results indicate that an ADP-ribosyltransferase is concentrated in the T-CAV fraction and that T-cadherin is its major substrate in this fraction. Cadherins comprise a family of Ca-binding, homophilic adhesion proteins important in development and maintenance of various tissues (33Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). For example, N-cadherin is important during skeletal muscle development during which it accumulates at the neuromuscular junction (34Cifuentes-Diaz C. Nicolet M. Goudon D. Rieger F. Mege R.M. Development. 1994; 120: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, N-cadherin appears early in cardiac development and is localized at adherens junctions in the adult heart (35Goncharova E.J. Kam Z. Geiger B. Development. 1992; 114: 173-183PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we show that two major species of 120 and 100 kDa found in adult cardiac sarcolemma comprise the related protein, T-cadherin. Previous studies identified this protein as an atypical truncated member of the cadherin family found at high levels in the nervous system (20Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In contrast to other family members, T-cadherin lacks a cytoplasmic domain and transmembrane segment. Instead, it is linked to the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor in certain classes of peripheral neurons (20Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). T-cadherin transcripts were previously shown to be present in both skeletal muscle and heart (22Sacristan M.P. Vestal D.J. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Ranscht B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 664-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); the protein is present on the surface of skeletal muscle cells (36Fredette B.J. Ranscht B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7331-7346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its localization in heart has not been investigated. We used specific anti-T-cadherin antibodies to verify the identity of the cardiac proteins and to analyze its distribution in sarcolemma and cultured atrial myocytes. As in neurons (20Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), T-cadherin is present in sheep cardiac sarcolemma as both 120 and 100 kDa proteins. In neurons these two species appear to bear a precursor-product relationship to each other, but whether both isoforms are functional is still unknown. We also found that T-cadherin, as in neurons (20Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmerman M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), is linked to the cardiac sarcolemma by a GPI anchor, since it could be released from the membrane by a specific PI·PLC. The presence of T-cadherin in a detergent-insoluble membrane fraction is in agreement with previous findings on several other GPI-linked proteins in numerous tissues (2Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 3Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 7Anderson R.G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It appears that such extracellularly-disposed lipid-linked proteins partition into domains of the membrane termed rafts that are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids and are resistant to nonionic detergents (4Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In the present study these membrane fragments comigrated on sucrose density gradients with putative caveolar membranes, distinguished by the presence of the protein caveolin. Previous studies of cardiac tissue reveal that caveolae are abundant in the sarcolemma (17Levin E.R. Page E. Circ. Res. 1980; 46: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Kordylewski L. Goings G. Page E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and are morphologically similar to those identified in diverse cells and tissues. The present work demonstrates that structures physically resembling caveolae are also found in the T-CAV fraction derived from purified sarcolemma. A controversy has arisen with respect to the homogeneity of the TIFF fraction, equivalent to the T-CAV fraction studied here, because different membrane structures may be Triton-insoluble and these may display similar densities or the detergent may promote artifactual fusion between insoluble domains that are not normally in contact (12Kurzchalia T.V. Hartmann E. Dupree P. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 187-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Mayor S. Rothberg K.G. Maxfield F.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1948-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 16Fujimoto T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 929-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Indeed, TIFF fractions containing abundant GPI-linked proteins can be obtained from cells that lack caveolin or morphologically identifiable caveolae (37Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mirre C. Monlauzeur L. Garcia M. Delgrossi M.H. LeBivic A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C887-C894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and direct separation of caveolar from noncaveolar membranes in lung has shown that GPI-linked proteins are abundant only in the noncaveolar material (39Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Thus in the present experiments we suspected that comigration of T-cadherin-containing membranes with those containing caveolin might well be due to the equivalent density of two or more types of Triton-insoluble membranes present in the T-CAV fraction. We resolved this issue by (a) immunopurifying caveolin-3-containing membranes from T-CAV and testing for bound T-cadherin, and (b) immunolocalizing T-cadherin and caveolin-3 on the surface of cardiac myocytes. Both approaches indicate that T-cadherin and caveolin-3 (as a marker for caveolae) reside in distinct membrane domains of the cardiac sarcolemma. T-cadherin did not coprecipitate with caveolin-3-rich membranes isolated on antibody-coated beads, and immunocytochemical analysis showed that the surface distribution of T-cadherin and caveolin-3 is distinct. Nevertheless, inspection of confocal immunofluorescence images suggests that the overall staining patterns of T-cadherin and caveolin are similar. It is conceivable that these two proteins occupy adjacent compartments in the membrane with T-cadherin residing in a “pericaveolar” domain enriched in GPI-linked proteins as has been previously hypothesized (4Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 39Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Another GPI-linked protein that may be present in this domain is an ADP-ribosyltransferase enzyme capable of modifying T-cadherin. A comparable enzyme ADP ribosylates another extracellular matrix protein, α7 integrin, in skeletal muscle (32Zolkiewska A. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25273-25276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of extracellular ADP-ribosylation is unclear (see Ref. 40Okazaki I.J. Moss J. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 35: 247-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar for review) and it will be interesting to test whether T-cadherin functions like Ca2+ binding are affected by this post-translational modification. What is the function of T-cadherin in the myocardium? Like other members of the cadherin family, T-cadherin can act as a homophilic Ca2+-dependent adhesion protein, but it exhibits a weaker interaction than its relatives (29Vestal D.J. Ranscht B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Developmental studies suggest that the presence of T-cadherin on the surface of certain motor neurons may provide negative axon guidance cues (36Fredette B.J. Ranscht B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7331-7346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Fredette B.J. Miller J. Ranscht B. Development. 1996; 12: 3163-3171Google Scholar). Studies in chick indicate that T-cadherin is expressed late (post-myoblast fusion) in skeletal muscle development; in mature muscle it appears to be widely distributed on the surface but excluded from the neuromuscular junction (36Fredette B.J. Ranscht B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7331-7346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a distribution is complementary to that of N-cadherin, the other major cadherin isoform expressed in skeletal muscle (35Goncharova E.J. Kam Z. Geiger B. Development. 1992; 114: 173-183PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that T-cadherin expression might also be a negative determinant of synaptogenesis in skeletal muscle and that it may act as a barrier to motor neuron sprouting (36Fredette B.J. Ranscht B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7331-7346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression studies in epithelial cells also reveal a differential distribution of T- and N-cadherin (42Koller E. Ranscht B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30061-30067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Whether this complementary expression pattern extends to adult cardiac tissue is currently under investigation. It is conceivable that T-cadherin plays a role in synaptic placement during cardiac development as suggested for motor neurons and skeletal muscle, but as the protein remains abundant in the adult it may prove to have additional functions. A more speculative possibility is that T-cadherin could play a role as a low affinity extracellular Ca2+ “sponge” leading to the accumulation of localized high [Ca2+] on the surface of the plasma membrane. Such extracellular Ca2+ pools could be important in cardiac function. For example, there is evidence that atrial granule secretion occurs in the vicinity of caveolae (43Page E. Upshaw-Early J. Goings G.E. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and caveolae themselves reportedly contain Ca2+ pumps (44Fujimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar); the T-cadherin/Ca2+ pool may then provide Ca2+ for the secretory apparatus in this region of the sarcolemma.

https://openalex.org/W2090748712,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important inflammatory mediator and plays a central role in the destruction of connective tissue matrices in diseases such as arthritis and periodontitis. It is well established that IL-1 activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and induction of c-fos expression is a required step in the induction of matrix metalloproteinase expression involved in tissue degradation. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that IL-1-induced calcium flux is dependent on focal adhesion formation, suggesting a matrix-dependent restriction system for IL-1 signaling. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the consequences of this restriction on IL-1-mediated activation of the MAP kinase family and on c-fos expression. Treatment of human gingival fibroblasts with IL-1 activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase activity and induced c-fos expression in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Plating cells on poly-l-lysine prevented focal adhesion formation, eliminated IL-1-induced calcium influx, abolished ERK stimulation, and blocked c-fos expression. Cells in suspension and hence with no suitable substratum for focal adhesion formation also showed no ERK activation or enhanced c-fos expression in response to IL-1. In contrast, eliminating focal adhesion formation or calcium depletion in cells plated on fibronectin had no effect on IL-1 stimulation of JNK and p38 kinases, demonstrating that their activation was mediated through pathways independent of focal adhesions and calcium. Calcium depletion abolished IL-1-induced calcium uptake, ERK activation, and c-fos expression. The focal adhesion dependence of IL-1-induced ERK activation and c-fosexpression could be circumvented in cells plated on poly-l-lysine by simultaneous incubation with IL-1 and the calcium ionophore ionomycin. In transfection studies, IL-1 stimulation of serum responsive element (SRE) transcriptional activity was dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium. This is consistent with a requirement for calcium in the activation of ERKs and their involvement in the induction of c-fos expression through the SRE site on the 5′ promoter of the c-fos gene. Our results demonstrate that in cells attached to substrates by focal adhesions, IL-1-mediated calcium flux is required for ERK activation and c-fos expression but not for JNK or p38 activation. We conclude that cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix play an important role in restricting ERK and c-fos-dependent processes. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an important inflammatory mediator and plays a central role in the destruction of connective tissue matrices in diseases such as arthritis and periodontitis. It is well established that IL-1 activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and induction of c-fos expression is a required step in the induction of matrix metalloproteinase expression involved in tissue degradation. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that IL-1-induced calcium flux is dependent on focal adhesion formation, suggesting a matrix-dependent restriction system for IL-1 signaling. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the consequences of this restriction on IL-1-mediated activation of the MAP kinase family and on c-fos expression. Treatment of human gingival fibroblasts with IL-1 activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase activity and induced c-fos expression in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Plating cells on poly-l-lysine prevented focal adhesion formation, eliminated IL-1-induced calcium influx, abolished ERK stimulation, and blocked c-fos expression. Cells in suspension and hence with no suitable substratum for focal adhesion formation also showed no ERK activation or enhanced c-fos expression in response to IL-1. In contrast, eliminating focal adhesion formation or calcium depletion in cells plated on fibronectin had no effect on IL-1 stimulation of JNK and p38 kinases, demonstrating that their activation was mediated through pathways independent of focal adhesions and calcium. Calcium depletion abolished IL-1-induced calcium uptake, ERK activation, and c-fos expression. The focal adhesion dependence of IL-1-induced ERK activation and c-fosexpression could be circumvented in cells plated on poly-l-lysine by simultaneous incubation with IL-1 and the calcium ionophore ionomycin.

We conclude that cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix play an important role in restricting ERK and c-fos-dependent processes.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uncompensated actions of such a potent cytokine can have deleterious consequences, and indeed IL-1 has been implicated in a wide range of pathological processes including sepsis, septic shock, and inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and periodontitis (2Glauser M.P. Baumgartner J.-D. Cohen J. Lancet. 1991; 338: 732-735Abstract PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 3Pelletier J.-P. DiBattista J.A. Roughley P. McCollum R. Martel-Pelletier J. Rheum. Dis. Clin. N.

The cellular responses to IL-1 stimulation are well documented and include increased production of matrix metalloproteinases (5Cruz T.F. Mills G. Pritzker K.P. Kandel R.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Sirum K.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8691-8698Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), prostaglandin E2 (7Ng S.B.

Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). However the detailed mechanisms leading to these biological activities after IL-1 binding to its cognate receptor are poorly defined. Many signaling systems (e.g. protein kinases A and C, phospholipase C, and G-proteins) have been reported to be utilized in IL-1-induced responses (9Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Cerretti D.P. Bird T.A. Chem. Immunol. 1992; 51: 33-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Small molecules such as ceramide (11Spiegel S. Merril Jr., A.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) may also act as second messengers for cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1. Recent advances in IL-1 signaling strongly suggest that protein kinases are involved in transducing signals elicited by IL-1 binding. An IL-1 receptor activated kinase has recently been identified and cloned (13Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Cytokines such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α can also exert their effects via MAP kinase cascades (14Saklatvala J. Davis W. Guesdon F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Members of this kinase family are classified into three subgroups (14Saklatvala J. Davis W. Guesdon F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar); the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the stress-activated protein kinases or c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinase. The MAP kinases are strongly activated by growth factors and stress-related signals including cytokine stimulation, ultraviolet light radiation, and osmotic shock. IL-1 activation of the MAP kinase cascade is necessary for the induction of the transcription factors, c-fos and c-jun, as well as the activation of the c-fos/c-Jun heterodimer, the activating protein-1 (AP-1). Since cytokine stimulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity is involved in a number of pathophysiological processes including cellular proliferation and production of matrix metalloproteinases, the signals modulating the MAP kinase pathway may play an important role in regulating cellular responses in disease. Although the mechanism of IL-1 signaling is an area of intensive reseach, much less effort has been devoted to studying the regulation of IL-1 receptor signaling by the extracellular matrix. In vitro, many types of stromal cells form contacts with their substrata through focal adhesions, which are discrete macromolecular complexes that function in cell attachment (16Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, IL-1 receptors are enriched at these focal adhesion sites (17Qwarnstrom E.E. Page R.C. Gillis S. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8261-8269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This localization may play an important role in regulating the signals induced following IL-1 binding to the receptor, possibly through the utilization of tyrosine kinases and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins enriched at focal adhesions sites (19Qwarnstrom E.E. MacFarlane S.A. Page R.C. Dower S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For example, we have previously shown that cell attachment reciprocally modulates IL-1 signaling since focal adhesions are required for IL-1 induction of intracellular calcium flux (18Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Luo L. Cruz T. McCulloch C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the requirement of focal adhesions and calcium uptake on IL-1 induced activation of the three MAP kinase subgroups and on c-fosexpression. Recombinant human IL-1β and biotinylated IL-1β were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The protein was purified by sequential chromatography (to >97% purity), and the endotoxin level was determined to be 0.1 ng/μg of IL-1 by the manufacturer. Ionomycin was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Fura 2 and fura 2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura 2/AM) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bovine fibronectin, poly-l-lysine, BSA, mouse monoclonal antibody to vinculin, FITC-conjugated antibodies, EGTA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM) were obtained from Sigma. Myelin basic protein was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-ERK2 and anti-p38 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Human gingival fibroblasts were grown in minimal essential medium (α-MEM) containing 15% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (0.17% penicillin V, 0.1% gentamycin sulfate, and 0.01 μg/ml amphotericin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells between the 4th and 12th passages were used in all experiments. Prior to experiments with IL-1, cells were detached by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C with 0.5 mm EDTA after washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fibroblasts were plated on coverslips, on 100-mm culture dishes, or in chamber slides. Cells were plated 1 day before experiments. Cells between the 4th and 12th passages were used in all experiments. Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i) was measured as described (20Luo L. Cruz T. McCulloch C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The calcium response was studied in cells plated on coverslips coated with fibronectin or poly-l-lysine or in suspended cells. In experiments with Ca2+-free medium, cells were washed with medium containing 0.5 mm EGTA without Ca2+ to chelate-free Ca2+ ions and preincubated with BAPTA/AM in Ca2+-free medium before adding IL-1β. Multichamber glass slides were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) or poly-l-lysine (200 μg/ml). Cells were then plated for 6 h, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeablized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and thoroughly rinsed with PBS. Immunofluorescence staining for vinculin was performed with a mouse anti-vinculin antibody (1:20 dilution) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:50 dilution) for 1 h at 37 °C. Nonspecific control staining was performed on the same slide by using secondary antibody only. The spatial distribution of staining for vinculin in focal adhesions was examined by confocal microscopy (Leica CLSM). For FITC-labeled antibodies, excitation was set at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm. Cells were harvested according to published procedures by Hibi et al. (21Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Extracts containing 100 μg of protein were used with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose suspension prebound with 20 μg of GST-c-Jun. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by drying, autoradiography, and quantitation by phosphoimaging analysis. Fibroblasts were lysed in 800 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA at pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium floride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin. ERK or p38 kinase activity was determined by incubating 200–300 μg of cellular extracts with 1 μg of anti-ERK2 or anti-p38 antibody, and protein A-agarose for 3 h at 4 °C. The protein A beads were then washed thoroughly before the addition of 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μm ATP) containing 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and 10 μg of substrate protein (MBP for ERK and GST-ATF2 for p38 kinase). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped with Laemmli buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to x-ray films. Human fibroblasts were propagated overnight on 35-mm plates. Transfections were done with 10–15 μg of the reporter plasmid SRE-luc and 5 μg of lacZ DNA by the calcium phosphate technique according to a standard protocol (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kinston R.E. Moore D.D. Seldman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 9.1.1-9.1.3Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m KH2PO4 at pH 7.8, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and luciferase activity was determined as described by Xie et al. (23Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Results were measured in a Lumat luminometer (Berthold) and expressed as relative light units. Total RNA was isolated by the acidified guanidine isothiocyanate method (12Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing gel. Denatured RNA samples (10–15 μg) were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in a 1% denaturing agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad), cross-linked with an ultraviolet cross-linker (Stratagene UV Stratalinker 1800), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled c-fos cDNA probe. The blots were subsequently stripped and re-probed with32P-labeled glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA as an internal standard to ensure roughly equal loading. Assessment of IL-1 receptors was conducted by flow cytometry and affinity labeling (R & D Systems). Single cell suspensions were prepared by treating cell cultures with 0.5 mm EDTA and washing twice with saline buffer. The cells were subsequently stained with biotinylated IL-1β and then with streptavidin FITC. Measurements of fluorescence intensity for individual cells due to specific binding of IL-1β were obtained by comparing cells stained with IL-1β and streptavidin-FITC, or cells stained with streptavidin-FITC only, or with cells incubated with IL-1β in the presence of a blocking antibody to IL-1 (polyclonal goat IgG against human IL-1β. These control groups were used to determine fluorescence channel thresholds for specific staining. Samples were analyzed on a FACSTAR Plus flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at 200 cells/sec with 488 nm laser excitation. Emission signals were obtained with a 590/30 nm band pass filter. Ten thousand cells were analyzed in each sample, and data were collected in list mode using logarithmic amplifiers. To eliminate signals due to cellular debris, particles with forward light scatter comparable with previously established threshold values for fibroblasts were assessed. We have demonstrated previously that IL-1 stimulation of human fibroblasts and bovine chondrocytes leads to elevation of intracellular calcium ion concentration (18Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Luo L. Cruz T. McCulloch C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a response that requires the formation of focal adhesions. Consequently we investigated the relationship between this adhesion-dependent calcium flux and the downstream signaling events activated by IL-1. Since members of the MAP kinase family are potential targets in the IL-1 signaling pathway, we first assessed the activity of members of the MAP kinase family under conditions that permit or prevent focal adhesion formation. Fibroblasts were plated on fibronectin-coated (10 μg/ml) coverslips to allow integrin-dependent attachment and spreading. As shown earlier (18Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), immunolocalization of the focal adhesion protein vinculin by fluorescence microscopy showed bright, punctate staining in presumptive focal adhesions of adherent cells (Fig.1 A). In contrast, cells plated on poly-l-lysine (200 μg/ml), which mediates nonspecific, integrin-independent attachment, failed to spread and remained rounded. Immunofluorescence detection of vinculin in cells plated on poly-l-lysine showed only diffuse staining with no discrete, brightly staining sites (Fig. 1 A). We examined ERK, p38, and JNK activities after IL-1 treatment of cells plated on fibronectin or poly-l-lysine. Fibronectin-adherent cells stimulated with IL-1 showed ERK activation; however, no significant activation occurred in cells attached to poly-l-lysine (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, both JNK and p38 kinase were very strongly activated by IL-1 in cells plated on either fibronectin or poly-l-lysine. In a separate assessment of the importance of cellular matrix attachment on IL-1-mediated ERK activation, the same treatment protocol was modified, and suspended cells were used instead of poly-l-lysine-attached cells. Again, significant increases of ERK activation above controls were observed only for cells adherent to fibronectin but not for suspended cells while JNK and p38 were activated independent of cell attachment (Fig. 1 C). Hence, in contrast to ERK, focal adhesion formation does not appear to be required for IL-1 activation of the JNK or p38 kinase pathways. Since one effect of IL-1 stimulation, namely an increase in intracellular calcium, is a focal adhesion-dependent process (18Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Luo L. Cruz T. McCulloch C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we asked if this calcium response could be the restricting factor leading to the differential effects of IL-1 on ERK activation. In cells plated on fibronectin, there was about a 2-fold increase in [Ca2+] (209 ± 30 nm above baseline, n = 3; Fig.2 A) upon IL-1 stimulation. Cell shape itself evidently did not play a role in the effects described above since poly-l-lysine-attached cells incubated with fibronectin but not BSA-coated beads also exhibited IL-1-induced calcium flux (Fig. 2 A, right upper inset). Under these conditions, integrins are recruited to the bead-attachment sites, and this results in the formation of focal adhesions on the ventral surface of cells which have not spread and remained round (data not shown; see Ref. 20Luo L. Cruz T. McCulloch C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As expected, calcium chelation (Ca2+-free medium plus BAPTA/AM) led to a nearly complete reduction in the amplitudes of IL-1-induced calcium transients (Fig.2 A). Cells pre-incubated in Ca2+-free medium but without BAPTA/AM also showed similar reductions of calcium transients, indicating that the rise in intracellular calcium was primarily due to influx through the plasma membrane (data not shown; see Ref. 18Arora P.D. Ma J. Min W. Cruz T. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6042-6049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When ERK activity was measured in cells plated on fibronectin, only cells incubated in calcium-containing buffer exhibited greatly increased IL-1-mediated activation of ERK than cells in calcium-free buffer (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating that the availability of calcium in the bathing buffer was important for stimulation of ERK by IL-1. As IL-1-induced ERK stimulation was evidently calcium-dependent, we examined if this requirement also applied to the other two MAP kinases. As measured by solid phase and immunocomplex kinase assays, respectively, neither JNK or p38 activation by IL-1 showed the calcium dependence that was required by ERK (Fig. 2 B). This common characteristic of calcium-independence is consistent with the notion that both JNK and p38 kinase activation are adhesion-independent and also share many properties including activation by the same stresses and cytokines (15Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar,24Geng Y. Valbracht J. Lotz M. J. Clin.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In the next series of experiments, we asked if we could circumvent the apparent focal adhesion dependence for IL-1-induced ERK activation in cells by inducing calcium entry with the ionophore ionomycin. Cells plated on fibronectin or poly-l-lysine were treated with and without IL-1 and ionomycin. Preliminary dose-response experiments were conducted with ionomycin to determine the optimal dose for stimulation of calcium flux, and this was found to be 2 μm. Treatment with ionomycin alone led to a significant calcium influx in cells plated on fibronectin (Fig. 2 A, left upper inset) or poly-l-lysine (not shown) but did not activate ERK in cells on fibronectin or poly-l-lysine (Fig.2 C), suggesting that calcium fluxes alone are necessary but not sufficient for ERK activation. Ionomycin and IL-1 induced ERK activation at a similar or greater level than that of IL-1 alone in fibronectin-attached cells (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2 and 4). Notably, in cells plated on poly-l-lysine, the combination of ionomycin and IL-1 was able to strongly stimulate ERK activation, whereas IL-1 or ionomycin alone had little or no significant effect. These data indicate that artificially induced calcium entry by ionomycin fulfill the requirements provided by focal adhesions in IL-1-induced activation of ERK even when cells are plated on poly-l-lysine and focal adhesions are absent. Since IL-1 activation of ERKs is thought to be a required step in the activation of the SRE and c-fos expression, we examined the effect of ERK inhibition by depriving cells of calcium and then measuring SRE transcriptional activity and c-fos expression in response to IL-1 (Fig. 3). The SRE is bound and regulated by the serum response factor (SRF) along with the ternary complex factor (TCF/Elk-1; Ref. 28Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Google Scholar). TCF/ELK-1 is a major substrate for ERK, which upon activation translocates to the nucleus. Thus ERK activation indirectly enhances transcriptional activity of SRE-dependent genes. To establish whether intracellular calcium increases are required for SRE activity, fibroblasts transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of a SRE were treated with IL-1 in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. In the presence of calcium, luciferase activity was stimulated 5-fold by IL-1 (Fig. 3). However, this stimulation did not occur if calcium was not available in the bathing buffer. These data demonstrate the dependence of IL-1 stimulation of SRE activity on calcium fluxes. However, the inability of ionomycin to stimulate luciferase activity in transfected fibroblasts (data not shown) suggests that artificially induced increases in intracellular calcium are not sufficient to induce SRE transcriptional activity. The c-fos gene is an immediate early response gene that is rapidly and transiently induced upon stimulation of quiescent cells with cytokines, growth factors, and serum. Serum growth factors and cytokines that activate MAP kinases stimulate c-fosexpression through the SRE (29Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, agents or conditions that alter SRE activity will modulate c-fos expression. In cells plated on fibronectin, IL-1 (20 ng/ml; continuous exposure) induced a transient increase of c-fos mRNA that peaked at 30 min (Fig. 4 A, top). Expression of GAPDH mRNA was used as a loading control and was unaffected by IL-1 treatment. IL-1 induced a dose-dependent increase of c-fos mRNA that peaked at 20 ng/ml IL-1β when cells were examined at 30 min after treatment (Fig. 4 A, middle). Induction of c-fos by IL-1 was dependent on the formation of focal adhesions since cells plated on poly-l-lysine showed only a minimal response to IL-1 (Fig.4 A, bottom), and cells in suspension showed no detectable response (data not shown). To investigate if the IL-1-induced calcium increase was required for the expression of c-fos, we examined the effect of IL-1β on [Ca2+] i in the presence (1.8 mm) and in the absence of extracellular calcium (Ca2+-free medium with 0.5 mm EGTA for 15 min). The amplitudes of IL-1-induced calcium transients above base line after incubation in EGTA without Ca2+ were significantly reduced (16 ± 4 nm above base line; p < 0.05;n = 4). Cells pre-incubated with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM showed no further reduction of calcium transients, indicating that entry of calcium from the external buffer was critical for generation of transients, whereas intracellular release was less important. Indeed preincubation of cells with thapsigargin (1 μm; 15 min in calcium containing buffer) before IL-"
https://openalex.org/W1979837084,"We have identified a novel Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP)-associatedprotein, an ATPase named RapA. Almost all of this 110-kDa protein in the cell copurifies with RNAP holoenzyme as a 1:1 complex. Purified to homogeneity, RapA also forms a stable complex with RNAP, as if it were a subunit of RNAP. The ATPase activity of RapA is stimulated by binding to RNAP, and thus, RapA and RNAP interact physically as well as functionally. Interestingly, RapA is a homolog of the SWI/SNF family of eukaryotic proteins whose members are involved in transcription activation, nucleosome remodeling, and DNA repair. We have identified a novel Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP)-associatedprotein, an ATPase named RapA. Almost all of this 110-kDa protein in the cell copurifies with RNAP holoenzyme as a 1:1 complex. Purified to homogeneity, RapA also forms a stable complex with RNAP, as if it were a subunit of RNAP. The ATPase activity of RapA is stimulated by binding to RNAP, and thus, RapA and RNAP interact physically as well as functionally. Interestingly, RapA is a homolog of the SWI/SNF family of eukaryotic proteins whose members are involved in transcription activation, nucleosome remodeling, and DNA repair. Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; ORF, open reading frame. is the sole enzyme responsible for all transcription activity in the cell. The core RNAP, consisting of α2ββ′ subunits, is the basic machinery capable of transcription elongation and termination at simple terminators. There are many RNAP-associated proteins that modulate the activity of RNAP during different stages of transcription (1Burgess R.R. Erickson B. Gentry D. Gribskov M.M. Hager D. Lesley S. Strickland M.

The two largest subunits of RNAP, β and β′, are the homologs of eukaryotic RNAP (for review, see Ref. 11Archambault J. Friesen J.D. Microbiol.

These homologies indicate that the basic structure and function of RNAP and RNAP-associated proteins are conserved throughout evolution.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Kolsto A. Bork P. Kvaloy K. Lindback T. Gronstadt A. Kristensen T. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), however, none of the prokaryotic homolog products had been purified. One of the unsolved questions regarding the SWI/SNF family of proteins is whether they are associated with RNAP (13Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our results have shown that RapA is an RNAP-associated protein, suggesting that association with RNAP is a conserved feature of this class of proteins. E. coli K12 cells (MG1655) were grown on 4× LB in a 10-liter fermenter. Cells were harvested at A600 ≈ 8 in late log growth phase (yield ∼200 g of wet cell paste). About 100 g of wet cell paste was used per purification. RNAP was purified according to Hager et al. (37Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but with some modifications. A single-stranded DNA-agarose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column was used instead of DNA-cellulose, and the step of gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 was omitted. The single-stranded DNA-agarose column (bed volume ∼25 ml) was pre-equilibrated with TGED buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol) containing 0.2 m NaCl, and sample was loaded on the column at 1.5–2 ml/min. After loading, the column was washed with 200 ml of TGED containing 0.2 m NaCl, and the RNAP fraction was eluted with TGED containing 1.0 m NaCl at 1 ml/min. A shallow gradient (from 0.3 to 0.5 m NaCl in 400 ml of TGED buffer) was used to elute RNAP from the 10/10 preparative Mono-Q column (Pharmacia) at 0.5 ml/min. Typically, the yield for core RNAP was 16–20 mg, for holoenzyme was 10–16 mg, and for holoenzyme-RapA was 2–4 mg. FPLC System (Pharmacia) was used for the protein purification, and the purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The combined RNAP-RapA fractions (peak 3 from the Mono-Q 10/10 column) were buffer exchanged with Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreithol, pH 7.5) containing 1 m(NH4)2SO4 using Centriprep 100 concentrators (Amicon). They were loaded on the phenyl Superose HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia), which was pre-equilibrated with the above buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 ml of Buffer A containing 1 m(NH4)2SO4 and then subjected to reverse linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (1–0 m in 80 ml of Buffer A). Fractions of 4 ml were collected and analyzed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The fractions that contained the 110-kDa RapA protein were diluted with 2 volumes of TGED buffer and loaded directly on the Mono-Q 5/5 column which was pre-equilibrated with TGED buffer containing 0.2m NaCl. After pre-elution wash with 10 ml of TGED containing 0.2 m NaCl, RapA was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.3–0.5 m in 80 ml of TGED buffer). Fractions of 4 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and analyzed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The combined fractions containing pure RapA were concentrated to 0.3–0.4 mg/ml and stored in TGED buffer containing 50% glycerol and 100 mm NaCl at −20 °C. Under these conditions no loss of ATPase activity was detected for at least 1 year. Formation of the RNAP·RapA complex was studied by gel-filtration of the protein mixtures on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia). The purified proteins were either premixed in 150 μl of TGED containing 0.1m NaCl, or run separately. Following 15 min of incubation on ice, the sample was loaded on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column pre-equilibrated with the above buffer. The column was run with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and fractions of 1.0 ml were collected. Each fraction was concentrated using Microcon 10 concentrators (Amicon) at 4 °C, and about half of the sample in each fraction was analyzed. ATPase assay is based on measuring the amount of [α-32P]ADP released from [α-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm ATP and 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. When indicated, poly(rA) (0.25 μg), poly(dA) (0.26 μg), or poly(dA)·poly(dT) (0.26 μg) was included in the reaction mixture. The reactions were started by the addition of the purified RapA (0.2 μm) or RNAP holoenzyme (0.1 μm) or 2:1 (mol/mol) mixture of the purified RapA (0.2 μm) and RNAP holoenzyme (0.1 μm). After 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 10% SDS, lyophilized, dissolved in 5 μl of methanol and spotted onto a poly(ethylenimine)-cellulose plate (J. T. Baker), and chromatography was carried out in 1 m LiCl, 1 mformic acid. Plates were autoradiographed and were also scanned on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to quantitate the amount of [α-32P]ATP hydrolyzed. For determination of other (d)NTPase 2A similar profile has also been observed upon Mono-Q chromatography in R. R. Burgess' laboratory (R. R. Burgess, personal communication). activity, ATP was replaced with a corresponding (d)NTP and [α-32P](d)NTP. The binding of polynucleotides to RapA was studied by fluorescent titrations using a Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50B (Perkin-Elmer). Protein (tryptophan) fluorescence of RapA (0.01 mg/ml in 120 μl) was measured in TGED buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl and 10 mmMgCl2. The reductions in the fluorescence intensity of the sample (λex = 295 nm) in the maximum of the emission spectrum were monitored after the additions of increasing amounts of a polynucleotide solution (for each addition, the sample was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min, and all additions were made in a total volume < 8 μl). ΔF/ΔFmaxfor each polynucleotide concentration was calculated, and the dissociation constants were determined from the Scatchard plots. RNAP concentrations were determined by UV absorbance using the extinction coefficient data of Lowe et al. (40Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). RNAP and RapA concentrations were also determined using the Bradford method (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of the RNAP and RapA preparations was estimated from overloaded SDS-polyacrylamide gels after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver. 8% SDS-polyacrylamide stacking gels were run using a Mini-PROTEAN II Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). Amino acid sequencing of the N-terminal region of RapA was done by automated Edman degradation and phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analysis using Applied Biosystems model 476A protein sequencing system. For Western blot, electroelution was performed using Fastblot semi-dry electroblotter (Biometra) and Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The polyclonal antibodies to highly pure core RNAP, ς-70 subunit of RNAP, or the 110-kDa RapA protein (>98% pure) were raised in rabbits by Berkeley Antibody Co., CA. The protein bands were visualized using goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Calbiochem) and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). In vitro transcription assays were essentially performed as described (49Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11659-11667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 0.2 mm ATP, GTP, and CTP and 0.02 mm UTP, including ∼5 μCi of [32-P]UTP, were used in multiple round transcription assays. The data were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Using a modified procedure for the purification of the E. coliDNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP), we identified a 110-kDa protein that consistently copurified with RNAP (Fig.1). In the final step of Mono-Q chromatography, from which highly pure and active RNAP was obtained (37Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the fraction that contained the RNAP holoenzyme and the 110-kDa protein eluted as peak 3 immediately following the core RNAP (peak 1) and holoenzyme (peak 2) in a shallow NaCl gradient (Fig. 1, B and C). 4(d)NTP = NTP and dNTP; (d)NTPase = NTPase and dNTPase; (d)ATP = ATP and dATP; and (d)ATPase = ATPase and dATPase. A protein of about 110-kDa had been previously observed to copurify with RNAP (38Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K.F. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 39Stetter K.O. Zillig W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); however, it was believed to be a proteolytic fragment of the β′ (40Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) or β subunit of RNAP (41Ishihama A. Fujita N. Glass R.E. Proteins. 1987; 2: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The 110-kDa protein in our preparation does not react with RNAP-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 2), indicating that it is not related to the known subunits of RNAP.Figure 2The 110-kDa protein is not related to the known subunits of RNAP. α, β/β′, ς-70 subunits of RNAP and the 110-kDa protein were isolated separately from the Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (by passive elution with 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 50 °C from homogenized gel slices) and loaded repeatedly on separate tracks of two identical 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, subjected to either silver staining (top) or immunoblotting with antibodies against both core RNAP and ς-70 (bottom). The 110-kDa position is indicated by an arrow. Lane 1, 2 μl of the protein standards; lane 2, 1 μg of the Mono-Q-purified RNAP holoenzyme (Peak 2); lane 3, 1 μg of the Mono-Q-purified fraction containing the RNAP holoenzyme and the 110-kDa RapA protein (Peak 3); lane 4, 0.2 μg of the purified α; lane 5, 0.2 μg of the purified β,β′; lane 6, 0.1 μg of the purified ς-70 subunit of RNAP; lane 7, 0.1 μg of the purified 110-kDa RapA protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The 110-kDa protein appears to be an integral component of RNAP because (i) it is associated with RNAP in nearly equimolar amounts, as estimated by quantitation of the Coomassie-stained protein bands on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels; (ii) there is a significant amount of the RNAP holoenzyme (20–30% in six independent protein purification procedures) associated with the 110-kDa protein; and (iii) almost all of the 110-kDa protein (>90%) from the cell is associated with RNAP, judging from the amount of this protein present during different stages of RNAP preparation, determined by immunoblotting using the 110-kDa protein-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig.3). Our results indicate that this 110-kDa protein is a novel RNAP-associatedprotein, and we name it RapA. RNAP containing the RapA protein is called RNAP·RapA hereafter. To study the biochemical properties of this new RapA protein, we separated the 110-kDa RapA protein from RNAP and purified it to homogeneity in two steps (Figs. 1 A and 4). The fractions containing RNAP holoenzyme and the 110-kDa RapA protein (Fig.1, Mono-Q-1, Peak 3) were first subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl Superose HR column (Fig. 4, A and B). The second peak eluted from the column was the 110-kDa RapA protein. Another chromatography on a Mono-Q column followed (Fig. 4, C and D), and the highly pure RapA protein was eluted as the first peak. In four repetitions of this purification procedure, about 100–250 μg of highly pure (>98%) RapA was obtained from 2–4 mg of the starting material. To obtain homogeneous RapA, the remaining contaminants (mostly RNAP) were removed by repeating the last purification step. We found that a stable RNAP·RapA complex can be reconstituted with highly purified 110-kDa RapA protein and RNAP holoenzyme in vitro. When the 110-kDa RapA protein and the RNAP holoenzyme were mixed and passed through a Superose 6 HR column (Pharmacia), they coeluted as a complex (Fig. 5 A). In control experiments, when these two proteins were applied separately to the column, RNAP and the 110-kDa RapA protein eluted at different fractions in gel filtration (Fig. 5, B and C). These results demonstrated that the 110-kDa RapA protein forms stable complex with RNAP, like a subunit of RNAP. Determination of the N-terminal sequence of the 110-kDa RapA protein showed that the first 10 N-terminal amino acid residues are: Pro-Phe-Thr-Leu-Gly-Gln-Arg-Trp-Ile-Val, a sequence whose only match is the corresponding region of the hepA ORF, located at 1.3 min on the E. coli linkage map. The E. coli hepA ORF (42Lewis L.K. Jenkins M.E. Mount D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Yura T. Mori H. Nagai H. Nagata T. Ishihama A. Fujita N. Isono K. Mizobuchi K. Nakata A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3305-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) is a putative ATP-dependent helicase (35Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Kolsto A. Bork P. Kvaloy K. Lindback T. Gronstadt A. Kristensen T. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 42Lewis L.K. Jenkins M.E. Mount D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3377-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with an expected molecular weight of 110-kDa. This hepA ORF is also homologous to the yeast SWI2/SNF2 protein (36Kolsto A. Bork P. Kvaloy K. Lindback T. Gronstadt A. Kristensen T. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We concluded that the hepA ORF encodes the 110-kDa RapA protein. Unlike eukaryotic SWI/SNF members, which form complexes with multiple polypeptides, this bacterial homolog RapA protein appears to be the only polypeptide that associate with RNAP during our purification procedure. Interestingly, yeast SWI/SNF complex is reported to be associated with RNA Pol II (44Wilson C.J. Chao D.M. Imbalzano A.N. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Young R.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), although a contradictory result is also reported (26Cairns B.R. Lorch Y. Li Y. Zhang M. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Du J. Laurent B. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1249-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Our finding that the RapA protein is an RNAP-associated protein suggests that association with RNAP is a common feature of this class of proteins. We found that RapA was capable of ATP hydrolysis (Fig.6). The ATPase activity of RapA was not affected by the presence of single-stranded DNA (lane 3), RNA (lane 4), or double-stranded DNA (lane 5). The ATPase activity of RapA was stimulated by the presence of RNAP (Fig. 6, lanes 10–13), which by itself did not hydrolyze ATP or did so very poorly (lanes 6–9). Thus, RNAP·RapA functions as an RNAP ATPase, a novel activity associated with RNAP. In the presence of poly(dA)·poly(dT), only RNAP·RapA exhibited RNA synthetic and ATP hydrolytic activities simultaneously (compare lane 13 to lanes 5 and 9), with the former being the predominant activity. The apparent kcat of ATP hydrolysis by RNAP·RapA increased more than 4-fold, while the Km for ATP changed very little (Table I). The stimulation of ATPase of other SWI/SNF members by RNAP has not been reported. The specific activities of the ATPases of RapA and RNAP·RapA were approximately 30 and 120 pmol of ADP released/min/microgram of RapA, respectively (Table II), values close to the yeast SWI/SNF ATPase (45Cote J.

RapA or RNAP·RapA was also able to hydrolyze dATP (Table II). the kcat for dATP hydrolysis was 30-fold higher than that of ATP (Table I). However, the Km for dATP was more than 8-fold higher than the Km for ATP, indicating that the affinity of RapA for dATP is much lower than that for ATP. The hydrolysis of dATP was enhanced by RNAP due to an increase in kcat (Table I). Because the concentration of ATP in the cell is about 10-fold higher than that of dATP (46Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7430-7438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that RNAP·RapA will use both ATP and dATP with similar efficiency. RapA or RNAP·RapA hydrolyzed other NTPs and dNTPs very poorly (Table II), a property similar to yeast RSC, another member of the SWI/SNF family (26Cairns B.R. Lorch Y. Li Y. Zhang M. Lacomis L.

RapA binds to single-stranded DNA, RNA, partial DNA-DNA, and DNA-RNA duplexes (TableIII). The Kd values of the complexes of RapA with different nucleic acids were similar, ranging from 15 to 30 μm with a relatively better binding to partial DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA duplexes. At present, we do not know whether the polynucleotide-binding activity of RapA is altered when it forms a complex with RNAP. Nucleic acid-binding activity has been reported for other members of the SWI/SNF family (26Cairns B.R. Lorch Y. Li Y. Zhang M. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Du J. Laurent B. Kornberg R.D.

However, when RapA preparations that contained even trace amounts of RNAP (<1%) were used, an apparent helicase activity was observed. RNAP alone was capable of unwinding model partial duplex DNA substrates used in helicase assays, and this activity was not enhanced by RapA (data not shown). So far, none of the members of the SWI/SNF2 family have shown helicase activity. In summary, we have identified a new RNAP-associated protein, RapA, in E. coli. This bacterial homolog of the SWI/SNF family interacts with RNAP both physically (binds to RNAP) and functionally (the ATPase of RapA is stimulated by RNAP). However, the effect of RapA on transcription using naked DNA templates (either linear or supercoiled) in vitro is not dramatic. Fig.7 illustrates a representative of such experiments showing at best moderate activation in overall transcription activity by RNAP·RapA when compared with RNAP itself. This moderate activation of transcription (∼150 to 200%) by RapA is independent of several promoters used, and the RapA protein has no effect on the rate of elongation and on the efficiency of termination at both ρ-independent and -dependent terminators (data not shown). Possibly, some factors are missing in our in vitro transcription system. At present, we do not know the role of RapA or RNAP·RapA in the cell. Apparently, the E. colicell that lacks a functional rapA gene is viable and able to utilize different sugars as carbon sources. 3M. V. Sukhodolets and D. J. Jin, unpublished results. Currently, we are studying the expression of rapA and the role of rapA under different conditions in the cell. Further study of this RapA protein and its gene is necessary to understand its function in E. coli.

The signaling pathways through which retinoids mediate this effect have not been defined. Normal HBE cell growth is stimulated by treatment with a variety of growth factors that increase mitogen-activated protein (MAP) activity. In this study, we examined MAP kinase-dependent pathways as potential targets of retinoid signaling and the role of MAP kinases in retinoid-induced c-fos gene regulation. All-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) inhibited Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and, to a lesser extent, extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity in normal HBE cells. t-RA reduced c-fos mRNA and protein levels by decreasing c-fos gene transcription. The c-fospromoter was activated by co-transfection with a constitutively active JNK kinase (SEK)-1 and suppressed by a dominant negative JNK kinase kinase (MEKK)-1. Furthermore, c-fos expression was inhibited by agonists of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) or retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and suppression of c-fos promoter activity by t-RA was abrogated by treatment with antagonists of RAR-α or of all the RXRs. These findings provide the first evidence that t-RA inhibits JNK activity and demonstrate a potential role of JNK-dependent pathways in the suppression of c-fos expression by t-RA. Furthermore, c-fosexpression was inhibited through activation of RAR- and RXR-dependent signaling pathways.

Proteinase K treatment was repeated followed by phenol/chloroform extraction, NH3OAc/EtOH precipitation. The RNA pellet was resuspended in water, and incorporation of 32P was quantitated with a scintillation counter. The c-fos and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs and the c-fos expression vector with no insert (negative control) were immobilized on nylon membranes (5 μg/mm2) by slot-blot and prehybridized (5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 50% deionized formamide, 200 mg/ml tRNA, and 500 mg/ml single-stranded DNA) at 42 °C for 2 h. The RNA was boiled for 3 min, chilled on ice, added to hybridization solution (the same as the prehybridization solution) in sufficient quantity to cover the slot-blot membrane at a concentration of 6.6 × 107cpm/ml, and incubated at 42 °C for 48 h. The membranes were washed to a stringency of 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C and autoradiographed. We examined the effect of t-RA treatment on MAP kinase activity in normal HBE cells. ERK and JNK activity were detected in normal HBE cells, and t-RA inhibited the activity of JNK and, to a lesser extent, ERK (Fig. 1 A). Densitometric analysis revealed that at 24 h of t-RA treatment, JNK and ERK activities were 11 and 71%, respectively, of untreated cells. Transient co-transfection experiments were performed using reporter plasmids containing GAL4-response elements (GAL-UAS-LUC) and expression vectors containing the GAL4-DBD fused with the transcriptional activating domain of Elk-1 (Elk-GAL-DBD) or c-jun(Jun-GAL-DBD). GAL-UAS-LUC was activated by Elk-GAL-DBD and Jun-GAL-DBD, and t-RA inhibited 40% of the activity induced by Jun-GAL-DBD but not Elk-GAL-DBD (Fig. 1 B). These findings demonstrate a prominent inhibition of JNK activity by t-RA treatment. ERK- and JNK-dependent signaling pathways activate c-fos expression (27Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks I. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 28Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined changes in c-fos levels with t-RA treatment. c-Fos protein levels were inhibited by t-RA in normal HBE cells (Fig.2 A). Moreover, t-RA decreased c-fos mRNA levels both time and dose dependently (Fig.2, B and C). The effect of t-RA on c-fos gene transcription was examined. Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that t-RA decreased c-fos gene transcription (Fig. 3 A). Transient transfection assays with reporter plasmids containing the c-fos promoter fragment from −327 to +40 in sense (fos-LUC) or antisense (sof-LUC) orientation demonstrated that t-RA sup- pressed fos-LUC activity, and this effect was dependent on t-RA dose (Fig. 3 B). These findings reveal that t-RA suppressed c-fos gene transcription through proximal c-fos promoter elements.Figure 3Nuclear run-on analysis (A) was performed on normal HBE cells treated for 6 h with 10−6m t-RA (+) or media alone (−). RNAs were hybridized to cDNAs for c-fos, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to examine relative amounts of RNA loading, or vector containing no c-fos cDNA (vector) to examine nonspecific hybridization. Transient transfection assays (B) were performed on normal HBE cells transfected with reporter plasmids containing the c-fos promoter in sense (fos-LUC) or antisense (sof-LUC) orientation. Transfectants were treated for 24 h with the indicated doses of t-RA or media alone. The results represent the means and standard deviations of luciferase values from five identical wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The role of MAP kinase-dependent pathways in the regulation of c-fos promoter activity was examined. Transient co-transfection assays with fos-LUC and expression vectors containing constitutively active mutant MEK-1 or JNK kinase (SEK)-1 revealed that fos-LUC was minimally activated by MEK-1 and to a greater extent by SEK-1 (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of normal HBE cells with the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 suppressed ERK activity but had no measurable effect on fos-LUC activity (data not shown). Co-transfection of an expression vector containing a dominant negative mutant JNK kinase kinase (MEKK)-1 inhibited fos-LUC activity (Fig. 4 B). Assays of JNK and ERK activities in normal HBE cells transiently transfected with the dominant negative mutant MEKK-1 expression vector revealed selective inhibition of JNK activity (Fig.4 C). These findings support a role for JNK-dependent pathways in the regulation of c-fos promoter activity. Retinoids induce signaling events through nuclear receptor activation. The potential roles of RAR- and RXR-dependent pathways were investigated in the suppression of c-fos expression. Normal HBE cells express all RAR and RXR gene family members (29Kim Y-H. Dohi D.F. Han G.R. Zou C-P. Oridate N. Walsh G.L. Nesbitt J.C. Xu X-C. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Kurie J.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5603-5610PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with RAR- (TTNPB) or RXR (SR11235)-selective agonists inhibited c-fos mRNA levels and activation of the c-fospromoter (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that activation of RAR- and RXR-dependent pathways inhibited c-fosexpression through suppression of proximal c-fos promoter elements. Furthermore, treatment with antagonists of RAR-α (LG100629) or of all the RXRs (LG100754) partially abrogated the inhibition of c-fos promoter activity by t-RA (Fig. 5 C), providing evidence that t-RA inhibited c-fos promoter activity through RAR- and RXR-dependent signaling pathways. In this study, we examined the effect of t-RA treatment on MAP kinase-dependent signaling pathways and the role of these pathways in t-RA-induced c-fos gene regulation. Our findings provide the first evidence that t-RA inhibits JNK and, to a lesser extent, ERK activity. Furthermore, we showed that t-RA suppressed c-fos mRNA and protein levels through a reduction in c-fos gene transcription. Previous studies have shown that t-RA inhibits c-fos gene transcription (37Perez P. Palomino T. Schönthal A. Aranda A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38Talmage D.A. Listerud M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3557-3563PubMed Google Scholar), but the signaling pathways through which t-RA mediates this effect have not been examined. The c-fos promoter is activated by both ERK- and JNK-dependent pathways through activation of the ternary complex factor (27Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks I. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 28Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we observed activation of the c-fos promoter by both MEK- and JNK-dependent pathways. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK-dependent pathways by transfection of a dominant negative mutant JNK kinase kinase (MEKK)-1 was sufficient to suppress c-fos promoter activity. These findings support the hypothesis that JNK inhibition contributes to retinoid-induced suppression of c-fos expression. While the suppression of JNK activity was more profound, ERK inhibition may also contribute to the inhibition in c-fos expression in t-RA-treated normal HBE cells. Retinoid actions are mediated through nuclear receptor activation. RAR- and RXR-selective retinoids have distinct biologic effects on cells in tissue culture (39Nagy L. Thomazy V.A. Shipley G.L. Fesus L. Lamph W. Heyman R.A. Chandraratna R.A.S. Davies P.J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3540-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), suggesting that they activate different signaling pathways. Consistent with this notion, RAR- and RXR-selective retinoids can regulate the expression of distinct target genes or have opposing effects on the same target gene (40Hembree J.R. Agarwal C. Beard R.L. Chandraratna R.A.S. Eckert R.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1794-1799PubMed Google Scholar, 41Vu-dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Heyman R.A. Steals B. Auwerx J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3350-3360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both RAR- and RXR-selective agonists inhibited c-fos expression in this study, suggesting that RAR- and RXR-dependent pathways share certain signaling events. Supporting this possibility, both RAR- and RXR-selective agonists inhibit the squamous differentiation of HBE cells (42Lee H-Y. Dawson M.I. Walsh G, L. Nesbitt J.C. Eckert R.L. Fuchs E. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Kurie J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 997-1004PubMed Google Scholar). This appears to be at least partly the result of the suppressive effects of these retinoids on the AP-1 transcription factor, which binds to the AP-1 sites in the promoters of a variety of genes required for the induction of HBE squamous differentiation, activating their expression (42Lee H-Y. Dawson M.I. Walsh G, L. Nesbitt J.C. Eckert R.L. Fuchs E. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Kurie J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 997-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that an RAR-α antagonist abrogated the effect of t-RA on the c-fospromoter, supporting a role for RAR-α in the inhibition of c-fos expression. In addition to reducing c-fosexpression, RAR-α also activates the expression of transforming growth factor-β and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 in normal HBE cells (43Han G.-R. Dohi D.F. Lee H.-Y. Rajah R. Walsh G.L. Hong W.K. Cohen P. Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13711-13716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, an RXR antagonist that blocks activation of RXR homodimers abrogated the inhibition of c-fos promoter activity by t-RA. t-RA does not transcriptionally activate RXRs (reviewed in Ref. 10Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar). A potential explanation for this finding is that t-RA can undergo stereoisomerization intracellularly to 9-cis-retinoic acid (44Urbach J. Rando R.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and thus activate RXR-dependent signaling, which the RXR antagonist would block. Mechanisms by which retinoid receptors suppress c-fosexpression have not been elucidated. Retinoid receptors modulate gene expression directly by binding to response elements within gene promoters and indirectly by binding to other transcription factors. The c-fos promoter from −327 to +40 (45Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19583-19592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains a variety of response elements that regulate its activity, including binding sites for cAMP response element-binding protein, STAT factors, YY-1, AP-1, and the ternary complex, but there are no consensus retinoid response elements (AGGTCA repeats separated by 1, 2, or 5 nucleotides), suggesting that retinoid receptors do not bind directly to this portion of the c-fos promoter. We demonstrated a potential role for JNK-dependent pathways in the suppression of c-fos expression by t-RA, supporting an indirect interaction of retinoid receptors with the c-fos promoter through JNK-dependent signaling pathways. Interactions between retinoid receptors and MAP kinase pathways have been not described. The estrogen receptor is phosphorylated through MAP kinase-dependent pathways, enhancing estrogen receptor transcriptional activity (46Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar), which provides a precedent for investigating interactions between retinoid receptors and components of MAP kinase signaling pathways. Normal HBE cells secrete a variety of peptide growth factors that stimulate growth through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (9Miller L.A. Cheng L.Z. Wu R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2527-2533PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lechner J.F. LaVeck M.A. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1985; 9: 43-48Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It is possible that the growth of normal HBE cells is dependent upon MAP kinase activation by endogenous and exogenous growth factors. This notion is supported by the observation that withdrawal of EGF or bovine pituitary extract, which contains a number of peptide growth factors, from the media attenuates the growth of normal HBE cells (9Miller L.A. Cheng L.Z. Wu R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2527-2533PubMed Google Scholar). We and others previously showed that treatment with t-RA inhibits normal HBE cell growth, and interruption of an autocrine growth stimulus contributed to the growth inhibition induced by t-RA (9Miller L.A. Cheng L.Z. Wu R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2527-2533PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kim Y-H. Dohi D.F. Han G.R. Zou C-P. Oridate N. Walsh G.L. Nesbitt J.C. Xu X-C. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Kurie J.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5603-5610PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of JNK or other components of growth factor-dependent signaling pathways may be an important mechanism by which retinoids inhibit the growth of normal HBE cells, and future work will examine this possibility."
https://openalex.org/W2071020235,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a neutrophil lysosomal hemeprotein essential for optimal oxygen-dependent microbicidal activity. We have demonstrated previously that calreticulin, a luminal endoplasmic reticulum protein, functions as a molecular chaperone during myeloperoxidase biosynthesis, associating reversibly with the heme-free precursor apopro-MPO. Because the membrane-bound endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin is structurally and functionally related to calreticulin, we assessed the role of calnexin in myeloperoxidase biosynthesis. Like calreticulin, calnexin coprecipitated exclusively with glycosylated MPO precursors and with apopro-MPO but, in contrast to calreticulin, also with the enzymatically active, heme-containing precursor pro-MPO. To determine if calnexin participated in heme insertion into MPO, we compared the kinetics of chaperone association with MPO precursors using stable transfectants expressing cDNA encoding wild type MPO or mutated forms that do not acquire heme. Transfectants expressing mutant cDNA had prolonged association of MPO-related precursors with calreticulin and especially with calnexin. These studies demonstrate that 1) both calreticulin and calnexin associated with glycosylated apopro-MPO; 2) only calnexin associated selectively with the enzymatically active, heme-containing precursor pro-MPO; and 3) mutants unable to incorporate heme had prolonged association with calnexin. These findings represent the first evidence of a specialized role for calnexin in facilitating protein maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum of myeloid cells.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO 1The abbreviations used are: MPO, myeloperoxidase; CRT, calreticulin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CLN, calnexin. 1The abbreviations used are: MPO, myeloperoxidase; CRT, calreticulin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CLN, calnexin.; donor: H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7) is a heme-containing lysosomal protein present exclusively in cells of neutrophil and monocyte lineage (1Klebanoff S.J. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-36Google Scholar). In concert with hydrogen peroxide generated by the NADPH-dependent oxidase, MPO is a critical component of the most efficient microbicidal system in human neutrophils (1Klebanoff S.J. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-36Google Scholar).Biosynthesis of MPO is restricted to the promyelocyte stage in myeloid development and has been studied extensively using human promyelocytic cell lines (for review, see Refs. 2Nauseef W.M.

Haematol. 1997; 58: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We reported previously that calreticulin (CRT), a high capacity, low affinity calcium-binding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 5Meldolesi J. Krause K.H. Michalak M. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), interacts transiently with apopro-MPO, the heme-free protein precursor of MPO (6Nauseef W.M. McCormick S.J. Clark R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Based on these studies we suggested that CRT functions as a molecular chaperone during MPO biosynthesis. Several studies have confirmed the ability of CRT to function in a similar fashion in the biosynthesis of a variety of unrelated proteins (for review, see Ref.7Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar).Calnexin (CLN), a membrane-bound molecular chaperone located in the ER, shares significant structural and functional features with CRT (8Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 9Williams D.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The regions of greatest similarity between CRT and CLN are those that extend into the lumen of the ER (8Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 10Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty III, J.J.

Biochem. 1994; 135: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and thus most likely to contribute to their shared capacity to interact with nascent glycoproteins. Published studies of the role of CRT and CLN in the biosynthesis of a given protein have not identified any functional differences in their capacity as molecular chaperones (7Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We undertook these studies to determine to what extent CLN participated in MPO biosynthesis and if there were significant differences between these interactions and those we had observed previously between apopro-MPO and CRT.DISCUSSIONMPO is the only heme or lysosomal protein demonstrated to date to associate with molecular chaperones during its biosynthesis (7Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, as with many other glycoproteins, quality control during its biosynthesis is mediated by transient association with ER resident proteins. The data presented here indicate that, like several other glycoproteins, precursors of MPO associated sequentially with different ER resident proteins, in this case two structurally similar proteins, CRT and CLN.In specific situations in which they have been compared, CRT and CLN have shown striking similarity in the substrates to which they bind (23Ware F.E.

Several studies have demonstrated sequential interactions of the folding intermediates of the same protein with CRT and CLN during its biosynthetic maturation (37Sadasivan B.K. Cariappa A.

Despite these similarities between CRT and CLN, we found evidence of functional discrimination in their ability to interact with biosynthetic precursors of MPO in the ER. In the case of CRT, only glycosylated apopro-MPO associated in a complex; heme-containing pro-MPO or mature MPO subunits did not coprecipitate with CRT under any conditions. CLN, on the other hand, bound not only apopro-MPO but also pro-MPO; as with CRT, neither subunit of mature MPO coprecipitated with CLN. Furthermore, mutations that inhibited the insertion of heme into the peptide backbone of apopro-MPO, R569W and H502, resulted in prolonged association of CLN and the mutant apopro-MPO. CLN may be subserving an ER “quality control” function for MPO biosynthesis, as these two particular mutations may have produced significant misfolding. As a result, the misfolded precursor would be unable to accommodate heme and would associate with CLN in a more stable complex. Alternatively, these findings may indicate that heme insertion is necessary for the normal dissociation of CLN from MPO precursors. Our studies cannot distinguish between these two possible interpretations of the findings.The active site in MPO is unusual and has been the subject of considerable study in the past (36Jacquet A.

On a broader level, the data may suggest that CLN serves a highly specialized function, i.e. to facilitate insertion of the prosthetic group into a hemeprotein, a function previously not attributed to molecular chaperones in the ER and not shared by the structurally related ER protein CRT. Myeloperoxidase (MPO 1The abbreviations used are: MPO, myeloperoxidase; CRT, calreticulin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CLN, calnexin. 1The abbreviations used are: MPO, myeloperoxidase; CRT, calreticulin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CLN, calnexin.; donor: H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7) is a heme-containing lysosomal protein present exclusively in cells of neutrophil and monocyte lineage (1Klebanoff S.J. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-36Google Scholar). In concert with hydrogen peroxide generated by the NADPH-dependent oxidase, MPO is a critical component of the most efficient microbicidal system in human neutrophils (1Klebanoff S.J. Everse J. Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-36Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of MPO is restricted to the promyelocyte stage in myeloid development and has been studied extensively using human promyelocytic cell lines (for review, see Refs. 2Nauseef W.M. Olsson I.

Haematol. 1997; 58: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We reported previously that calreticulin (CRT), a high capacity, low affinity calcium-binding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (4Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4741-4747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Based on these studies we suggested that CRT functions as a molecular chaperone during MPO biosynthesis. Several studies have confirmed the ability of CRT to function in a similar fashion in the biosynthesis of a variety of unrelated proteins (for review, see Ref.7Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Calnexin (CLN), a membrane-bound molecular chaperone located in the ER, shares significant structural and functional features with CRT (8Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B.

The regions of greatest similarity between CRT and CLN are those that extend into the lumen of the ER (8Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem.

Published studies of the role of CRT and CLN in the biosynthesis of a given protein have not identified any functional differences in their capacity as molecular chaperones (7Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We undertook these studies to determine to what extent CLN participated in MPO biosynthesis and if there were significant differences between these interactions and those we had observed previously between apopro-MPO and CRT. DISCUSSIONMPO is the only heme or lysosomal protein demonstrated to date to associate with molecular chaperones during its biosynthesis (7Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, as with many other glycoproteins, quality control during its biosynthesis is mediated by transient association with ER resident proteins. The data presented here indicate that, like several other glycoproteins, precursors of MPO associated sequentially with different ER resident proteins, in this case two structurally similar proteins, CRT and CLN.In specific situations in which they have been compared, CRT and CLN have shown striking similarity in the substrates to which they bind (23Ware F.E.

Despite these similarities between CRT and CLN, we found evidence of functional discrimination in their ability to interact with biosynthetic precursors of MPO in the ER. In the case of CRT, only glycosylated apopro-MPO associated in a complex; heme-containing pro-MPO or mature MPO subunits did not coprecipitate with CRT under any conditions. CLN, on the other hand, bound not only apopro-MPO but also pro-MPO; as with CRT, neither subunit of mature MPO coprecipitated with CLN. Furthermore, mutations that inhibited the insertion of heme into the peptide backbone of apopro-MPO, R569W and H502, resulted in prolonged association of CLN and the mutant apopro-MPO. CLN may be subserving an ER “quality control” function for MPO biosynthesis, as these two particular mutations may have produced significant misfolding. As a result, the misfolded precursor would be unable to accommodate heme and would associate with CLN in a more stable complex. Alternatively, these findings may indicate that heme insertion is necessary for the normal dissociation of CLN from MPO precursors. Our studies cannot distinguish between these two possible interpretations of the findings.The active site in MPO is unusual and has been the subject of considerable study in the past (36Jacquet A.

https://openalex.org/W2084767220,"The V1a arginine vasopressin receptor (V1aR) expressed in HEK 293 cells was phosphorylated after binding to arginine vasopressin (AVP). The phosphate was incorporated very rapidly into the protein but remained attached for a very short time despite the continuous presence of hormone. The extent of phosphorylation depended upon the concentration of AVP suggesting the involvement of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases. Protein kinase C (PKC) contributed to V1aR phosphorylation as demonstrated by the fact that inhibition of the kinase decreased the amount of phosphate incorporated into the receptor. However, PKC activity was not responsible for the transient nature of V1aR phosphorylation. The hormone-free receptor could be phosphorylated by phorbol ester-activated PKC. Although the phosphorylation was transient, the phosphate groups incorporated remained on the receptor protein longer than those incorporated after AVP treatment. PKC phosphorylation of unoccupied V1aR was not sufficient to promote sequestration. Vasopressin also promoted sequestration of about 80% of the surface receptor, but measurements of the rate of accumulation of inositol phosphates in the sustained presence of the ligand did not reveal a significant desensitization of coupling to phospholipase C activity. The addition of a V1aR antagonist inhibited the sustained accumulation of inositol phosphates establishing that the sustained stimulation of PLC was mediated by receptors located on the cell surface. The transient character of V1aR phosphorylation seemed intrinsic to the receptor protein rather than a consequence of signaling within the cell, and receptor sequestration appeared to be responsible for the desensitization observed in HEK 293 cells.

Agonist binding and activation of many G-protein-coupled receptors is followed by desensitization, an attenuation of the cellular response to the ligand that prevents sustained stimulation. Studies with rhodopsin and the β2-adrenergic receptor have implicated phosphorylation in receptor desensitization (1Bennett N. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 2Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar) Receptor phosphorylation promotes the binding of arrestin, which in turn uncouples the receptor from the G-protein and enhances sequestration. In the particular case of the β2-adrenergic receptor, it has been postulated that sequestration of the phosphorylated receptor facilitates cleavage of the phosphate groups by phosphatases that associate with the endosomes and allows the recycling of the de-phosphorylated active protein to the cell surface (3Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Data obtained with other G-protein-coupled receptors have indicated that phosphorylation is not required to observe receptor sequestration and desensitization. For example, a truncated form of the V2 vasopressin receptor lacking the phosphorylation acceptor sites at the carboxyl-terminal end was sequestered and desensitized, although to a lesser extent than the wild type receptor (4Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Eberle A.N. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2486-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similarly, a mutant angiotensin II receptor missing a portion of the carboxyl terminus did not exhibit ligand-induced sequestration although it contained a putative GRK 1The abbreviations used are: GRKs, G-protein-coupled receptor kinases; V1aR, V1a arginine vasopressin receptor; AVP, arginine vasopressin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; D-PBS, Dulbecco's PBS; HBSS, Hanks' buffered saline solution; IP, inositol phosphates; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; TyrPhaa, phenylacetyl-d-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Val-Asn-Lys-Pro-Tyr-NH2; r, receptor; CCK, cholecystokinin. phosphorylation site (5Thomas W.G.

Different kinds of protein kinases can be responsible for receptor phosphorylation. Those that phosphorylate the receptor occupied by agonist are termed G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), of which six have been identified up to now (2Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of GRK1 and GRK4, found in the retina and in testis, respectively, the other enzymes are present in most tissues and seem to catalyze in an agonist-dependent manner the phosphorylation of all the receptors of this family that have been tested until now. Receptors can also be phosphorylated by other kinases such as the cAMP-dependent and the Ca2+-dependent (PKC) protein kinases. These enzymes can be activated by an increase in second messengers and may contribute to reduce receptor activity. Some receptors can be substrates to multiple kinases, while others, exemplified by the V2 vasopressin receptor, serve as substrates to a single type of kinases, the GRKs (4Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.

Kidney Int. 1988; 26: 38-42Google Scholar). Whereas the V2 receptor stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity, the V1a and V1b receptor subtypes activate phospholipases A2, C, and D. Previous studies in hepatocytes and in smooth muscle vascular cells have described ligand-induced desensitization and sequestration of the V1a vasopressin receptor (V1aR), as well as its recycling to the cell surface following removal of the ligand (7Fishman J.B. Dickey B.F. Bucher N.L. Fine R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12641-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Briner V.A. Williams B. Tsai P. Schrier R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2854-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, data regarding V1aR phosphorylation and its relationship to receptor desensitization are lacking. The availability of the V1aR cDNA (9Morel A. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 10Innamorati G. Lolait S.J. Birnbaumer M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 710-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) has enabled the examination of whether the V1aR is phosphorylated and the characteristics of this process. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), minimum essential medium without sodium phosphate, Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS), penicillin/streptomycin, Geneticin (G418), 0.5% trypsin, 5 mm EDTA, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc.; methionine/cysteine-free DMEM was from ICN, Costa Mesa, CA; cell culture plasticware was from Costar, Cambridge, MA. [3H]Arginine vasopressin (specific activity 60–80 Ci/mmol), Expre35S35S protein labeling mix (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol), and [32P]H3PO4 in water (pH 5–7) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Amplify® was from Amersham Corp. Okadaic acid was from RBI (Natick, MA). Phenylacetyl-d-Tyr(Et)-Phe-Val-Asn-Lys-Pro-Tyr-NH2(TyrPhaa) was from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA); AVP, staurosporine and all other reagents were from Sigma. The hemagglutinin epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was introduced using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach (11Birnbaumer M.S. Gilbert S. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 886-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting construct was sequenced fully by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar). For expression in eucaryotic cells, the cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Boston, MA). HEK 293 cells were grown in DMEM-high glucose, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were plated at a density of 2.8 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected the following day by a modification of the method of Luthman and Magnusson (13Luthman H. Magnusson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Growth medium was replaced with 6.7 ml of a mixture of 100 μm chloroquine and 0.25 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 3 μg of DNA. After 2 h at 37 °C, the solution was removed, and the cells were treated for 1 min at room temperature with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in PBS. The cells were rinsed with PBS and returned to growth medium at 37 °C. Measurements were done 48 h after transfection. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique of Graham and Van der Eb (14Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) as described previously. The day before transfection, 1.2 × 106 cells were plated into each of two 100-mm dishes. The DNA-calcium phosphate co-precipitate, containing 10 μg of DNA, was prepared immediately before use; all reagents were at 37 °C. The reagents were mixed in a 15-ml sterile polystyrene tube in the following order: 10–100 μl of DNA in 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; sterile H2O to bring the volume to 900 μl; 1 ml of 250 mm CaCl2, 100 μl of 15 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl; 5 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.05 with NaOH. All reagents were added dropwise slowly, with gentle mixing after each addition. After 10 min at room temperature, half of the whitish suspension was added dropwise to each plate containing cells and mixed by gentle swirling. After 18 h in the incubator, the medium was removed, and cells were treated with 2 ml of 25% glycerol in HBSS at 37 °C. After 1 min the glycerol/HBSS mixture was diluted with 10 ml of HBSS, added slowly with continuous mixing. The solution was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed once with HBSS. Fresh medium was then added, and the plates were returned to the incubator. The next day the cells were trypsinized, diluted with the selection medium containing 400 μg/ml G418, and distributed into two 96-well microtitration plates (2000–4000 cells/well), using a Costar transplate device. G418-resistant clones were picked after 16–18 days and expanded in 6-well plates to assay for hormone binding as described below. Cells were plated at a density of 2–4 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates pretreated for 1 h with 0.1 mg/ml polylysine. Binding assays were performed the following day. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold D-PBS after which each well received 0.5 ml of ice-cold D-PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and the appropriate dilution of [3H]AVP. Plates were incubated for 2 h on top of crushed ice in the cold room before removal of the binding mixture by aspiration. After quickly rinsing twice with ice-cold D-PBS, 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH was added to each well to extract bound radioactivity. After 30 min at 37 °C, the fluid from the wells was transferred to scintillation vials containing 3.5 ml of ULTIMA-FLO M (Packard Instrument Co.) scintillation fluid for radioassay. Nonspecific binding was determined under the same conditions in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled AVP (11Birnbaumer M.S. Gilbert S. Rosenthal W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 886-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed at least three times. Accumulation of inositol phosphates was measured by a modification of the method of Hung et al. (15Hung D.T. Vu T.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Stably transfected cells were grown in 12-well tissue culture plates in selection medium supplemented with 2 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol. Labeled cells were rinsed three times at room temperature with 1 ml of D-PBS supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2. After washing, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of the aforementioned solution before 10 μl of 1 m LiCl were added to each well. The incubation was continued for 10 min, after which 0.5 ml of the same solution containing the ligand was added to the wells. The incubation was continued for the indicated times at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation the supernatant was removed rapidly by turning the plates upside down, and the plates were immediately chilled by placing them over a mixture of ethanol and dry ice followed by the addition of 0.75 ml of ice-cold 20 mm formic acid to each well. Inositol phosphates (IPs) produced were separated from myo-inositol according to a simplified Dowex chromatography procedure described in Ref. 15Hung D.T. Vu T.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar. Briefly, after 1 h on ice, the 20 mm formic acid extracts were applied to Dowex columns (Bio-Rad AG 1-X8, 100–200 mesh, formate form, 0.6 cm diameter, 1.0-ml bed volume) that had been pretreated sequentially with 2 mammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid, water, and 20 mm ammonium hydroxide adjusted to pH 9.0 with formic acid. Immediately after the samples were loaded, 3 ml of 40 mmammonium hydroxide, pH 9.0, were added to each column, and the eluates (∼3.75 ml) were collected in scintillation vials containing 10 ml of scintillation fluid. When standard myo-inositol was subjected to this procedure 98% of the radioactivity was recovered in this eluate. The columns were than washed three times with 4 ml of 40 mm ammonium formate, and IPs were eluted with 5 ml of 2m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid, into scintillation vials containing 15 ml of ULTIMA-FLO M scintillation fluid (Packard Instrument Co.). The accumulation of IPs was normalized by dividing the counts for [3H]IPs by the sum of the counts for myo-[3H]inositol plus [3H]IPs. No 3H-containing phospholipids were expected in the eluates as mentioned by Zhu et al. (16Zhu X. Gilbert S. Birnbaumer M. Birnbaumer L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 460-469PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to 100 nm AVP at 37 °C in minimum essential medium without sodium phosphate for the phosphorylation experiments and in DMEM-high glucose for all the other experiments. Prior to the binding assay cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, twice for 40 s with an ice-cold solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmacetic acid, followed by three washes with ice-cold PBS to ensure removal of the ligand and restoration of the pH. Transiently or stably transfected cells were plated in 6-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well). The following day, the cells were washed and incubated for 30 min with phosphate-free minimal essential medium, followed by the addition of 100 μCi/well [32P]H3PO4. After 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were exposed to vasopressin or other agents for the times and concentrations described in the text. Cells were then chilled, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in 300 μl of RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 300 nm okadaic acid). Solubilization was helped by sonication with an XL2020 Misonix Inc (Farmingdale, NY) sonicator at an output power of 440 watts. Three 30-s pulses were applied at intervals of 30 s each. Cell extracts were clarified by the addition of 50 μl of a 50% slurry of prewashed protein A-Sepharose® (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in RIPA for 30 min and centrifugation. Prewashed protein A-Sepharose was prepared by treating for 1 h with 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in RIPA, followed by two washes in RIPA alone. The clarified extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 9 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 12CA5, and the antigen-antibody complexes were separated by incubating with prewashed protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged and washed 5 times with 800 μl of RIPA, recovering them after each wash by centrifugation. The proteins were eluted from the beads for 20 min at room temperature with 80 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by exposing the dried gels to Kodak BMR. Quantification of the 32P incorporated into proteins was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). Identical rectangles containing the bands of interest were drawn to circumscribe the areas to be integrated. Unless otherwise indicated, the values were expressed as percent of the phosphorylation obtained by treating for 1 min with 100 nm AVP; each experiment was performed with duplicate samples. The day after plating, the cells in 100-mm dishes were starved for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM high glucose, followed by 2 h labeling in the same medium containing 100 μCi of Expre35S35S Protein Labeling Mix/plate. Cells were then rinsed, and the receptor was extracted and immunoprecipitated as described above. The bands were visualized by treating the gels with Amplify® followed by fluorography of the dried gels. The values obtained with the PhosphorImager, the binding data, and the IP accumulation data were fitted by the least square method using logistic function. The minimization of the square differences was calculated with the function Solver in Microsoft Excel 5.0 C. The values of t½Kd, Bmax, and EC50 were obtained from the fitting curves. Stably transfected HEK-293 cells expressing the tagged V1aR were selected by measuring AVP binding. Metabolic labeling with [35S]Met/Cys of one of the positive clones, followed by extraction and immunoprecipitation of the receptor with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures,” allowed the characterization of the migration of the V1aR protein in SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1, a single broad band migrating between 62 and 76 kDa (V1aR) was detected by autoradiography in samples immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK 293 cells. The band was not present in naive HEK 293 cells (C). The V1aR has a predicted molecular mass of 45,500 daltons and contains three consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (9Morel A. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar); thus, the apparent larger mass of the receptor was consistent with the presence of glycosylated sites. To examine whether addition of the epitope had altered receptor function, saturation binding assays were performed on intact cells. The ligand binding affinity obtained was 8.5 ± 2 nm, similar to the value reported by Fishman et al. (7Fishman J.B. Dickey B.F. Bucher N.L. Fine R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12641-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the V1aR present in cultured hepatocytes. The Bmax for clone HEK-V1aR-40 was estimated at 527,000 ± 76,000 sites/cell, and the EC50 of vasopressin-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation was 4 nm, similar to values reported for the rat V1aR present in WRK1 cells (17Jard S. Guillon G. Balestre M.N. Kirk C. WRK 1 Cardiovas. Pharmacol. 1986; 8: 12-17Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To test whether activation by ligand resulted in receptor phosphorylation, clonal cells expressing the V1aR were incubated with 32P to label their nucleotide pools and then exposed to hormone. Cell membrane proteins were extracted at different times following addition of 100 nm AVP, and the receptor was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fig.2 A illustrates the time course of phosphorylation of the V1aR. A significant amount of 32P was found incorporated into the receptor prior to the addition of hormone; this radioactivity accounted for as much as 36 ± 2.5% of the phosphorylation observed after a 1-min treatment with AVP, and it will be referred to as basal phosphorylation. Following a very fast increase in 32P incorporation, already maximal at the shortest time analyzed (15 s), the receptor became rapidly dephosphorylated despite the continuous presence of AVP. The estimated t½ of dephosphorylation was 6 min. After approximately 30 min, the amount of 32P incorporated into the receptor had returned to basal levels. Equilibration of the cells with 300 nm okadaic acid 10 min prior to the addition of AVP did not prevent the dephosphorylation of the receptor (data not shown). As shown by the dose-response curve in Fig. 2 B, the extent of V1aR phosphorylation was dependent on the amount of AVP present. The dependence of phosphorylation on hormone concentration was examined after 1-min exposure of the cells to different concentrations of AVP. Ligand-promoted phosphorylation not only increased the amount of32P in the V1aR, it also changed the migration of the receptor protein in SDS-PAGE as seen with the receptor protein labeled with [35S]methionine, as shown in Fig. 1. Addition of 100 nm AVP promoted the rapid loss of 80% of the binding sites from the cell surface with a t½ = 1 min, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This rapid internalization is comparable to what had been reported in rat hepatocytes (7Fishman J.B. Dickey B.F. Bucher N.L. Fine R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12641-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it reveals a temporal correlation between phosphorylation and ligand-induced internalization of the V1aR. The V1aR contains several consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation, and receptor signaling activates this enzyme by increasing diacylglycerol and intracellular Ca2+in the cell. Thus, it was relevant to investigate the involvement of PKC in the phosphorylation of the receptor promoted by AVP. Treatment of 32P-labeled cells with 100 nm PMA for 1 min, to stimulate PKC activity, doubled the level of receptor phosphorylation demonstrating that PKC could phosphorylate the unoccupied receptor. After 1 min of PMA treatment the phosphorylation obtained was 46 ± 1% of the response stimulated by AVP, and it could be completely blocked by treating the cells with 1 μm of the PKC inhibitor staurosporine. As illustrated in Fig. 4 A, following the addition of PMA there was a slow increase in receptor phosphorylation that reached values similar to those obtained with AVP 10 min after addition of the reagent. This was followed by a slow decrease of the radioactivity incorporated into the protein. Treatment of the cells with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin also resulted in the transient phosphorylation of the V1aR presumably by activating PKC. Phosphorylation of unoccupied V1aR stimulated by PMA did not result in a loss of binding sites from the cell surface at any of the times analyzed as shown in Fig. 4 B. Thus, PKC phosphorylation by itself was not sufficient to promote receptor sequestration. Treatment of the cells with 100 nm vasoactive intestinal peptide or 10 μm forskolin did not promote incorporation of radioactivity into the V1aR ruling out a role for protein kinase A in receptor phosphorylation (data not shown). The consequences of inhibiting or down-regulating PKC in V1aR phosphorylation were also investigated. As illustrated in Fig.5, treatment of cells with 1 μm staurosporine reduced by 43 ± 3% the AVP-stimulated incorporation of 32P into the receptor without changing the basal level of phosphorylation. The consequences of treating the cells overnight with 10 μm PMA to down-regulate PKC activity are shown in Fig.6. After the PMA treatment, AVP-promoted phosphorylation of the receptor was 40 ± 4% of the increase over the basal level detected in cells not treated with PMA, but it remained transient. The fact that inactivation of PKC by staurosporine or by overnight treatment with PMA did not prevent rapid loss of phosphate from the V1aR suggested that phosphorylation of the sites modified by PKC did not play a role in the lability of the phosphate groups incorporated into the receptor protein possibly by GRKs.Figure 6Effect of PKC down-regulation on V1aR phosphorylation. Cells expressing the epitope-tagged V1aR were used for this experiment. After overnight treatment with 10 μm PMA to down-regulate PKC, treated and control cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and exposed to 100 nm AVP for the times indicated. The receptor was isolated by immunoprecipitation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative experiment is shown. Extracts of cells not exposed to AVP are identified as C (control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm the role of GRKs in staurosporine-resistant phosphorylation, the dominant negative GRK2 mutant K220M was co-transfected with the V1aR into HEK 293 cells (18Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Kelly E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). AVP-stimulated receptor phosphorylation was assessed in the presence and absence of staurosporine to inhibit PKC activity. Although only a modest 26 ± 9% (n= 6) reduction was detected in all the experiments performed (data not shown), these experiments confirmed the involvement of GRKs in V1aR phosphorylation. These experiments were the only ones carried out in transiently transfected cells; all other determinations were done with stably transfected cell clones. As mentioned above, treatment of the cells with 100 nm AVP promoted the rapid loss of more than 70% of the binding sites from the plasma membrane. Thus, a significant impairment in the ability of the hormone to stimulate the production of inositol phosphates (IPs) was expected due to the reduction in receptor number. As illustrated in Fig.7 A, examination of the time course of AVP-stimulated IP accumulation revealed that the rate of production of inositol phosphates remained constant even 40 min after the addition of AVP. The possible interference of 20 mmLiCl with receptor sequestration was examined, but none was detected (data not shown). The rate of phosphoinositide accumulation was examined at shorter times searching for evidence of rapid desensitization. As shown in the inset panel in Fig.7 A, the rate of accumulation of IPs was higher in the first 30 s and quickly decayed to a lower rate of sustained activity. The sustained activity observed could be due to the following: 1) the receptors present on the cell surface, or 2) to sustained activity of the internalized receptor-G-protein complex. To distinguish between these possibilities, the effect of the V1aR antagonist TyrPhaar in the accumulation of IPs was tested (19Thibonnier M. Bayer A. Madhun Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E906-E913PubMed Google Scholar). Four minutes after addition of 100 nm AVP, the hormone was removed and replaced by 1 μm TyrPhaar, and the effect of the antagonist on PLC activity was measured at different times. As illustrated in Fig.7 B, addition of the antagonist rapidly stopped the accumulation of IPs indicating that it was mediated by receptors present on the cell surface. Overnight treatment of transfected cells with PMA to down-regulate PKC activity failed to alter the fast and slow rates of accumulation of inositol phosphates, suggesting that there was no involvement of PKC in this mild desensitization (data not shown). The speed of recycling of the internalized receptor to the cell surface was also examined. After removal of AVP, fast recycling of receptor to the cell surface was detected, a process that had been described for the V1aR in smooth muscle vascular cells (8Briner V.A. Williams B. Tsai P. Schrier R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2854-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.8, the receptor internalized during a 10-min AVP treatment recycled rapidly to the cell surface following removal of AVP with an isotonic acid wash and return of the cells to normal growth conditions. At the last time point analyzed, the number of binding sites on the cell surface had increased to values very similar to those present in the non-treated cells indicating that only a small percent of the receptors had been degraded after internalization. Occupancy of the V1aR by agonist promoted phosphorylation of the receptor protein. At variance from what had been observed with most receptors of this family, the phosphorylation reached maximum values very quickly and was transient in the continuous presence of AVP. This was an unexpected finding since in the same HEK 293 cell line the V2 vasopressin receptor was found to reach maximal phosphorylation at a slower rate and to maintain the phosphate incorporated into the protein for as long as 30 min in the presence of AVP. Transient phosphorylation in the continuous presence of ligand has been reported for three other receptors as follows: the α1B-adrenergic and the bradykinin B2 receptors expressed in fibroblasts (20Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 21Blaukat A. Abd Alla S. Lohse M.J. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor native to acinar cells (22Klueppelberg U.G. Gates L.K. Gorelick F.S. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2403-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the α1B-adrenergic and the bradykinin receptors peaked about 5 min after addition of ligand and started showing a reduction in the phosphate content 10 min later. Phosphorylation of the CCK receptor in acinar cells reached maximum values 1–2 min after addition of the ligand and returned to basal levels after 20 min. However, when the CCK receptor was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it remained phosphorylated at its maximum level in the continuous presence of CCK (23Ozcelebi F. Rao R.V. Holicky E. Madden B.J. McCormick D.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3750-3755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Compared with these proteins the V1aR was the fastest in reaching maximum phosphorylation. The data indicated that protein kinase C and other kinases, most likely GRKs, were involved in phosphorylating the V1aR. The possibility that phosphorylation of the V1aR by PKC caused the fast de-phosphorylation observed was not supported by comparison with other G-protein-coupled receptors. For example the somatostatin (24Hipkin R.W. Friedman J. Clark R.B. Eppler C.M. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13869-13876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), angiotensin AT1 A (25Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and thromboxane A2 (26Habib A. Vezza R. Creminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) receptors do not lose their phosphate groups in the continuous presence of the ligand, although PKC contributes to their ligand-promoted phosphorylation. This assumption is consistent with the finding that neither down-regulation of PKC by PMA nor inhibition of its activity by staurosporine had a significant effect on the kinetics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the V1aR. The longer lived phosphorylated forms of the V2 vasopressin and other receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells indicated that transient phosphorylation is not dependent on the host cells, rather it is an intrinsic property of V1aR protein. Expression of the dominant negative GRK2 reduced ligand-promoted V1aR phosphorylation in the presence of staurosporine by 26% strengthening the assumption that the protein is a substrate for GRK. This supposition is in accordance to the reported ability of GRKs to phosphorylate other receptors of this subfamily. The identity of the GRK(s) that phosphorylate this receptor remains unresolved since the six known variants of the enzyme have been detected in HEK 293 cells. To examine whether the constitutive V1aR of hepatocytes and smooth muscle vascular cells exhibits transient phosphorylation, it will be necessary to develop antibodies with good affinity for the receptor protein. In addition to phosphorylation, AVP promoted internalization of the V1aR. Although the experiments presented established a strong temporal correlation between phosphorylation and internalization of the V1aR, our laboratory has reported the ligand-promoted internalization of the non-phosphorylated V2 vasopressin receptor (4Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Eberle A.N. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2486-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that GRK phosphorylation might not be necessary for the internalization of the ligand occupied receptor, but to prove this point would require identification of the sites phosphorylated by GRK(s) in the V1aR followed by the characterization of the behavior of this mutant V1aR in internalization experiments. Removal of the hormone revealed prompt recycling of the receptor to the cell surface. The recycled receptor accumulated relatively fast on the plasma membrane, and the number of sites reached values similar to those present at the beginning of the experiment suggesting that recycling occurred without significant degradation of V1aR molecules. The return of the de-phosphorylated receptor protein to the cell surface would be in agreement with the hypothesis of Krueger et al. (3Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) that defines internalization as a necessary step for the receptor to be de-phosphorylated and thus regain its activity, i.e. to reverse ligand-promoted inactivation. Similar to phosphorylation, PLC activation occurred very rapidly after hormone addition, followed immediately by a decrease in the rate of accumulation of inositol phosphates. The attenuation of PLC activity was not as pronounced as expected from the significant loss of receptors from the cell surface. Fig. 7 illustrates that the rate of IP accumulation was sustained for more than 30 min in the presence of hormone, while after 5 min more than 75% of the receptor remained inside the cell. Desensitization of the V1aR happened within the first 2 min after addition of hormone as illustrated in the inset panel of Fig. 7, and there was no evidence of progressive loss of PLC activity during prolonged incubations at variance with what has been described for in vitro systems that are desensitized until the activity of the effectors practically ceases (27Hepler J.R. Earp H.S. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7610-7619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sustained level of PLC activity suggested that the apparent desensitization of the rate of IP accumulation detected initially was due to the fast sequestration of the phosphorylated receptor resulting in a decrease in the number of proteins mediating PLC stimulation. The ability of a V1aR antagonist to inhibit the sustained accumulation of IPs that followed indicated that the activity of PLC was maintained by receptors present on the cell surface, whose number was constantly replenished by recycling of the protein. Consistent with the hypothesis that a conformational change induced by ligand binding is required to trigger receptor internalization (4Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Eberle A.N. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2486-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), PMA-induced phosphorylation of unoccupied receptor was not sufficient to provoke a reduction of cell surface receptors. These data are compatible with the report that a truncated V1aR missing the putative PKC sites on the carboxyl terminus still undergoes ligand-induced desensitization, probably caused by ligand-induced disappearance of receptor from the cell surface. No information on V1aR phosphorylation was provided (28Ancellin N. Preisser L. Corman B. Morel A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Some of the phosphate incorporated in response to PMA was removed during the 1st h, implying that dephosphorylation could take place without the receptor being transferred to the endosomal compartment. The phosphate incorporated by PKC into the ligand-free receptor was cleaved at a much slower rate than the phosphate incorporated into the ligand-bound receptor (Figs. 2, 4, and 6). Two alternative hypotheses are suggested by the observations: that AVP-promoted internalization of the V1aR translocates the receptor to endosomal compartments that are enriched in phosphatases responsible for the fast dephosphorylation, or that the phosphorylated occupied receptor acquires a conformation that makes it a better substrate for the phosphatases regardless of its subcellular localization. The experiments presented could not distinguish between these two possibilities; they only established a strong temporal correlation between the disappearance of the incorporated phosphate and the fast internalization of the receptor. A noticeable amount of phosphate was present in the resting receptor. The changed migration in acrylamide gels caused by the incorporation of additional phosphate promoted by receptor activation suggests that there are qualitative as well as quantitative differences among the phosphorylation sites. This observation is reminiscent to what has been described for the β2-adrenergic receptor for which multiple cAMP-dependent protein kinase and GRK phosphorylation sites have been demonstrated to play different roles in desensitization and sequestration (2Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). No functional consequences of PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation were detected for the V1aR in the experiments described. In conclusion, activation of the V1aR by AVP promotes phosphorylation of the receptor by GRK and PKC. PKC phosphorylation by itself does not promote V1aR sequestration or alter its desensitization. AVP-promoted phosphorylation is fast and quickly reversible in the continuous presence of ligand, a characteristic that seems intrinsic to the receptor protein. Phosphorylation and sequestration of the ligand occupied receptor are concurrent and seemed to participate in desensitization."

Cells with expression vectors that encoded the disulfide-rich domain lacking the last 90 and 150 carboxyl-terminal residues, respectively, from the carboxyl terminus of the disulfide-rich domain were unable to secrete truncated domains. These results indicate that the information required to form disulfide-bonded dimers resides in only 90 residues, including 11 half-cystines. Site-specific mutagenesis was employed to change, one at a time, each codon for the 11 half-cystines to serine. Eight of the 11 mutants formed disulfide-bonded dimers indistinguishable from those produced by unmutated vector, although 6 of the 8 mutants also produced aggregates thought to be misfolded protein with scrambled disulfide bonds. Two additional mutant vectors encoding serine instead of half-cystine at residues 13244 and 13246 in submaxillary mucin expressed both monomers and dimers of the disulfide-rich domain but no aggregates. The final mutant vector, C13223S, expressed protein aggregates that were poorly secreted from transfected cells. A mutant vector with two codon changes, C13244A/C13246A, expressed both monomers and dimers, just like the single mutants at these half-cystines. These results suggest that three half-cystine residues (Cys13223, Cys13244, and Cys13246) may be involved in forming interchain disulfide bonds in mucin dimers. Two of these half-cystines, Cys13244 and Cys13246, are in the highly conserved sequence C13244LC13246C in the disulfide-rich domain of several other human mucins and in prepro-von Willebrand factor and norrin, a protein that in mutant forms gives rise to Norrie disease. Support for the involvement of these half-cystines in formation of disulfide-bonded dimers of these molecules is also provided by known mutations in prepro-von Willebrand factor and norrin.

Support for the involvement of these half-cystines in formation of disulfide-bonded dimers of these molecules is also provided by known mutations in prepro-von Willebrand factor and norrin. Porcine submaxillary mucin contains a polypeptide chain of 13,288 residues, 1GenBankTM accession numberAF005273. 1GenBankTM accession numberAF005273. which can be divided into domains typical of those found in several other mucins secreted by various human tissues (1Eckhardt A.E.

Most of the polypeptide chain is comprised of 81 residue tandem repeats that are rich in serine, threonine, glycine, and alanine, and together account for 75% of the residues in this domain. There are at least three different genes encoding porcine submaxillary mucin that differ from one another in the number (90, 125, and 135) of repeats they encode (1Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. DeLuca A.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33204-33210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The tandem repeat domain is flanked on either end by unique sequences that are similar in composition to the repeat domains but exhibit no sequence identity to one another or to the tandem repeat domains. The hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine in the tandem repeat domain (2Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and presumably the unique sequences flanking this domain, are in O-glycosidic linkage with oligosaccharides, which account for about 75% of the weight of native mucin. Three disulfide-rich domains are at the amino terminus of submaxillary mucin (1Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. DeLuca A.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

It has been shown that the disulfide-rich domain of prepro-von Willebrand factor (14Voorberg J. Fontijn R. Calafat J. Hanssen H. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), porcine submaxillary mucin (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 33410-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) forms interchain disulfide bonds between two polypeptide chains in these molecules. We describe here studies designed to determine whether the entire 240-residue carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domain is required for the formation of disulfide-linked dimers of porcine submaxillary mucin. The approach taken was to mutate plasmids encoding the domain by deletion of segments of DNA from either the 5′ or the 3′ end and to examine the ability of the truncated plasmids when transfected into COS-7 cells to form disulfide-bonded dimers. Further studies by site-specific mutagenesis permitted determination of those half-cystine residues that appear to form the interchain disulfide bonds in dimers. Site-specific mutagenesis was achieved as described earlier (17Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) with reagents fromCLONTECH and, as template, the expression vector pMC (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which encodes the 244 residues of the disulfide-rich carboxyl-terminal residues of mucin. Primers were synthesized by the Duke University Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility or by Life Technologies, Inc. The selection primer was the antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-CTGCAGGTCGTCCTTCTTCAC-3′, which introduces a silent mutation that destroys a unique SalI site in the multicloning site of pMC. To construct the vector pMCbc, a XhoI restriction site was created just upstream of the histidine 13131 codon with the following antisense mutagenic primer, 5′-TTTTCACAGTGTTCTCGAGTTCACAGCAGG-3′. A XhoI/SpeI mucin-encoding polynucleotide was then obtained from the resulting plasmid and subcloned between the SalI and the SpeI sites of pMC. The final expression vector encodes a fusion protein containing a 25-residue transin signal peptide (18Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 3 residues derived from the cloning site (GRE), and the truncated mucin domain, residues 13131–13288 (1Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. DeLuca A.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33204-33210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The antisense mutagenic oligonucleotides used for substitutions of cysteine to another amino acid in pMC were as follows: C13200S, 5′-CACGGGGGAAGGTTTGGAACTACTCTTAC-3′; C13214S, 5′-CTTTAATCGTGGATCCATTGTACC-3′; C13223S, 5′-GTCTTTTTGCACTCCCCTACAGATCTGTCCAT-3′; C13227S, 5′-GACAGTCTTTTTGGATTCCCCTACAC3′; C13244S, 5′-GGCAGCAAAGAGATGAATTTTTCAACTGG-3′; C13246S, 5′-CTTGGCAGGAAAGACATGAATTTTTCAACTG-3′; C13247S, 5′-CTTCTTCTTGGGAGCAAAGACATG-3′; C13261S, 5′-CATCAGGAGAGTCTAGAACAATATC-3′; C13277S, 5′-CTAAGCAGGAGGACGCGGTGATGTGC-3′; C13279S, 5′-CACGGATCTAACGAGGAGCACGCG-3′; C13283S, 5′-GATTGTTGGGACGGGTCTAAGCAGG-3′; C13223A, 5′-GTCTTTTTGCACTCCCCTACAGCTCTTGCCAT-3′; C13227A, 5′-GGCAGCAAAGAGCTGAATTTTTCAACTGG-3′; C13244A, 5′-CTTGGCAGGCAAGACATGAATTTTTCAACTG-3′; and C13244A/C13246A, 5′-CTTCTTGGCAGGCAAGAGCTGAATTTTTCAAC-3′. The vector pMCab was made by introducing into pMC a PstI site downstream to the Gly13213 codon with the antisense mutagenesis oligonucleotide 5′-CAACTTTAATCCTGCAGACCATTGTACC-3′. The new plasmid encodes a transin signal peptide of 25 residues, 3 residues (GRE) that precede a truncated mucin domain (residues 13045–13213), and 3 additional residues (LQD) at the carboxyl terminus. To construct plasmid pMCa, a frameshift in the mucin coding region of pMC was created downstream from the Glu13128 codon with the following antisense mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5′-TTTTTCACAGTGTCTCGAGTTCACAGCAGG-3′. This plasmid expressed a mutant protein containing a transin signal peptide of 25 residues, followed by 3 amino acids (GRE) and a truncated mucin domain (residues 13045–13128) and the tetrapeptide LETL at the carboxyl terminus. The expression vector pMCcH was constructed by replacing the protein A coding sequences of plasmid pPA-MC1 (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with a new multicloning site as described earlier (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was then digested with XhoI and SpeI and ligated to a XhoI/SpeI mucin DNA fragment encoding residues 12572–13288 (1Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. DeLuca A.W. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33204-33210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A new XbaI site was made by site-specific mutagenesis upstream from the codon for serine residue 12572 with the following antisense mutagenic primer; 5′-GGTTTGCAACTACTTCTAGATGTATAGCAACA-3′. The following oligonucleotide was used as selection primer: 5′-CTAGAAAGAATTCGACGACCTTCTTCAC-3′, which destroys a unique SalI site in the multicloning site of the template plasmid. A poly-His-encoding cassette was inserted upstream to the stop codon by published procedures (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was digested with XbaI and religated to give pMCcH, which encodes a fusion protein containing a 25-residue transin signal peptide, 7 residues of the cloning site (GRRILSR), followed by 90 residues at the carboxyl terminus of mucin (residues 13198–13288) and 6 histidine residues. The Cys to Ala mutants of pMCcH were constructed with the same antisense mutagenic oligonucleotides used with pMC, and the antisense selection primer 5′-GCAACTACTTCTGGAAAGAATTCG-3′, which destroys a unique XbaI site. To facilitate the screening process, the mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to produce silent mutations that destroy or create restriction sites in the mucin sequences along with the desired codon changes. All mutations in the expression vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing with the Sequenase 2.0 system from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The entire polynucleotide encoding the mutant C13223S was completely sequenced to establish that no unintended mutation had been made. COS-7 cells were grown and transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) except that chloroquine, at a final concentration of 50 mm, was included during the 6-h transfection. NIH-3T3 cells expressing mutant or normal mucin domains were obtained by co-transfection of cells with plasmid pHBAPr1neo (19Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.-Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Antisera 3814 against the carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domain of mucin was described earlier (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Metabolic labeling of cells with Tran35S-label or 35S-cysteine (both from ICN Pharmaceutical, Inc.) and immunoprecipitation with antisera 3814 were performed as described earlier (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) except that immunoprecipitates were washed further with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25m NaCl containing 0.01% each of SDS, sodium deoxycholate, and Nonidet P-40. To block free thiol groups that could permit formation of incorrectly paired half-cystines during cell lysis and immunoprecipitation, intracellular precursors were reacted in vivo with iodoacetamide as reported earlier (20Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and media were reacted with iodoacetamide prior to immunoprecipitation. SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography were done as described earlier (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 14C-labeled proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as molecular weight standards, including myosin (220,000), phosphorylase b (97, 400–100,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), ovalbumin (46,000–50,000), carbonic anhydrase (30,000), and lysozyme (14,300). His-tagged proteins were purified from the medium of transfected cells on TALON-IMAC beads (CLONTECH) (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), eluted from the beads with 0.5 ml of Tris, pH 8, containing 10 mm EDTA, and 6 murea (binding buffer), and then applied to a column of activated thiolpropyl-Sepharose 6B (Sigma) equilibrated with binding buffer. After 2 h at 25 °C, the column was sequentially eluted with binding buffer, the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and then with binding buffer-NaCl containing 10 mmdithiothreitol. Fractions (0.15 ml) were collected and counted for radioactivity. In some experiments, fractions were desalted on Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia-LKB) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, and the eluted domain was isolated by immunoprecipitation with antiserum 3814. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed as described earlier (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The expression vector pMC (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) is a plasmid that encodes a fusion protein containing a transin signal peptide of 25 residues followed by 3 residues (GRE) derived from a multicloning site and then 244 residues that encode the disulfide-rich domain at the carboxyl terminus of mucin. As a first step to identify which of the 30 half-cystine residues are involved in formation of interchain disulfide bonds between two of the disulfide-rich domains, pMC was truncated at its amino terminus by site-specific mutagenesis. Two truncated plasmids were produced. One, designated pMCbc, is devoid of the first 86 residues of the disulfide-rich domain and encodes 158 residues (residues 13131 to 13288 in mucin1) including 20 half-cystine residues. The other, designated pMCcH is devoid of the first 154 residues of the disulfide-rich domain and encodes the last 90 residues (residues 13198 to 13288) at the carboxyl terminus of the domain, including 11 half-cystine residues, followed by 6 histidine residues, which were introduced to aid in purification of the protein expressed by the plasmid. Fig. 1 A shows the electrophoretic pattern on SDS gels in 2-mercaptoethanol of the proteins immunoprecipitated from the medium of COS-7 cells that had been transfected with the truncated plasmids and metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label. The protein produced by pMCbc (lane 2) migrated as a broad band with Mr = 22,000–28,000, whereas pMCcH (lane 3) was expressed as two proteins with Mr = 17,000 and 19,000, respectively. However, if the proteins produced by these plasmids were digested with N-glycanase, only one protein species was observed on gels (Fig. 1 B). pMCbc gave a protein with Mr = 22,000, and pMCcH gave a protein with Mr = 17,000. Treatment of transfected cells with tunicamycin also showed single protein species of these sizes on gel electrophoresis (data not shown). These results are similar to those obtained earlier (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) on transfection of COS-7 cells with pMC and show that the different sizes of proteins expressed by the plasmids result from different extents of N-glycosylation, with pMCbc containing two glycosylation sites and pMCcH containing one. Fig. 1 A also shows the proteins produced by COS-7 cells transfected with these plasmids and analyzed on nonreducing gels. pMCbc (lane 5) produced a protein with Mr = 48,000, about twice the size of the species observed in the presence of reducing agent. pMCcH (lane 6) produced three protein bands with Mr = 33,000, 35,000, and 37,000, respectively. These results indicate that the proteins produced by the plasmids formed disulfide-linked dimers. The different protein bands observed with pMCcH are the result of dimer formation among the two monomeric species observed under reducing conditions. These results also indicate that the half-cystine residues involved in forming interchain disulfide bonds in disulfide-rich domain dimers (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) are among the 11 half-cystines contained in the last 90 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the domain. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that transfection of COS-7 cells with 2 other plasmids, pMCab and pMCa, which lacked DNA encoding the last 90 and 150 carboxyl-terminal residues, respectively, in the disulfide-rich domain, did not secrete any proteins into the medium as judged by SDS-gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 C). By site-specific mutagenesis of pMC, each of the codons for the 11 half-cystine residues contained in the last 90 residues of the disulfide-rich domain was changed one at a time to the codon for serine. The proteins expressed by each of the mutant plasmids were then determined after transfection of COS-7 cells with the plasmids followed by metabolic labeling of the cells with Tran35S-label, immunoprecipitation of the proteins from the medium, and autoradiography of the proteins after gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, all mutants expressed and secreted into the medium five proteins species ranging in size from Mr = 33,000 to 47,000 on gels run in the presence of reducing agent. The five proteins differ in the extent of N-glycosylation as shown earlier (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The amounts of protein expressed by each mutant appears to be about the same as that for pMC (lane 2) except C13223S (lane 11), which secreted lesser amounts of the domain. Fig. 2 B shows the proteins expressed by 8 of the 11 mutant plasmids shown in Fig. 2 A when analyzed on gels in the absence of reducing agent. Mutants C13200S, C13214S, C13227S, C13247S, C13261S, C13277S, C13279S, and C13283S gave proteins with Mr ∼75,000, which is about the same size as the dimers produced by unmutated pMC (lane 2). In addition, mutants C13200S (lane 9), C13214S (lane 10), C13247S (lane 7), C13261S (lane 6), C13277S (lane 5), and C13279S (lane 4) showed more radioactivity at the interface between the stacking and running gels than the amounts seen normally with unmutated proteins (lane 2) and with preimmune serum (lane 1). This suggests that aggregates of the disulfide-rich domain are expressed by these plasmids, especially in the case of C13200S (lane 9), C13214S (lane 10), and C13247S (lane 7). The nature of these aggregates is unknown, but they likely result from incorrect formation of interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds that contain many covalently linked monomeric polypeptides. Fig. 2 C shows the autoradiographs of the proteins on nonreducing gels that were expressed by COS-7 cells transfected with two mutant plasmids not shown in Fig. 2 B. The majority of the protein expressed by these mutants, C13244S (lane 4) and C13246S (lane 3), were of about the size (Mr = 73,000) as that of disulfide-bonded dimers expressed by pMC (lane 2), the unmutated plasmid. Moreover, there was no more radioactivity between the running and stacking gels than seen with the pMC (lane 2) and with preimmune serum (lane 1), indicating that they did not express aggregates. However, each mutant plasmid expressed five protein bands, when analyzed on nonreducing gels, that are characteristically seen on reducing gels (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that a small but significant amount of non-disulfide-bonded monomer is secreted into the medium of the cells transfected with these two plasmids. The unreduced monomeric species expressed by C13244S migrated slightly faster than those from C13246S. Fig. 3 A shows the autoradiographs of the proteins expressed by the remaining mutant plasmid not shown in Figs. 2, B and C. The plasmid, C13223S, was found to secrete very little protein into the medium when analyzed either on reducing (lane 1) or nonreducing (lane 3) gels. Under nonreducing conditions, the secreted (lane 3) and unsecreted (lane 4) proteins expressed by this plasmid were found at the interface of the stacking and running gels, which is characteristic of disulfide-bonded aggregates. Dimeric species, similar to those secreted by the unmutated domain, were not observed. The large majority of the protein was found in cell lysates (lanes 2 and 4) and was present in reducing gels as five species of protein (lane 2) resulting from differences in the extent of N-glycosylation. When transfected cells were radiolabeled for 4 or more hours, immunoprecipitates of the cell lysates from transfected COS-7 cells also showed a faint band with Mr = 80,000 (Fig.3 B, lane 1). This protein was neither absorbed by the pre-immune serum (lane 3) nor observed in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the unmutated domain (lane 2). Moreover, it is not found in the medium (Fig.3 A, lane 1). The nature of this protein is not known, but it did not immunoprecipitate with antiserum to BiP (GRP78) or to calnexin, chaperones (21Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Peterson J.R. Helenius A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that could be involved in folding of the domain. Pulse-chase studies with the mutant plasmid as shown in Fig. 3 C indicated that the expressed protein was still present in transfected COS-7 cells 3 h after synthesis of the protein commences, the time when they were endoglycosidase H-sensitive. This result suggests that intracellular precursors of C13223S are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum during the chase period. Proteins from unmutated plasmids that express the disulfide-rich domain were found earlier (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to be completely secreted after 2 h. Thus, it is very likely that the mutant expressing C13223S impairs dimerization and secretion of the disulfide-rich domain of mucin. The studies shown in Figs. 2 and 3indicated that three of the half-cystine to serine mutant plasmids, C13223S, C13244S and C13246S, expressed proteins from transfected cells that were different in some respect from that expressed by the other mutant and unmutated plasmids. To determine whether an amino acid other than serine produced the same kinds of effects on the disulfide-rich domains, these three half-cystines were changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis, and the proteins produced were analyzed as described above. Fig. 4 A shows that the proteins expressed by C13223A, C13244A, and C13246A behave exactly like the corresponding proteins that contained serine instead of alanine. The secreted forms of C13244A (lane 9) and C13246A (lane 8) showed substantial amounts of dimers on nonreducing gels but also had small but significant amounts of the five monomeric species that differ in the extent of N-glycosylation and are characteristic of the monomeric species observed on reducing gels (lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, the protein expressed by the mutant C13223A is poorly secreted from the cells (lanes 5 and 10) and is recovered from cell lysates as disulfide-bonded aggregates (lane 6), with no indication of dimeric species. Fig. 4 B shows autoradiograms of the proteins expressed by NIH-3T3 cells that were stably transfected with the mutant plasmids that have the C13244A (lane 4) and the C13246A (lane 3) mutation. The behavior of the mutant disulfide-rich domain is essentially identical to that obtained from transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Thus, the mammalian expression system appears to have no effect on the nature of the disulfide-rich domains expressed. Site-specific mutagenesis was also used to prepare a plasmid that encoded a disulfide-rich domain with both half-cystine 13244 and 13246 changed to alanine. Fig. 4 C shows SDS gel electrophoresis of the proteins secreted into the medium by COS-7 cells transfected with this plasmid and then metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label. Except for the presence of aggregates, this plasmid produced the same pattern of proteins on unreduced gels as those found when cells were transfected with plasmids with only one of either of the two codons for half-cystine changed to alanine. Dimers were the predominant species secreted, but significant amounts of the five monomeric species and some aggregates were observed (lane 2). This suggests that half-cystines other than C13244 and C13246 may be involved in formation of disulfide-bonded dimers. Two mutants of pMCcH, which encodes the carboxyl-terminal 90 residues of the disulfide-rich domain, were also subjected to site-specific mutagenesis to attempt to gain further insight into the possible role of half-cystine 13244 and 13246 in dimer formation. Fig.5 shows the autoradiographs of the proteins secreted into the medium by COS-7 cells transfected with mutant plasmids of pMCcH that have the C13244A or the C13246A mutation. The amounts of protein expressed by the cells transfected with the mutant plasmids were lower than those from cells transfected with normal plasmid, but the species secreted into the medium by the cells were the same, except that monomers were not found in the media of cells transfected with normal plasmid. Cells transfected with the mutant plasmids secreted dimers and monomers of the disulfide-rich 90-residue domain as observed on nonreducing gels (Fig. 5). The mutant protein produced by C13244A (lane 8) had three monomeric species on nonreducing gels. The fastest moving species may have a different pattern of disulfide bonds than the other two. A third mutant vector encoding the carboxyl-terminal 90 residues of mucin with C13244 and C13246 replaced by alanine expressed and secreted the same species as the single alanine mutants for each half-cystine (data not shown). This is further evidence that the carboxyl-terminal 90 residues contain the information necessary for dimer formation. To understand more exactly the nature of the half-cystine residues in the disulfide-rich domain, it was important to know whether the domain contained any free thiol groups. Thus, cells were transiently transfected with pMCH (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which encoded the same domain as pMC plus six histidine residues at its carboxyl terminus. The cells were metabolically labeled, and the proteins secreted into the medium isolated by absorption onto and elution from TALON-IMAC adsorbant. After denaturation in 6 m urea, the proteins were applied to a column of thiolpropyl-Sepharose. Fig.6 shows the elution profile of the column. It can be seen that all of the radioactivity emerged unretarded from the column. Autoradiograms are also shown in Fig. 6 B of the different fractions emerging from the column. Only monomeric species that had been N-glycosylated to different extents were observed. Fig. 6 A also shows that the domain is completely absorbed to the thiolpropyl-Sepharose column if first reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol to break the disulfide bonds and can be eluted from the column with dithiothreitol. These results indicate that the 30 half-cystines in the disulfide-rich domain are in disulfide bonds, and the domain is devoid of free thiol groups. The present studies suggest that formation of disulfide-bonded dimers of the carboxyl-terminal disulfide-rich domain of porcine submaxillary mucin is dependent only on structures in the 90 carboxyl-terminal residues of mucin, including 11 half-cystines (Fig.1). By site-specific mutagenesis, each of the codons for the 11 half-cystines was changed one at a time to serine, and the ability of the resulting mutant proteins to form disulfide-bonded dimers examined (Fig. 2). Two of the mutants, C13227S and C13283S, were identical to the normal domain. Six others, C13200S, C13214S, C13247S, C13261S, C13277S, and C13279S, formed dimers indistinguishable from normal protein although they also formed aggregates of disulfide-bonded mutant protein. The aggregates are thought to be improperly folded molecules with scrambled disulfide bonds because they give monomers on reduction. These results suggest that these eight half-cystines are not involved in forming the interchain disulfide bonds of dimers. Moreover, these eight half-cystines likely form intrachain disulfide bonds because the disulfide-rich domain is devoid of free thiol groups (Fig.6). Two other mutant proteins, C13244S and C13246S, form substantial amounts of monomers and dimers under nonreducing conditions, suggesting that interchain disulfide bond formation is impaired in these mutants. They did not, however, form aggregates. The final mutant, C13223S, does not form dimers but forms disulfide-bonded aggregates that are very poorly secreted from the cells (Fig. 3). Thus, the three half-cystines at residues 13223, 13244, and 13246 would seem to be likely candidates for forming interchain disulfide bonds. The mutant proteins, C13244A and C13246A, were indistinguishable from their serine counterparts and showed both monomers and dimers and no aggregates under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, a double mutant construct, C13244A/C13246A, expressed and secreted monomeric and dimeric species in addition to aggregates. These results suggest that one other half-cystine is involved in dimer formation and that at least two interchain disulfide bonds may exist in dimers. It is possible that half-cystine 13223 is also involved, but its role could not be tested by site-specific mutagenesis because proteins with this half-cystine mutated are poorly secreted from the cells. Fig. 7 compares the amino acid sequences of the disulfide-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of porcine submaxillary mucin1 with the corresponding domains in human mucins MUC2,3 MUC5AC,4 MUC5B,5 and MUC66 and in human prepro-von Willebrand factor2 and human norrin.7 Noteworthy is the almost identical position of the 11 half-cystine residues in each sequence. Experimental proof for dimer formation is lacking for the human mucins, but both von Willebrand factor (14Voorberg J. Fontijn R. Calafat J. Hanssen H. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and porcine submaxillary mucin (15Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9845-9850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) form dimers, and norrin forms disulfide-linked oligomers (16Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33410-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Half-cystine 13246 in submaxillary mucin is in an identical position to half-cystine 2010 in mature von Willebrand factor and to half-cystine 95 in norrin. Moreover, a mutant form of von Willebrand factor containing an arginine instead of half-cystine 2010 fails to form dimers (22Schneppenheim R. Brassard J. Krey S. Budde U. Kunicki T.J. Holmberg L. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, a mutant form of norrin containing alanine instead of half-cystine 95 has impaired oligomer formation (16Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33410-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations argue strongly for the involvement of half-cystine 13246 of porcine submaxillary mucin in formation of disulfide-bonded dimers. Similar support for the involvement of porcine mucin half-cystine 13244 in interchain disulfide bonds of dimers is not available, but noteworthy is the conservation of the sequence CXCC in the seven proteins shown in Fig. 7, with the three half-cystines corresponding to half-cystines 13244, 13246, and 13247, respectively, in porcine mucin. It is possible that substitutions of half-cystine 13244 result in changes in conformation that affect the interchain disulfide bonds formed by half-cystine 13246. This view is consistent with the observation that mutant proteins C13244S and C13244A migrate slightly faster on SDS-gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions than mutant proteins C13246S and C13246A (Figs. 2 C, and 4, A and B). Support for the involvement of half-cystine 13223 in formation of disulfide-bonded dimers in mucin also comes from comparison of the sequences shown in Fig. 7. Half-cystine 13223 is the first half-cystine in the sequence VEMARCVGECKK, which is one of the most highly conserved sequences in these proteins. Substitution of the half-cystine in norrin that corresponds to half-cystine 13223 by either tryptophan (23Schuback D.E. Chen Z.Y. Craig I.W. Breakefield X.O. Sims K.B. Hum. Mut. 1995; 5: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or tyrosine (24Strasberg P. Alexander Liede H. Stein T. Warren I. Sutherland J. Ray P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 2: 2179-2180Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) produces Norrie disease in humans. Moreover, when valine 60 of norrin, which corresponds to valine 13218 in submaxillary mucin, is substituted by glutamic acid, the secretion of the mutant norrin is impaired (16Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33410-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and humans with this mutation have a severe form of Norrie disease (13Meindl A. Berger W. Meitinger T. van de Pol T.J.R. Achatz H. Döerner C. Haasemann M. Hellebrand H. Gal A. Cremers F.P.M. Ropers H.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Valine 13218, five residues removed from half-cystine 13223, may well be in a sequence that is directly involved in dimer formation through disulfide bonds. The recent report (16Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33410-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) describing the oligomerization of human norrin, in conjunction with the studies reported here, strongly suggests that this type of domain with 11 half-cystines functions to form interchain disulfide bonds. This view is supported by the recent report (10Toribara N.W. Ho S.B. Gum E. Gum Jr., J.R. Lau P. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16398-16403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that human MUC6 contains a carboxyl-terminal domain with only 91 residues, including 11 half-cystines, that has significant sequence identity with the carboxyl-terminal, disulfide-rich domain of porcine submaxillary mucin (Fig. 7)."
https://openalex.org/W2068267769,"The β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds proceeds by reduction of the double bond (reductase-dependent pathway) in addition to the well established isomerization of the double bond (isomerase-dependent pathway). The metabolic significance of the reductase-dependent pathway was assessed with 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA (2,5-octadienoyl-CoA) and its products, all of which are metabolites of α-linolenic acid. A kinetic evaluation of β-oxidation enzymes revealed that the presence of a 5-cis double bond in the substrate most adversely affected the activity of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase although not enough to become rate-limiting. Concentration-dependent and time-dependent measurements indicated that most (80%) of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA is metabolized via the isomerase-dependent pathway. The reason for the greater flux through the isomerase-dependent pathway is the higher activity of l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase as compared with Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase. These two enzymes catalyze the rate-limiting steps in the isomerase-dependent and reductase-dependent pathways, respectively. Once 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA is converted to 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA (perhaps fortuitously because of the presence of Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase), the only effective route for its degradation is via the reductase-dependent pathway.

It is concluded that the reductase-dependent pathway assures the degradation of 3,5-dienoyl-CoA intermediates, thereby preventing the depletion of free coenzyme A and a likely impairment of mitochondrial oxidative function. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are degraded by β-oxidation. However, the breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids requires additional enzymes that specifically function in the metabolism of preexisting double bonds (1Schulz H. Kunau W.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 403-406Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Even-numbered double bonds are reductively removed by the combined actions of NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34) and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8). In contrast, metabolites with odd-numbered double bonds were thought to undergo only a 3-cis to 2-trans isomerization before reentering the β-oxidation spiral. However, recent evidence suggests that odd-numbered double bonds can be removed by an NADPH-dependent reduction once they are in the Δ5-position (2Tserng K.-Y. Jin S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11614-11620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a result of chain shortening. A detailed study of this conversion revealed a four-step reaction sequence that results in a shift of the double bond from the Δ5- to the Δ2-position (3Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The starting metabolite in this reaction sequence is 2-trans-5-cis-dienoyl-CoA, which is formed from 5-cis-enoyl-CoA by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. 2-trans-5-cis-Dienoyl-CoA can either complete the β-oxidation cycle to yield 3-cis-enoyl-CoA or can be converted to 3,5-cis-dienoyl-CoA by enoyl-CoA isomerase. 1The abbreviations used are: enoyl-CoA isomerase, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase; dienoyl-CoA isomerase, Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; 3-hydroxy-5-octenoyl-CoA, 3-hydroxy-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA; 3-keto-5-octenoyl-CoA, 3-keto-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; 2-octenoyl-CoA, 2-trans-octenoyl-CoA; 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA, 2-trans,4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA; 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA, 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA; 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA, 3,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA. 1The abbreviations used are: enoyl-CoA isomerase, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase; dienoyl-CoA isomerase, Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; 3-hydroxy-5-octenoyl-CoA, 3-hydroxy-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA; 3-keto-5-octenoyl-CoA, 3-keto-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; 2-octenoyl-CoA, 2-trans-octenoyl-CoA; 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA, 2-trans,4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA; 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA, 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA; 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA, 3,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA.

The latter compound is a substrate of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and hence can be reduced by NADPH to 3-trans-enoyl-CoA, which is converted to 2-trans-enoyl-CoA by enoyl-CoA isomerase. The elucidation of this novel pathway raised the question as to whether unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds are metabolized via one or both branches of the pathway. The two branches are referred to as the isomerase-dependent pathway, which only requires enoyl-CoA isomerase, and the reductase-dependent pathway which requires dienoyl-CoA isomerase, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, and enoyl-CoA isomerase.

The goal of this study was to elucidate the metabolic significance of the novel reductase-dependent pathway. Answers were sought for the following questions. Does the 5-cis double bond affect the activities of the β-oxidation enzymes? What are the contributions of the isomerase-dependent and the reductase-dependent pathways to the flux of unsaturated fatty acid through the β-oxidation spiral? Does the reductase-dependent pathway serve a special function that cannot be assumed by the isomerase-dependent pathway?

Sep-Pak C18 cartridges used for concentrating acyl-CoAs were purchased from Waters. The methyl ester of 5-cis-octenoic acid was a kind gift from Dr. Howard Sprecher (Ohio State University). 5-cis-Octenoic acid (3Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and 2-trans, 4-trans-octadienoic acid (14Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14140-14144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared from methyl-5-cis-octenoate and 2-trans, 4-trans-octadienal, respectively, by established procedures. 5-cis-Octenoyl-CoA, 3-octenoyl-CoA, 2-octynoyl-CoA, 2-trans-octenoyl-CoA, and 2-trans, 4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA were synthesized from 5-cis-octenoic acid, 3-octenoic acid, 2-octynoic acid, 2-trans-octenoic acid, and 2-trans, 4-trans-octadienoic acid, respectively, by the mixed anhydride method as described by Fong and Schulz (15Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All acyl-CoAs were further purified by HPLC. For the synthesis of 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, 10 μmol of 5-cis-octenoyl-CoA were incubated with 5 units of acyl-CoA oxidase from Arthrobacter species in 60 ml of 0.1m KPi (pH 9.0) at room temperature. The conversion of 5-cis-octenoyl-CoA to 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA was monitored by analyzing aliquots of 50 μl, withdrawn from the reaction mixture at different time intervals, by HPLC. Under the conditions described above, 3-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA was observed to be a minor product of the reaction. When 5-cis-octenoyl-CoA was completely converted to products, usually after 1 h, the reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 1.0 with concentrated HCl to avoid further isomerization of 2-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA to 3-trans-5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA. The protein was removed from the reaction mixture by filtration through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane, and the pH was readjusted to 8.0 with 4.0n KOH. To avoid the difficult separation of small amounts of 3,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA from 2,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA by HPLC, 0.5 unit of purified dienoyl-CoA isomerase from rat liver was added to the reaction mixture to isomerize 3,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA to 2-trans-4-trans-octadienoyl-CoA, which can be separated more conveniently from 2,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA by HPLC. After adjusting the pH to 1.0 with concentrated HCl, precipitated protein was removed from the reaction mixture by filtering the mixture through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane. The reaction mixture was concentrated, after adjusting its pH to 3.0, by passing it through a Sep-Pak mini column and eluting it with methanol. Methanol was evaporated under a stream of N2, the resultant acyl-CoA was redissolved in 1 ml of H2O, and the pH was adjusted to 3.0 with concentrated HCl. 2-trans-5-cis-Octadienoyl-CoA was further purified by HPLC. 3,5-cis-Octadienoyl-CoA was synthesized by incubating 10 μmol of 5-cis-octenoyl-CoA with 5 units of acyl-CoA oxidase from Arthrobacter species in 60 ml of 0.1m KPi (pH 8.0) at room temperature. The conversion of 5-cis-octenoyl-CoA to 3,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA was monitored by analyzing aliquots of 50 μl, taken at different time intervals from the reaction mixture, by HPLC. When 5-cis-octenoyl-CoA was completely converted to products, the reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 1.0 with concentrated HCl, and the precipitated protein was removed by filtration through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane after readjusting the pH to 5.0. The resultant acyl-CoA was concentrated by use of a SEP-Pak mini column as described above, and 3,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA was purified by HPLC. The synthesis of l-3-hydroxy-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA was accomplished by incubating 10 μmol of 5-cis-octenoyl-CoA with 15 units of acyl-CoA oxidase from yeast and 5 units of bovine liver crotonase in 60 ml of 0.1m KPi (pH 8.0) at room temperature. The conversion of 5-cis-octenoyl-CoA tol-3-hydroxy-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA was monitored by analyzing aliquots of 50 μl, withdrawn from the reaction mixture at different time intervals, by HPLC. The reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 1.0 with concentrated HCl when no further increase in the formation of 3-hydroxy-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA was observed upon the addition of more enzymes. For the purpose of synthesizing 3-keto-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA, the above reaction was carried out in the presence of 10 units of pig heart l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 1.0 mmpyruvate, 1.0 mm NAD+, and 15 units of lactate dehydrogenase. The conversion ofl-3-hydroxy-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA to 3-keto-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA was monitored by analyzing aliquots of 50 μl, withdrawn from the reaction mixture at different time intervals, by HPLC. The reaction was allowed to proceed for approximately 5 h. The reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 1.0 with concentrated HCl, and precipitated protein was removed by filtration through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane. The resultant 3-keto-5-cis-octenoyl-CoA was concentrated by use of a Sep-Pak minicolumn as described above and purified by HPLC. 3-Ketooctanoyl-CoA was synthesized by incubating 5 μmol of 2-octynoyl-CoA with 10 units of bovine liver crotonase in 5 ml of 50 mm MES (pH 6.0). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 45 min and was terminated by adjusting the pH to 1.0 with concentrated HCl. Precipitated protein was removed by filtration through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane, and the pH was readjusted to 3.0. The product was purified by HPLC. Concentrations of all acyl-CoA thioesters were measured spectrophotometrically by quantifying CoASH with Ellman's reagent (16Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar) after cleaving the thioesters bond with NH2OH at pH 7.0 (15Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Rat liver mitochondria were isolated as described by Nedergaard and Cannon (17Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 71: 390-398Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C. Mitochondria were precipitated by centrifugation and resuspended in an equal volume of 0.2 m KPi (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (v/v) hexamethylphosphoramide, 10 mm benzamidine, and pepstatin A (2 μg/ml). The resuspended mitochondria were sonicated 5 times for 5 s each under cooling at 4 °C and then were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant represented the soluble extract of mitochondria. Purified crotonase from bovine liver or crotonase present in a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria was assayed spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. A standard assay mixture contained 0.2 m KPi, (pH 8.0), 20 μm 2-octenoyl-CoA or 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA, and enzyme to give an absorbance change of approximately 0.04/min. A molar extinction coefficient of 5100 m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate rates. Purified 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase or 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase present in a soluble extract from rat liver mitochondria was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring the formation of NADH at 340 nm. A standard assay mixture contained 0.2m KPi, (pH 8.0), 20 μm2-octenoyl-CoA or 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA, 1 mmNAD+, 0.3 mm CoASH, crotonase (0.17 unit), 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (0.1 unit), and enzyme to give an absorbance change of approximately 0.04/min. When the mitochondrial extract served as an enzyme source, no purified thiolase was added to the assay mixture. A molar extinction coefficient of 6220m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate rates. Purified 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase from pig heart or 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase present in a soluble extract from rat liver mitochondria was assayed by measuring the formation of product by HPLC. A standard assay contained 0.2 m KPi (pH 8.0), 0.3 mm CoASH, 20 μm 3-ketooctanoyl-CoA, or 20 μm 3-keto-5-octenoyl-CoA and enzyme to convert approximately 20% of the substrate to product during the 1-min incubation period. The reaction was terminated by adjusting the pH to 1.0 with concentrated HCl. After removal of precipitated protein by filtration through 0.22-μm pore size membranes, the pH was readjusted to 5, and the samples were analyzed by HPLC. The products were quantified by use of standard curves established with either hexanoyl-CoA or an equilibrium mixture of 2-trans-hexenoyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA. With 3-keto-5-octenoyl-CoA as the substrate, 3-cis-hexenoyl-CoA was formed when purified thiolase was used. However, 3-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA and 2-trans-hexenoyl-CoA were the products when the mitochondrial extract served as the enzyme source. The thiolytic product of 3-ketooctanoyl-CoA was hexanoyl-CoA. Enoyl-CoA isomerase was assayed spectrophotometrically with the purified enzyme and 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA as the substrate. The increase in absorbance at 240 nm, due to the formation of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA was recorded. An extinction coefficient of 18,800 m−1cm−1 was used to calculate rates. With the same substrate but with the mitochondrial extract as an enzyme source, the increase in absorbance, due to the formation of 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA, was recorded. Purified dienoyl-CoA isomerase, which was added as a coupling enzyme in some measurements, was found to produce maximally a 20% increase in the rate. An extinction coefficient of 27,000m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate rates. With purified enoyl-CoA isomerase and 3-octenoyl-CoA as the substrate, an increase in absorbance at 263 nm, due to the formation of 2-enoyl-CoA, was recorded. An extinction coefficient of 6700 m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate rates. A standard assay contained 0.2 mKPi (pH 8.0), 20 μm 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA or 3-enoyl-CoA, and enzyme to produce an absorbance change of approximately 0.04/min. All spectrophotometric assays were performed an a Gilford, model 260, recording spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Kinetic parameters (apparent Vmax and Km) were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting using the Sigma plot program. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate to product per min. Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. For rate measurements, various amounts of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA in 0.2 m KPi (pH 8.0) were incubated with a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria. When the flux through the isomerase-dependent branch was evaluated, 1 mm NAD+ and 0.3 mm CoASH were added, and the formation of NADH was recorded at 360 nm. An extinction coefficient of 4140 m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate rates. When rates of metabolism via the reductase-dependent pathway were determined, either no cofactors or 1 mm NAD+, 0.3 mmCoASH, 1 mm pyruvate, and 1 unit of lactate dehydrogenase were present. The absorbance increase at 300 nm was recorded, which reflects the formation of 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA. An extinction coefficient of 27,000 m−1 cm−1was used to calculate rates. The rate of 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA degradation was measured spectrophotometrically by recording the decrease of the absorbance at 300 nm due to the disappearance of the substrate. The assay mixture contained in 0.2 mKPi (pH 8.0), various amounts of 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA, 1 mm NAD+, 0.3 mm CoASH, mitochondrial extract, and either 0 or 0.5 mm NADPH. Observed absorbance changes were corrected for changes detected in the absence of cofactors that most likely were due to the hydrolysis of the substrate. An extinction coefficient of 27,000m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate rates. When the time-dependent formation of metabolites from 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA or 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA was studied, 20 μm of either substrate in 0.2 mKPi (pH 8.0) was incubated with 1 mmNAD+, 0.3 mm CoASH, 0.5 mm NADPH, and mitochondrial extract (0.1 mg/ml). Reactions were terminated after various periods of incubation by adjusting the pH to 1 with concentrated HCl. After readjusting the pH to 5, samples were clarified by filtration through 0.22-μm pore size membranes and analyzed by HPLC. Standard curves established with purified acyl-CoAs were used to quantify the metabolites. In some experiments, a reconstituted β-oxidation system was used in place of the mitochondrial extract. Such incubation mixtures contained in 0.2 m KPi(pH 8.0) either 20 μm 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA or 20 μm 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA plus 1 mmNAD+, 0.3 mm CoASH, enoyl-CoA isomerase (0.7 milliunit), enoyl-CoA hydratase (0.5 unit), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (18 milliunits), and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (0.11 unit). Samples were processed and analyzed by HPLC as described above. Acyl-CoA substrates and metabolites were purified and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Waters μBondapak C18column (30 cm × 3.9 mm) attached to a Waters gradient HPLC system. The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 254 nm. Separation of metabolites was achieved by first washing the column with 50 mm ammonium phosphate (pH 5.5) containing 5% of acetonitrile/water (9:1, v/v) for 15 min and then eluting acyl-CoAs by linearly increasing the organic phase from 5 to 50% in 30 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. When the kinetics of purified 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase with 3-keto-5-octenoyl-CoA as a substrate were studied, an isocratic elution was used for 7 min. Thereafter, a 5–50% gradient was developed within 13 min. With 3-ketooctanoyl-CoA as substrate, the separation of substrate and product was achieved by linearly increasing the methanol content of the 75 mm ammonium phosphate (pH 5.5) elution buffer from 30 to 60% in 30 min at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. When the sample contained only acyl-CoAs, the isocratic part of the elution program was omitted, and a linear gradient from 10 to 50% was used to achieve elution within 30 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds yields 5-enoyl-CoA intermediates, which are converted to 2,5-dienoyl-CoA by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (3Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The focus of this study was the mitochondrial metabolism of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA. The degradation of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA, which is a metabolite of α-linolenic acid, involves only soluble enzymes that are located in the matrix of mitochondria. Hence, a soluble extract of mitochondria represents a suitable enzyme system to study the metabolism of this compound. The direct β-oxidation of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA requires the sequential actions of crotonase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (see Fig. 1, pathway A). In an attempt to determine if the 5-cis double bond affects the rate at which 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA is metabolized via the isomerase-dependent pathway (Fig. 1, pathway A), the apparent Km and Vmax values were determined for these three β-oxidation enzymes using substrates with and without the 5-cis double bond. The results, shown in TableI, demonstrate that the 5-cisdouble bond affects the activities of the three enzymes differently. With enoyl-CoA hydratase, a 3-fold higher Vmaxwas observed when the substrate contained the 5-cis double bond, while the Km was virtually unaffected. The opposite observation was made with 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which yielded a 4-fold higher Km value for the unsaturated as compared with the saturated substrate. However, the maximal velocity of this enzyme was unaffected by the presence of the 5-cis double bond. The most adverse effect was detected with 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, which exhibited with the unsaturated substrate only one-sixth of the maximal velocity obtained with the saturated substrate. In addition, the Km value was 5-fold higher when the 5-cis double bond was present in the substrate. These data demonstrate that 5-cis-enoyl-CoA intermediates can be directly metabolized by β-oxidation, but perhaps more slowly than the corresponding saturated metabolites.Table IThe influence of a 5-cis double bond in the substrate on the kinetic parameters of several enzymes of β-oxidationEnzymeSubstrateVmax1-aApparent values of Vmax and Km were determined at fixed concentrations of 1 mm NAD+ and 0.3 mm CoASH with 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and 0.3 mm CoASH with 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.

For other experimental details, see “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Since 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA can be metabolized by both the isomerase-dependent (Fig. 1 A) and reductase-dependent (Fig. 1 B) pathways, it was important to determine the relative fluxes via these two routes in mitochondria. For estimating the flux through the isomerase-dependent pathway, rates of NADH formation in the presence of NAD+ and CoASH but in the absence of NADPH were measured spectrophotometrically with a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria (see Fig. 2 A). Since initial velocities were determined, the simultaneous entry of substrate into the reductase-dependent pathway was assumed to have little or no effect on the rates of degradation via the isomerase-dependent pathway. Flux through the reductase-dependent pathway was determined by measuring spectrophotometrically the formation of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA at 300 nm (see Fig. 2 B) in the absence of coenzymes. A comparison of the data shown in Fig. 2, curves A and B, indicates that 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA is metabolized mostly (80%) by the isomerase-dependent pathway and to a lesser extent (20%) via the reductase-dependent route. When the rate of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA formation was measured in the presence of NAD+, CoASH, and pyruvate plus lactate dehydrogenase to reoxidize NADH, rates were lower by approximately 50% than those observed in the absence of coenzymes (compare curves B and C of Fig. 2). This decline in rates is attributed, at least in part, to the β-oxidation of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA via route C(see Fig. 1), which requires the involvement of enoyl-CoA isomerase and dienoyl-CoA isomerase, but not the reductase. The direct β-oxidation of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA, as outlined in Fig. 1 C, is possible, albeit at a low rate, because this intermediate has the 2-trans-4-trans configuration, which makes it a substrate of the mitochondrial β-oxidation system in contrast to the 2-trans-4-cis-isomer, which is not directly oxidized (14Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14140-14144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time-dependent β-oxidation of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA by a mitochondrial extract from rat liver mitochondria in the presence of NAD+, CoASH, and NADPH was analyzed by HPLC (see Fig. 3). Striking was the almost instantaneous hydration of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-5-octenoyl-CoA, the first metabolite of the isomerase-dependent pathway (see Fig. 3 A). Purified enoyl-CoA hydratase was used to determine the equilibrium ratio of 3-hydroxy-5-octenoyl-CoA to 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA. This ratio was found to be 6.4:1. One minute into the reaction, significant amounts of 3-keto-5-octenoyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA, the final product of the isomerase-dependent pathway, were detected (see Fig.3 B). At the same time, only small quantities of metabolites belonging to the reductase-dependent pathway had been formed (marked Δ3,5 and Δ2,4 in Fig.3 B). Hexanoyl-CoA, the final product of the reductase-dependent pathway, was detected toward the end of the reaction, when it constituted 18% of butyryl-CoA (see Fig.3 C). Since butyryl-CoA is also formed by the direct β-oxidation of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA, approximately 20% of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA is metabolized by the reductase-dependent pathway. The kinetic parameters (apparent Vmax and Km) of several β-oxidation enzymes that are present in a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria were determined with substrates having 5-cis double bonds. As is apparent from the data shown in Table II, the activity of enoyl-CoA hydratase with 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA as a substrate is at least 50-fold higher than the activity of the second most active enzyme in this group of β-oxidation enzymes in rat liver mitochondria. The hydratase activity is sufficiently high to maintain an equilibrium or a near equilibrium situation between 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA and its product of hydration. As a consequence, the effective concentration of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA in the isomerization reaction was only 14% of the expected concentration based on the flux through the pathway. Of the first three enzymes of pathway A (see Fig. 1), the least active one was 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. However, the specific activity of this enzyme was 6 times higher than the activity of enoyl-CoA isomerase, which is the enzyme that determines the rate at which intermediates enter the reductase-dependent pathway (see Fig.1 B). The relative activities of the rate-determining enzymes of the isomerase-dependent and reductase-dependent pathway explain the observed greater flux through the former than through the latter pathway. If pathway A would be inhibited, then a larger percentage of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA might enter pathway B. This hypothesis was tested by evaluating the effect of NADH on the fluxes through pathways A and B. Since NADH is a product inhibitor of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, the flux through pathway A should be inhibited, and more of the intermediate might enter pathway B. The results shown in Fig. 4, specifically the reduced formation of butyryl-CoA, prove the predicted inhibition of the flux through pathway A. However, the formation of hexanoyl-CoA via pathway B also was reduced, although only slightly, so that almost equal amounts of butyryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA were formed when either 0.5 or 1 mm NADH were present in the incubation mixture (see Fig. 4, B and C).Figure 3HPLC analysis of metabolites formed from 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA by a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria in the presence of NAD+, CoASH, and NADPH.

Since the equilibrium concentration of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA was found to be at least 20 times higher than the concentration of the 2,5-isomer, the rate of the Δ3,5→Δ2,5 isomerization was expected to be slow. An analysis of metabolites formed from 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA by a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria in the presence of NAD+ and CoASH revealed the rapid conversion of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA (see Fig.5 A) and the slower appearance of butyryl-CoA (see Fig. 5, B and C). This pattern of metabolite formation is indicative of the degradation of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA via pathway C, shown in Fig. 1. The absence of metabolites characteristic of pathway A suggests that butyryl-CoA was not formed via pathway A after the conversion of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA to 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA. When NADPH was present besides NAD+and CoASH, hexanoyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA were formed in a ratio of 3:2 (see Fig. 5 D). A similar ratio was observed when the rate of 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA utilization by a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria was determined in the presence of either NAD+, NADPH, and CoASH (B and C) or NAD+and CoASH (C) (see Fig. 6). This experiment revealed that 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA can be β-oxidized directly (see Fig. 1, pathway C) in addition to being degraded after the NADPH-dependent reduction of one double bond (see Fig. 1, pathway B). The fluxes through the two pathways are of similar magnitude, with the reductive branch facilitating a slightly faster flow than the direct oxidation. Although the above mentioned results are indicative of the degradation of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA via pathways B and C, a possible contribution of pathway A cannot be excluded. The possibility of a slow degradation of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA via pathway A (see Fig. 1) was evaluated by use of a β-oxidation system reconstituted from purified enzymes. All soluble β-oxidation enzymes necessary to degrade 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA via pathway A were combined at activity levels observed in a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria. The absence of dienoyl-CoA isomerase prevented the degradation via pathways B and C. When 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA was incubated with such a reconstituted β-oxidation system in the presence of NAD+ and CoASH, its rapid degradation via pathway A was observed, as indicated by the almost complete disappearance of the starting material within 1 min (see Fig. 7 A). In contrast, 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA, when incubated under identical conditions, remained mostly unaltered after the same incubation time (see Fig.7 B). However, small amounts of butyryl-CoA and 3-keto-5-octenoyl-CoA so detected are indicative of a slow degradation of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA via pathway A.Figure 6Rates of 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA utilization by a soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria as a function of the substrate concentration.

For details, see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The recognition that 2,5-dienoyl-CoAs, which are metabolites of unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds, can be degraded by the reductase-dependent pathway (see Fig. 1 B) (3Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), raised the question as to whether the isomerase-dependent pathway (see Fig. 1 A) is operative at all. If it is, the relative fluxes through both pathways needed to be determined. Should the reductase-dependent pathway not be essential for the rapid β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, then its metabolic function needs to be elucidated. The results of this study as well as data presented by Tserng et al. (7Tserng K.-Y. Chen L.-S. Jin S.-J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) demonstrate that 2,5-dienoyl-CoAs can be degraded via the isomerase-dependent pathway. A kinetic study of enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase revealed that the presence of a 5-cis double bond in the substrate had a positive effect on the hydration reaction but negatively affected the dehydrogenation reaction and the thiolytic cleavage. Most severely affected by the 5-cis double bond was 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. The Vmax value determined with 3-keto-5-octenoyl-CoA as the substrate was almost 6 times lower than the Vmax obtained with 3-ketooctanoyl-CoA. In addition, the Km for the substrate was 5 times higher when a 5-cis double bond was present in the acyl chain. In contrast, the Vmaxof 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was unaffected by the presence of a 5-cis double bond, whereas the Km for the unsaturated substrate was 4 times higher than the value for the saturated substrate. Since the activity of the dehydrogenase present in the soluble extract of rat liver mitochondria was found to be lower than the activity of the thiolase, it seems that the 5-cisdouble bond may have only a small, if any, impact on the flux of 5-cis enoyl-CoAs through this part of the β-oxidation spiral. Moreover, it remains to be established which segment of the total β-oxidation spiral limits the rate of fatty acid oxidation. If the the flux through the β-oxidation pathway is not limited by the degradation of medium chain intermediates, the lower activity of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase toward substrates with 5-cisdouble bonds would not affect the rate of unsaturated fatty acid oxidation. Since 2,5-dienoyl-CoAs can be metabolized via the isomerase-dependent (see Fig. 1 A) and the reductase-dependent (see Fig. 1 B) pathways, it was important to determine the contributions of both pathways to the metabolism of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA. The results of concentration-dependent and time-dependent measurements are indicative of a much slower flux through the reductase-dependent branch (20%) than through the isomerase-dependent branch (80%). The main reason for the slow degradation of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA via the reductase-dependent pathway is the low activity of enoyl-CoA isomerase toward 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA relative to the activity of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase with 3-hydroxy-5-octenoyl-CoA as a substrate in rat liver mitochondria. Moreover, the steady-state concentration of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA in an extract of rat liver mitochondria is low because of the high ratio of [3-hydroxy-5-octenoyl-CoA]/[2,5-octadienoyl-CoA] at equilibrium that is maintained because of the high activity of enoyl-CoA hydratase in rat liver mitochondria. However, a restriction in the flux through the isomerase-dependent pathway could result in an increased entry of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA into the reductase-dependent pathway. This possibility was explored by inhibiting 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase with NADH and studying the effect of this measure on product formation via both pathways. As expected, the flux through the isomerase-dependent pathway was reduced, but so was the degradation via the reductase-dependent pathway. However, the fluxes through both pathways, although reduced, were almost equal at [NADH]/[NAD+] ratios of 0.5 and 1. Thus, the relative contribution of the reductase-dependent pathway to the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds appears to be more significant when the intramitochondrial [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio is high, e.g. under conditions of restricted energy utilization. The results of this study do not agree with those of Tserng et al. (9Tserng K.-Y. Jin S.-J. Chen L.-S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), who concluded that in liver mitochondria 5-cis-enoates are metabolized essentially by the reductase-dependent pathway. However, different experimental approaches were used in these two studies. Tserng et al. analyzed intermediates of β-oxidation that were released from rat liver mitochondria, whereas this study relied on experiments with soluble extracts of liver mitochondria. Both experimental approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of using intact mitochondria is that the intramitochondrial organization of enzymes is maintained. However, the information provided by intermediates released from mitochondria is difficult, if not impossible to interpret, especially when the experiments are carried out under conditions of restricted respiration. A major concern is the reliance on the analysis of fatty acid oxidation intermediates that under physiological conditions do not accumulate or accumulate only to a very small extent (19Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Experiments with mitochondrial extracts have the advantage that coenzyme concentrations can be controlled and concentrations of true intermediates can be measured. The disadvantage is that the intramitochondrial organization of enzymes is lost. However, in the absence of detailed information about the operation of the two pathways, results obtained with mitochondrial extracts and isolated enzymes provide the more meaningful information. Ultimately, conclusions based on investigations with enzymes or enzyme systems will have to be verified by use of biological systems like isolated mitochondria or, better, intact cells that more closely reflect the in vivo situation. If the reductase-dependent pathway is not necessary to ensure the efficient β-oxidation of 5-enoyl-CoAs, it may serve another metabolic function. Experiments with 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA as a substrate indicated that this intermediate can be metabolized at a significant rate only by its conversion to 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA. The major reason for this situation is the greater thermodynamic stability of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA as compared with the 2,5-isomer. This difference in stabilities is reflected by a better than 20:1 ratio of [3,5-isomer]/[2,5-isomer] at equilibrium. Consequently, the reentry of the 3,5-isomer into the isomerase-dependent pathway is an energetically unfavorable reaction. The experiment with a system reconstituted from β-oxidation enzymes, except for dienoyl-CoA isomerase and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, demonstrated that the metabolism of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA via the isomerase-dependent pathway is very slow even when this compound is present at a high concentration. Because enoyl-CoA isomerase is essential for the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids, it is present in mitochondria and hence will catalyze the conversion of 2,5-dienoyl-CoAs to their 3,5-isomers. Once formed, 3,5-dienoyl-CoAs cannot be metabolized efficiently via the isomerase-dependent pathway. Therefore, these intermediates must be metabolized via the reductase-dependent pathway, or they would accumulate and thereby tie up free coenzyme A. Consequently, the concentration of free mitochondrial coenzyme A would decline with the result that all oxidative pathways in mitochondria would be inhibited. Obviously, such a deleterious consequence of the unintended Δ2,5→Δ3,5 isomerization must be prevented. Since dienoyl-CoA isomerase ensures the removal of 3,5-dienoyl-CoAs, it may be present in mitochondria (4Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chen L.-S. Jin S.-J. Tserng K.-Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10527-10534Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and peroxisomes (6He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as a detoxification enzyme. An interesting finding of this study was the observation that 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA can be degraded by β-oxidation without being first reduced by 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (see Fig. 1 C). This result is not completely surprising, since it had been reported that 2-trans-4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA can be directly oxidized, whereas the 4-cis-2-trans-isomer can only be degraded after reduction by 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (14Cuebas D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14140-14144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the reduction of 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA is more rapid than its direct β-oxidation, both pathways contribute significantly to the degradation of this metabolite. Hence, the term “reductase-dependent pathway” referring to the branch initiated by enoyl-CoA isomerase is not correct. A better term would be “dienoyl-CoA isomerase-dependent pathway,” because this enzyme is essential for the formation of 2,4-octadienoyl-CoA. However, since the term “reductase-dependent pathway” is simple and well established, it will be retained with the understanding that it refers to the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acid with odd-numbered double bonds via a sequence of reactions with 2,4-dienoyl-CoA as intermediate.

https://openalex.org/W2033455138,"We recently identified a novel factor involved in cellular iron assimilation called SFT or Stimulator ofFe Transport (Gutierrez, J. A., Yu, J., Rivera, S., and Wessling-Resnick, M. (1997) J. Cell Biol.149, 895–905). When stably expressed in HeLa cells, SFT was found to stimulate the uptake of both transferrin- and nontransferrin-bound Fe (iron). Assimilation of nontransferrin-bound Fe by HeLa cells stably expressing SFT was time- and temperature-dependent; both the rate and extent of uptake was enhanced relative to the activity of control nontransfected cells. Although the apparent Km for Fe uptake was unaffected by expression of SFT (5.6 versus5.1 μm measured for control), the Vmax of transport was increased from 7.0 to 14.7 pmol/min/mg protein. Transport mediated by SFT was inhibitable by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and ferrozine, Fe3+- and Fe2+-specific chelators. Because cellular copper status is known to influence Fe assimilation, we investigated the effects of Cu (copper) depletion on SFT function. After 4 days of culture in Cu-deficient media, HeLa cell Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase activity was reduced by more than 60%. Both control cells and cells stably expressing SFT displayed reduced Fe uptake as well; levels of transferrin-mediated import fell by ∼80%, whereas levels of nontransferrin-bound Fe uptake were ∼50% that of Cu-replete cells. The failure of SFT expression to stimulate Fe uptake above basal levels in Cu-depleted cells suggests a critical role for Cu in SFT function. A current model for both transferrin- and nontransferrin-bound Fe uptake involves the function of a ferrireductase that acts to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+, with subsequent transport of the divalent cation across the membrane bilayer. SFT expression did not enhance levels of HeLa cell surface reductase activity; however, Cu depletion was found to reduce endogenous activity by 60%, suggesting impaired ferrireductase function may account for the influence of Cu depletion on SFT-mediated Fe uptake. To test this hypothesis, the ability of SFT to directly mediate Fe2+ import was examined. Although expression of SFT enhanced Fe2+ uptake by HeLa cells, Cu depletion did not significantly reduce this activity. Thus, we conclude that a ferrireductase activity is required for SFT function in Fe3+ transport and that Cu depletion reduces cellular iron assimilation by affecting this activity.

Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that Tf-dependent and -independent import involves at least two functional activities as follows: a ferrireductase that converts Fe3+ to Fe2+ and a carrier mechanism that subsequently translocates Fe2+ across membrane bilayers (3Nunez M.T.

Genetic studies in yeast have begun to identify a number of factors involved in membrane transport of Fe, and at least two uptake systems have been characterized: a high affinity transport mechanism involving FTR1 and FET3 (9Askwith C.

Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and a low affinity activity provided by FET4 (11Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, two ferrireductases, FRE1 and FRE2, are known to play a role in yeast iron transport (13Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Whereas FET4 can mediate the import of Fe2+ in the absence of ferrireductase activity (11Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FTR1 is believed to be a transporter for iron that has been first reduced by FRE1 (or FRE2) and then oxidized by the multi-copper oxidase FET3 (2DeSilva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). However, although it is presumed that FET3-oxidized Fe3+ is then translocated across the yeast membrane, the exact valency of transported iron and the precise function of FTR1 remain poorly defined. Nonetheless, an interesting connection between Cu and Fe metabolism has been revealed by the observation that FTR1 biosynthesis is impaired in the absence of Cu-requiring FET3 (10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The relationship between Cu and Fe transport in yeast (2DeSilva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) is highly reminiscent of the role of copper for iron metabolism in mammals (15Winzerling J.J. Law J.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Dietary Cu deficiency leads to microcytic hypochromic anemia (16Lee G.R. Nacht S. Lukens J.N. Cartwright G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47: 2058-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Owen C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 224: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Van Den Berg G.J. Van Houwelingen F. Lemmens A.G. Beynen A.C. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1992; 35: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar); this apparent iron deficiency appears to be promoted by the loss of oxidase activity provided by circulating ceruloplasmin, a Cu-requiring enzyme (19Harris Z.L. Takahashi Y. Miyajima H. Serizawa M. MacGillivray R.T.A. Gitlin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2539-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar).Although progress in characterizing the proteins involved in yeast Fe transport has been made, relatively little is known about mammalian uptake systems. Recently, two factors were identified to be involved in this process. DCT1 (or nRAMP2) was defined to function in rat intestinal iron uptake by the functional expression cloning of Fe2+ transport activity in Xenopus oocytes (20Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 338: 482-487Crossref Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mk mouse, which suffers from microcytic anemia due to inefficient iron absorption (21Edwards J.A. Hoke J.E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1972; 141: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), was found to have a defect in the nRAMP2 gene; this missense mutation is predicted to impair nRAMP2 transport function (22Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). DCT1/nRAMP2 appears not only to mediate uptake of Fe2+, but it is capable of facilitating the translocation of other divalent cations as well (20Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 338: 482-487Crossref Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). In contrast, a second transport protein that we have identified, called SFT orStimulator of Fe Transport, enables Xenopus oocytes to take up iron presented as Fe3+, and this activity is inhibited by Cd2+but not other divalent cations (23Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our preliminary investigation of SFT function in mammalian cells revealed its capacity to also stimulate the assimilation of Fe from the Tf-mediated pathway. Here, we report a more detailed functional characterization of the stimulation of SFT of non-Tf-bound Fe uptake in mammalian cells. These studies define the function of SFT in promoting the uptake of iron presented to cells as either Fe2+ or Fe3+. Furthermore, we explored the potential role of copper for the activity of SFT by depleting cells in culture with Cu-deficient media (24Tong K.K. Hannigan B.M. McKerr G. Br. J. Nutr. 1996; 75: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that Cu depletion decreases both Tf- and non-Tf-bound Fe uptake by HeLa cells and that the function of SFT is impaired under these conditions. Cu depletion was also found to partially inhibit a cell surface ferrireductase, implicating a role for this activity in SFT-mediated import of Fe3+. This idea is strongly supported by the finding that SFT-stimulated Fe2+ uptake is unaffected in Cu-depleted cells.DISCUSSIONThe stimulation of non-Tf-bound Fe transport by SFT has all of the features previously described for Tf-independent transport by K562 (26Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HeLa (30Sturrock A. Alexander J. Lamb J. Craven C.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3139-3145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cells. Uptake is time- and temperature-dependent, inhibited by Cd2+, blocked by Fe3+ and Fe2+ chelators, and appears specific for the cation rather than its anionic ligand. Moreover, SFT function in Tf-independent transport also appears to depend on cell surface ferrireductase activity, as previously characterized for uptake of ferric iron (5Inman R.S. Coughlan M.M. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11850-11857Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Jordan I. Kaplan J. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16046-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observations that HeLa(SFT) cells display a Vmax two times greater than non-transfected HeLa cells and that levels of SFT expression are approximately doubled in the stably transfected cell line directly support the hypothesis that SFT itself is a membrane carrier for iron. Indeed, SFT is an integral membrane protein localized to the plasma membrane and endosomal domains (23Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); its expression stimulates both Tf-dependent and -independent Fe assimilation (see Fig. 5), and it contains an RE XXE domain putatively involved in Fe binding (10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Mutation of these critical glutamic acid residues results in the loss of function of SFT (23Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), further implicating a direct role for SFT in the translocation of Fe across membrane bilayers. Despite the strength of this combined evidence, however, it is important to keep in mind the consideration that the enhanced non-Tf-bound Fe uptake by HeLa(SFT) cells could be a secondary consequence of SFT expression. Recent controversies surrounding the precise role for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in ATP transport reflect similar concerns (35Devidas S. Guggino W.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Until rigorous evidence is obtained through reconstitution studies, the precise role of SFT in the transmembrane transport of Fe may remain elusive (see below).The complexities associated with membrane transport of Fe have been revealed by genetic studies in yeast. Multiple carrier mechanisms have been defined (9Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). FET4, for example, appears to play a direct role in the uptake of Fe2+ (12Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); this activity resembles the function of the rodent DCT1/nRAMP2 transporter in intestinal iron uptake (20Gunshin H.

It is likely that the latter transporter may play a role in endosomal transport of Fe as well since it has been discovered that the Belgrade rat, which has genetic defects in the release of Tf-bound Fe from endosomes (36Garrick M.D. Gniecko K. Liu Y. Cohan D.S. Garrick L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14867-14874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), harbors the exact same mutation in DCT1/nRAMP2 as the mk mouse (37Fleming M.D. Romano M.A. Su M.A. Garrick L.M. Garrick M.D. Andrews N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). One notable difference is the ability of DCT1/nRAMP2 to mediate uptake of other divalent cations (20Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 338: 482-487Crossref Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). The idea that a common carrier exists to translocate iron and other metals across the plasma membrane is consistent with observations made for uptake by reticulocytes (38Morgan E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 943: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), HeLa cells (30Sturrock A. Alexander J. Lamb J. Craven C.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 269: G570-G576PubMed Google Scholar) but contrasts with our studies of K562 cells that suggest this erythroleukemia cell line has distinct transport properties (26Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity for Fe by FET4 not only resembles the characteristics of a second yeast iron transport mechanism involving FET3 and FTR1 but also parallels the properties we have defined for SFT, which was identified by screening a K562 cell cDNA library (23Gutierrez J.A. Yu J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Both FET4 and FET3/FTR1 depend on the function of FRE1, a yeast ferrireductase, to transport Fe3+ (13Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Similarly, our investigation demonstrates a strong dependence on HeLa cell surface ferrireductase activity for SFT's stimulation of non-Tf-bound Fe3+ uptake. This correlation is revealed by the finding that Cu depletion impairs ferrireductase function and that expression of SFT is unable to compensate for the loss in Fe3+ uptake under these conditions (Fig. 5).Certain facets of the yeast FTR1/FET3 iron uptake system are comparable to elements associated with SFT function. FTR1 and SFT are both integral membrane proteins containing six transmembrane-spanning domains and are of similar size (∼40 kDa). Both of these putative carriers have RE XXE motifs that Stearman et al.(10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) speculate may be involved in iron binding. In contrast, FET4 lacks the appearance of similar motifs within its primary sequence and has a greater mass of 63 kDa (11Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of both FTR1 and SFT in the transport of ferric iron also appear to depend on Cu. However, our investigation reveals clear mechanistic distinctions between yeast and man in the relationship of Cu in cellular iron uptake.The importance of Cu in yeast Fe transport is believed to be associated with its activity as a cofactor for FET3. FET3 was identified early in the search for membrane carriers of iron (9Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar); in a concurrent search for iron transport proteins, Dancis et al. (34Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) uncovered the necessity for a copper transport protein, CTR1. The connection between FET3 and CTR1 was revealed by the findings that FET3 was a multicopper oxidase (9Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and that although Δctr1Δfet3 yeast strains were unable to take up Fe2+, activity could be restored to Δctr1yeast grown in high copper media (34Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Later studies also defined the requirement for an intracellular Cu transporter, CCC2 (41Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Finally, the role of FTR1 in FET3-mediated iron uptake was defined by Klausner and colleagues (10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) when they characterized yeast transport mutants that phenotypically resembled fet3 mutants but had defects that could not be compensated for by addition of excess Cu to the growth medium. FTR1 appears to be required for FET3 expression and loading with copper (10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar); elimination of the FTR1 gene results in a block in FET3 biosynthesis and expression at the cell surface, whereas FET3 deletion mutants reciprocally cannot express FTR1 at the plasma membrane. The idea that FTR1 is an iron transporter is supported by the finding that mutants in its RE XXE domain cannot take up iron despite the fact that FET3 oxidase activity is unimpaired (10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar).The multifactorial nature of Fe3+ uptake by yeast, requiring FRE1, FET4, or FTR1/FET3, as well as the Cu-transporting proteins CTR1 and CCC2, emphasizes the concerns raised earlier regarding the exact role of SFT in mammalian non-Tf-bound Fe transport. Individually, each of these yeast genes appears to modulate iron assimilation and could serve as stimulators of Fe transport. To this end, a complete description of yeast Fe import also remains elusive since iron is required for growth, and fet3fet4 deletion strains, predicted to be defective in both of the pathways described above, are still capable of survival (2DeSilva D.M. Askwith C.C. Kaplan J. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Dix D. Bridgham J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Similar to the mechanism of Fe uptake in yeast, Cu depletion of HeLa cells also results in defective Tf- and non-Tf-bound iron assimilation (Fig. 5), yet our studies demonstrate that at least for the latter activity, impaired cell surface ferrireductase function can account for this loss (Fig. 6). Although it is possible that a ferroxidase activity analogous to FET3 could be compromised by Cu deficiency, under our assay conditions both basal and SFT-stimulated Fe2+ uptake remains unperturbed. Because oxidation of Fe2+ by FET3 is apparently required for FTR1 function in yeast (10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), we conclude that if a similar activity is involved in SFT-mediated iron uptake, it is unlikely to be dependent on cellular Cu status.This investigation yields two related findings regarding the function of SFTs: 1) SFT stimulates the import of iron presented as either Fe2+ or Fe3+, and 2) it is unlikely that SFT simply acts as a ferrireductase to stimulate Fe uptake. Because our results clearly demonstrate that Cu depletion inhibits ferric iron uptake and that ferrireduction is impaired under these conditions, we conclude that SFT-mediated Fe transport is downstream of the cell surface ferrireductase activity, but whether its activity stimulates the membrane translocation of ferrous iron alone is uncertain. As discussed above, FRE1/2 ferrireductase activity is required for yeast iron uptake when presented in the ferric form (13Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), yet the activity of the FET3 oxidase is also necessary for the role of FTR1s in transport; these observations prompted Stearman et al. (10Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) to suggest that FTR1 may bind both Fe2+ and Fe3+ during its mechanism of transmembrane transport. Importantly, the yeast reductase FRE1 has been identified to be a b-type cytochrome similar to the NADPH oxidase gp91phox. Shatwell et al. (42Shatwell K.P. Dancis A. Cross A.R. Klausner R.D. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14240-14244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have reported biophysical characteristics of FRE1 indicating that it is a heme protein; this is consistent with early investigations of Lesuisse and Labbe (43Lesuisse E. Labbe P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar) in which they describe the lack of ferrireductase activity in heme-deficient yeast strains. In this context, analogies in the role of copper for ferric iron uptake between yeast and man possibly may be drawn since Cu deficiency is known to impair heme biosynthesis (see Ref. 33Chan W.Y. Rennert O.M. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1980; 10: 338-344PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Therefore, one may speculate that the influence of Cu depletion on HeLa cell Fe uptake may result from defective heme synthesis leading to the loss of a cytochrome b-like cell surface ferrireductase. Further experimentation is required to fully elucidate the role of Cu in mammalian iron assimilation and its exact function in SFT-mediated transport. Mammalian cells can acquire iron either via the binding of Fe2-transferrin (Tf) 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; SFT, stimulator of Fe transport; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NTA, nitriloacetic acid; SOD, superoxide dismutase; Fe, iron; Cu, copper; TRIEN, TriethylenetetramineTM. 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; SFT, stimulator of Fe transport; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NTA, nitriloacetic acid; SOD, superoxide dismutase; Fe, iron; Cu, copper; TRIEN, TriethylenetetramineTM. to high affinity surface receptors and its subs"

We show that the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) and benzothiophene-2-carboxamide, 5-methoxy-3-(1-methyl ethoxy)-1-oxide (PD 144795) block the induction of p53 and NF-κB binding to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by the T cell receptor activator phytohemagglutinin. CsA and PD 144795 also inhibit the induction by phytohemagglutinin of the transcription mediated by an HIV-1 LTR fragment containing the p53 and NF-κB sites. These effects of PD 144795 on HIV-1 transcription correlate with its ability to inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and are similar to those previously described for CsA. Moreover, a constitutive active form of calcineurin is able to induce expression from the HIV-1 LTR in a p53- and NF-κB-dependent manner and PD 144795 is able to block this induction. These results demonstrate that the DNA binding of p53 to the HIV-1 LTR can be modulated by calcineurin and provide a framework to understand the anti-HIV properties of benzothiophene derivatives.

Originally, these compounds were shown to block expression of cellular adhesion molecules and to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties (1Boschelli D.H. Kramer J.B. Khatana S.S. Sorenson R.J.

Recently, benzothiophene derivatives were shown to block HIV-1 transcription in response to tumor necrosis factor α stimulation of promyelocytes (2Butera S.T. Roberts B.D. Critchfield J.W. Fang G. McQuade T. Gracheck S.J. Folks T.M. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 758-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, these compounds blocked constitutive HIV-1 transcription in chronically infected cells and induced a latency state in cytokine-activated cells. The benzothiophene derivatives did not block the activation of NF-κB in response to tumor necrosis factor α treatment and did not block Tat function (2Butera S.T. Roberts B.D. Critchfield J.W. Fang G. McQuade T. Gracheck S.J. Folks T.M. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 758-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have studied the effects of PD 144795 (Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals) (Fig. 1) on HIV-1 LTR-directed transcription in Jurkat T cells. The expression of HIV-1 genes is controlled in part by the interaction of sequence-specific transcription factors with the LTR region of the provirus. NF-κB, Sp1, and other sequence-specific transcription factors have been shown to control transcription initiation directed by HIV LTR (3Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev.

We have recently identified an inducible form of p53 in Jurkat T cells that directly interacts with a specific DNA-binding site positioned immediately downstream to the most 5′ Sp1-binding site in the HIV-1 LTR (5Gualberto A.

We have also shown that this DNA element mediates the induction of the HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity by tumor promoting mutant forms of p53 (5Gualberto A. Hixon M.L. Finco T.S. Perkins N.D. Nabel G.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results provide a mechanism to explain the dramatic increase in HIV-1 replication observed after the overexpression of mutant p53 in cells that completely lack expression of this protein (7Duan L. Ozaki I. Oakes J.W. Taylor J.P. Khalili K. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4302-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that the replication of the HIV-1 virus in lymphocytes correlates with the activation/proliferation status of the infected cell (8McDougal J.S. Mawle A. Cort S.P. Nicholson J.K.

Previous reports have indicated that ligands of the TCR activate LTR-dependent transcription through a CsA-sensitive mechanism (12Tong-Starkesen S.E. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. J.

CsA, through its interaction with cyclophilin (reviewed in Ref. 15Fruman D.A. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), acts as an strong inhibitor of the serine/threonine phosphatase CN (16Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I.

This enzyme is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a 59-kDa catalytic subunit, calcineurin A subunit, a calcium-binding regulatory subunit of 19 kDa, calcineurin B subunit, and a 17-kDa calcium-binding protein, calmodulin. CN plays a critical role in the regulation of calcium-dependent signaling pathways that are necessary for T cell activation (16Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L.

This enzyme regulates the nuclear translocation of NF-ATp, a transcription factor implicated in the expression of several cytokines (20Rao A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Also, CN inhibitors are known to decrease HIV-1 viral replication and to inhibit HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcription (12Tong-Starkesen S.E. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. J.

Inhibition of NF-κB binding to the LTR region of the HIV-1 provirus has been suggested as the mechanism by which CN inhibitors would repress the transcriptional activity mediated by this promoter (14Schmidt A. Hennighausen L. Siebenlist U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the relatively large number of genes whose expression is modulated by CN inhibitors in T cells (23Gunter K.C. Irving S.G. Zipfel P.F. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3286-3291PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zipfel P.F. Irving S.G. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) suggests that, in addition to NF-AT and NF-κB, other transcription factors could be affected by these drugs. In this study we have investigated the effect of CsA and PD 144795 on the transcriptional activity mediated by p53 and NF-κB. Using several approaches we demonstrate that calcineurin is implicated in the regulation of p53 transcriptional activity, that PD 144795 is an inhibitor of calcineurin, and that the DNA binding and transactivation of p53 to the HIV-1 LTR can be modulated by calcineurin inhibitors. These results offer insight into the understanding of the molecular basis for the inflammatory and anti-HIV properties of benzothiophene derivatives. Compound PD 144795 (Fig.1) was synthesized by Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research as described previously (1Boschelli D.H. Kramer J.B. Khatana S.S. Sorenson R.J. Connor D.T. Ferin M.A. Wright C.D.

DNA oligonucleotides were prepared with an Applied Biosystems 391EP DNA synthesizer using the phosphoramidite method, and purified by Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Associates). p53 gel shift mobility assays were prepared as follows: a 10-μl reaction volume containing the binding reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol) and 1–2 μg of protein nuclear extract was mixed with 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 0.2 ng of radiolabeled probes and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were loaded onto a 3.8% polyacrylamide gel previously prerun for 15 min. The NF-κB HIV-1 EMSA sequence was as follows (double strand): CGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGG. NF-κB EMSA reactions were prepared as described previously (25Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Jurkat T leukemia cells from ATCC were cultured at 0.1–0.5 × 105 cells/ml in α-minimal essential medium, 2% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (Irvine), and penicillin/streptomycin. When incubations were performed, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in new media at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated as indicated. Incubations were stopped by centrifugation and cells were processed for the preparation of nuclear extracts as described (25Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but a final concentration of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was used. Extracts were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. For transfection experiments, Jurkat or CEM lymphocytes were transfected by electroporation at 5 × 106 cells, 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 10 ml of media. Incubations were carried out for 24–48 h. Cells were lysed by a 3-s ultrasonic vibration at 4 °C using a Branson Sonifier at setting 3. Equal amounts of protein, as determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), were then analyzed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity using the fluor diffusion assay (27Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. Biotechniques. 1992; 5: 444-448Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared as follows: 106 Jurkat lymphocytes per experimental condition were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg of protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were disrupted by freeze/thaw and extracts cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Peptide substrate (Peninsula Laboratories) was as in Hubbard and Klee (28Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Wheal H. Chad J. Molecular Neurobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 135-157Google Scholar). CN activity was determined in the presence of 100 nm calmodulin and 5 μm32P-labeled phosphopeptide in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 20 μl of cell lysate. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and stopped by the adition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. Phosphate was isolated by Dowex AG 1-X8 chromatography and quantitated by scintillation counting. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured as previously reported (29Feldbush T.L. Lafrenz D. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3690-3695PubMed Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay (Boehringer Mannheim). The HIV-1 LTR contains a binding site for a proliferation-associated form of p53 (5Gualberto A. Hixon M.L. Finco T.S. Perkins N.D. Nabel G.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The p53 protein bound to this site is in a proliferative or mutant-like unfolded state based on recognition by specific monoclonal antibodies. This DNA region mediates the induction of the HIV-1 LTR by tumor necrosis factor α and by transforming mutant forms of p53. Importantly, tumor necrosis factor α induces a physical interaction between p53 and Sp1 and this interaction is required for the induction of HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcription by this cytokine (6Gualberto A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19680-19683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We investigated whether or not p53/Sp1 binding to the HIV-1 LTR is also induced by activation of the T cell receptor. For that purpose, we performed EMSA using an oligonucleotide probe (LTR B), CAGGGAGGCGTGGCCT GGGCGGGACTGGGG, that contains the composite p53 (underlined) and Sp1 (italics) site in the HIV-1 LTR, and nuclear extracts prepared from Jurkat T cells either unstimulated or stimulated with PHA (Fig.2 A). Incubation with PHA induced the appearance of two complexes, which we called PIC 1 and 2 (Fig. 2 A). Subsequent experiments indicated that maximal complex formation by PHA was obtained at a 5-h incubation time (not shown). To confirm that these complexes contain p53 and Sp1, extracts were incubated with antibodies against these proteins prior to the mobility shift assay. Monoclonal anti-p53 PAb 421 and polyclonal anti-Sp1 demonstrated that p53 was present in PIC 1 and 2 while Sp1 was detected only in PIC 1 (Fig. 2 B). A supershift was obtained with the anti-Sp1 antibody, whereas disruption of Sp1/p53 binding to the LTR was observed with the anti-p53 antibody PAb 421. We have previously shown that PAb 421 specifically blocks p53 interaction with LTR B p53/Sp1 composite site (6Gualberto A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19680-19683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments were directed to determine if the PHA-inducible binding of p53/Sp1 to the HIV-1 LTR is sensitive to pharmacological modification. We performed EMSA with nuclear extracts of Jurkat T cells incubated with PHA and exposed to a series of pharmacological agents. Incubation of Jurkat cells for 30 min with CsA or PD 144795 blocked the induction of PICs by PHA, however, incubation with pentoxifylline (data not shown), an NF-κB inhibitor (30Biswas D.K. Dezube B.J. Ahlers C.M. Pardee A.B. J. AIDS. 1993; 6: 778-786PubMed Google Scholar), or the immunosuppressant rapamycin (15Fruman D.A. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) had no effect (Fig. 2 C). Other 5-methoxybenzothiophene derivatives had minor or no effect on PIC formation (not shown). Also, titration experiments indicated that inhibition of the induction of the p53·Sp1 complexes was reached at 3 μm PD 144795 and 0.5 μg/ml CsA (not shown). As a control, the nuclear extracts used in Fig. 2 C were tested for their ability to bind the HLA DRα octamer site using an oligonucleotide sequence from this gene (46Peterlin B.M. Hardy K.J. Larsen A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1967-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). No effect of CsA or PD 144795 was detected on Oct-1 binding (Fig. 2 D). The identity of the Oct-1 complex was determined by supershift with an anti-Oct-1 antibody (not shown). CsA and PD 144795 also inhibited the induction of p53·Sp1 complexes in another T cell line, CEM, when these cells were incubated in the presence of the calcium ionophore A23187 (47Weiss A. Imboden J. Shoback D. Stobo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4169-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) (not shown). Finally, the effect of CsA and PD 144795 was specific for the TCR-dependent signal and no effect of these compounds was detected when Sp1·p53 complexes were induced by the incubation of the Jurkat cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (Fig.2 E). Previous reports have shown that CsA inhibits the induction by calcium-dependent signals of the DNA binding activity of the transcription factors NF-AT and NF-κB (14Schmidt A. Hennighausen L. Siebenlist U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R.

Immunopathol. 1996; 80: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). An inhibition of NF-κB by PD 144795 could be critical for HIV-1 replication, as NF-κB is a major regulator of HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcription (34Garcia J. Gaynor R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 157-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35Alcami J. Lain de Lera T. Folgueira L. Pedraza M.A. Jacque J.M. Bachelerie F. Noriega A.R. Hay R.T. Harrich D. Gaynor R.B. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1552-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We tested whether or not PD 144795 was able to block the induction by PHA of NF-κB binding to its recognition sequence in the HIV-1 LTR. Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells, incubated as described above, were assayed by EMSA using an oligonucleotide probe containing the HIV-1 LTR NF-κB II site. A typical result of these experiments is shown in Fig.3 A. Two specific complexes were identified using this probe. The faster mobility complex contained NF-κB-p50/p50 homodimers whereas the slower mobility complex was comprised of NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers as indicated by supershift with specific anti-NF-κB antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Incubation of Jurkat cells with PHA increased p50/p65 binding while a minor effect was observed on p50/p50 homodimers. PD 144795, as well as CsA, inhibited the PHA-induced increase in the levels of p50/p65 heterodimers. No effect of these drugs was observed on the binding of p50/p50 homodimers. The decrease in p50/p65 binding to a basal or lower than basal level was observed in several experiments (not shown). A certain variability in the level of basal p50/p65 binding was observed, probably resulting from activation of NF-κB by growth factors present in the serum. CsA and PD 144795 also inhibited NF-κB p50/p65 binding in CEM lymphocytes when these cells were incubated in the presence of the calcium ionophore A23187 (47Weiss A. Imboden J. Shoback D. Stobo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4169-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) but not in the presence of PMA (not shown). In summary, these results indicate that CsA and PD 144795 specifically inhibit the activation by PHA of p53 and NF-κB binding to the HIV-1 LTR. Intriguingly, these results suggested that both compounds interfere with a common signal transduction pathway that regulates transcription factors that are critical for the expression of the HIV-1 promoter. To test the sensitivity of the p53 and NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activities to CsA and PD 144795 in vivo, transfection experiments were performed in Jurkat T cells using the reporter plasmid −121,+232 HIV-1 LTR CAT that contains the HIV-1 LTR κB II and p53 sites (5Gualberto A. Hixon M.L. Finco T.S. Perkins N.D. Nabel G.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After a 24-h incubation period, transfected cells were aliquoted and incubated with PHA alone or in the presence of CsA or PD 144795 for an additional 48 h. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig.4 A. Incubation of the cells with PHA and CsA or PD 144795 reduced CAT activity to approximately 50% of PHA alone. However, the PMA induction of the transcriptional activity mediated by this promoter fragment was not altered by the incubation with CsA or PD 144795. Consistent with the idea of a common role for PD 144795 and CsA, we observed that the activation of an interleukin-2 reporter plasmid by calcium-dependent signals was inhibited by PD 144795 and CsA (not shown). These results parallel the signal-specific inhibition by CsA and PD 144795 of p53 and NF-κB binding in vitro. To define the HIV-1 LTR DNA elements that are targeted by PD 144795 and CsA, we tested the effect of these compounds on the activity of NF-κB/p53-E1BTATA CAT, a minimal promoter-reporter plasmid that contains a 32-base pair HIV-1 LTR fragment comprising the NF-κB II and the proliferative p53 sites subcloned upsteam of an heterologous TATA element. PD 144795 and CsA inhibited the PHA, but not the PMA induction of NF-κB/p53-E1BTATA CAT activity in Jurkat T cells (Fig.4 B). PD 144795 and CsA did not affect the basal activity of the minimal promoter element at the concentrations used in these experiments (not shown). As a control we investigated the effect of CsA and PD 144795 on the transcriptional activity mediated by PG13, a CAT reporter plasmid containing 13 copies of an RGC consensus (antiproliferative) p53-binding site. We transfected primary human fibroblasts with PG13 and incubated these cells with the DNA synthesis inhibitor phosphono-l-acetyl aspartate because this compound induces the transcriptional activity mediated by consensus p53 sites. 2A. Gualberto, unpublished data. Neither CsA nor PD 144795 altered the induction of PG13 activity by phosphono-l-acetyl aspartate (Fig. 4 C). No effect of PD 144795 or CsA was observed on the basal expression of PG13 (not shown). These experiments further demonstrated that PD 144795 and CsA target a common signal transduction pathway that mediates the activation of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and proliferative p53 by ligands of the TCR. Since engagement of the TCR activates HIV-1 LTR-mediated transcription through a calcineurin-dependent pathway (12Tong-Starkesen S.E. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 702-707PubMed Google Scholar, 13Siekevitz M. Josephs S.F. Dukovich M. Peffer N. Wong-Staal F. Greene W.C. Science. 1987; 238: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 14Schmidt A. Hennighausen L. Siebenlist U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and since benzothiophene showed similar properties to CsA, we tested the effect of PD 144795 on the activity of calcineurin, the enzymatic activity that is targeted by CsA (16Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3615) Google Scholar, 17Friedman J. Weissman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 799-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Incubation of Jurkat cells with PD 144795 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin (Fig.5 A). PD 144795 did not decrease the activity of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, indicating that this compound was not toxic to the cells (Fig. 5 A). PD 144795 and CsA also inhibited the activity of calcineurin in Jurkat cell extracts (Fig. 5 B). However, they did not affect the activity of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 5 B, inset), indicating that the effect of PD 144795 on calcineurin was specific. Thus, our results demonstrate that PD 144795 targets the same enzymatic activity as CsA, suggesting that inhibition of calcineurin is a common mechanism of action of both drugs that explains their similar effect on the transcriptional activity of p53 and NF-κB. Current experiments in our laboratory indicate that PD 144795 has additional effects on early events associated with the activation of the TCR. For example, low concentrations of PD 144795 induced a slow and steady increase in the intracellular calcium levels in T lymphocytes and inhibited the PHA-induced rise of intracellular calcium in these cells. 3R. Montaño and F. Sobrino, unpublished data. The effect of PD 144795 on the activity of calcineurin was further investigated by experiments of overexpression of this enzyme in vivo. It has been shown that overexpression of calcineurin in Jurkat cells renders them more resistant to the effects of CsA and FK 506 (48Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3689-3690Crossref Scopus (755) Google Scholar), another calcineurin-inhibitor agent, and augments both NF-AT- and NF-interleukin-2A-dependent transcription (18O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neil E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 19Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). We co-transfected −121,+232 HIV-1 LTR CAT with pSRα-ΔCAM, a pSRα expression vector containing a constitutively active form of calcineurin, in Jurkat cells and normal human fibroblasts. Calcineurin induced the transcriptional activity of this HIV-1 LTR fragment in both cell types (Fig. 5 C). A higher induction was obtained in fibroblasts (15-fold) than in Jurkat cells (6-fold). Incubation of the cells with PD 144795 inhibited the effect of calcineurin in a dose-response manner. Fibroblasts were more sensitive than Jurkat cells to the inhibition by PD 144795. Half-maximal inhibition of CAT activity by PD 144795 was reached at approximately at 0.2 μm in normal human fibroblasts and 1 μm in Jurkat cells. A possible explanation for the cell-type difference in the response to PD 144795 could be the existence of a mutant p53 allele in the Jurkat cells (36Cheng J. Haas M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5502-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This mutant p53 protein may already display in basal conditions the conformation necessary for the interaction with HIV-1 LTR. Alternatively, Jurkat T cells may carry other genetic alterations that result in a certain degree of constitutive activation of NF-κB or p53. Interestingly, low concentrations of PD 144795 (0.3 μm) induced a moderate activation of −121,+232 HIV-1 LTR CAT in both cell types. This paradoxical effect may result from an indirect activation of endogenous calcineurin by PD 144795 secondary to an increase in the intracellular calcium levels induced by low concentrations of the drug. This effect disappeared at higher concentrations of PD 144795 as it was expected from its inhibitory effect on calcineurin activity in vivo (Fig. 5 A). The effect of the low concentration of PD 144795 was not observed in cells transfected with pSRα-ΔCAM. This calcineurin mutant is not affected by alterations in the intracellular calcium levels (18O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neil E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Finally, since PD 144795 inhibits calcineurin and the transcriptional activity mediated by NF-κB and p53, we investigated whether or not calcineurin is involved in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and p53. For that purpose, we co-transfected CEM cells with a wild type HIV-1 LTR CAT reporter or HIV-1 LTR CAT plasmids with mutated NF-κB or p53 sites and the pSRα or pSRα-ΔCAM expression vectors. The results of these experiments are shown in the Fig. 6. As expected, the activated form of calcineurin induced HIV-1 LTR CAT in this cell type. Importantly, mutagenesis of the NF-κB or p53 sites completely abolished the induction of HIV-1 LTR activity by calcineurin, indicating that the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and p53 can be modulated in a calcineurin-dependent manner. Previous reports have indicated that calcineurin inhibitors modulate NF-κB transcriptional activity (14Schmidt A. Hennighausen L. Siebenlist U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Brini A.T. Harel-Bellan A. Farrar W.L. Eur. Cytokine Net. 1990; 1: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar, 38Granelli-Piperno A. Nolan P. Inaba K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The regulation of p53 transcriptional activity by calcineurin may have important implications for the growth regulatory functions of this protein. It has been shown that proliferative forms of p53 may work as positive regulators of cell growth (Refs. 41Zhang W. Hu G. Estey E. Hester J. Deisseroth A. Oncogen. 1992; 7: 1645-1647PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ullrich S.J. Anderson C.W. Mercer W.E. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15259-15262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Milner J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 211-219PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). In addition, recent data indicates that certain members of the NF-AT(Rel) family of transcription factors can synergize with NF-κB and Tat in the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 (44Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Since NF-AT activity is regulated by calcineurin (31Park J. Yaseen N.R. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20653-20659Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 40McCaffrey P.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22602-22607Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it is possible that an NF-κB/NF-AT synergistic effect on HIV-1 LTR transcription could be affected by PD 144795. In our experimental conditions, NF-κB was solely accounted for by HIV-1 κB site nucleoprotein complex formation (Fig. 3 and data not shown). However, we cannot discard that a physical or functional interaction between NF-κB and certain NF-AT family members may take place in vivo and could be targetted by PD 144795. We thank B. Stein, G. Nabel, B. Vogelstein, E. O'Neill, and T. Tlsty for reagents and suggestions."

Type V adenylyl cyclase-expressing yeast grow only when the cyclase is activated by coexpression of Gsα or addition of forskolin to the medium; however, growth arrest is observed in the presence of both activators or under basal conditions.

Sequence analysis and biochemical characterization of these mutants have identified residues in both cytoplasmic domains of the cyclase that are involved in the specific binding of and regulation by Gsα. Regulation of intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations is principally controlled at the level of its synthesis, through the hormonal regulation of adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP into cyclic AMP. The adenylyl cyclase system comprises three components: seven transmembrane-spanning receptors for a variety of hormones and neurotransmitters, heterotrimeric G proteins, 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; Gsα, the α subunit of the G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase; Giα, the α subunit of the G protein that inhibits adenylyl cyclase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AC, adenylyl cyclase. and the catalytic entity itself. Currently, nine isoforms of membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases have been identified by molecular genetic approaches, and studies of these enzymes reveal both common and unique regulatory features (1Sunahara R.K.

Lippincott-Raven, New York1998: 81-98Google Scholar). All isoforms tested to date are activated by the GTP-bound form of Gsα and by forskolin; for some of the isoforms, such as the type V, these stimulators synergistically activate the enzyme. All isoforms of adenylyl cyclase are further regulated by additional inputs in an isoform-specific pattern. For example, Giα inhibits the types I, V, and VI isoforms (3Taussig R. Iniguez-Lluhi J.

Structural motifs responsible for the recognition of these regulatory molecules by the adenylyl cyclases are starting to be uncovered. A region of type II adenylyl cyclase (residues 956–982 from the C2 domain) containing a QXXER motif has been shown to be important for the regulation of this enzyme by G protein βγ subunits (17Chen J. DeVivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This site has been proposed to interact with the βγ subunit of the G protein, within the amino-terminal 100 residues of β (18Weng G. Li J. Dingus J. Hildebrandt J.D. Weinstein H. Iyengar R. J. Biol.

Synthetic peptide and mutational approaches have identified sequences located within the first cytoplasmic (C1a) region of type I adenylyl cyclase (residues 495–522) important for calmodulin activation (20Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Wu Z. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23766-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this sequence has a hydrophobic/basic composition and an aromatic amino acid in its NH2-terminal portion, typical of most calmodulin binding domains, and is therefore likely to function as the calmodulin binding domain in the cyclase. The recently solved crystal structure of a homodimer of the type II adenylyl cyclase second cytoplasmic domain (C2) bound with forskolin has revealed the binding site(s) of this regulator (22Zhang G.Y. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of Gsα has revealed three regions of the protein critical for the ability of Gsα to activate adenylyl cyclase (23Itoh H. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16226-16231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Berlot C.H. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); however, at the time that this study was initiated, the Gsα-binding site on the adenylyl cyclase molecule had not been determined. The yeast adenylyl cyclase, encoded by the CYR1 gene, is structurally distinct from and exhibits much different regulation than the mammalian adenylyl cyclases (25Kataoka T. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Yeast strains containing a disruption of the CYR1 gene are not viable but can be propagated in medium containing cAMP, demonstrating the importance of cAMP for growth of the organism (26Ishikawa T. Matsumoto K. Uno I. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Based on this requirement of cAMP for growth, we have expressed mammalian adenylyl cyclases in a CYR1-deleted yeast strain to take advantage of the readily manipulatable genetic properties of the yeast for the isolation of mutant mammalian adenylyl cyclases defective in their regulatory responses. In this report, we describe a genetic system utilizing the expression of mammalian type V adenylyl cyclase in yeast and demonstrate its utility in isolating mutant adenylyl cyclases defective in their regulation by Gsα. Genetic and biochemical analyses of these mutants reveal structural information about the Gsα binding site on the cyclase, as well as regions of the molecule important for responses to activating regulators. Yeast strain TC41-1 (27Casperson G.F. Walker N. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5060-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (MAT a, leu2–3, leu2–112, ura3–52, his3, his4, cam1, cam2, cam3, cyr1 Δ::URA3) was a generous gift of Warren Heideman (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Strain 12229 is an isogenic derivative of TC41-1 generated by the targeted integration of plasmid pIntTrp1Cup1Gs at the chromosomal TRP1 locus; this plasmid contains the CUP1copper-inducible promoter (region −460 to −30) fused to the coding region of rat Gsα. Plasmid pADHprACVLeu was constructed by ligating the XbaI-HindIII fragment of dog type V (12Ishikawa Y. Katsushika S. Chen L. Halnon N.J. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13553-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) adenylyl cyclase (in pCDNA1) into the XbaI-HindIII sites of pVT100U and replacing the EcoRI-HpaI fragment of pVT100U (containing the URA3 gene) with the LEU2 gene (HpaI fragment) from YEP13. Randomly mutated libraries of plasmid pADHprACVLeu were generated by passage in the mutator bacterial strain XL1 Red (Stratgene). Libraries with different extents of mutagenesis were prepared by isolating plasmids after 24, 48, and 72 h of growth in this strain. Libraries containing random mutations in the C1 or C2 domains were constructed by error-generated PCR mutagenic techniques. For the C1domain, sense (nucleotides 1125–1144) and antisense (nucleotides 1807–1826) primers were used and the PCR products were digested with NcoI and NdeI and ligated into these same sites present in the pADHprACVLeu yeast expression plasmid. C2domain mutant libraries were constructed by replacement of the carboxyl-terminal SphI fragment with the SphI-digested PCR fragment generated with the C2domain primers (sense = nucleotides 2918–2937, antisense = nucleotides 3754–3773). PCR was performed using standard conditions for Taq polymerase except MgCl2 and deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) concentrations were as follows (for low, medium, and high level of mutagenesis, respectively): 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP; 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTP; 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dCTP, 1 mm dGTP, 0.2 mm dATP, and 0.2 mmdTTP. PCR was performed for 30 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 45 °C, 1 min at 72 °C). Plasmid libraries were introduced into yeast strain 12229 by standard yeast transformation protocols using lithium acetate. Transformants were plated on yeast plates containing CM/−Leu medium supplemented with 100 μm CuSO4, 200 μm forskolin, and 2% dimethyl sulfoxide and incubated at 30 °C. Plasmids were recovered from yeast using Wizard Clean-up columns (Promega) and introduced into bacteria by electroporation as per manufacturer's specifications (Bio-Rad). Recovered plasmids were reintroduced into 12229 and TC41-1 yeast strains by transformation and replica-plated. Sequencing of the adenylyl cyclase mutants was performed using Thermal Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as per procedures supplied by the manufacturer. In some cases, automated sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems sequencer (Applied Biosystems, division of Perkin-Elmer). Plasmids encoding mutant adenylyl cyclases localized (by sequencing) to the C1region were produced by ligating the NcoI-NdeI fragment from isolated mutant plasmids into NcoI-NdeI-digested parental plasmid pADHprACVLeu. Plasmids encoding mutant adenylyl cyclases mapping to the C2 region were produced by replacing the SphI-HindIII fragment (encoding the carboxyl terminus of type V adenylyl cyclase) in wild type plasmid pADHprACVLeu with the SphI-HindIII fragment of the isolated mutant plasmid. In all cases, the replacement fragment contained only a single point mutation. These plasmids were reintroduced into 12229 and TC41-1 yeast strains by transformation and replica-plated to verify that the mutation correlated with the growth phenotype of the originally isolated mutant plasmid. Generation of recombinant baculovirus was performed using the fastbac system (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per manufacturer's specifications. For the production of recombinant baculovirus encoding the wild type type V adenylyl cyclase, the BamHI fragment containing the entire coding region of dog type V was ligated to the BamHI-digested pfastbac transfer vector to generate pfastbacACV. Viruses encoding mutant adenylyl cyclases mapping to the C1 region were produced by ligating the NcoI-NdeI fragment from isolated mutant pADHprACVLeu yeast expression plasmids into NcoI-NdeI-digested pfastbacACV. Viruses encoding mutant adenylyl cyclases mapping to the C2 region were produced by replacing the SphI-HindIII fragment (encoding the carboxyl terminus of type V adenylyl cyclase) from pfastbacACV with the SphI-HindIII fragment of the isolated mutant pADHprACVLeu yeast expression plasmids. Procedures for the culture of Sf9 cells and the amplification of recombinant baculovirus have been outlined by Summers and Smith (28Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; : 1555Google Scholar). Sf9 membranes containing individual adenylyl cyclase isoforms were prepared as described elsewhere (29Taussig R. Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recombinant Gsα and Giα were synthesized in bacteria and purified as described by Lee et al. (30Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by staining with Amido Black (31Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). The α subunits were activated by incubation with 50 mmNa-HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 400 μm GTPγS at 30 °C for 30 (Gsα) or 120 (Giα) min (32Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); unbound GTPγS was removed by gel filtration. Yeast cells were grown to mid log phase and incubated with appropriate activators/inducers (forskolin/copper) for 3 h, harvested by centrifugation, and cAMP content was measured as described by Uno et al. (33Uno I. Nyunoya H. Ishikawa T. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1981; 27: 219-228Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured using the procedure described by Smigel (34Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed for 10 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 μg of membrane protein and a final concentration of 10 mm MgCl2. Wild type and mutant type V adenylyl cyclase proteins were purified from Sf9 membranes using published methods (9Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted as described (29Taussig R. Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), using a primary rabbit antibody specific for type V/VI adenylyl cyclase (ACV/VI) (35Gao T. Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19401-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and a secondary 125I-conjugated anti rabbit antibody (NEN Life Science Products). Proteins were visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The labeled Gsα for binding experiments was prepared by incubating ∼50 pmol of Gsα with 1.2 μm[35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol) for 1 h at 30 °C in 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 80 μl. The reaction mixture was then gel-filtered through a Sephadex G-50 column to remove free [35S]GTPγS. The Gsα binding assay was performed by mixing 20 μg of Sf9 cell membranes expressing wild type or mutant adenylyl cyclase, 80 fmol of [35S]GTPγS-Gsα (final concentration 4 nm) and unlabeled GTPγS-activated Gsα as described previously (5Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Tang W.J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prizm program. Minimum values for the EC50 for Gsαstimulation were estimated from the dose-response curves; for curves that did not approach saturation, values represent concentrations of Gsα that stimulate enzymatic activity half as much as the highest concentration of Gsα tested (3 μm). Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) adenylyl cyclase (encoded by the CYR1 locus) is an essential gene product;cyr1 strains lacking a functional cyclase are non-viable but can be propagated in the presence of cAMP in the growth medium. As shown in Fig. 1, expression of the mammalian type V (ACV) adenylyl cyclase (under the control of the yeast ADH promoter) on a multicopy episomal plasmid can conditionally rescue the lethal phenotype of the CYR1-deleted strain TC41-1. The expression conditions employed have allowed us to discern the different regulatory states of the type V adenylyl cyclase based on growth characteristics of the yeast. In the absence of cyclase activators, TC41-1 cells expressing ACV fail to grow, presumably due to low cAMP levels produced by this isoform under basal conditions (0.02 pmol of cAMP/mg of protein). However, under activating conditions (in the presence of 100 μm forskolin in the medium or coexpression of Gsα), these cells now grow. Growth was accompanied by an increase in intracellular cAMP levels (0.25 pmol of cAMP/mg of protein for either condition). In vitro, ACV is synergistically activated by Gsα and forskolin in combination, and under these conditions we were surprised to observe a no growth phenotype rather than robust growth of this yeast strain despite measuring enhancement of intracellular cAMP levels (1.2 pmol of cAMP/mg of protein). The observed failure of the yeast strain expressing ACV to grow under concomitant activation of the cyclase by forskolin and Gsα suggested a strategy to isolate adenylyl cyclase mutants defective in their response to Gsα. We reasoned that Gsα-insensitive mutants should represent a subset of those that would allow for growth in the presence of Gsαand forskolin. Toward this end, we have constructed libraries encoding randomly generated mutant type V adenylyl cyclases in a yeast expression vector, introduced these libraries into yeast strain 12229 (a derivative of TC41-1 expressing rat Gsα under the control of the CUP1 copper-inducible promoter), and selected for transformants that grow in the presence of forskolin and copper. Several hundred colonies were isolated from >5 × 106transformants derived from nine libraries; three libraries differing in the extent of mutagenesis were generated for each target region of ACV (C1a, C2, and the entire coding region). Positive colonies selected in these genetic screens were replica-plated on medium lacking forskolin to assess growth in the presence of differing levels of expressed Gsα (controlled by the concentration of copper in the growth medium) alone. For mutants that exhibited reduced sensitivity to Gsα stimulation (observable by lack of growth in the presence of Gsα), plasmids encoding the mutant cyclases were recovered and introduced into TC41-1 cells to assess their sensitivity to stimulation by forskolin and back into the parental yeast strain, 12229, to verify that the growth phenotype segregated with the mutant adenylyl cyclase plasmid. Fig. 2 depicts the growth characteristics of 13 independently isolated mutants defective in responses toward Gsα. All of these mutants (isolated for their ability to grow in the presence of Gsα and forskolin stimulation) fail to grow in the presence of Gsα levels sufficient to obtain growth for the wild type ACV-expressing cells; maximal activation of the CUP1 promoter by high concentration of copper in the medium, however, will elevate Gsα levels enough to permit growth of yeast expressing some of these mutant cyclases. All but one mutant (D424N) impart a growth phenotype in the presence of forskolin, consistent with a defect limited to Gsα regulation. Growth of yeast (expressing these mutants or wild type) is slower at lower concentrations of forskolin and not detected at concentrations below 10 μm (data not shown). Twenty-five independent mutants 2Mutant F379L was independently isolated from three libraries, two times from the PCR-targeted C1 domain library, and once each from the 24-h and 48-h randomly mutated libraries. Mutant D424N was isolated from the 72-h randomly mutated library. Mutant L967P was independently isolated from both the 24-h randomly mutated library and the PCR-targeted C2 domain library. All other mutants were isolated from the PCR-targeted C2 domain library. were subjected to DNA sequence analysis to localize the sites of mutations responsible for the observed phenotypes. Eleven positions (the C1a and C2 domains of the cyclase containing 2 and 9 sites, respectively) were identified, as shown in Fig.3. Several point mutants were independently recovered multiple times from different mutant libraries (F379L and F1093S, four times; L967P and G1016S, three times; N1013D and N1094D, two times), and two positions were found mutated to two different amino acids (Leu-967 to Pro or Arg, and Asn-1094 to Asp or Tyr). As depicted in Fig. 3, all mutated positions are highly conserved among all mammalian adenylyl cyclase family members. We next examined the biochemical properties of these mutant type V cyclases to determine whether defective regulatory properties of these mutants could account for the altered growth phenotypes observed when they are expressed in yeast. Unfortunately, characterization of the regulatory properties of mutant or wild type adenylyl cyclase in yeast homogenates or membranes was not possible due to extremely low enzymatic activities of these preparations. Therefore, the mutant adenylyl cyclase constructs were introduced into recombinant baculoviruses and overexpressed in Sf9 cells; membranes from these cells were then used as a source of cyclase for biochemical studies. To address potential differences in relative levels of active cyclase protein, the wild type and mutant adenylyl cyclase proteins were purified; equivalent amounts of these cyclases (based on activity measurements) were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-AC5/6 antibody (data not shown). For comparative purposes, levels of active cyclase protein were normalized with respect to that of the wild type enzyme and are summarized in Table I; the values range from 43% to 385% of wild type and may reflect differences in expression levels or stabilities of the mutant cyclases.Table IExpression levels of wild type and mutant adenylyl cyclases in Sf9 membranesActive cyclase in membranes% of WTWT100 (±0.0)F379L74 (±33)D424N98 (±45)L967P63 (±22)L967R43 (±11)F1006L207 (±71)N1013D110 (±22)G1016S237 (±33)V1017D385 (±151)R1021Q75 (±14)V1022A96 (±54)F1093S103 (±32)N1094D133 (±76)N1094Y371 (±145) Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig.4, both the D424N and F379L mutants have reduced responses to stimulation by Gsα compared with the wild type enzyme, correlating well with the growth phenotypes observed in S. cerevisiae. The rightward shift in the dose-response curves for both of these mutants indicates a reduced affinity for Gsα relative to the wild type enzyme (EC50values for wild type, F379L, and D424N are 101, >700, and >600 nm, respectively). We could not determine whether the maximal stimulation by Gsα was also reduced by these mutations, because we were unable to reach saturating Gsαconcentrations for the mutant type V adenylyl cyclases. We next examined the responses of these mutants to forskolin to determine whether these mutants had alterations in their response to this activator and to examine the ability of these mutants to integrate concomitant forskolin and Gsα activation. Examination of Fig. 5 reveals that the sensitivity of the F379L mutant to forskolin (EC50 = 37 μm) is comparable to wild type (EC50 = 44 μm). In the presence of Gsα, where synergistic activation of the wild type ACV is apparent as an increase in sensitivity to forskolin (EC50 lowered to 6 μm) and an increase in the magnitude of the forskolin response (Fig. 5 A), the F379L mutant shows neither of these effects (Fig. 5 B), further demonstrating its defective response to Gsα. In marked contrast is the behavior of the D424N mutant shown in Fig.5 C; this mutant has a marked decreased sensitivity to forskolin (the dose-response curve does not appear to saturate at the highest concentration tested). Surprisingly, the synergistic activation of this mutant by forskolin plus Gsα (EC50 = 5 μm) resembles that of the wild type despite the observed loss of responsiveness to either activator alone. These observations suggest that the defect associated with the D424N mutant is a more global defect affecting regulation by multiple activators, whereas the F379L mutant is specifically defective in its response to Gsα, likely due to a reduced ability to bind Gsα. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of these mutants to directly bind 35S-labeled GTPγS-bound Gsα. As shown in Fig. 6 (inset), wild type ACV binds labeled Gsα in the presence of forskolin, and this binding is competed by the addition of excess unlabeled Gsα. No binding of labeled Gsαcould be detected for the F379L mutant under these conditions, consistent with the reduced sensitivity of this mutant toward Gsα stimulation, and inability to respond to Gsα in the presence of forskolin. The D424N mutant, by contrast, did bind to Gsα, although the initial level of binding appears reduced, the affinity of this mutant for Gsα is comparable to that of the wild type enzyme (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest a role for Phe-379 in Gsα binding and a more structural role for Asp-424 (see “Discussion”). The majority of the Gsα-insensitive mutants that were isolated in yeast were localized to the C2 domain of ACV. Biochemical analysis of these cyclase mutants, after expression in Sf9 cells, reveals that all are defective in responding to stimulation by Gsα. As shown in Fig. 7, all mutants have reduced responses to stimulation by Gsαcompared with the wild type enzyme. EC50 values of these mutants for Gsα are shown in TableII.Table IIForskolin and G sα-stimulated activities of C 2adenylyl cyclase mutantsFsk/Mn2-aCyclase activity was assessed in the presence of 100 μm forskolin and 5 mm Mn2+.Fsk/Mn2-bForskolin-stimulated activities in the presence of Mn2+ were adjusted to reflect differences in adenylyl cyclase expression levels (see Table I).Fsk EC502-cValues for the EC50 for forskolin stimulation were calculated from forskolin dose-response curves using GraphPad Prizm software.

Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 67-108Google Scholar, 2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). TFIID is a multisubunit complex that includes the TATA binding protein (TBP) (3Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). TBP, in its recombinant form or as part of the TFIID complex, recognizes the TATA motif present in many genes and can nucleate the formation of transcription-competent complexes (4Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The TBP (TFIID)-TATA complex provides the foundation for the entry of TFIIB, which is then followed by the entry of RNA polymerase II. RNA polymerase II is escorted to the promoter by TFIIF (5Flores O. Lu H. Killeen M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9999-10003Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The resulting DNA-protein complex, TBPolF, contains RNA polymerase II stably associated with the promoter (2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). This complex, however, is unique with respect to complexes formed with other RNA polymerases since the formation of an RNA polymerase II transcription-competent complex requires the function of two other GTFs, TFIIE and TFIIH (6Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFIIE is a tetrameric factor composed of two subunits, p56 and p34 (7Inostroza J. Flores O. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9304-9308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Ohkuma Y. Sumimoto H. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9163-9167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TFIIE interacts with RNA polymerase II (9Flores O. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8913-8921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TFIIH (10Maxon M.E. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.-C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether TFIIE enters the transcription complex with RNA polymerase or in a subsequent step with TFIIH. However, it is clear that the association of TFIIE with the TBPolF complex is necessary for the entry of TFIIH to the transcription complex (6Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested an alternative model for the formation of transcription competent complexes. These studies suggest that the GTFs and RNA polymerase II are preassembled in an RNA polymerase holoenzyme complex (12Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 13Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P. Lees E. Anderson C.W. Linn S. Reinberg D.

Nature. 1996; 380: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). TFIIH also known as BTF2 was initially purified as a factor required to reconstitute accurate transcription by RNA polymerase II in vitro (6Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gerard M. Fisher L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BTF2 was originally presumed to be TFIIE (16Zheng X.M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 50: 361-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the availability of antibodies against a subunit of TFIIE (17Peterson M.G. Inostroza J. Maxon M.E. Flores O. Admon A. Reinberg D. Tjian R. Nature. 1991; 354: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) revealed that BTF2 and TFIIE are distinct (18Fischer L. Gerard M. Chalut C. Lutz I. Humbert S. Kanno M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibodies generated against the 62-kDa subunit of BTF2 revealed that BTF2 and TFIIH are the same factor (18Fischer L. Gerard M. Chalut C. Lutz I. Humbert S. Kanno M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Lu H. Zawel L. Fisher L. Egly J.M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1992; 358: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Additionally, an activity isolated from rat liver extracts, referred to as factor δ, contained a subunit composition and properties similar to human TFIIH (20Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 7356-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Purification of TFIIH demonstrated that it is a multisubunit factor composed of nine polypeptides (6Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gerard M. Fisher L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 7356-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The studies with the rat liver-derived factor were the first to demonstrate that factor δ (TFIIH) copurified with a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity. The authors also reported that the ATPase activity of TFIIH was preferentially stimulated by the TATA motif (20Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 7356-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The subunit composition of TFIIH has proved to be intriguing. The cDNA clones encoding the different subunits of TFIIH have been isolated. The largest subunit (p89) was identified as the DNA excision repair protein ERCC3 (Excision Repair Cross Complement) (21Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. Science. 1993; 260: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ERCC3 gene are responsible for the DNA repair defects observed in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group B and Cockayne's syndrome (reviewed in Refs. 22Drapkin R. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Cell. 1994; 77: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 23Tanaka K. Wood R.D. TIBS. 1994; 19: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, ERCC3 was found to contain a DNA-dependent ATPase and a 3′ to 5′ helicase activity. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the second largest subunit of TFIIH (p80) was encoded by the ERCC2 gene (11Drapkin R. Reardon J.T. Ansari A. Huang J.-C. Zawel L. Ahn K. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Nature. 1994; 368: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 24Schaeffer L. Moncollin V. Roy R. Staub A. Mezzina M. Sarasin A. Weeda G. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1379-1387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), which corrects the DNA repair defect in cultured cells obtained from patients with XP group D (reviewed in Refs. 22Drapkin R. Sancar A. Reinberg D. Cell. 1994; 77: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar and 23Tanaka K. Wood R.D. TIBS. 1994; 19: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). ERCC2 possesses a 5′ to 3′ ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity. Mutations in the yeast TFIIH subunits that are homologous to p62 (TFB1) and p44 (hSSL1) demonstrated that these subunits also perform essential functions in the nucleotide excision repair process (26Matsui P. DePaulo J. Buratowski S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Wang Z. Buratowski S. Svejstrup J. Feaver W.J. Wu X. kornberg R.D. Donahue D.F. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2288-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, the 34-kDa subunit of TFIIH has homology with domains of hSSL1, suggesting that it also participates in nucleotide excision repair (28Humbert S. Vuuren V.H. Lutz Y. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. Moncollin V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations was the finding that the TFIIH complex is essential for nucleotide excision repair (29Aboussekhra A. Bigerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubschner U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 30Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Most recently, the p52 subunit of TFIIH was cloned (32Marinoni J.-C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Molina-Gomez D. Hoeijmarkers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This subunit was found to be a homolog of Tfb2 a subunit of the yeast TFIIH (33Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This subunit is also thought to be involved in repair because Tfb2 mutants in yeast have a UV-sensitive phenotype, and antibodies raised against the human protien inhibit nucleotide excision repair in microinjection assays (32Marinoni J.-C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Molina-Gomez D. Hoeijmarkers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Feaver W.J. Henry N.L.

TFIIH also copurifies with a kinase activity specific for the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII (19Lu H. Zawel L. Fisher L. Egly J.M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1992; 358: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 34Feaver W.J. Gileadi O. Li Y. Kornberg R.D.

A. 1992; 89: 7476-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The CTD is composed of multiple, tandemly repeated copies of the heptapeptide Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. The kinase activity of mammalian TFIIH was shown to reside in the cdk-activating kinase (CAK) complex composed of the catalytic subunit cdk7 and its regulatory subunits cyclin H and MAT1 (36Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.-P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The cdk7 kinase activity was previously shown to be necessary for the activation of at least three cyclin-dependent kinases that regulate cell-cycle progression through G1 (cdk2 and cdk4) and mitosis (cdc2) (40Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that TFIIH not only participates in transcription and nucleotide excision repair, but may also regulate cell cycle progression. Studies performed initially in yeast (41Svejstrup J.Q. Wang Z. Feaver J.W. Wu X. Bushnell D.A. Donahue T.F. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and recently extended to the mammalian factor (42Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulichev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 43Reardon J.T. Ge H. Gibs E. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. Pan Z.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), demonstrate that TFIIH exists in at least two subcomplexes, a complex containing the core subunits of TFIIH (ERCC3, ERCC2, p62, p52, p44, and p34) that is devoid of the kinase complex, referred to as core-TFIIH, and a complex associated with the kinase complex (cdk7, cyclin H and MAT-1), referred to as holo-TFIIH. Interestingly, studies performed in HeLa cells have demonstrated that TFIIH is limiting with respect to CAK and that no more than 20% of the total cellular CAK is associated with the TFIIH complex (42Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulichev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The studies with the human CAK demonstrated that it exists in three distinct complexes: CAK, a novel ERCC2-CAK complex, and TFIIH (42Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulichev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 43Reardon J.T. Ge H. Gibs E. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. Pan Z.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, these studies also demonstrated that the ERCC2-CAK complex, and not CAK, was capable of complementing the severely compromised transcription activity of core-TFIIH in vitro (42Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulichev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 43Reardon J.T. Ge H. Gibs E. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. Pan Z.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As indicated above TFIIH is a complex factor composed of nine subunits. Conventional purification procedures for mammalian TFIIH generally consist of eight-ten column schemes (15Gerard M. Fisher L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 7356-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 42Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulichev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which are time consuming and often result in poor recovery. In this report, we describe a quick and efficient method to immunopurify functional TFIIH complexes. Hybridomas producing ERCC3 and GST antibodies were prepared by Bios-Chile I.G.S.A. Immunization was carried out with a bacterially produced MBP-ERCC3 fusion protein or recombinant GST. The recombinant MBP-ERCC3 polypeptide was isolated by maltose affinity purification as described previously (44Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea A.G.I. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Guan C. Gene. 1988; 40: 183-190Google Scholar). The GST protein was purified using glutathione affinity chromatography. Isotyping was performed with a mouse antibody isotyping kit, Isostrip (Boehringer Mannheim). The MBP-ERCC3 fusion protein containing amino acids 199 to 782 of ERCC3 was generated by subcloning ERCC3 cDNA (nucleotides 689 to 2751) into pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs). The clones encoding C-terminal truncations of ERCC3, extending from amino acids 199 to 497, or 199 to 355, were constructed by digesting the DNA encoding MBP-ERCC3 with PstI or SphI, respectively. PstI cleaves at nucleotide 1586, whereas SphI cleaves at nucleotide 1160. A XbaI linker containing stop codons in all three reading frames was ligated at the cleavage sites. To generate the clones encoding C-terminal truncations of ERCC3 extending to amino acids 303 and 242, oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification were designed. These primers contain 20 nucleotides complementary to sequences at the 5′-end (ending at nucleotide 689) and 3′-end (ending at residues 1003 and 820 for truncations at amino acids 303 and 242, respectively). The 5′-end primer was flanked with a noncomplementary BamHI restriction enzyme site followed by eight noncomplementary bases to assist restriction enzyme cleavage of the PCR product. The 3′-end primers were flanked by a HinDIII restriction enzyme site. PCR reactions were carried out as follows: 10 ng of template DNA, 50 pmol of 3′-end primer, 50 pmol of 5′-end primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer (Perkin-Elmer) and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The PCR reactions (100 μl) were performed for 30 cycles using a model 9600 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer) PCR system. The PCR products were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and cleaved with BamHI and HinDIII restriction endonucleases. The expression vector pMAL-c2 was also cleaved with BamHI and HinDIII in the polylinker region followed by alkaline phosphatase treatment. The various PCR products were ligated into the pMAL-c2 expression vector with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). In the pMAL-c2 expression system, the cloned gene is inserted downstream of the MAL-E gene in the same reading frame. The MAL-E gene encodes the maltose binding protein (MBP) and allows one-step purification using a maltose affinity column. All DNA constructs encoding truncated MBP-ERCC3 proteins were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells. To express the fusion proteins, cells were grown in LB media to A600 = 0.6. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Four overlapping peptides extending from amino acids 242 to 303 of ERCC3 were synthesized. Peptide 1 extends from amino acids 242 to 261, peptide 2 from amino acids 256 to 275, peptide 3 from amino acids 270 to 291, and peptide 4 from amino acids 281 to 303. These peptides were used as competitors in immunoprecipitation experiments used to map the epitope of ERCC3 that is recognized by one of the monoclonal antibodies (mAb 3G4). Monoclonal antibody 3G4 was immobilized on protein A-agarose as follows. A 1:1 (v/v) ratio of ascites containing anti-ERCC3 mAb to protein A-agarose beads (Boheringer Mannheim) in PBS, was incubated for 90 min at 25 °C with rotation. After extensive washing of the beads with PBS, the samples were divided into five separate tubes each containing 20 μl of the antibody-coupled beads. Each aliquot was then subjected to a 90-min incubation at 4 °C with a particular peptide (as indicated) or PBS. Next, 50 μl of a 0.5 m KCl-eluted phosphocellulose fraction (4 mg/ml) that is enriched in TFIIH (6Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to each tube and incubated for an additional 90 min at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed three times with IP wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After a final wash with PBS to remove the Nonidet P-40, the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling in SDS gel loading buffer for 5 min. The eluate was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies recognizing subunits of TFIIH. The polypeptides were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (Promega). Anti-ERCC3 or anti-GST monoclonal antibodies were covalently coupled to protein A-agarose as described (45Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 521-523Google Scholar). The peptide used for the elutions of MBP-ERCC3 or TFIIH from the affinity columns consists of 24 amino acids containing residues 242 to 261 of ERCC3 flanked by two additional lysine residues at each end to increase its solubility. To affinity purify MBP-ERCC3 with the mAb 3G4, an extract was prepared from E. coli DH5α cells overexpressing the MBP-ERCC3 fusion protein. One milliliter of this extract (2 mg/ml) was incubated in Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 m KCl) with either 250 μl of anti-ERCC3 mAb (3G4) coupled beads or 250 μl of anti-GST coupled beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 50 column volumes of Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol) containing 1.0 m KCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by 50 column volumes of the same buffer containing 0.1 m KCl. The columns were eluted by incubation with 2 column volumes (500 μl) of the peptide (4 mg/ml) in Buffer D containing 0.1 m KCl for 1 h at 4 °C. TFIIH derived from the second step of purification, the DEAE-cellulose bound fraction (6Flores O. Lu H. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2786-2793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was dialyzed against Buffer D containing 0.1m KCl and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and was used as the input material for affinity purifications. To affinity purify holo-TFIIH, which includes the CAK complex (42Drapkin R. Le Roy G. Cho H. Akoulichev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 43Reardon J.T. Ge H. Gibs E. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. Pan Z.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the DEAE-cellulose bound fraction (10 ml at 1.2 mg/ml) was applied to 500 μl of either anti-ERCC3 mAb (3G4) coupled beads or 500 μl of anti-GST mAb coupled beads. The TFIIH complex was immunoabsorbed by passing the input over the mAb-coupled beads 10 times at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with 100 column volumes of Buffer D containing 0.4 m KCl and 0.03% Nonidet P-40, followed by 50 column volumes of Buffer D containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.03% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted from each column by incubation with 3 column volumes of the peptide (4 mg/ml) in Buffer D containing 0.4m KCl for 1 h at 25 °C. The first three fractions contained TFIIH that was active in transcription. To affinity purify the core-TFIIH complex, devoid of the CAK complex, the TFIIH complex was immunoadsorbed as described above, but the beads were washed with an additional 100 column volumes of Buffer D containing 0.85 m KCl and 0.03% Nonidet P-40 prior to elution with peptide. Transcription assays contained the adenovirus major late promoter (200 ng) directing transcription of a G-less cassette as a template, recombinant human TBP (5 ng), TFIIB (5 ng), TFIIE (15 ng), and TFIIF (25 ng), and highly purified RNA polymerase II (500 ng) isolated from HeLa cells as described (13Maldonado E.

Conventionally purified TFIIH used as a control in kinase assays was prepared as described in Ref. 38Shiekhattar R. Mermelstein F. Fisher R.P. Drapkin R. Dynlacht B. Wessling H.C. Morgan D.O.

The transcriptionally active fractions from the Superose-6 column were pooled and used for these experiments. These fractions are devoid of all the other known GTFs or CTD kinases. Transcription assays were supplemented with conventionally purified XPD-CAK (5, 10, and 15 ng) derived from the ceramic hydroxyapatite column purification step as described in (42Drapkin R. Le Roy G.

Kinase assays (30 μl) were performed as described (38Shiekhattar R. Mermelstein F. Fisher R.P. Drapkin R. Dynlacht B. Wessling H.C. Morgan D.O. Reinberg D.

All immunoblots were performed with nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies, either mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal, in TBS (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm NaCl) with 0.5% Tween-20 for 3 h at 25 °C. After extensive washing with TBS, 0.5% Tween-20, the blots were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega) for 2 h. Blots were extensively washed with TBS, 0.5% Tween-20 prior to development with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Monoclonal antibodies were generated against a bacterial expressed MBP-ERCC3 fusion protein that was purified by maltose affinity chromatography. Monoclonal antibodies were initially screened for their ability to recognize ERCC3 in Western blot analysis, and for their ability to immunoprecipitate ERCC3 along with other TFIIH subunits from HeLa cell nuclear extract. One ERCC3 mAb (3G4/E5) was selected which fulfilled both of these criteria (data not shown, see below). We next screened this mAb for its ability to recognize a series of C-terminal truncated MBP-ERCC3 fusion proteins (Fig.1 a) by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 b). This analysis allowed us to identify the region in ERCC3 recognized by the monoclonal antibody. C-terminal truncated proteins extending up to amino acid 303 of ERCC3 were recognized by the mAb. However, a protein containing a C-terminal deletion ending at residue 242 was not recognized by the antibody (Fig. 1 b). All polypeptides were recognized by polyclonal antibodies (Fig.1 b). Therefore, we concluded that the epitope recognized by the mAb 3G4 lies within a 51-amino acid segment located between amino acids 242 to 303 (Fig. 1 a). We then attempted to localize the particular epitope recognized by the mAb within 20 amino acids. This was achieved by generating four overlapping 20-amino acid peptides used in immunoprecipitation competition experiments (Fig.2 a, for details see “Materials and Methods”). A partially purified preparation of TFIIH was used in the analysis (see “Materials and Methods”). Peptide 1, containing residues 242 to 261 of ERCC3, was capable of blocking the mAb (3G4) from co-immunoprecipitating TFIIH, monitored by analyzing in Western blot for the presence of p62 and cyclin H subunits (lane 3). However, peptides 2, 3, and 4 had no effect on co-immunoprecipitations. The results from these immunoprecipitation competition experiments demonstrate that the epitope which the mAb recognizes lies within a 20-amino acid region of ERCC3, residues 242 to 261 which corresponds to amino acids SDIPMDLFDFYEQMDKDEEE. Having established that the epitope lies within amino acids 242 to 261 of ERCC3, which is contained in peptide 1, we next analyzed whether the fusion MBP-ERCC3 protein could be retained by a column containing the monoclonal antibody and whether peptide 1 could displace the fusion protein from the column (Fig. 2 b). A peptide similar to peptide 1 used in the immunoprecipitation competition experiments was constructed although two lysine residues were added to each end to increase its solubility. A ba"

To identify receptor structures and signaling pathways essential for anti-apoptotic effects on cells, we have created a chimeric receptor (colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor/insulin receptor chimera (CSF1R/IR)) connecting the extracellular, ligand-binding domain of the colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the insulin receptor. Upon activation with CSF-1, the CSF1R/IR phosphorylates itself and intracellular substrates in a manner characteristic of normal insulin receptors. CSF-1 treatment protected cells expressing the CSF1R/IR from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. A chimeric receptor (CSF1R/IRΔ960) with a deletion of 12 amino acids from its juxtamembrane domain was constructed and expressed. CSF-1-treated cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 are unable to phosphorylate IRS-1 and Shc (Chaika, O. V., Chaika, N., Volle, D. J., Wilden, P. A., Pirrucello, S. J., and Lewis, R. E. (1997) J. Biol.

CSF-1 stimulated glucose uptake, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase in cells expressing the CSF1R/IR but not in cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960. Surprisingly, the CSF1R/IRΔ960 was as effective as the CSF1R/IR in mediating CSF-1 protection of cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. These observations indicate that the anti-apoptotic effects of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain can be mediated by signaling pathways distinct from those requiring IRS-1 and Shc.

These observations indicate that the anti-apoptotic effects of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain can be mediated by signaling pathways distinct from those requiring IRS-1 and Shc. Most proposed mechanisms of carcinogenic progression predict that any single cell with a selective growth advantage would, by virtue of clonal expansion, provide an enlarged target for the accumulation of additional carcinogenic mutations. The relative rarity of tumor formation in organisms with billions of proliferating cells has led to the hypothesis that most cells acquiring growth advantages are selectively deleted by apoptotic mechanisms (1Harrington E.A. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A corollary of this proposal is that suppression of the apoptotic pathway is a requirement for carcinogenesis. Several growth factors and cytokines have been identified as suppressors of apoptosis in specific cell types (2Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 3Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 4Collins M.K. Marvel L. Malde P.

Numano F. Yamori Y. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 603-612PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the IGF I receptor to block cell death is marked in oncogene-driven cells placed in a growth factor-deprived environment and is manifested in vivo even more dramatically than in vitro (9Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 249-252PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, human melanoma cells transfected with an antisense cDNA construct to the IGF I receptor were very weakly tumorigenic upon injection into nude mice compared with cells expressing wild type levels of IGF I receptors (10Resnicoff M. Coppola D. Sell C. Rubin R. Ferrone S. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4848-4850PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was initially postulated that such IGF I receptor-deficient cells simply failed to proliferate in vivo, further analysis revealed that the cells undergo apoptosis within 27 h of injection (10Resnicoff M. Coppola D. Sell C. Rubin R. Ferrone S. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4848-4850PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IGF I and insulin have been demonstrated to suppress apoptosis in c-myc-induced Rat 1 fibroblasts, PC-12 cells, and IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cells (2Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 3Yao R. Cooper G.M.

These observations lend strong support to the notion that IGF action mediated through the IGF I receptor is directly and intimately involved in suppression of apoptosis in many cell types. If inhibition of an IGF-regulated anti-apoptotic pathway is a requisite step in carcinogenesis, then knowledge of the essential components in that pathway may lead to strategies that can specifically invoke apoptosis of transformed cells. The IGF I receptor and insulin receptor encode homologous cytoplasmic domains (11Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Franke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). In addition to a highly conserved tyrosine kinase domain, the insulin and IGF I receptor also retain homologous phosphorylation sites including sites that regulate the interaction of each receptor with the intracellular signaling proteins IRS-1 and Shc (12Craparo A.

A primary goal in the study of insulin and IGF I receptor action is the identification of the intracellular pathways that mediate the biological actions of these hormones. One strategy to identify signaling pathways that regulate specific biological actions of insulin and IGF I receptors has been to create mutations within specific receptor sequences that disrupt one insulin or IGF I-regulated pathway while leaving others intact. Deletion mutagenesis of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain has generated insulin receptors with altered biological properties (21White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Ullrich A.

Analysis of the ability of mutated insulin receptors to mediate signaling in cells is obscured by the activity of endogenous insulin receptors. We have avoided this dilemma by constructing a chimeric receptor (CSF1R/IR) consisting of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the human CSF-1 receptor (25Coussens L. Van Beveren C. Smith D.

The CSF1R/IR chimera has CSF-1-dependent enzymatic and biological properties expected of the insulin receptor and IGF I receptor (20Chaika O.V. Chaika N. Volle D.J. Wilden P.A. Pirrucello S.J. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11968-11974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CSF-1 inhibits apoptosis in CHO cells expressing the CSF1R/IR but has no protective effect on control cells. Inhibition of apoptosis by insulin in CHO cells is sensitive to the PI 3′ kinase inhibitor wortmannin. However, deletions within the cytoplasmic domain of the CSF1R/IR that disrupt the ability of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain to activate MAP kinase and IRS-1-associated PI 3′ kinase activity do not disrupt its anti-apoptotic activity. These observations indicate that the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its subsequent association with and direct activation of PI 3′ kinase are not requisite components of anti-apoptotic signaling by the insulin receptor kinase. The construction of the chimera, transfection of the DNA, and isolation of clonal cell lines have been described previously (20Chaika O.V. Chaika N. Volle D.J. Wilden P.A. Pirrucello S.J. Lewis R.E.

Before stimulation with insulin or CSF-1 the medium was changed to serum-free medium. Insulin (100 nm) or CSF-1 (10 nm) were added to stimulate the cells. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and Western blots were developed using anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20, 1:1000) antibodies as specified by the manufacturer (Transduction Laboratories) or using CT-1 (1:5000) (29Ganderton R.H.

Blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium using the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. 1 × 106 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium with or without growth factors or 5 nmstaurosporine (30Weil M.

The medium from each culture dish was removed and pelleted in a bench top centrifuge for 10 min to capture any cells that had detached from the tissue culture dish. 1 ml of Hirt lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6% SDS, and 10 mmEDTA) with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K was added to each tube. The resuspended pellets were transferred back to the corresponding plate from which they were taken. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to lyse the cells. Following the incubation, 300 μl of 5m NaCl was added dropwise to each dish, and lysates were scraped into polypropylene tubes and incubated at 4 °C for 4–16 h. The precipitated lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 31,000 ×g in a SS34 rotor (Sorvall). The supernatants were combined with an equal volume of isopropanol, mixed, and centrifuged for 45 min at 31,000 × g in an SS34 rotor. Supernatants were immediately decanted, and the pellets were allowed to dry briefly. The pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA containing 100 μg/ml RNase A. The suspension was transferred to Eppendorf tubes and allowed to incubate at 25 °C for 1 h. The DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and precipitated, and each sample was resuspended in 100 μl of DNase-free water. The DNA was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP using a kit from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD) and run on a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid overnight, dried, and visualized using phosphor storage technology (Molecular Dynamics). Flame sterilized coverslips were placed at the bottom of 35-mm tissue culture dishes and secured with a drop of medium. 5 × 104 CHO cells expressing CSF1R/IR or CSF1R/IRΔ960 or transfected with the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were plated onto the coverslips. The day after plating the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium, and the cells were treated for at least 9 h at 37 °C with or without 5 nm staurosporine, 1.7 μm insulin, or 10 nm CSF-1. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4) and fixed with ice-cold 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. Following fixation the cells were washed once with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 5 min at 25 °C, once with 70% ethanol for 5 min at 25 °C, and twice with PBS. The coverslips were then stained with 25 μl of 25 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in PBS for 30 min. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS and mounted on microscope slides with 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane in glycerol gelatin. At least 500 nuclei were counted for each treatment, and the percentage of pyknotic nuclei present was calculated. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts expressing the CSF1R/IR or CSF1R/IRΔ960 were differentiated into adipocytes with dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin as described previously (20Chaika O.V.

Glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was measured using a modification of the method described previously (31Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 14 days after induction of differentiation, at which time >90% of the cells expressed an adipocyte phenotype. Cell monolayers were washed twice with buffer A (130 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 0.68 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. To determine nonspecific glucose uptake the cells were treated for 10 min in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 μm cytochalasin B and 200 μmphloretin. Cell monolayers were washed once with 1 ml of KRP buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) with or without CSF-1 or insulin as indicated and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of the same buffer. The glucose uptake assay was initiated by replacement of KRP buffer in each well with KRP buffer containing 0.1 mm 2-deoxy-d-[2,6-3H] glucose (1 μCi) for 10 min at 37 °C. Termination of glucose uptake was performed by the rapid removal of assay buffer followed by four rapid washes of each well with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A containing 500 μm phloretin. Cells were removed from each well with 0.4 ml of 0.1% SDS and counted for radioactivity after the addition of 4 ml of Optifluor (Packard Instrument Co.). CHO cells (1 × 105) were seeded in 35-mm dishes. 16 h after plating, cells were starved in serum-free F-12 medium for 18 h. After serum deprivation, the cell monolayer was washed with PBS and stimulated with 10 nmCSF-1 or 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 10 min. Cells were snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium PPi, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin), transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and pelleted at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates were transferred into new microcentrifuge tubes containing 15 μl of protein G-agarose beads and 10 μl each of ERK-1 (C-16) and ERK-2 (C-14) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer (without sodium PPi and leupeptin) and three times with ice-cold kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 25 μm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Myelin basic protein (0.5 mg/ml) and [γ-32P]ATP (0.7 μl, 10 μCi/μl, and 6000 μCi/nmol) were added to each tube. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 2× sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 50% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol) and boiling the samples for 5 min. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Each gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to detect myelin basic protein and dried. The relative amount of32P incorporated into myelin basic protein was determined using phosphor storage technology (Molecular Dynamics). CHO cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates in duplicate. The day after plating the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 18 h. The cells were stimulated with 1 μm insulin or 10 nm CSF-1 for 2 min, snap frozen with liquid nitrogen, lysed with 450 μl/well of lysis buffer containing 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium PPi, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g, clarified lysates were incubated for 1.5–2 h at 4 °C with 3 μl of antibodies to IRS-1. Protein G-agarose beads (12.5 μl) were added to each immune complex and precipitated for 1.5–2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1% Triton X-100 and PBS, twice with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mLiCl, and twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmNa3VO4. The washed beads were resuspended in 30 μl of a buffer containing (30 mm MgCl2, 30 nm HEPES, 0.6 mm EGTA) and left on ice. At this time the sonication mixture containing 30 mm HEPES, 0.6 mm EGTA, and 0.6 mg/ml phosphoinositol (Avanti) was prepared and placed on ice. The mixture was sonicated at 4 °C for 5–7 s with a probe sonicator (Heat Systems) set at position 9, and 15 μl of the sonicated mixture was added to the immunoprecipitates. [γ-32P]ATP (0.8 μl, 10 μCi/μl, 6000 μCi/nmol) was quickly added, and the mixtures were mixed rigorously at 25 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 12 μl of 6 mHCl and 120 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1). 20 μl of the organic phase were spotted on a silica gel 60 (Merck) TLC plate that had been previously coated with 1.3% potassium oxalate in H2O/MeOH (3:2). Radiolabeled phospholipids were resolved in a solvent system consisting of CHCl3/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/H2O (35:13:15:12:8). The relative amount of PI 3′ phosphate generated was determined using phosphor storage technology (Molecular Dynamics). Treatment of cells expressing the CSF1R/IR with CSF-1 for 10 min resulted in the phosphorylation of the 170-kDa chimeric receptor (Fig. 1). CSF-1 stimulates phosphorylation of the CSF1R/IRΔ960 to a lesser extent than it stimulates phosphorylation of the intact CSF1R/IR (Fig. 1). The tyrosine-phosphorylated CSF1R/IR and CSF1R/IRΔ960 were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody CT-1, which is specific for the carboxyl terminus of the insulin receptor. The amounts of CSF1R/IR and CSF1R/IRΔ960 in each cell line were equal as determined by a Western blot using the CT-1 antibody (Fig. 1), thus showing that the difference in tyrosine phosphorylation between the CSF1R/IR and the CSF1R/IRΔ960 is due to the 12-amino acid deletion of the juxtamembrane domain that is present in the CSF1R/IRΔ960 and not to clonal variation. CHO cells expressing the CSF1R/IR were examined for their ability to resist apoptosis upon treatment with CSF-1. Cells were incubated with CSF-1 (0.1–10 nm) for 1 h and then induced to undergo apoptosis with the addition of 5 nmstaurosporine. Cells treated with staurosporine for 9 h showed the presence of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2). CSF-1 decreased DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner. The juxtamembrane region contains an important phosphorylation site at Tyr960 (32Feener E.P. Backer J.M. King G.L. Wilden P.A. Sun X.J. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol.

Deletion of 12 amino acids within the juxtamembrane domain (Δ960) of the insulin receptor or the CSF1R/IR blocks the ability of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate IRS-1 or Shc (20Chaika O.V.

To determine whether or not the anti-apoptotic signaling of the CSF1R/IR required juxtamembrane phosphorylation sites, we looked at the ability of the CSF1R/IRΔ960 to protect cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Cells transfected with the expression vector alone, expressing the CSF1R/IR, or expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 were treated with 5 nm staurosporine and with or without 10 nm CSF-1 or 1.7 μm insulin for 18 h at 37 °C. The percentage of pyknotic nuclei present was determined as a measure of the level of apoptosis. Cells transfected with the expression vector alone contained detectable pyknotic nuclei after a 9-h treatment with staurosporine alone (Fig.3). Physiological concentrations of IGF I inhibit apoptosis in different cultured cell lines (2Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that CHO cells express relatively low numbers (1,000–10,000 receptors/cell) of insulin receptors and are relatively insensitive to physiological concentrations of insulin. High concentrations of insulin were used to ensure activation of endogenous IGF I receptors. Insulin blocked the formation of pyknotic nuclei upon staurosporine treatment, whereas 10 nm CSF-1 had no effect (Fig. 3). Cells expressing the CSF1R/IR were also susceptible to staurosporine-induced apoptosis in the absence of insulin or CSF-1. When insulin or CSF-1 were present, the number of pyknotic nuclei detected was greatly reduced (Fig. 3). Cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 were also protected from staurosporine-induced death by insulin or CSF-1. The CSF1R/IR and the CSF1R/IRΔ960 were compared for their ability to stimulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Saturating concentrations of insulin (100 nm) stimulated [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake 8–9-fold in adipocytes expressing either chimera (Fig.4). 10 nm CSF-1 is sufficient to maximally activate the CSF1R/IR kinase (20Chaika O.V.

Adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR were also able to increase glucose uptake approximately 7.7-fold in response to 10 nm CSF-1 (Fig. 4). In contrast, the juxtamembrane deletion severely inhibited the ability of CSF-1 to stimulate glucose uptake in cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 (Fig.4). IRS-1 and Shc are important mediators of insulin-induced Ras activation and the subsequent activation of MAP kinases (34Baltensperger K. Kozma L.M. Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Chawla A. Banerjee U.

We tested the ability of the 12-amino acid deletion in the CSF1R/IR to affect CSF-1-induced activation of MAP kinases in CHO cells. CHO cells transfected with the expression vector alone activated MAP kinases approximately 3.5-fold in response to phorbol esters but were unresponsive to CSF-1 (Fig.5). In cells expressing the CSF1R/IR, CSF-1 was able to activate MAP kinases at least as well as phorbol esters (Fig. 5). The 12-amino acid juxtamembrane deletion (Δ960) blocked the ability of CSF-1 to stimulate the MAP kinases but had no effect on the action of phorbol esters (Fig. 5). PI 3′ kinase has been shown to play a role in inhibiting apoptosis in some cells (3Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 37Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The contribution of PI 3′ kinase activity to anti-apoptotic signaling of the insulin receptor kinase in CHO cells was tested with the PI 3′ kinase inhibitor wortmannin. CHO cells expressing the human insulin receptor were treated with 5 nm staurosporine with or without 1 μm wortmannin and 100 nm insulin for 18 h. Wortmannin alone had no effect on the extent of apoptosis in staurosporine-treated cells (Fig. 6). Insulin significantly reduced the number of pyknotic nuclei detectable upon staurosporine treatment (Fig. 6). However, the addition of wortmannin significantly reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of insulin (Fig. 6). PI 3′ kinase can be activated through association with phosphorylated IRS-1 and to a lesser extent with the phosphorylated carboxyl terminus of the insulin receptor (38Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G.

Analysis of different tissues of the transgenic mouse lines having the 2.7-kilobase (kb) promoter construct revealed a pattern of reporter gene expression in embryonic and adult tissues that paralleled that of endogenous HGF gene expression. A similar expression pattern was observed in the 0.7-kb transgenic lines. However, in contrast to in vitro data, no promoter activity was detected in four independent transgenic lines harboring the 0.1-kb construct. Akin to the activity of the endogenous HGF gene, which is induced in the liver, lung, and spleen in response to 70% partial hepatectomy, the reporter gene driven by the 2.7-kb promoter construct was strongly induced, whereas that driven by the 0.7-kb promoter construct was modestly induced in these organs after partial hepatectomy. Together, these data suggest that the region between −0.1 and −0.7 kb of the HGF gene promoter is essential to drive its expression in vivo and that additional upstream sequences located between −0.7 and −2.7 kb are also necessary for its maximum inducibility in response to cues that stimulate tissue growth and regeneration.

HGF gene expression is mainly confined to the mesenchymal/stromal cells of a variety of tissues under normal and pathophysiological conditions (15Noji S. Tashiro K. Koyama E. Nohno T. Ohyama K.

Unveiling the molecular mechanisms that govern HGF and HGF receptor expression is crucial to understanding the biology and pathobiology of each of these processes. In an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the complex regulation of HGF gene expression, we have previously reported the cloning and partial characterization of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse HGF gene (33Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection studies using in vitro models have identified several regulatory elements that may be involved in the cell type-specific and inducible expression of the HGF gene (29Liu Y.

Promoter analysis using in vitrotransfection assays, however, suffers from many shortcomings and is limited to few cell types and experiments. Thus, to expand our in vitro findings as well as to further characterize other mechanisms involved in regulation of HGF expression in vivo, we developed transgenic mice harboring chimeric genes containing various lengths of the mouse HGF promoter region fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Our data show that the upstream regulatory regions of the HGF promoter are essential for efficient promoter activity and contain the necessary DNA elements to dictate expression in embryonic and adult tissues and to confer inducibility in response to cues such as tissue loss, which triggers cell growth and regeneration. These transgenic mice provide a good model system for studying the transcriptional regulation of HGF gene expression in normal development and in pathological conditions such as cancer in which HGF gene expression is unregulated. The cloning of the mouse HGF promoter region into pCAT basic vector designated 2.7HGF-CAT (-2674 to +29 bp), 0.7HGF-CAT (−699 to +29 bp), and 0.1HGF-CAT (−70 to +29 bp) has been described in our previous study (33Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transgene constructs used for microinjection were derived from these plasmids by digesting them with HindIII and HpaI to release the corresponding fragment, which consisted of the HGF promoter sequences, the CAT gene, and the late SV40 poly(A) site as depicted in Fig. 1. These linearized DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by glassmilk (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). Transgenic mice were generated according to established methods (39Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 174-175Google Scholar) by the transgenic mouse facility at our institution using the mouse strain B6D2 (C57B6 × DBA2). Potential founders were screened for transgene integration by PCR analysis of blood DNA using CAT-specific primers. Whole blood (50 μl) was obtained from 3-week-old mice by retro-orbital bleeding, and the DNA was prepared according to Innis et al. (40Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 146-152Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers designed from the CAT gene sequence (sense, 5′-CACCGTTGATATATCCCAATGGCAT-3′; and antisense, 5′-GCCACTCATCGCAGTAACTGTTGTAA-3′) were used to generate a 620-bp PCR product from the transgene. PCR was carried out using TaqDNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 μg of blood DNA, and 15 pmol of primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Southern blot hybridization of tail DNA was also performed to confirm the PCR results. Tails were clipped at postnatal day 21, and the genomic DNA was extracted according to Hogan et al.(39Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 174-175Google Scholar). Tail DNA (20 μg) was digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease, fractionated on 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (NEN Life Science Products), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled 0.6-kb CAT DNA fragment. Hybridization conditions have been described (41Liu Y. Bell A.W. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 144: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine the expression of the HGF promoter-CAT reporter constructs in various tissues, CAT activity was analyzed as follows. Tissues were dissected and homogenized in 0.25m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) using a Dounce homogenizer. For cell suspensions, cells were pelleted, and their membranes were disrupted using three freeze-thaw cycles. The homogenates were incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). CAT activity was determined by incubating 20–100 μg of total protein with [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as a substrate for 24 h as described (42Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19622-19630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acetylated products were separated by thin-layer chromatography (Eastman Kodak Co.) and visualized by autoradiography. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographs was performed using the BioImage analytical scanning densitometer (Millipore/BioImage, Bedford, MA) in conjunction with the Whole Band Analysis software package. CAT activity (percent conversion of CAT substrate to acetylated products) was normalized by comparison with protein concentration. Various tissues were dissected from both wild-type and HGF-CAT transgenic mice anesthetized with methoxyflurane (Pittman-Moore, Mundelein, IL). Total RNA was then isolated using RNAzol B solution (Cinna/Biotecx, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. Northern blots were prepared by separating 20 μg of total RNA on formaldehyde-containing 1.0% agarose gels and transferring them to GeneScreen Plus membranes. Blots were hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes for mouse HGF, CAT, or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as described (29Liu Y. Lin L. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR analysis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) and amplified with Taq DNA polymerase following the manufacturer's instructions using primers specific to mouse HGF (sense, 5′-ATCAGACACCACACCGGCACAAAT-3′; and antisense, 5′-GAAATAGGGCAATAATCCCAAGGAA-3′) (43Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), CAT (described above), or β-actin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). β-Actin served as an RNA integrity and normalization control. The DNA amplification reaction was also carried out without reverse transcriptase to ensure that the amplified bands were not due to contamination by genomic DNA in the RNA preparations. Hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells from HGF-CAT transgenic mice and wild-type mice were isolated by in situ perfusion of the liver with collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (44Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3314-3320PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocyte and non-parenchymal liver cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation and either disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles for CAT assay or extracted with RNAzol B for RNA analysis as described above. Spleens were excised and teased apart in ice-cold minimal essential medium containing nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). This suspension was then loaded onto a Ficoll-Paque gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and centrifuged to separate the cells into a monocyte/lymphocyte-enriched fraction and a polymorphonuclear cell-enriched fraction. Each fraction was washed in minimal essential medium and assayed for CAT activity as described above. Peritoneal cell exudates were isolated by lavage using a 10-ml syringe attached to an 18-gauge needle and cold phosphate-buffered saline from control mice and mice subjected to abdominal incision and closing, such as that required for hepatectomy. The cells were pelleted, washed by centrifugation, and used to prepare cell extracts/RNA or cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to obtain adherent and nonadherent cell populations. Fibroblast cell cultures were established by the explantation method from the skin of 2.7HGF-CAT transgenic mice. Fibroblast cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cell cultures were passaged by trypsinization and subjected to study at passage 3 or 4. A DNA fragment corresponding to −538 to −274 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse HGF gene was isolated from the mouse chimeric plasmid 0.7HGF-CAT. Following restriction digestion of mouse 0.7HGF-CAT with SacI and SmaI, the 264-bp fragment was purified and labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The labeled probe was then gel-purified and used in gel mobility shift assays as described previously (36Jiang J.-G. Bell A. Liu Y. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3928-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as the nonspecific competitor in 10 μl of reaction mixture. The binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 20 min before loading onto 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). Nuclear protein extracts from liver tissue and HL-60 cells were prepared as described (34Liu Y. Beedle A.B. Lin L. Bell A.W. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7046-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The concentration of nuclear extract used in each reaction was 4 μg, and that of the labeled probe was between 0.2 and 0.4 ng. The same nuclear extracts were subjected to gel shift assays using a radiolabeled Sp1 site as a probe to control for integrity of the nuclear protein extracts described previously (37Jiang J.-G. Chen Q. Bell A. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA fragment was included in the reaction mixture. Gels were run in 0.5× 0.045 m Tris borate and 0.001 m EDTA at a constant voltage of 190 V, dried, and autoradiographed with intensifying screens. Lung and liver tissues were dissected from control and 70% partially hepatectomized mice; rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; and homogenized in 2 ml of 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm CaCl2, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, and 15 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Aliquots of 400 μl were then treated with DNase I (0–30 units; Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA and SDS to final concentrations of 12.5 mm and 0.5%, respectively. DNA was isolated by phenol extraction following a 30-min RNase A digestion. DNA was then digested with HindIII/EcoRI, run on 1.5% agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes, hybridized with a DNA fragment that corresponded to the 5′-flanking region of the mouse HGF promoter, and autoradiographed. We generated transgenic mouse lines that harbor various lengths of the mouse HGF promoter region (5′-deletions) fused to the CAT reporter gene. The constructs designated 2.7HGF-CAT (−2674 to +29 bp), 0.7HGF-CAT (−699 to +29 bp), and 0.1HGF-CAT (−70 to +29 bp) (Fig. 1) were used since our previous in vitro transient transfection studies using these constructs revealed that they are transcriptionally active and may contain important regulatory elements (33Liu Y. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4152-4160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Liu Y. Beedle A.B. Lin L. Bell A.W. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3928-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transgenic offspring were screened for germ line integration of the transgene by both PCR amplification of peripheral blood cell DNA and Southern blot hybridization of tail DNA (data not shown). Four lines with germ line integration of the 2.7HGF-CAT transgene construct were propagated. Of these, two lines contained ∼10 copies of the transgene, whereas the other two had five copies. Three transgenic founders harboring the 0.7HGF-CAT construct were also established. Estimates of transgene copy numbers indicated that all founders possessing the 0.7HGF-CAT construct contained approximately five copies; however, one founder did not yield germ line transmission. Germ line transmission of the 0.1HGF-CAT construct was propagated in four transgenic lines, two of which had approximately five copies and two of which harbored 10–15 copies of the transgene (data not shown). To determine whether the HGF promoter fragments described above were transcriptionally active in mice, extracts from various tissues of HGF-CAT transgenic animals (8–10 weeks of age) were isolated and assayed for reporter gene expression by CAT assay to determine CAT activity and by Northern blot analysis to determine CAT mRNA levels. Tissues from nontransgenic mice were also harvested and analyzed for expression of the endogenous HGF gene by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. In the 2.7HGF-CAT mice, we observed a widespread tissue distribution of the reporter gene expression, which mimicked that of the endogenous HGF gene, with nearly all tissues examined expressing a detectable level of CAT activity (Fig.2 and TableI). A similar expression pattern was observed with the 0.7HGF-CAT transgenic lines, although the expression in the 2.7HGF-CAT transgenic lines was much more robust than that observed with the 0.7HGF-CAT animals, particularly in the kidney, stomach, and intestine (Table I). Interestingly, the 0.1 HGF-CAT transgenic mice did not express the transgene in any tissues assayed from the four independent founder lines (Fig.3 and Table I). Akin to the expression of the endogenous HGF gene, the highest expression of the transgene was reproducibly noted in the lung, skin, and spleen, especially in the 2.7HGF-CAT mice (Figs. 2 and 3 and Table I). To substantiate these findings, we analyzed the expression pattern of the endogenous mouse HGF gene in wild-type littermates by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis (Table I). Tissues from nontransgenic littermates were also screened for CAT activity, and none was detected in any of their extracts, as expected (Fig. 3).Table ISummary of endogenous HGF gene expression in wild-type mouse tissues and HGF promoter activity in HGF-CAT transgenic mouse tissuesLungSkinSpl1-aSpl, spleen; Thy, thymus; Utr, uterus; Ovr, ovary; Tes, testis; Mus, muscle; Kid, kidney; Stm, stomach; Int, intestine; Pan, pancreas; Liv, liver; Hrt, heart; Bra, brain.ThyUtrOvrTesMusKidStmIntPanLivHrtBraHGF mRNA1-bThe expression of HGF mRNA in normal wild-type mouse tissues were determined by RT-PCR and/or Northern blot analysis.++++++++++++++++++2.7HGF-CAT1-cTransgene expression was determined by CAT assays and confirmed by RT-PCR and/or Northern blot analysis.(4)1-dThe numbers in parentheses indicate the number of independent transgenic lines for each construct.

Shown are the results from a representative CAT assay demonstrating the expression pattern of CAT transgene levels in three separate HGF-CAT transgene constructs (i.e. 2.7, 0.7, and 0.1 kb). Protein extract (50 μg) from various tissues of 0.1HGF-CAT, 0.7HGF-CAT, and 2.7HGF-CAT transgenic mice and nontransgenic (NTG) mice was analyzed for CAT expression (see Table I). Representative results of CAT assays are shown for skin, spleen, and lung since these tissues reproducibly exhibited the highest CAT expression as compared with the other tissues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is well known that HGF gene expression is mainly confined to mesenchymally derived cells of various tissues. For example, in the liver, the HGF gene is expressed in non-parenchymal cells such as Ito cells, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells, but not in parenchymal hepatocytes. To define the cellular localization of transgene expression, specific cell types were isolated from HGF-CAT transgenic mice and assayed for CAT expression. Similar to endogenous HGF gene transcription, transgene expression (2.7HGF-CAT and 0.7HGF-CAT constructs) was directed to the non-parenchymal liver cell fraction, but not to the hepatocyte fraction of the liver (Table II).Table IISummary of endogenous HGF gene expression and HGF promoter activity in specific cell types isolated from wild-type and HGF-CAT transgenic miceMNC2-aMNC and PMN, monocytes/lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells, respectively, isolated by Ficoll density gradient from spleen; HEP and NPC, hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells, respectively, isolated from collagenase-perfused livers; PEL,"
https://openalex.org/W2008633653,"We have previously developed a mouse model of insulin-resistant diabetes by targeted inactivation of the insulin receptor gene. During studies of gene expression in livers of insulin receptor-deficient mice, we identified a novel cDNA, which we have termed sirm (Son of InsulinReceptor Mutant mice). sirm is largely, albeit not exclusively, expressed in insulin-responsive tissues. Insulin is a potent modulator of sirm expression, and sirm mRNA levels correlate with tissue sensitivity to insulin. The product of the sirm gene is a serine/threonine-rich protein with several proline-rich motifs and an NPNY motif, conforming to the consensus sequence recognized by the phosphotyrosine binding domains of insulin receptor substrate and Shc proteins. However, Sirm bears no extended homologies with other known proteins. Based on the sequences of the proline-rich domains, we sought to determine whether Sirm binds to the SH3 domains of FYN and Grb-2. We demonstrate here that Sirm binds to FYN and Grb-2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that insulin treatment results in the dissociation of the Sirm·FYN and Sirm·Grb-2 complexes. We also show that Sirm is a substrate for the kinase activity of FYN in vitro. Based on the patterns of expression of sirm, its regulation by insulin, and the interactions with molecules in the insulin signaling pathway, we surmise that Sirm plays a role in modulating tissue sensitivity to insulin.

We have previously developed a mouse model of insulin-resistant diabetes by genetic ablation of insulin receptors. Lack of insulin receptors is rapidly lethal, leading to death from diabetic ketoacidosis within few days of birth (1Joshi R.L. Lamothe B. Cordonnier N. Mesbah K. Monthioux E. Jami J. Bucchini D.

We have reported that insulin treatment of liver extracts derived from insulin receptor-deficient (ir −/−) 1The abbreviations used are: ir, insulin receptor; Grb-2, growth factor receptor binding protein-2; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SH3, src homology 3 domain; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor type 1; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; EST, expressed sequence tags; nt, nucleotide(s). mice resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein migrating as a 75-kDa species on SDS-PAGE. This protein was not detected in control (ir +/+ mice) liver extracts. In the course of experiments designed to determine the identity of this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, we isolated a novel cDNA. We termed the protein product of this cDNA sirm(Son of Insulin ReceptorMutant mice). sirm mRNA is most abundant in insulin-sensitive tissues, such as skeletal muscle, heart, fat, kidney, and liver, and is regulated by insulin both in vivo and in cultured cells. In fact, sirm mRNA expression correlates with insulin sensitivity so that it is increased under conditions of increased insulin sensitivity, for example during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells and in diabetic ketoacidosis, and is decreased under conditions of desensitization to insulin, for example following prolonged exposure of cells to insulin. We have cloned a 3661-base pair sirm cDNA. The amino acid sequence predicted from sirm cDNA clones encodes a 600-amino acid polypeptide, bearing no extended homology to other known proteins. The Sirm protein is rich in serine and threonine residues and contains potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation and for phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases, as well as proline-rich motifs. Immunoreactive Sirm localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm in skeletal muscle, whereas it is found partly associated with the membrane compartment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We show, using co-immunoprecipitation studies and GST binding assays, that Sirm binds to the SH3 domains of FYN and Grb-2 in vitro and in cultures of 3T3-L1 cells. Insulin treatment results in the dissociation of the Sirm·Grb-2 and Sirm·FYN complexes. Sirm also appears to be a substrate for phosphorylation by the FYN kinase. The engagement of Sirm in complex formation with adapter proteins and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, together with the distribution of Sirm to insulin-dependent tissues, and the regulation of sirm mRNA by insulin both in vivo and in vitro represent circumstantial evidence for the fact that Sirm plays a role in modulating tissue sensitivity to insulin. Husbandry and genotyping of mice bearing a targeted ir allele have been described in previous publications (2Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Salvatore P. Asico L.D. Jose P.A.

Anti-insulin receptor antibodies were purchased from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FYN and anti-Grb-2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-Sirm antisera were raised by immunizing rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides corresponding to amino acids 136–149 of the Sirm sequence. All antisera were affinity purified using peptide columns. For immunoprecipitation, antibodies were used at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers. The immune complexes were captured on protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) and washed three times in 1.0 ml of 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters for Western analysis. Blots were pre-blocked in 3% BSA in PBS and incubated with the anti-Sirm antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution in 0.3% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Following a short wash in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.05% Triton X-100, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) was added at a 1:5000 dilution and incubated for 20 min. Three additional washes were performed in PBS/Tween/Triton, followed by detection of chemiluminescence using ECL (Amersham Corp.). Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers and hind limb skeletal muscles or from SV40-transformed hepatocytes using a guanidinium isothiocyanate/acid phenol extraction procedure. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described previously. PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 45 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. For Northern analysis, poly(A)+-enriched RNA was obtained by oligo-(dT) affinity chromatography. 2–3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were size-fractionated on denaturing 1% agarose, 2.2 mformaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were probed with random-primed sirm cDNA. Additionally, a mouse multiple tissue, an embryonic Northern blot, as well as a zoo blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were used to confirm the identity of the various clones isolated, to study the distribution of the sirm transcripts, and to analyze the presence of sirm gene homologues in other species. Hybridization was performed according to standard procedures. Initially, a random primed sirm fragment obtained by RT-PCR amplification of ir −/− liver RNA was used to probe 106 plaques of mouse embryo and mouse fetal heart cDNA libraries (CLONTECH). Hybridization and plaque purification of individual positive clones were carried out according to standard methods. However, only partial cDNA clones could be isolated from these libraries. To isolate full-length clones, mouse heart Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH) was amplified using primers derived from the 5′ and 3′ end of the available sequence. Amplification was carried out as suggested by the manufacturer, with a mixture of Klenow and Taq polymerase. Amplified products were subcloned into a PCR II vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced using cycle sequencing with fluorescent dideoxy terminators (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on 373 and 377 Applied Biosystems sequencers. Each partial clone was hybridized with multiple tissue Northern blots as well as Northern blots of ir −/− mice to confirm that amplified sequences derived from the same original transcripts. Multiple subcloned fragments were analyzed to confirm the nucleotide sequence. Sequence alignment was carried out using the Autoassembler software (Applied Biosystems) to develop a consensus sequence. Ambiguities were further resolved by visual inspection of electropherograms. An 1800-nt fragment of the mouse sirm cDNA was amplified from Marathon-ready mouse heart cDNA. The upstream primer 5′ GAA TTC TCC AGC TGG CACATG AAC AAC AGT3′ (nt 949–972) contained an additional EcoRI site in frame with the ATG initiation codon (bold face). The downstream primer spanned nt 2924–2901. The amplified product was digested with EcoRI to generate a 1590-nt fragment, which was subsequently subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The amplified fragment was entirely sequenced to rule out nucleotide substitutions during the amplification procedure. Bacterial cultures were obtained as indicated by the manufacturer, and the recombinant GST-Sirm fusion protein was isolated by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Whole E13.5 and 18.5 mouse embryos, or livers, hind limb muscles, hearts, epididymal fat pads, and kidneys derived from adult mice were finely minced and homogenized using a glass-glass pestle in 1 mm NaHCO3 containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim). 20 μg of whole tissue extracts were prepared for SDS-gel electrophoresis as described (2Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Salvatore P. Asico L.D. Jose P.A. Taylor S.I. Westphal H. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In some experiments, subcellular fractions were obtained from cultures of 3T3-L1 cells or from mouse skeletal muscle. After resuspending the cells or tissue in 1 mm NaHCO3 buffer as described above, nuclei were removed by a low speed centrifugation (1000 × g) for 10 min, followed by high speed centrifugation (20,000 ×g) to pellet the microsomal fraction and separate the cytosol. The crude microsomal homogenate was solubilized in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) 150 mm NaCl containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g to remove the insoluble material. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated as described (5Accili D. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4708-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cultures of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells or confluent SV40-transformed hepatocytes derived from ir −/− mice or from ir +/+ mice were grown in 100-mm Petri dishes as described. Following incubation overnight in 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (3T3-L1) or for 4 h in 1% insulin-free BSA (SV40-transformed hepatocytes), cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm insulin for various lengths of time at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were frozen in liquid N2 and thawed in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 50 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm sodium pyrophosphate). For RNA analysis studies, SV40-transformed hepatocytes were incubated with insulin (1 or 100 nm) for 4 h, frozen in liquid N2, and thawed for RNA extraction as outlined above. In vitro transcription/translation was performed using a coupled rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega, Madison WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GST fusion proteins used in these studies are as follows: mouse c-Abl type IV SH3 domain (amino acids 84–138) (6Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the mouse phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 SH3 domain (amino acids 1–80) (7Kapeller R. Prasad K.V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1927-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the human FYN SH3 domain (amino acids 84–148) (8Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Druker B. Panchamoorthy G. Shoelson S.E. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the full-length mouse Grb2 (Upstate Biotechnology). Confluent monolayers of SV40-transformed hepatocytes (in two 175-cm2 flasks) were solubilized in 5 ml of 1% Triton buffer. 5 μg of recombinant GST fusion protein in 0.05 ml were added to the extracts and allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Thereafter, the material was pelleted by centrifugation and washed in 10 ml of 0.1% Triton buffer four times. The final pellet was prepared for electrophoresis as described above. 2 units of purified FYN kinase (Upstate Biotechnology) were incubated with 1 unit of denatured rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma) in the presence of GST, or GST-Sirm, or with various concentrations of peptides corresponding to Sirm amino acid sequences 224–246 (peptide 1), 331–339 (peptide 2), and 29–40 (peptide 3). Thereafter, a phosphorylation buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. One of two experiments is shown. We had previously shown that insulin stimulation of liver extracts derived from ir −/− mice results in tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of apparent mass of ∼75 kDa that is not observed in ir +/+ mice (see Fig. 3B in Ref. 2Accili D. Drago J. Lee E.J. Johnson M.D. Cool M.H. Salvatore P. Asico L.D. Jose P.A. Taylor S.I. Westphal H. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We questioned whether this protein may share sequence similarity with the insulin receptor or its substrates. To this end, we carried out RT-PCR amplification from ir −/− and ir +/+ mice liver RNA using several sets of primers, the sequences of which were derived from mouse insulin and IGF-1 receptors, as well as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). A set of primers designed to amplify the extracellular domain of the IGF-1 receptor consistently gave rise to an additional band of slightly larger size than predicted (Fig.1 A). This band was unique to ir −/− liver RNA and was never observed in amplification experiments with ir +/+ mouse liver RNA (data not shown). The band was isolated, sequenced, and used as a hybridization probe to isolate clones containing the sirmcoding sequence. By using a combination of cDNA library screening and cDNA amplification techniques, we cloned a 3661-nt cDNA, with an open reading frame of 1800 nucleotides, predicted to encode a 600-amino acid polypeptide. The 5′ end of the cDNA was isolated from mouse heart Marathon cDNA (CLONTECH). Two different clones were isolated, possibly as the result of two different transcription start sites. The longest cDNA contains 962 nt of 5′-untranslated sequence; the shorter one contains 620 nt. Two non-canonical ATTAAA polyadenylation signals are found 24 and 160 nt downstream of a putative ochre termination codon. In vitrotranslation of a full-length sirm cDNA clone in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate yielded a peptide of 81 kDa (Fig.1 B).Figure 1A, alignment of mouse IGF-1 receptor and sirm sequences. This figure shows the partial homology between the primers used to screen for IGF-1 receptor-related sequences and the sirm sequence. There is 66 and 57% identity between the upstream and downstream IGF-1 receptor primers and the relevant sirm sequences. Of note is also the virtual identity (10 out of 11 matches) at the 3′ end of the upstream primer. B, schematic diagram of the Sirm protein and cloning strategy.

Tinley T.L. Tang X. Borodovsky M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and to the open reading frame K08E7.5 on chromosome IV of C. elegans (21% identity in a 598-amino acid overlap) (10Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Coulson A. Craxton M. Dear S. Du Z. Durbin R. Favello A. Fulton L. Gardner A. Green P. Hawkins T.

Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The KSP region of the unc-89 gene is serine- and threonine-rich and is thought to represent a potential target for phosphorylation by cell cycle-dependent kinases. We did not detect any homology to known mammalian proteins. However, analysis of the data base of expressed sequence tags revealed that sirm is virtually identical to two human ESTs. The first EST corresponds to a skeletal muscle cDNA (Z19503/HSB35G062); the second one to a beta cell library cDNA (T10445) (11Takeda J. Yano H. Eng S. Zeng Y. Bell G.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The longest sirm open reading frame is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 69,000 Da (Fig. 1 C). Hydropathy profile analysis indicates that Sirm lacks a hydrophobic sequence long enough to serve as a transmembrane domain. The sequence is enriched in serines and threonines (20% of all amino acids) and in basic residues (17% arginines, lysines, and histidines). There are five potential —SP— phosphorylation sites by proline-directed serine kinases at amino acid residues 76, 189, 231, 418, and 438. Three potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation are present at positions 37, 56, and 81. Tyr37 is of interest in that it conforms to an NPXpY motif found in receptor tyrosine kinases and is thought to serve as a binding site for the phosphotyrosine binding domains of IRS and Shc molecules upon phosphorylation (12White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another interesting feature of Sirm is the presence of four proline-rich motifs, conforming to the SH3 binding consensus PXXP (13Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). Of these, sequences NPLPTTPKR (amino acids 328–336) and PLPLLPSK (amino acids 240 to 233, in reverse orientation) share homology with the Src and Grb2 SH3 consensus binding site RPLPPLP (14Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B). The sequence between amino acids 224 and 246 conforms to a consensus PΨXXSPLLPXPXP sequence, where Ψ indicates a hydrophobic amino acid, found in the following four known SH3 domain-binding proteins: CR16, a protein encoded by a brain-specific mRNA regulated by glucocorticoids (15Masters J.N. Cotman S.L. Osterburg H.H. Nichols N.R. Finch C.E. Neuroendocrinology. 1996; 63: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); SH3 BP2, a protein that binds to the Src, Nck, Grb-2, and Abl SH3 domains (16Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar); the Ras-GAP SH3 binding protein (17Parker F. Maurier F. Delumeau I. Duchesne M. Faucher D. Debussche L. Dugue A. Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); and Abi-2, a protein cloned based on its ability to bind with high affinity to the SH3 domain of Abl (18Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the proline-rich domains of SH3 BP-2 and Abi-2 that are homologous to Sirm are not the same as those implicated in Abl binding (16Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 18Dai Z. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2569-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). sirm was originally detected in RNA derived from ir −/− mice. Next, we asked whether failure to detect sirm in the same assay in ir +/+ mice could be due to overexpression of sirm in ir −/− mice compared with normal littermates. Northern blotting analysis was performed on pooled RNAs derived from skeletal muscle and liver of three to five ir +/+, ir +/−, and ir −/− mice (Fig.3). In liver of ir −/− mice, sirm mRNA levels were 3-fold higher than in ir +/+ mice (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6) after correcting for the amount of actin mRNA (lower panel), whereas in skeletal muscle they were 40% higher (lanes 1 and 3). Intermediate variations were observed in ir +/−mice (lanes 2 and 4). To determine further whether expression of sirm is under regulation by insulin, we studied the effect of insulin on sirm expression in SV40-transformed hepatocytes derived from ir −/− and ir +/+ mice. Cells derived from ir −/− mice are devoid of insulin receptors but possess about 50,000 IGF-1 receptors/cell. 2K. Rother, Y. Imai, and D. Accili, manuscript in preparation. After treatment with insulin (1 or 100 nm), RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting with a 32P-labeled sirm cDNA (Fig. 4). 4 h treatment of normal cells with 1 nm insulin led to a 50% decrease of sirm expression, and 100 nm insulin led to a 90% decrease (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3). In contrast, in ir −/− cells, 1 nm insulin decreased sirm mRNA levels by 20% and 100 nm insulin by 45% (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). Thus, expression of the sirm gene is decreased following prolonged exposure of cells to insulin. The ID50 for insulin inhibition of sirm expression is ∼1 nm in ir +/+ cells and ∼100 nm in ir −/− cells. This observation suggests that insulin regulates sirm expression in ir −/− cells by binding to IGF-1 receptors. In fact, insulin would be predicted to bind to IGF-1 receptors with about 100-fold lower affinity compared with insulin receptors. We performed a tissue survey of sirm gene expression (Fig. 5). During mouse embryonic development, sirm expression peaks in mid-late gestation (E11–15), to then decline prior to birth (left panel). In adult mouse, sirm is most abundant in skeletal muscle and heart (Fig. 5, middle panel). Additionally, sirm is expressed in kidney, brain, and lung. Although not clearly visible on this exposure of the blot, sirm mRNA can be detected in liver, as demonstrated in Figs. 3 and 4. Expression of sirm is associated with adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 5, right panel). Furthermore, sirm is identical to EST T10445, which was isolated from a pancreatic islet library (11Takeda J. Yano H. Eng S. Zeng Y. Bell G.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Takeda J. Espinosa R.R. Eng S. Le B.M. Bell G.I. Genomics. 1995; 29: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Thus, sirm is expressed in virtually all insulin-responsive tissues and, at lower levels, in other organs. Similar expression patterns were detected using Northern analysis of human RNAs (data not shown). A zoo blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized to a32P-labeled mouse sirm cDNA. Results indicate that homologues of the mouse sirm gene are present in human, rat, and yeast (data not shown). We raised a polyclonal antserum against the peptide sequence corresponding to amino acids 136–149 of Sirm. The antiserum detected an immunoreactive species of ∼90 kDa in several mouse tissues, which is specifically competed by the peptide used for affinity purification of the antiserum (Fig.6 A, compare left and middle panel). The same band is not present when preimmune serum is used for immunoblotting (Fig. 6 A, right panel). The tissue distribution of immunoreactive Sirm protein correlates well with patterns of mRNA expression. We next examined the subcellular localization of Sirm (Fig.6 B). Extracts of skeletal muscle and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were separated into cytosolic and membrane-enriched fractions. In skeletal muscle, immunoreactive Sirm was detected exclusively in the cytosolic fraction. In contrast, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a fraction of Sirm immunoreactivity corresponding to about 25% of the total was membrane-associated (Fig. 6 B). Short term (5 min) stimulation with 100 nm insulin did not affect the subcellular distribution of Sirm (Fig. 6 B, compare −insulin and +insulin lanes). We also compared the levels of Sirm immunoreactivity in livers and hearts of ir +/+ and ir −/− mice (Fig. 6 B, compare WT and −/− lanes), but we failed to detect the difference predicted on the basis of the Northern blot shown in Fig. 3. It is possible that the discrepancy between levels of mRNA and immunoreactivity is due to impaired recovery of immunoreactive Sirm protein in insulin receptor-deficient mice caused by their advanced metabolic derangement. The amino acid sequence of Sirm contains four proline-rich domains that could potentially serve as binding sites for SH3-containing proteins. Based on the homology between these domains and the known binding specificities of Grb-2 and FYN (Fig. 2 B), we investigated whether Sirm could bind to Grb-2 or FYN SH3-GST fusion proteins in vitro. Furthermore, in view of the consensus sequence among Sirm (amino acids 224–246) and several Abl-binding proteins, we also included the Abl SH3-GST protein in these experiments, as well as the p85α SH3-GST as a negative control. GST fusion proteins containing the SH3 domains of the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (7Kapeller R. Prasad K.V. Janssen O. Hou W. Schaffhausen B.S. Rudd C.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.
